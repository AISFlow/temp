42429506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzC7h,1533763234,The SEC Will Decide on 9 Bitcoin ETFs in the Next 2 Months,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to make final decisions on nine proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the next two months.  As first reported Tuesday by CoinDesk, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a decision on a proposed rule change from the Cboe BZX Exchange that, if approved, would allow for the listing of an ETF backed by blockchain startup SolidX and investment firm VanEck.  Yet the SolidX-VanEck proposal – first put forward in June – is just one of four filings in waiting.  Combined with past submissions from firms ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares, a total of 10 bitcoin-related funds are being weighed by SEC officials, according to public records, although the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF is the only ""physical"" ETF among all the proposals.  Those deadlines are set by the time at which the proposals are published in the U.S. Federal Register, with an initial decision due 45 days after that time. The agency can then punt those decisions to as many as 240 days following publication in the Register.  The deadline for a decision on two funds from ProShares is August 23, is just over two weeks away. The rule change paving the way for those products was submitted by NYSE Arca on December 4, 2017.  September will see a series of deadlines for bitcoin ETFs, starting on September 15, the date by which two funds by GraniteShares will receive a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. The funds were initially proposed on January 5.  The deadline for Direxion's four funds is September 21, as indicated by public records, after being first submitted on January 4.  As CoinDesk reported, the SEC punted its decision on the SolidX-VanEck proposal to September 30. However, given the way in which the agency considers such proposals, additional time may be carved out, pushing a final decision deadline to as far as late February of next year.  To be sure, the agency could release its decisions ahead of its prescribed deadline (as the SEC did this week). But past examples indicate that the SEC will wait until closer to the deadlines, all but ensuring additional nail-biting by the crypto community.

42429514,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCNh,1533758628,$30 Billion Lost: 4 Stats That Show a Crypto Market in Decline,"The crypto markets are seeing red in a big way Wednesday as an ongoing rout is wiping away billions of dollars in value.  As reported by CoinDesk, the collective market capitalization for all crypto assets hit a new low for the year earlier today – as it stands, the overall market cap is roughly $225 billion, representing a significant decline from the more than $800 billion witnessed in early January of this year.  Among the developments driving the market turmoil: the fact that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to punt a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  As always, the devil is in the details – and these four statistics show a market in turmoil  1. Market cap decline  According to figures compiled by CoinDesk, as much as $51 billion in market cap was lost during the past seven days. CoinMarketCap figures indicate that as much as $30 billion or more in value was shed amid the day's market action.  This amount indicates a more than 18 percent decline within that time frame.  But the market capitalization data only tells part of the story.  Perhaps most tellingly, all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies (indicated on sites like CoinMarketCap as well as OnChainFX), showed significant declines in the past 24 hours, accounting for an average loss of more than 14 percent during that period.  For bitcoin specifically, the past days haven't been exactly forgiving either.  3. Days of pain  The cryptocurrency has seen losses for ten out of the last eleven days – a series of events that have not occurred since September 2014.  That extended period of price declines is fully on display in the graph below, pulled from Bitfinex, which shows the market sliding downward after climbing above $8,000 last month.  But the 11-day datapoint has another message: the recent bull run has basically evaporated, CoinDesk analysis shows.  Today's low represents a depreciation of 26.28 percent endured over the bearish stint. As a result, over 80 percent of the recent rally from bitcoin's annual low has evaporated.  In sum, bitcoin's price rallied $2,705 from June 24th to July 24th, over $2,000 of which has since disappeared, according to data from Bitfinex.

Million in New Funding,"Decentralized music-sharing protocol Audius has raised $5.5 million in a Series A funding round led by General Catalyst and Lightspeed Capital the firm announced Wednesday.  The project seeks to use a blockchain platform to help artists control the music they share, according to a press release.  While a release date is not yet clear, the musician-owned platform would allow artists to publish their work and interact with fans, rather as platforms like SoundCloud operate today. However, Audius would provide artists with a greater degree of control over their intellectual property than existing systems do today, the release claims.  The startup boasts advisers including BitTorrent chief architect Greg Hazel, Augur co-founder Jeremy Gardner and musician 3LAU, among others.  3LAU, who is notably headlining what's been dubbed a blockchain music festival later this year, said in a statement that it is important for artists to be a part of running their content distributors.  He said:  ""Artists need decentralized models for music sharing, and a stake in the platforms they contribute content to. Blockchain allows Audius to do this with tokens and decentralized voting-based governance so artists have a say in how the platform evolves.

The company said Wednesday that it acquired the Texas-based Bitfract after it made the tool – allowing for the exchange of bitcoin for ""dozens of digital assets in a single transaction"" using the company's API. The idea is that the tool makes it easier for crypto-buyers to switch up their portfolio without having to execute numerous transactions.  ""This demonstrated a great alignment of strategy and thinking, and their execution was so exceptional that we wanted to bring their talented team and technology on board,"" CEO Erik Voorhees said in a statement.  The tool works by letting investors choose what percentage of their holdings should be in a particular asset, add the destination wallet addresses and send bitcoin in a single mass transaction.  ShapeShift intends to continue operating Bitfract's tool in its present form ""as a demonstration of the power of ShapeShift's open API."" However, the exchange will also integrate the platform's mechanism into its own platform, creating a native ""multiple output transactions"" function.  ""We believe in a decentralized future where individuals freely control their digital wealth, and our team is honored to work alongside Erik and everyone at ShapeShift to make this a reality,"" Bitfract co-founder and CEO Willy Ogorzaly said of the acquisition.  The move comes just less than a year after ShapeShift announced the acquisition of KeepKey, a bitcoin hardware wallet startup. ShapeShift raised a $10.4 million Series A funding round in March 2017.

The developments come after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The news triggered a market reaction, ultimately sending the total value of all cryptocurrencies down to $227.8 billion on Wednesday – the lowest level since November 2017 – according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The drop to nine-month lows marks a 10.7 percent depreciation on a 24-hour basis. As of press time, the market capitalization had risen back slightly to $228.6 billion.  Although the ETF decision is solely in regards to bitcoin, many alternative cryptocurrencies are printing worse losses than the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, signaling worsening risk sentiment in the market.  The rise in the bitcoin dominance rate – an indicator that tracks the percent of the total crypto market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency – to an eight-month high of 48.6 percent also suggests the investors are venturing out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency.  The falling spread or difference between the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and BTC's market capitalization is also signaling reduced demand for high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies.  At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin is just over $118 billion – an 8.5 month low – whereas the total market cap of bitcoin is topping $111 billion, a figure last seen less than a month ago and above its annual low of $99,915,112,929, according to CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, the BTC dominance rate is hovering around 48.9 percent and could rise to 50 percent if the risk aversion worsens, boosting demand for well-established cryptocurrencies like BTC.

As previously reported, the Tezos Foundation and DLS were facing four class action lawsuits following their ICO that raised $232 million in 2017 and was later accused of selling unregistered securities to investors in the U.S.  Based on the docket report of one case, dubbed ""In Re Tezos Securities Litigations,"" the class action lawsuits have now been consolidated into one with a lead plaintiff named Arman Anvari.  According to the judge's order, the Brietmans argued in the motion that the ICO was administrated by the Tezos Foundation which is based in Switzerland and, as such, the couple and DLS should not be held liable.  However, the judge said the involvement of DLS ""in establishing and aiding the Tezos Foundation rendered the two entities deeply intertwined, if not functionally interchangeable, throughout the ICO process.""  The defendants also argued as part of the motion for dismissal that the lawsuits were trying to use U.S. securities laws to govern an ICO for which ""critical aspects of the sale occurred outside of the United States.""  The judge responded in the order that the realities of the ICO transactions ""belie"" such a conclusion, arguing:  ""Anvari participated in the transaction from this country (the U.S). He did so by using an interactive website that was: (a) hosted on a server in Arizona and; (b) run primarily by Arthur Breitman in California. He presumably learned about the ICO and participated in response to marketing that almost exclusively targeted United States residents.""      Separately, the court granted the motion and dismissed cryptocurrency brokerage firm Bitcoin Suisse as a defendant, saying that ""in any event, Bitcoin Suisse does not appear to be a key player in this action.""

42429500,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzBvh,1533733237,Inside State Street Bank's Blockchain Deliberations,"There's no shortage of breathless hype about blockchain.  What's harder to find is a sober and nuanced discussion of the technology's merits and drawbacks for a particular use case. For such a perspective, it can help to talk to different people at the same company who have been studying the matter and reached divergent conclusions.  It's not a secret that State Street, the giant U.S. custody bank, is looking to streamline the complex business of securities lending using blockchain. A decades-old industry, securities finance today is a continual dance of manual reconciliation, involving a string of market participants and lending parameters, all of which has become even more complicated since the 2008 financial crash.  In theory, distributed ledger technology (DLT), with its shared view of the truth, removes the need for multiple processes and lots of intermediary players. But it was never going to be a simple transition – and that's one thing at least that executives from different parts of the bank can agree on.  In terms of how peer-to-peer securities lending could be deployed, people from the technology architecture and product teams are bullish about what they consider an inevitable change.  From the product development side, Nick Delikaris, head of global trading and algorithmic strategies, said that ""the whole industry"" is looking at a peer-to-peer version of securities lending, and blockchain based solutions are definitely on the cards.  He also acknowledged the scale of the challenge, telling CoinDesk,  ""It's not an on-off button, like you can wake tomorrow and be doing everything peer-to-peer.""  Delikaris said he expects to see a mix of products and services. ""Different counterparties will have different flavors, and to start with some of this tech may actually make things harder,"" he said.  ""I think that's what we are going through right this second. But at the end of the day, we will have a better industry set up.""  Meanwhile, the pragmatists in the front office, who perhaps take more of a legacy marketplace position, remain wary of such a transformation.  Doug Brown, head of alternative financing solutions at State Street, said he sees potential value in using blockchain to enable P2P lending of securities, but cautioned that most of the market isn't ready for it.  ""If you look at that marketplace and the people who borrow securities, there are very few institutions that have the technology or the operational infrastructure in place to do that themselves today,"" he said.  Brown added that ""there is a real question about whether it's worth their time to build that infrastructure, the cost to do it, the staffing to do it – or whether the model they are using today is efficient enough.""  Pros and cons  Taking a step back, ""peer-to-peer"" lending in this context means a client who wants to lend securities (typically a large mutual fund or pension plan) directly faces the borrower (normally a hedge fund), as opposed to having a broker-dealer in the middle managing the whole operation.  State Street has a panoramic view of the securities lending landscape; the bank has two components under its roof that most people don't have, explained Delikaris.  ""We have an arm called enhanced custody, which is basically akin to a prime broker,"" i.e. a provider of specialized services to hedge funds, he said.  ""We also have the biggest agent lender in the world,"" he added, referring to State Street's business of lending securities to institutions on behalf of its clients.  This means that testing out a blockchain idea – which State Street began doing in 2016 with a proof of concept (PoC) for digital tokens to post collateral – has evolved to a point where the bank is mapping out the entire securities financing ecosystem for potential transformation.  And this, in turn, has led to markedly different views inside the bank on the pros and cons.  From his front-office perspective, Brown conceded a P2P model might make it a little cheaper to borrow securities, while State Street's traditional lending clients might make a bit more on the transaction.  But he also reeled off a list of challenges, and in so doing told a familiar story about the real benefits intermediaries and brokers bring to a market.  Prime brokers, for example, manage all aspects of liquidity and are charged with finding substitute collateral when required to do so. In addition, going P2P without anyone in between means counterparties would need to do credit due diligence on each other.  Plus there would no longer be borrower default indemnification, which is pretty much expected across the industry, noted Brown. In other words, if the borrower in a P2P transaction fails to return the borrowed assets, the lender is out of luck, whereas in today's market an intermediary like State Street will cover the loss.  ""A P2P model, where everybody faces each other and negotiates contracts, where the protection is gone and both parties now need credit teams, would likely not be a broad industry solution,"" said Brown.  ""That model might work for a small subset of institutions. But if you only had a small number of institutions participating I think it might be challenging to convince people there was enough liquidity to really move that market in a large way,"" he said.  Delikaris took on board the very real concerns of his colleague, agreeing ""this can't simply be done in a lab"" but involves talking to clients to find out ""what keeps them up at night.""  However, he defended a P2P model which he said could be offered to lenders with an appetite for more risk, who might not care about the indemnity – adding that things could be priced differently because of that.  ""My own personal feeling is that if some things get transformed because of this technology I think what you'll see are other products and services that will come and piggyback off that to help where those issues arise,"" he said.  Evolution, not revolution  Meanwhile, other banks are forging ahead with securities lending using blockchain, but like State Street, they expect a long transition period.  Back in March this year, ING and Credit Suisse completed a live securities lending transaction using a collateral-lending blockchain application co-developed by HQLAx and R3.  Herve Francois, blockchain initiative lead at ING, said that for now his bank is ""leveraging the existing infrastructure of tri-party agents and custodians in order to go to production faster, as this constitutes a legal framework by itself.""  Francois acknowledged that market participants might be left with missing services if they moved to a P2P model, and in the event may need to outsource to the current intermediaries.  ""That could be a way for those actors to still play a role in the short- to medium-term,"" he said. ""It's a step in the blockchain evolution which in the long run should be able to disintermediate them.""  Guido Stroemer, CEO of HQLAx, which is focused on tokenizing baskets of securities to help bank treasurers manage and transfer liquidity better, agreed the legacy marketplace requires many operational stages to be carried out in a well-established manner  Going forward, Stroemer said some assets lend themselves to DLT better than others, with securities first, then cash, and maybe gold.  ""Successful use cases will only thrive in the real world when they have relatively low barriers to entry,"" said Stroemer, concluding:  ""Anything that requires a market user to go through a 'big bang' change has no chance of creating market wide adoption.""

The firm, which allows users to borrow cash against their cryptocurrency holdings, is now available in 35 states, including Washington D.C.  Also revealed today is a new tech platform for SALT clients, which the firm says includes updated tools for borrowing funds and faster transactions, as well as a new member loyalty program.  The firm's chief executive, Bill Sinclair, who took up his post last month, told CoinDesk that the process of expanding to new states is complicated, and that the company's legal team has been working with regulatory experts to ensure that the loans it provides fall within each state's individual laws.  ""SALT loans are and will be structured within the laws, regulations, and guidelines provided by each jurisdiction in which the loan is offered,"" he said.  As such, the platform is newly available to residents of Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Texas, Maryland, Michigan, Wisconsin and Maine, among others.  The company is currently moving its current users to the new platform, Sinclair said, adding that, for the rebuild, ""we started with some key community leaders and worked their feedback into the nuances of our technology.""  ""The first borrowers to get loans in the new system were those who previously applied in areas in which we were not approved to lend and were still interested in a SALT loan,"" he said.  To further attract new members and retain existing clients, the startup today also unveiled a new member loyalty program. Called Proof of Access, the scheme lets customers modify their loan conditions using the firm's own token (also called SALT), according to Sinclair  New clients become members by depositing at least one SALT token onto the company's platform, and can then stake their tokens to adjust their loan interest rates.  Sinclair said the firm plans to continue developing its platform, and in the future plans to introduce micro-loans and qualified custody products, alongside international expansion.  SALT will also be looking at adding new blockchain tokens to be used as collateral, he said, explaining:  ""As blockchain assets continue to grow in abundance and popularity, technology will need to pivot accordingly. ... Opening doors for our potential borrowers who may have selected different investments than bitcoin and ethereum will be a key differentiator for SALT in the future.""

42429512,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCJh,1533726007,Bitcoin Outlook Sours As Price Sheds 70% of Recent Rally,"Bitcoin's recent downtrend has deepened in the wake of a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay a ruling on a keenly awaited bitcoin ETF.  The leading cryptocurrency was expected to stage a minor corrective rally in the last 24 hours, having defended the key 50-day moving average (MA) support earlier this week.  However, the sellers made a strong comeback above $7,100 after the SEC exercised its right to postpone the decision on whether to approve a rule that would allow Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer shares of a bitcoin ETF issued by VanExk SolidX Bitcoin Trust.  As a result, BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday on a negative note at $6,719 and fell to $6,360 today – the lowest level since July 16. At press time, BTC is trading at $6,500 on Bitfinex.  The 7.9 percent sell-off witnessed in the last 24 hours reinforces the view that a major part of the rally seen in July was likely fueled by speculation that a Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the US SEC within weeks.  Further, the bear grip around bitcoin has strengthened in the last 24 hours as bitcoin's drop to three-week lows below $6,400 means the cryptocurrency has retraced more than 70 percent of July's rally to $8,507.  Still, as the SEC has merely delayed its decision until September, there is still a chance that the ETF could be approved next month.  Daily chart  BTC's break below the ascending trendline (drawn from the June 29 low and the July 12 low) has bolstered the already bearish technical setup.  For example, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are sloping south in favor of the bears, and BTC is trading well below the long-term MAs (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day) – all suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.  More importantly, perhaps, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding below 50.00 (in bearish territory), but has yet to hit oversold territory (below 30.00). Hence, there is scope for a further drop towards $6,000, albeit after a minor bout of consolidation as the short-duration technical charts (below) are reporting oversold conditions.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped below 30.00, signaling the sell-off is overdone. As a result, BTC could trade sideways within a falling channel over the next day or two.  View  BTC's drop to three-week lows below $6,400 has likely strengthened the bear grip and opened the doors to $6,000 (psychological support).  The cryptocurrency might consolidate around $6,500 in the next 24 hours, as suggested by the 4-hour chart, before resuming the sell-off.  Only a high-volume break above the falling channel seen in the 4-hour chart would shift risk in favor of a re-test of $7,200 (200-candle MA).

As opposed to traditional ICOs, which have sought to reward early buyers, Metronome's sale, completed Tuesday, was notable for seeking to sell its tokens at a progressively lower price each minute for up to seven days. Buyers let the auction run 6 days, 23 hours and 40 minutes, according to a post-mortem post by the team.  In total, the project sold 8 million MET tokens for 26,502.21 ETH – which the post valued at $12.1 million (approximately $10 million at time of writing) – from 1,443 different wallet addresses, making an average purchase of $3,623-worth of tokens each.  In its review of the sale, Metronome acknowledged that the timing proved to be a challenge for raising a large amount from the sale.  The team writes:  ""Metronome's Initial Supply Auction took place during one of the deepest dips of an already stubborn bear market for cryptocurrencies as a whole in 2018.""  This, they believe, dampened market appetite to use ETH to buy a new token, particularly if buyers' ETH were well below the price they had initially paid for them. Still, those involved emphasized that the technical process underlying the sale went smooth.  ""The functionality of Metronome on a technical level works as designed, its Initial Supply Auction operated as intended, and that all users still had the same access to the auction opportunities,"" the post reads.  As we previously reported, Metronome – created by Jeff Garzik's Bloq – is built for longevity, being a token that can easily move on and off multiple blockchains, allowing a choice of rule sets and governance models that, in theory, should facilitate smooth running.  Garzik told CoinDesk last October, ""It's sort of a best-of-all-worlds cryptocurrency,"" a ""boxcar"" that can ride on any compatible blockchain.

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) initiative on Tuesday, alongside 11 other member regulators from jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia and Abu Dhabi.  GFIN will primarily serve as a network of regulators to discuss policies regarding financial technologies, the statement indicates, as well as to develop a ""global sandbox"" that will offer firms ""an environment in which to trial cross-border solutions.""  While the paper offers few details on the plan, the FCA said the new alliance follows a consultation effort in February on the idea of an international sandbox.  Among the 50 responses it received at the time, the FCA said one key theme focused on how regulators around the world can work together to pilot cross-border payments based on DLT and how to regulate initial coin offerings, which often extend beyond borders.  Notably, several members of GFIN, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Abu Dhabi Global Market, are already working on cross-border payment corridors built with DLT.  Along with the announcement, the group jointly published a consultation paper seeking public feedback on the GFIN initiative by Oct. 14.  Just last month, the FCA also granted 11 blockchain crypto-related startups to the fourth cohort of its sandbox program – almost 40 percent of the 29 firms accepted – which can now trial their products in a regulated environment.

42429513,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCHh,1533715222,Where Have All the Augur Users Gone?,"The day Augur launched it breezed into the rankings of top ethereum dapps by daily active users – but the momentum didn't last long.  Released on July 10, Augur allows users to create and bet on prediction markets tied to real-world events, such as World Cup games, elections and – unfortunately – murders. Having waited three years for Augur to be developed and tested, users rushed to try it out, briefly pushing it past the most famous dapp, CryptoKitties, in terms of users. It's worth noting that dapp userbases are uniformly tiny, though, with Augur and CryptoKitties each boasting around 300 users on the day in question.  Over the following weeks, however, Augur has shed users and slipped in the rankings.  At the time of writing, it's had 66 users over the past 24 hours, putting it in an uninspiring 22nd place, according to data provider DappRadar.  The dwindling userbase has also raised some uncomfortable questions about the valuation of Augur's native REP tokens, which are used to create markets and challenge reported outcomes (bets are placed and paid out in ether).  ""I like Augur and what it represents,"" Edan Yago, founder and CEO of the bitcoin-focused software company Epiphyte, tweeted. ""BUT,"" he continued:  ""The protocol is valued at $308 million and has 64 daily users. That's $4.8 million per user.""  It's up for debate how useful that metric is (the valuation could reflect expectations of future user growth, or not be directly connected to users at all), but the Augur community plainly has user numbers on its mind. The project's Discord forum was mulling the topic at the time of writing, and the question of whether Augur has ""failed"" was broached at least once.  Joey Krug, the project's co-founder, put on a brave face, telling CoinDesk he's ""not super concerned"" about user numbers ""as long as markets are getting resolved correctly.""  He cited short-term factors that could have fed the decline, including the end of the World Cup (which dominated betting volumes early on) and the fact that user experience is still clunky.  ""I imagine lots of people tried it and decided they'd come back in six months to a year when it's more mature,"" Krug said.  The liquidity problem  However, Ryan Berckmans, co-founder of Predictions.Global, a site that displays Augur markets and data, thinks the issue goes deeper than UX or FIFA's schedule.  ""Pretty much no one is using Augur,"" he said bluntly, continuing: ""A big reason why is it's difficult to find markets with liquidity.""  To illustrate what he means, Berckmans compared markets to grocery stores. Customers go shopping at a grocery store because they expect to find shelves full of food. Grocery stores, in turn, stock their shelves with food because they expect shoppers to come buy it. If one or the other is missing, the store is no good to anyone.  It's the age-old ""chicken-and-egg problem,"" he said.  As a first step towards solving that problem, Predictions.Global has rolled out a new feature, which lets users sort through open Augur markets by liquidity.  ""Traders will be able to discover a short list of desirable markets to trade in,"" Berckmans told CoinDesk, which may encourage trading and boost liquidity.  According to the feature – which is based on a closed-sourced algorithm – 33 open Augur prediction markets currently have at least 10 ether in liquidity and four have at least 250 ether in liquidity (the exact liquidity figures for each market are not shown).  The most liquid market at the time of writing deals with the price of ether at the end of the year:  Whatever the current trends in user numbers, Augur has been live for less than a month, and Krug, for one, is willing to be patient.

42429508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCDh,1533708031,Blockchain Startup Havven to Launch Stablecoin on EOS This Year,"A blockchain startup that sets out to offer cross-blockchain payments has announced it is planning to bring its existing stablecoin – a cryptocurrency tied to a stable asset – to the EOS network.  Called Havven, the Australia-based project said in a release on Wednesday that it is expecting to issue its nUSD stablecoin on EOS by the end of this year. The U.S. dollar-pegged token first launched on the ethereum network in June.  The goal, the startup said, is not to switch the token's fundamental network from ethereum to EOS, but to issue nUSD on both networks separately – a mission it claims will ""offer cross-blockchain stablecoins.""  ""At this stage, cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, so it's not clear which blockchains will manage to scale,"" Havven's founder Kain Warwick said in the announcement, adding:  ""For this reason, it's important that projects providing blockchain infrastructure plan to provide cross-chain compatibility, so their success isn't bound to the success of whatever chain they've chosen.""  A stablecoin is typically designed to adjust its supply as the market shifts in order to maintain a price pegged to an asset such as a fiat currency, providing a lack of volatility makes it easier for businesses or users to adopt.  For instance, stablecoin startup MakerDAO is currently working with supply chain management firm Tradeshift to use its ethereum-based DAI token to help speed up payments for small businesses.  Havven's effort comes after EOS officially announced its long-awaited network launch in June. Block.One, the entity behind the EOS blockchain has also revealed a $1 billion investment fund to facilitate the growth of its ecosystem.

42429502,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzBxh,1533700845,Code as a Weapon: Amir Taaki Wants You to Join the Real Crypto Revolution,"There are many words that could be used to describe Amir Taaki – but today, ambitious is best.  The infamous bitcoin developer – known for co-creating Dark Wallet, Darkleaks and DarkMarket – took the stage during a hackathon he hosted in the wake of the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) in Barcelona last week, the same city where he plans to set up his academy of coders, hackers and philosophers dubbed Autonomous Polytechnics.  It's a bit of a shift, about 1,800 miles to the West from Taaki's earlier idea, which was to build the academy in Greece. But with a toolset focused on anonymity and autonomy, it might make more sense to build the project in the capital city of the autonomous Spanish community of Catalonia.  Spending no time mulling over the decision, Taaki took to sketching out his political vision on a dirty whiteboard.  In a series of diagrams, Taaki described the evolution of biological cells, the structure of societies and the impact that technology can have on such systems, sparking runaway trends to monopolization, or its opposite — atomization.  Tying the latter to the UNIX philosophy, a branch of coder theory that vouches for minimal and modular units of software, Taaki then exposed the upcoming product suite his academy will build.  Albeit loose mathematical sequences, the audience could tell the scripts comprised the details of an entire dark machinery, a kind of subterranean web 3.0. Distilling the wide-ranging talk, one attendee quipped, ""Plans to anonymize the world.""  And while Taaki insisted the details on the whiteboard not be published for fear they be co-opted – ""There's a lack of ideas in this space,"" he told CoinDesk – it's clear the tooling he's got in mind would be a revolution, which is exactly what he wants.  Having left bitcoin development to fight alongside a Kurdish militia in Rojava, an autonomous region in northern Syria, Taaki is hoping to spread that region's practices of democratic confederalism, a political theory that advocates for small, self-governing communities.  ""Every revolutionary movement needs to have a technological arm, and we are the technological arm of the democratic confederalist movement,"" Taaki told CoinDesk,  ""This is our objective as an organization, which is using technology for autonomous democracy and the collapse of the system of nation states around the world.""  Politics and tech  To make this happen, Taaki expects participants of the academy to undergo a strict training. Newcomers are subject to a three-month introduction period, one that repeats every six months to one year.  ""It's a vehicle for developing them as leaders, to develop their skills technically, socially and being able to effectively organize other human beings and coordinate together tightly,"" Taaki told CoinDesk.  While there's room for ideological diversity within the organization — for example, Taaki wants to set up multiple tiers of participation and a system of allied academies globally — core attendees will need to follow careful timetables, give up other engagements and dedicate themselves fully to the project.  ""Together we can elevate each other higher, we can learn from each other, we can dedicate ourselves to a sense of purpose and become stronger,"" Taaki said. ""And because we gain something from this, we are willing to forgo certain comforts of life, certain smaller freedoms for an even bigger freedom that we want to grasp.""  For himself, Taaki lives a rigid lifestyle: lifting weights, measuring his meals, avoiding weed and alcohol. And with the occasional snide remarks about ""lazy hacker culture,"" he doesn't hide his disdain for those who don't.  ""You can't party and have the revolution at the same time. They're mutually incompatible things,"" he told CoinDesk.  That's one of the outcomes he fears for bitcoin, and even the cryptocurrency community as a whole – that while it has attracted some of the best minds in technology, there's a risk that it will simply devolve into play.  ""There's a danger that bitcoin as this transformative tool to liberate humanity will just be turned into a nice subculture where we meet up with friends at conferences and a few geeky people play around, make investments, but it's nothing more, and the potential that exists, that truly exists inside of bitcoin, does not get realized,"" he said.  That's why instead he wants his followers to have a serious drive.  That drive is a mix of both the democratic confederalism of the Rojava movement and a distinct theory of technology theorized by American philosopher Lewis Mumford.  The basic premise of democratic confederalism is self-governance, but the theory also elevates environmentalism and feminism.  On the other side, Mumford suggests that there are two types of technological process, monotechnics and polytechnics. Whereas the former creates global, top-down, single-purpose technologies, polytechnics conceives technology for users across different socio-political contexts – and it's the latter that Taaki believes can bring about change.  ""We believe in building technology on a human scale, for humans to employ in many different contexts to solve problems that they face,"" Taaki told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The technology needs to be targeted for socio-political change, not just to find like the perfect mechanism to make people comfortable, for convenience, to make people happy.""  Exhausted ideas  Not only the fears of bitcoin becoming just another fun fad, but Taaki also believes what's missing from the first and largest cryptocurrency is this idea of polytechnics.  According to Taaki, bitcoin's failure came from the belief that the technology itself was sufficient to enact a global reorganization of power, and by simply inserting it into systems, human freedom would increase.  ""Everybody thought that bitcoin would come as this huge inevitability,"" he told CoinDesk. ""You saw this also, people talking about the honey badger, the honey badger can't be stopped, there's a sense of inevitability or linear historical trajectory.""  However, that vision failed, in part due to an inability for bitcoiners to propagate the political concepts inherent to the technology and adopt the tooling to constantly evolve with the landscape.  ""Technology is the means, or the instrument of power that we use for shaping the society, but we are fundamentally the drivers of that technology,"" Taaki asserted.  In this way, Taaki's central tenet maintains that without ideological purpose, technologies cannot survive.  ""The problems with bitcoin are in no way technical, they are deeply social and economic problems,"" he said, adding:  ""The ideas behind bitcoin have exhausted their potentiality to be able to advance that project forward.""  And this seems to stem, according to Taaki, from the prevalence of the ""engineering mindset.""  ""There is an elite inside bitcoin. They have a very particular way of seeing the world, and that viewpoint of the world, which sees things in a very technical way ... in some cases can be extremely limiting,"" Taaki said.  He gave the example of the lightning network, which while it solves a much needed technical problem — scalability — it cannot solve the wider societal issues surrounding the cryptocurrency's lack of adoption. At the same time, corporations and central banks are co-opting the technology, developing more usable products and overtaking the cryptocurrency community.  ""Unless there is a fundamental correction in the course of events that we're heading into now, that is what is going to happen,"" Taaki warned.  And that's a large part of the work he is trying to achieve with Autonomous Polytechnics.  Where's the money?  At the time of writing, Taaki and the earliest enlisted members of the revolution are squatting at the historic home of the Cooperativa Integral Catalana, a cooperative that spawned a cryptocurrency of its own, FairCoin.  But the plans for their very own academy are laid out.  It'll be located at the base of Carmel Hill, stretching across 8,600 square feet, containing a shared workspace, living quarters, a garden and if they have enough money, a basement that can host conferences, hackathons and other events.  Taaki has even designed a special flag for the academy, in the colors of the organization, green and black, with a blazing sun, as a symbol of technology, in the center.  And with that, there's no shortage of interest from potential participants in the program, many of which are currently living with Taaki and told CoinDesk they're excited to begin. But still, they wait.  ""It's been almost a year now, and we're still waiting to get started,"" Taaki told CoinDesk.  Part of this stems from the construction of the building, which is slow going, but another thing stands in the way too — a lack of funding.  Taaki is looking for $10,000 to $20,000 – merely a drop in the bucket compared to the huge amounts of money being raised by sometimes suspicious initial coin offerings (ICOs) – however, many investors have been unwilling to donate without the promise of something in return.  But the academy's plans are to create free technology, and even its business arm would merely be a mechanism for funneling excess profits into the support of democratic confederalism around the world.  ""Right now to get established we're trying to get donations which is kind of difficult because despite rhetoric a lot of people in this crypto space are very stingy,"" Taaki said.  At the moment, the project is being sustained through donations from Cody Wilson, the co-creator of Dark Wallet and the infamous creator of the 3D printable Liberator pistol.  But Taaki would like to diversify those donation streams, and at this point, he's running out of options.  Laughing, Taaki concluded:  ""Dude, at this point, I would take money from African dictators.""

42429511,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzCLh,1533698006,"XRP, Litecoin Fall to Lowest Prices Yet Seen in 2018","The price of XRP, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to a new 2018 low on Wednesday.  Data from Bitfinex shows the cryptocurrency dropped to $0.35 - seven cents from the previous yearly low of $0.42 in July. Indeed the current price stands at its lowest level since December 12, 2017, days before XRP shot up to all-time-highs over $3 amid a bull run on the crypto market.  All told, XRP is now down 89.2 percent over an eight-month period.  Driving the trend is likely not only the wider bear market, but bad press for Ripple, the startup most often associated with XRP, and which continues to be bombarded by bad press and investor lawsuits stemming from the coin's price decline.  XRP Daily Chart  At press time, the price of XRP continues its downward trajectory - down 11.76 percent over a 24-hour basis according to CoinMarketCap data and down 1 percent on the hour.  As a matter of fact, other major names are also flashing red. For example, bitcoin is down 4.86 percent over a 24-hour period after it dropped from its $7,000 support zone on Tuesday.  Litecoin Daily Chart  Litecoin has also dropped to its lowest point this year, declining 8.78 percent from its previous yearly low at $72.65, making it one of the biggest losers on the day.  Other names such as ethereum and eos are down 6.89 percent and 7.96 percent respectively and are showing no signs of a short-term bullish revival.  Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped below $250 billion - an amount traders kept an eye on in hopes of remaining bullish.
