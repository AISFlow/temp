42382421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rbDf,1564231224,Crypto Exchanges Are Benefiting from Algorithmic Trading: Here's How,"Matthew Trudeau is chief strategy officer at crypto asset exchange ErisX. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.      Recently CoinDesk published an article titled, ‘High Frequency Trading is Newest Battle Ground in Crypto Exchange Race’ that discusses trading venues offering direct connectivity to their matching engines.  While ErisX has only recently launched its spot market, other crypto exchanges announced their intention to and/or began to enable trading firms to cross-connect (a direct network connection within the data center as opposed to a connection routed over the internet) to their matching engines at least a year ago, so this is not a new development.  Cross-connects are a standard service in global capital markets, utilized across asset classes and market participant types, so the characterization of such connectivity options as “rolling out the red carpet for high frequency traders” is peculiar. Based on the article, none of the exchanges that responded, including ErisX, actually directly offer colocation services (colocation is provided by the datacenter owners/operators).  One of our core views at ErisX is that precision in discussing any important topic is critical, be it institutional interest, custody, etc. so in this piece we are applying the same rigor when discussing “high frequency trading,” “colocation” and “data center-hosted” exchanges vs. “cloud-based” exchanges.  Because ErisX is one of the exchanges mentioned in the article as trying to attract large algorithmic traders with “colocation” offers, we want to more precisely define “algorithmic trading” and “HFT.”  We also want to explain why automated trading can be beneficial to the market and address the distinction, missing in the CoinDesk article, between “cloud” versus “data center-hosted” exchanges and why exchanges hosted in data centers present superior performance and benefits to market participants.  Defining HFT  High frequency trading (HFT) has been a topic of debate in large part because of a lack of precision and/or understanding by commentators even in traditional markets. There are different kinds of “HFT” but for this post we will define it as automation of trading strategies enabled by computers to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second.  Leveraging algorithms, high frequency traders analyze market conditions to manage risk and execute orders based on predefined trading strategies. Blackrock, a global investment management company, did an excellent job of further distinguishing a taxonomy of HFT strategies along with their relative impact on market quality in a 2014 whitepaper US Equity Market Structure: An Investor Perspective.  We would add to the taxonomy in the graphic below a fifth category of fraudulent or manipulative strategies that are prohibited in other markets, are not limited to HFT, and have been shown to exist, although not exclusively, on many crypto exchanges as we discussed in a previous post.  In general, automated market making and arbitrage strategies create greater efficiency in the market as depicted in the above graphic by integrating information into prices more quickly and efficiently resulting in narrower bid/offer spreads, improved price discovery, and fewer and more-fleeting instances of price discrepancies across markets when an asset type, such as bitcoin, trades on multiple venues.  There is evidence that the cryptocurrency markets are experiencing these benefits on the more reputable exchanges as a result of increasing HFT participation.  In the past 2.5 years spreads have generally narrowed and become more stable, and price discrepancies across trading venues have become less dramatic and less frequent. The below graphic from a 2019 white paper Buying Bitcoin, published by the New York Digital Investment Group, demonstrates this effect from December 2016 through October 2018.  So, while there are a variety of trading strategies that can be automated and labeled “HFT,” some contribute to market quality while some detract from it.  It is important to note our definition of market quality includes deep liquidity and tight bid/offer spreads, supported by fair access, elimination or appropriate management of potential conflicts of interest, and technology that benefits participants.  Cloud vs Data Center Matching Engine  The CoinDesk article mistakenly states that ErisX has a “hardware matching engine.”  In fact, ErisX has located the hardware (servers etc.) upon which its matching engine software runs in a Tier 1 datacenter facility in New Jersey that services a high density of major financial firms including traditional exchanges, brokers and trading firms as well as communications firms, enabling all new and traditional participants to quickly and efficiently gain access to our markets.  Participants that already have a presence in this datacenter can connect to ErisX's matching engine via a cross-connect and our FIX API. Additionally, ErisX offers connectivity to its matching engine over the internet via Websocket API.  There is nothing extraordinary about this model. In fact, deploying an exchange in a data center gives exchange operators the greatest control of their entire infrastructure from network firewalls and switches to servers.  This control enables exchange infrastructure to be precision-calibrated to create the most reliable, consistent and performant (lowest absolute latency and variability in latency) experience, promoting fairness amongst market participants. Participants can, in turn, precision-tune their trading systems and automated trading strategies; market participants that host their trading infrastructure in a datacenter (vs. the cloud) benefit from the same level of control and precision tuning. This is a good thing.  In contrast, cloud-based exchanges have less control over their infrastructure managed by the cloud operator in a shared general-purpose environment, and as a result cannot yet achieve the same level of reliability and performance offered by data center hosted exchanges.  To illustrate, at the risk of getting into the technical weeds, a world-class data center-hosted exchange may offer round-trip latency in the sub-100 microseconds (millionths of a second) range with 99th percentile consistency and the capability to process millions of orders per second, all with 99.99 percent uptime.  Cloud-based exchanges, on the other hand, may offer latency in the tens or hundreds of milliseconds (a thousand times slower) with less reliability, consistency and throughput due to the vagaries of internet routing algorithms. Further, cloud-based exchanges may rotate the location of the system running their matching engine periodically from one cloud datacenter to another, introducing even greater latency and inconsistency.  Low and predictable latency enables market participants to better manage their risk and pricing algorithms to ensure their best possible quotes are posted to exchanges creating high quality liquidity. In contrast, long round-trip order/quote/trade times resulting from high, unpredictable latency do not allow participants to react as fast to rapidly evolving market conditions. To compensate, participants may quote wider markets and thinner liquidity.  The CoinDesk article implies that by hosting in the cloud, exchanges create a fairer access model and/or protect retail investors. In fact, wider spreads and thinner liquidity are a detriment to all investors. The article also overlooks the reality that clouds run in data centers, and latency-sensitive market participants can locate their automated trading systems within, or close to the cloud data centers with or without explicit approval from exchanges – essentially unsanctioned “colocation.”  These firms access cloud exchanges faster than other participants, just with less reliability and determinism than with a data center-hosted exchange.  Conclusion  Automated market making and arbitrage, both forms of “high frequency trading” strategies, contribute to higher quality liquidity and markets, and the performance offered by data center-hosted exchanges enables these strategies to better manage risk and react to fast-moving markets.  In conclusion, we believe that constructive automated strategies and data center-colocated exchanges provide fair and consistent market performance with benefits for all participants.

42382414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rb8d,1564214492,Binance Exchange's Charity Falling Short of Transparency Goals,"The Takeaway:  The charity arm of Binance was reportedly financed late last year by donations of at least $13 million. A company spokesperson said, ""the donated amount does not include the total committed funds.""  Less than half of the donations committed to the Binance Charity Foundation (BCF) are accounted for on BCF's website, which shows under $6 million worth of crypto.  BCF is partnering with the nonprofit AFRIpads for its Pink Care Token project but is still working to establish ties with actual recipients.  The nonprofit has a long way to go until it can reach its stated goal of being ""100 percent transparent.""      Binance’s new Pink Care Token is putting a high-tech twist on the term “period equity.”  Earlier this month the philanthropic arm of the Malta-based exchange, Binance Charity Foundation (BCF), launched a program to give African girls sanitary products to help them stay in school. Helen Hai, head of BCF, told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency donations are bundled into unique tokens, redeemable for menstrual products, then given to the parents and teachers of Ugandan students.  So far, the Pink Care Token website says donations to the campaign have reached roughly 20 bitcoin (nearly $199,000). Donors include Primitive Ventures co-founder Dovey Wan and Arrington XRP Capital founder Michael Arrington. BCF’s goal is to use blockchain technology to offer a transparent connection between donors and recipients. But discrepancies in the nonprofit’s online records raise questions about the way such campaigns are actually managed.  Binance founder Changpeng Zhao reportedly committed to donating $10 million worth of cryptocurrency to launch the nonprofit foundation in 2018, followed by a $3 million donation from Tron founder Justin Sun. In addition, Binance disclosed in October 2018 that token listing fees would now be donated to the charity. Although several $100,000 donations have since been attributed to projects listed on the exchange, only around 507 bitcoin (under $6 million depending on volatility) was actually deposited in the charity wallets.  When asked where the rest of the money is, a BCF spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “The Binance part ($10 million) is a commitment … other [donations] are set aside. But since we don’t have that many projects yet, they will come when needed.”  For example, the spokesperson identified Sun’s donation is part of the Pink Care Token campaign. When asked where that donation was on the public wallet listings, the spokeswoman told CoinDesk to refresh the page in a few minutes. That donation was added just before the interview began.  As such, the foundation may have a long way to go with regards to fulfilling the mission Zhao originally stated of “100 percent transparent” fund management. A BCF spokesperson told CoinDesk the announced donations are committed to projects as they arise.  On the other hand, Hai herself has a checkered past in Africa. She previously worked for Chinese shoe manufacturer Huajian Group, which later came under fire for alleged human rights abuses. Hai told CoinDesk she left the company in 2013 and doesn’t hold any shares or value related to that particular enterprise.  As for BCF, The Block reported the foundation uses 10 percent of funds for operational costs and has deployed over $1 million in capital so far. A BCF spokesperson said these operational costs relate to partner nonprofits, as all BCF operational costs are covered by Binance proper. Hai said the BCF plans to donate to 160 Ugandan schools with 100,000 students, half of which would be involved with the Pink Care Token campaign.  CoinDesk was not able to reach any of the local schools. We will update the article if we hear back.  ""There’s definitely room for improvement on our donation process,"" a BCF spokesperson wrote via email after the initial publication of this article. ""We’re working our best to constantly improve our operation while making sure all stakeholders are satisfied with the results. We welcome external supervision and constructive advice.""  AFRIpads partnership  BCF is partnering with the local nonprofit AFRIpads to provide the menstrual health products.  AFRIpad communications lead Sarah Sullivan told CoinDesk that beneficiaries will exchange their tokens for the AFRIpads Deluxe kits, containing an annual supply of products. AFRIpads will then redeem tokens for Ugandan shillings using the Binance Uganda exchange.  Contrary to Hai’s estimate, Sullivan said the plan is to start with 50,000 students and that the team on the ground is still in the process of reaching out to the first 50 schools. Sullivan described the token initiative as a “creative way to address the challenges posed by menstrual health in the school setting.”  Stepping back, the Pink Care Token campaign is meant to promote period equity, a term popularized by activist Jennifer Weiss-Wolf to encompass policies that allow people who menstruate to fully participate in society.  According to UNICEF, millions of girls around the world drop out of school when they start menstruating, although affordable sanitary resources could help them continue their education. A lack of access to such necessities in public spaces is often referred to as “period poverty,” a feminist phrase used as part of the marketing for BCF’s campaign.  Weiss-Wolf told CoinDesk AFRIpads is considered an exemplary Ugandan company focused on that issue, creating reusable sanitary pads for people in rural areas.  “AFRIpads received the bid because of its relatively low pricing, sustainability – their product is reusable and environmentally friendly – and their factory in Southern Uganda [that] employs local women of the rural region,” BCF executive director Athena Yu told CoinDesk. “The selection of schools is still ongoing and will be aided by our implementation party, Tech Plus Love Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in Uganda.”  Yet Weiss-Wolf questioned whether cryptocurrency is the right tool for such donations.  “Any sort of intervention program needs to be firmly rooted with local people and what they need, to provide access to the products and resources that would be most comfortable and useful for them,” Weiss-Wolf said.  Grassroots marketing  There are many reasons for Pink Care Token to utilize cryptocurrency, even if a fiat donation to AFRIpads might have accomplished the philanthropic goals.  BCF is partnering with Binance Uganda for this project, a separate entity founded in 2018 to offer crypto trading with fiat on-ramps. Pink Care Token is essentially a digital coupon that requires both product sellers and recipients to set up a crypto wallet or exchange account.  Bitcoin seller Wensi Nuwagaba, based in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, told CoinDesk that rural areas often lack access to banks and large-scale inventory, so mobile payments for smaller merchants are commonplace.  “The biggest challenge we have is internet infrastructure. When you leave the city, the connection is really, really slow,” Nuwagaba said. “What they [BCF] are trying to do is to raise [crypto] awareness as well.”  Cryptocurrency does address some pain points in the Ugandan market.  Nuwagaba said he is part of a WhatsApp group with 206 Ugandan bitcoin sellers who help traders liquidate around $2 million worth of crypto a month. His biggest client liquidated $500,000 worth of bitcoin, but most are freelance traders liquidating roughly $1,000 a month. Some clients also use bitcoin for e-commerce.  “Parts of Africa are excluded from forms of payment. Visa and Mastercard work in Uganda, but remittances for outside Uganda don’t work,” he said. “PayPal doesn’t allow us to receive payments in Uganda. Bitcoin has helped to bridge the gap.”  Within that context, Pink Care Token provides a free learning opportunity for crypto-curious families, even if the BCF lacks complete transparency.  “We hope to use this Pink Care Token project to inspire more people to think about the application of blockchain and crypto in social impact,” Hai said. “Hopefully we can copy the model to more regions where there is a need.”  Update (July 28, 1:51 UTC): This article has been updated to reflect the BCF's future commitment to charity projects, Helen Hai's current business holdings and the current status of Binance Uganda's exchange offerings.

Company CEO Alex Adelman announced the partnership with Albertson’s subsidiary Safeway in an interview with Yahoo! Finance on Thursday. The expansion enables users to order groceries, beauty products, or pharmacy items online at Safeway.com for pick-up.  “We saw a demand from users to earn bitcoin for every day expenses like food and pharmacy,” said Adelman, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Additionally, users still earn a 3-5 percent return in bitcoin through their online purchases, which Adelman sees as a “rail to get bitcoin to the masses.” According to company accounting, nearly 40 percent are Lolli users are new to cryptocurrencies.  Launched a little under a year ago, Lolli has partnered with 750 merchants online, including Walmart, Macys, and Priceline. Adelman's previous company Cosmic was acquired by ecommerce firm Ebates, “so we know the merchants and understand the business model well.”  He estimates the average user has so far earned around $26 (263,661 satoshis) in bitcoin. He adds, after a purchase, the rewards estimate is calculated within “a few minutes to a few days.” However, it typically takes 30-90 days for the rebate to come through, as Lolli must wait until after the return period closes.  Adelman declined to share the firm's revenue projections, but said Lolli gets a percentage of each sale, which they then share with their tens of thousands of users.  As previously reported, Lolli launched in September 2018 backed with $2.35 million from prominent venture capital firms including Bain Capital Ventures and Digital Currency Group.
