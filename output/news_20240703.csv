30365153,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627629,1720047611,"British Mega Bank Standard Chartered Says Bitcoin Will Hit $100,000, Here’s When","British mega bank Standard Chartered has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The multinational bank has projected that Bitcoin will surge as high as $100,000 from its current price of above $60,000. Bitcoin To Reach $100,000 By US Election Day In a Tuesday note, Standard Chartered’s head of forex and digital assets research, Geoffery Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin could see its price rallying to $100,000 by the United States (US) election day in November. He also disclosed that the pioneer cryptocurrency is poised for “a fresh all-time” by August 2024. Related Reading: XRP Price Attempts Bullish Decoupling Amid Major Developments Kendrick’s bullish forecast for BTC hinges on the outcome of the upcoming US Presidential election, particularly whether the current US President, Joe Biden, continues his election campaign. Within the crypto space, Biden has somewhat gained an anti-crypto reputation due to his previous actions seemingly aimed at limiting the crypto industry. As a result, the crypto industry may lean towards supporting US presidential candidate, Donald Trump in the forthcoming elections, given his vocal support for cryptocurrencies and promises to advance the ecosystem if elected President. Standard Chartered has also correlated Trump’s electoral odds to the price of Bitcoin, elucidating that both crypto regulation and mining could be viewed more favorably under his regime. On the flipside, Kendrick also emphasized that if Biden withdraws from the US Presidential election race in July, the price of Bitcoin could drop as low as $50,000 to $55,000. He pinpointed August 4 as a crucial date that would determine Biden’s candidacy. Moreover, Kendrick’s bullish outlook for BTC reaffirms his earlier predictions in November 2023 when he projected BTC to hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. At the time, Kendrick and the Standard Chartered team had outlined catalysts like Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the Bitcoin halving event as bullish drivers for this price surge. BTC Continues To Trade Below All-Time Highs Bitcoin is still trading below its all-time high of above $73,500 in March, experiencing major declines as selling pressures take hold and market volatility continues. Although Standard Chartered foresees a $100,000 price leap for BTC and Bernstein predicts a $200,000 all-time high for Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency is still on a downward trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Starts July On A High Note: Burn Rate Surges 16,854%, Trading Volume Rises 170% In just 24 hours, BTC gave up over $2,000 from its price, declining by 3.88% to trade at $60,115, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been exhibiting bearish signals since the beginning of June, influenced by miners’ Bitcoin sell-offs and recent outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez has predicted that over $1 billion will be liquidated if BTC rebounds to $62,600. This development could potentially short the market and trigger more declines for Bitcoin.

30361561,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627592,1720042224,"These Are The Altcoins In Buy Zone, Analytics Firm Reveals","The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the altcoins that are currently in the historical buy zone according to a fair value model. A Large Amount Of Altcoins Are Currently Near The Opportunity Zone In a new post on X, Santiment talked about what the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector are looking like right now based on their Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios. The MVRV ratio is an indicator that keeps track of the profit/loss status of the addresses on any given network. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are carrying a net amount of profits right now. On the other hand, the metric under this threshold implies the dominance of losses in the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Next Bitcoin Target Is $78,700 If BTC Breaks This Resistance Naturally, the MVRV ratio being exactly equal to 1 suggests the unrealized loss on the network is exactly equal to the unrealized profit, so the average holder could be considered just breaking even. Historically, corrections have become more probable when investor profits have ballooned up. Holders become more tempted to sell the larger their gains grow. Similarly, holders getting underwater has facilitated bottom formations, as sellers become exhausted during such conditions. Based on these facts, Santiment has developed an Opportunity and Danger Zone Model that uses the MVRV ratio’s divergence on different timeframes to estimate better whether an asset is currently providing a buying or selling window. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows where the different altcoins stand according to this model: Note that in this model, the zero mark takes the role of the neutral 1 level from the MVRV ratio. Also, the polarity is flipped here, with values under zero implying profit dominance and those above signifying loss. The graph shows that most of the altcoins are in the positive region right now, suggesting that their investors are underwater. Among these, Basic Attention Token (BAT), Chromia (CHR), and Highstreet (HIGH) particularly stand out as their MVRV divergence exceeds the 1 mark. Related Reading: PEPE Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $14.7 Million Stack From Binance Under this model, the region above 1 is called the “Opportunity Zone,” as assets have historically offered the most profitable opportunities while inside it. While most altcoins are at least slightly undervalued currently, a few, like Ethereum Name Service (ENS), MANTRA (OM), and Reserve Rights (RSR), are in or near the Danger Zone instead. The Danger Zone, which occurs under -1, is the counterpart to the Opportunity Zone, where coins become overvalued. Ethereum Price Ethereum, the largest among the altcoins, has faced a plunge of more than 4% in the last 24 hours, which has taken its price under the $3,300 level.

These developments have sparked intrigue in political circles and garnered attention within the cryptocurrency industry. Biden’s Successor? According to seven senior sources from the Biden campaign, the White House, and the Democratic National Committee, discussions are underway about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee if he chooses not to pursue reelection. This scenario would involve Harris inheriting the funds and campaign infrastructure established by the Biden campaign. With her high name recognition and favorable polling among Democrats, Harris is considered a strong alternative candidate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Drops Below $60,000: Key Reason Explained The cryptocurrency market has also reacted to these speculations, with traders on the crypto-based prediction platform Polymarket witnessing a significant increase in the odds of VP Harris becoming the Democratic nominee. The trading of stocks indicating a “yes” answer to Harris receiving the nomination jumped from as high as 43%, approaching Biden’s numbers, which amount to a 45% chance, according to voters, of completing the race to the White House. Kamala Horris Skyrockets Amidst Political Buzz CoinGecko data further reveals the impact of these developments on the meme coin market. The Kamala Horris meme coin experienced an astronomical surge, soaring over 174% in the past 24 hours and an astonishing 1659% over the past two weeks. Its trading price peaked at $0.01561, reflecting the growing interest and uncertainty surrounding the potential shift in the upcoming presidential election. In contrast, CoinGecko shows that Donald Trump’s parody meme coin, Doland Tremp (TREMP), faced a decline of over 43% in the past seven days, currently trading at $0.4868. However, TREMP still boasts a substantial market cap of $48 million, surpassing other political meme coins in the crypto space. Conversely, President Biden’s parody meme coin, Jeo Boden (BODEN), witnessed a surge of over 22% in the past hour alone, demonstrating the frenzy among crypto investors in response to the evolving political landscape. Nevertheless, BODEN experienced a 71% price drop in the past week, with its current trading price at $0.04533. Related Reading: Ethereum DApps On Fire: Volume Soars Over 90% — Good For ETH Price? Ultimately, these developments hold implications for the political arena and the broader crypto industry. Former President Trump’s pro-crypto stance and emphasis on innovation have been juxtaposed with the regulatory challenges faced during the Biden administration. The lack of a clear regulatory framework and enforcement actions brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past years has raised concerns among industry participants, who argue that such actions may hinder growth and innovation in the nascent crypto space. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, continues to exert its influence on the sentiment of top cryptocurrencies.

30354259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627635,1720031418,Ethereum DApps On Fire: Volume Soars Over 90% — Good For ETH Price?,"Ethereum (ETH) has become a beacon in the sea of blockchains, boasting a staggering 92% surge in dApp (decentralized application) volume over the past week. This news, however, comes with a layer of complexity, revealing a landscape of both opportunity and potential setbacks for the leading blockchain. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market Cheap Gas Fuels The Fire Analysts attribute the dApp volume explosion to the Dencun upgrade in March, which significantly reduced gas fees – the cost associated with processing transactions on the Ethereum network. Lower fees have historically enticed users, and this recent development seems to be no different. The surge in activity suggests a revitalized Ethereum, potentially attracting new projects and fostering a more vibrant dApp ecosystem. NFT Mania Drives The Numbers While the overall dApp volume (see chart below) paints a rosy picture, a closer look reveals a more nuanced story. The surge appears to be driven primarily by a surge in NFT (Non-Fungible Token) trading and staking activity. Applications like Blur and Uniswap’s NFT aggregator saw significant hikes, highlighting the booming NFT market on Ethereum. This trend indicates a thriving niche within the Ethereum dApp landscape, but raises questions about the platform’s diversification beyond NFTs. A Look At User Engagement A curious wrinkle emerges when examining user engagement metrics. Despite the impressive volume increase, the number of unique active wallets (UAW) on the Ethereum network has actually decreased. This disconnect suggests that the current activity might be driven by a smaller, more active user base. While high volume is certainly a positive indicator, it’s crucial to see broader user participation to ensure the sustainability of the dApp ecosystem. A Glimmer Of Hope? One positive long-term indicator for Ethereum is the trend of decreasing exchange holdings, as reported by Glassnode. This suggests ETH holders are moving their assets off exchanges, potentially reducing sell pressure and contributing to price stability. If this trend continues, ETH could potentially target reaching $4,000 this quarter or even surpass its all-time high. However, this price prediction remains speculative and depends on various market forces. Ethereum At A Crossroads Ethereum finds itself at a crossroads. The Dencun upgrade has demonstrably revitalized dApp activity, particularly in the NFT space. However, the uneven dApp performance and declining UAW raise concerns about the long-term viability of this growth. Network growth, measured by the number of new addresses joining the network, is also slowing down, according to Santiment, potentially hindering wider adoption. Related Reading: Avalanche On The Verge: Will AVAX Break Out And Reach $65? The short-term price outlook for ETH remains uncertain. While the long-term indicators, like decreasing exchange holdings, suggest potential for price appreciation, the network’s growth slowdown might lead to a short-term price dip. Looking Forward The coming months will be crucial for Ethereum. The platform needs to capitalize on the renewed interest in dApps by attracting a broader user base and fostering a more diverse dApp ecosystem beyond NFTs. Addressing scalability issues and ensuring user-friendly interfaces will also be key to sustaining growth. If Ethereum can navigate these challenges, it has the potential to solidify its position as the premier platform for decentralized applications. However, if it fails to adapt, other blockchains waiting in the wings might capitalize on its shortcomings.

42417810,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyPd,1720030530,The Protocol: 'Private Jet Brandization' Is One Way Polkadot Burnt Cash,"June proved to be an incredibly ugly month in crypto markets (see our blood-red chart below), but wasn't completely devoid of decent blockchain tech stories. One obsession of crypto twitterati during the past week was poring over the line items in Polkadot's treasury transparency report. The $6.8 million to sponsor a ""prestigious soccer club"" was just one of many expenses held up to public scrutiny.  ALSO:  Handicapping Solana's ETF chances.  Crypto hacks in 1H doubled from a year earlier to $572M.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Tezos, Igloo, Worldcoin, Alchemy, Obol Labs, Wavlake, ZBD.  Nearly $80 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Lombard, Prodia, RedStone, Pi Squared, Astria, Redacted, OpenLedger, Ethos.  Uniswap had the least-bad June returns among members of the CoinDesk 20.  Network news  Polkadot's spending more than doubled from the prior six months' clip. (Polkadot)  BURN RATE: At the very least one has to give Polkadot credit for transparency. On Tuesday the blockchain project released a lengthy report, including spreadsheets and copies of invoices, detailing its spending over the past six months. No good deed goes unpunished, however, and right on cue, twitterati tore into the project's multimillion-dollar spending on activities like marketing, advertising, sponsorships, events and influencers. At the highest level, the project spent $87 million worth of its own DOT tokens on various activities during the first half of 2024, a pace that would exhaust the $245 million currently in the treasury within roughly two years, as relayed by CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa. But it was the green-eyeshade details that left the report's readers agog – $4.9 million for influencers, $1.9 million to sponsor the race car driver Conor Daly, $1 million for digital ads on CoinMarketCap, $490,000 to the press-release website Chainwire, $180,000 for ""private jet brandization,"" $6.8 million for a ""deal with a prestigious soccer club,"" as the report termed it. (Lionel Messi's team, Inter Miami?) Snarky posters on X remarked that, for all the spending, the influencers seemed strangely inactive – while others joked that the report was finally bringing Polkadot the publicity it coveted. Polkadot officials noted that the spending went further than expected, thanks to this year's mostly-up crypto markets: ""We can observe a huge jump in spending, as proposals got more ambitious in scope and ask size recently,"" the report read. ""The good news is that the average DOT price has gone up this half-year, resulting in more bang for the DOT, highlighted by the fact that DOT spending went up by 2.4x, but the USD-equivalent value is up 3.2x in the same timeframe.""  NOT SOL FAST! Hey, Bitcoin got ETFs earlier this year, and now Ethereum appears headed in that direction, possibly bringing in billions of dollars within months, based on Galaxy Digital research. So what about an ETF for Solana, seen as one of the most promising blockchains? Probably not anytime soon, experts are saying. The speculation kicked off last week as the investment manager VanEck filed for a Solana ETF, sending the project's native token, SOL, up 8%. Another firm, 21Shares, put in a request a day later. But as reported by CoinDesk's Helene Braun, ""Solana hasn't cleared a prerequisite for the Biden administration's Securities and Exchange Commission: a well-established regulated derivatives market. Both bitcoin and ether have had that, in the form of CME Group's cryptocurrency futures contracts."" Another possible hurdle is that the SEC, in some of its legal cases, has alleged that SOL is an unregistered security – and that cloud might have to clear before an ETF sees any sunlight. ""It is unlikely that there will be a decision on this in the near future,"" as Coinbase Institutional analysts put it in a weekly research report.  ALSO:  WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange received a donation of 8.07 bitcoins (worth roughly $500,000) from one entity, helping to cover the cost of a private jet that flew him out of the UK and ultimately to freedom in Australia after he reached a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice.  Jesse Powell, a co-founder of the crypto exchange Kraken, said he donated $1 million to Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, most of which was in ether (ETH).  The family of Tigran Gambaryan, an executive of the crypto exchange Binance being detained in Nigeria in connection with money-laundering charges, said his health is deteriorating. He complained of numbness in his foot as well as back pain, and has double pneumonia and malaria, according to a statement from the family. A trial in the case was adjourned until July 5 following cross-examination Monday of the first witness from the country's Securities and Exchange Commission.  In a rare move, the predictions market Polymarket contradicted its decentralized oracle service UMA with regard to the resolution of a market betting on whether Barron Trump had a role in the DJT token – tweeting that there was ""conclusive"" evidence the former president's scion was involved ""in some way."" (For background, please see The Protocol's June 19 summary of the controversy, including the participation of ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli.)  Crypto losses due to hacks and rug pulls in the second quarter more than doubled from a year earlier to $572 million, according to Immunefi.""CeFi was the main target of successful exploits at 70% of the total losses in Q2, compared to DeFi at 30%.""

Developer teams behind the Tezos blockchain unveiled ""Tezos X,"" a set of technological upgrades they say could bring a ""huge boost in performance, composability and interoperability."" The roadmap, setting out a development plan for the next two years, calls for splitting off transaction execution into a separate ""canonical rollup"" that would support ""atomic transactions across smart contracts written in different programming languages."" The main Tezos blockchain would serve as a base layer for consensus and settlement.  2. Igloo Inc., Pudgy Penguins’ parent company, on Monday announced the acquisition of the Frame team. ""Frame co-founders and notable blockchain developers Cygaar and Beans will contribute towards building a new Ethereum L2, Abstract, designed to take on the consumer crypto opportunity,"" according to the team.  3. Worldcoin has announced that it is partnering with Alchemy to provide reliable infrastructure for World Chain, a new blockchain designed for humans, according to the team.  4.

Early participants in the collective include EigenLayer, Lido, Figment, Bitcoin Suisse, Nethermind, Blockdaemon, Chorus One, DappNode and ETH Stakers.  5. Wavlake, a music and podcast distribution platform, has partnered with ZBD to revolutionize creator payments. According to the team: ""Unlike Spotify and Apple Music, which pay meager royalties, Wavlake empowers independent musicians and podcasters. Through Wavlake, creators can upload content distributed across platforms like Fountain.fm. Listeners can tip artists using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, enabling instant microtransactions. Ainsley Costello earned over $700 in Bitcoin for a single track, outperforming Spotify.""

30350628,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627594,1720026013,"Bitcoin Price Drops Below $60,000: Key Reason Explained","The Bitcoin price has fallen to a low of $59,604 today, marking a 4% decrease. According to several renowned crypto analysts, this movement was largely driven by the phenomenon known as the CME gap, a concept critical in Bitcoin futures trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? A “CME gap” is a term used to describe the price gap that emerges on the Bitcoin CME futures chart. Unlike Bitcoin’s spot markets that operate 24/7, the CME Bitcoin futures market only trades five days a week, closing over the weekend and on holidays. This difference in trading hours can result in a price discrepancy between the last traded price on Friday and the market’s opening on Monday. Today’s Bitcoin price action can probably be directly linked to the closure of such a gap. Over the weekend, a noticeable gap formed. Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto), a prominent trader and analyst, confirmed this via X, explaining, “Bitcoin closed most of the gap that was created during this weekend. On Monday it also closed the gap that was created a week ago and topped out right at that point. [..] The gap has now been fully closed. No major gaps in nearby proximity as we speak.” Related Reading: Fundstrat’s Head Of Research Says Bitcoin Will Reach $150,000, Here’s When Other market participants echoed this sentiment. Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) indicated the bullish potential post-gap closure, stating on X, “Bitcoin CME Futures GAP got filled! As expected. Nothing holds BTC back now. Time to send.” This view suggests that filling the gap could remove resistance for Bitcoin’s price, potentially leading to an uptick. Crypto analyst Ninja (@Ninjascalp) confirmed, “this was just a CME gap fill guys it’s bullish selling. It’s all going to be okey. Don’t panic.” Another analyst commented “For anyone questioning who’s running the BTC market in the short term, it’s market makers! There was no way they were going to leave a $1,650 CME gap from the weekend.” What To Expect Now? Marco Johanning offered a more nuanced take, emphasizing the precarious nature of the current price level. His commentary via X highlighted both potential and risk. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Tied To Economic Echoes Of The 1930s-1970: Arthur Hayes “Main scenario: Bitcoin has lost the trendline and closed the CME gap. The price is sitting on a local support, from which it can now pump. That would be a typical mid-week reversal with the liquidity behind the equal highs at 63.8k as the main target. However, the current level is also fragile. If the support is lost, we could see another 1k-2k drop. I can hardly wait for Bitcoin to finally leave this exhausting time capitulation range,” Johanning stated. The analysts from Alpha dōjō (@alphadojo_net) provided an in-depth analysis, dissecting the day’s price movement and potential future trends. Their report highlighted the critical levels that traders are watching: “The analysis is quite simple: BTC needs to bounce here, or if it loses the $60k level, much lower prices are likely. As long as we don’t break below $60k or above $63.5k, it’s best to take it slow and wait for a clearer direction.” They also noted a significant liquidity pool around the $60,000 mark which might act as a support, while pointing out that a strong selling presence above this level at $64,000 could cap upward movements. “In the order books, the sell side remains very strong, while the bid side fails to show any increase.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,388.

AAVE, LDO also saw more than 10% price drops as a large investor moved $10 million of tokens to Binance.  Cryptocurrencies in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector were hit harder than the broader crypto market this week, with the CoinDesk DeFi Index losing 9% from its Monday high versus the CoinDesk 20 benchmark's 5% decline during the same time.  Leading the plunge was the governance token of Pendle – a DeFi protocol that offers crypto yields in the form of tradable tokens – falling more than 20% during the Tuesday and Wednesday trading sessions, with short positions piling up to bet on further declines.  The protocol saw a significant, $3 billion drop in the value of assets locked on the protocol (TVL), Defillama data shows. Analysts reasoned that many users withdrew funds from the protocol instead of rolling over their positions at the end of June lock-up expiry. Pendle also benefited from the airdrop and points farming bonanza earlier this year, which ground to halt lately.

Tokens of other major DeFi lending platforms Aave {{AAVE}} and liquid staking protocol Lido {{LDO}} were also among the biggest underperformers, falling 10%-15% during the same period.  The declines happened as a large crypto investor, or ""whale,"" transferred earlier Wednesday $6.2 million worth of LDO and $4.5 million in AAVE to crypto exchange Binance, likely to sell the tokens, one observer noted citing blockchain data on EtherScan.  The DeFi sector's struggle coincided with a period of lull in the crypto market, with bitcoin {{BTC}} and DeFi hotbed ether {{ETH}} consolidating range-bound below their March peaks. ETH, the second largest crypto asset, is down about 6% from its Monday highs and has erased most of its gains since odds for regulatory approval for U.S. spot ETFs jumped overnight in late May.

The analyst suggested that things are about to get interesting for the flagship crypto, predicting it could rise to as high as $4.5 million. The “Fireworks” Are Just About To Begin For Bitcoin While highlighting the significance of Bitcoin’s fourth halving, Quinten claimed that the “fireworks” were just about to begin for Bitcoin. The crypto analyst remarked that BTC was currently at the bottom of the range of a growth pattern, which it could enjoy if this fourth halving were to follow the same growth rate as the previous market cycles. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Starts July On A High Note: Burn Rate Surges 16,854%, Trading Volume Rises 170% If that were to happen, Quinten claims that Bitcoin could be worth between $140,000 and $4.5 million going forward. He noted that this potential move for BTC is starting at the range bottom at $63,000, so he remarked that the fireworks are just about to start for the flagship crypto. From the chart Quinten shared, Bitcoin’s impressive growth to $4.5 million isn’t expected to happen in this bull run. He predicts that Bitcoin could peak at around $1 million if it were to mirror Bitcoin’s trajectory after the first halving. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could eventually rise to $4.5 million in 2028 if it continues to mirror the price action following the first halving. Additionally, BTC’S fourth halving mirroring the second or third halving will bring lower price moves for the flagship crypto. Quinten predicts that Bitcoin will rise to as high as $400,000 or $280,000 if it follows the second or third halving, respectively. Meanwhile, based on the second and third halving trajectory, Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million or $800,000 by 2028. Time For BTC To Resume Its Upward Trend Based on recent analyses by different crypto analysts, Bitcoin could resume its upward trend soon enough. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez mentioned that retail investors are returning to the Bitcoin ecosystem, with new Bitcoin addresses hitting a four-month high of 432,026. This could put the flagship crypto in price discovery and lead to a rally as these investors accumulate Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently predicted that BTC is set to rise higher. He claimed that the flagship crypto had completed its inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily and noted that Bitcoin’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator suggests an imminent bullish cross, which indicates strength for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: XRP Price Attempts Bullish Decoupling Amid Major Developments Meanwhile, Mikybull Crypto revealed that Bitcoin’s CME gap has been filled.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $60,300 after sliding by 3% on Wednesday. This level has acted as a critical support since April, with bitcoin bouncing three times from this region before heading back towards the $70,000 mark.  Data provider CryptoQuant believes this is likely to happen again in the near future as numerous signs point towards capitulation following a period of intense sell pressure.  Two signs of miner capitulation are dwindling hashrate and mining revenue by hash (hashprice), both of which are down significantly this month, with hash rate plunging by 7.7% since the halving at hashprice nearing all-time lows. Hashrate is the mining power in the Bitcoin network, and hash price refers to the revenue miners earn from a unit of hashrate.  Miners are also experiencing a hit to their daily revenue, which fell to $29 million today from $79 million on March 6. This has led to miners turning off equipment and the subsequent drop in hashrate.  ""Miners have been hit by a 63% decline in daily revenues due to the halving and the collapse of transaction fees to 3.2% of total revenue,"" CryptoQuant said in a report.  Miner capitulation levels are now comparable with those in December 2022, which was the market bottom following the demise of FTX.

42417796,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyBB,1720018800,The Case for Crypto Index Funds,"The crypto assets market has grown remarkably over the past 15 years, peaking at a $3 trillion valuation in 2021, with over 26,000 listed cryptocurrencies. This growth has attracted retail and high-net-worth investors, family offices, university endowments, and even pension plans.  The entry of reputable TradFi firms such asGoldman Sachs,Fidelity, andBlackrock into the crypto space underscores the growing institutional acceptance and maturity of digital assets and has facilitated broader market participation.  Despite the strong demand for digital assets, there is still debate as to how to best to gain optimal exposure and manage risks. Many investors hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, or have invested in spot BTC ETFs, but a third option exists: crypto index funds. These funds offer diversified exposure to digital assets.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Sophisticated investors recognize the need to diversify portfolios, anticipating that as inflows into Bitcoin ETFs slow, so will volatility, reducing the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Institutional investors are increasingly seeking exposure to a broader set of cryptocurrencies that complement traditional equity holdings, which is where index funds come in. Crypto index funds are investment vehicles that track the performance of a basket of various cryptocurrencies, offering investors diversified exposure to the digital asset market without the need to buy individual cryptocurrencies directly. Currently, over a dozen crypto index funds are marketed to investors, ranging from $1 million to several hundred million dollars in assets under management.  Historically, good or bad news (idiosyncratic risk) about a specific crypto asset tends to be priced into the market quickly. That is to say that current market prices generally reflect what is currently known about these assets, creating some degree of price efficiency. Ideally, investors need to rebalance their portfolios frequently to capitalize on market movements and manage volatility. However, most active managers do not offer sufficient liquidity for this frequent rebalancing, consequently, most investors maintain very small position sizes. Given these challenges and the market’s nascency, adopting a diversified index strategy is sensible for those seeking broad exposure to this opportunity set.  Cryptocurrency index funds provide institutional investors with a streamlined approach to gain exposure to digital assets. Although typically distinct from venture capital investments, these index funds share a similar strategy in managing risk through diversification. By investing in the top crypto assets by market capitalization, they offer a way to mitigate some of the infancy risks associated with individual cryptocurrencies, much like how venture capital spreads investments across numerous startups to balance the high failure rate with the potential for substantial successes.  A key consideration for index funds is the number of cryptocurrencies they represent. While opting for the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization has been the norm, expanding the index to 25 accounts for 92% of the total crypto market capitalization. Some might seek to diversify even more with the top 50, but this would only marginally increase market cap coverage by 3%.  There are downsides to extending the universe of cryptocurrencies included in an index fund. It is advisable for investors to note whether an index fund includes meme coins, which have minimal developmental goals and are typically seen more as artistic expressions or cultural commentary. The higher volatility associated with meme coins also makes them unsuitable for an institutional portfolio.  For long-term investors who can forgo intra-monthly liquidity, staking assets held by the index can help protect against dilution as the coin supply of protocols grows over time. Staking assets allows investors to participate in the transaction verification process of proof-of-stake blockchains, with the chance to earn rewards, similar to equity dividend yields.  As institutional adoption of digital assets continues, it is imperative for investors to assess how best to gain exposure to the space and work with trusted partners to navigate the complexities of the crypto ecosystem. While an index fund is not the only way to invest in digital assets, there are strong arguments for it to be viewed as a foundational building block for an institutional portfolio to gain a more controlled and diversified exposure.

42417802,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyGL,1720018800,Insurance Is the Silent DeFi Guardian,"Insurance companies have historically shaped standards and promoted safer practices throughout society. In the automobile industry, they drove the development and adoption of now-ubiquitous safety measures – like seatbelts and airbags. By reducing premium payments for vehicles equipped with safety features, insurance companies helped align incentive mechanisms for car manufacturers and drivers and enforce higher safety standards. Similarly, by making liability coverage insurance contingent on adherence to safety protocols, insurance companies played a pivotal role in establishing safety standards in buildings and in the manufacturing sector.  The digital asset ecosystem has grown substantially in recent years and will continue to maintain its momentum as more institutions like BlackRock bring real-world assets on chain via tokenization. Despite this growth, the absence of regulatory guidance has created uncertainty, posing challenges for widespread adoption and rapid integration into the broader financial ecosystem.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In a similar vein, during the early days of the internet, cyber insurance emerged as an important tool to promote online security and reliability. Insurers offered coverage against risks such as hacking and data breaches, but only to companies that implemented stringent cybersecurity measures. This incentivized businesses to adopt best practices in cybersecurity, such as regular software updates, strong password policies, and comprehensive data protection strategies. Just as cyber insurance fostered a more secure digital environment, the development of regulatory frameworks and risk mitigation strategies will be crucial in ensuring the stability and trustworthiness of the growing digital asset landscape.  In this stage of its evolution, DeFi is exposed to a myriad of risks including smart contract vulnerabilities and regulatory, economic, and governance risks. This creates an opportunity for insurers to step in and act as a de facto regulator to enhance the resilience of the on-chain ecosystem and foster more trustworthy on-chain finance where user funds are protected at all times.  Traditional Insurance offerings are offered on a “guaranteed cost” basis, meaning the premium (rate based on exposure) is fixed for the policy term, regardless of the number or amount of claims that occur during the term. Although this model has made insurance available to billions of individuals and organizations worldwide, it has also created limitations for risk areas where insurers lack data, expertise or regulatory support. Due to this limitation, industries such as DeFi, have been left exposed, which ultimately affects the public.  So far, insurers have relied upon organizations such centralized exchanges and DAOs to create the framework for possible insurance offerings. Centralized exchanges still have fairly limited markets, and mostly utilize insurers to re-insure their exposure. Users seeking protection against their exposures on exchanges that don’t offer coverage, now are being offered coverage by DAOs (example: Nexus Mutual) for their individual risks. Although this provides a short-term solution to the limited capacity, the piecemeal implementation lacks the efficiency required to bring coverage to the nearly $2T (and growing) digital asset sector.  Many of us are accustomed to our personal funds being insured at chartered financial institutions up to a certain amount. For digital assets to be fully adopted by the general public, the framework for insurance must likewise be fully integrated into the institution. This integration helps give the public the confidence that their digital assets are protected to the same degree they are accustomed to with their real world assets.  Starting with insuring funds on Sandclock, Schwarzschild insurance is one service provider aiming to pioneer the protection for user funds across DeFi protocols. By seamlessly integrating with decentralized protocols, Schwarzschild aims to establish a model for comprehensive DeFi insurance that mirrors the depositors' insurance at chartered banks. This approach includes rigorous security audits and compliance checks to ensure that only the safest and most reliable DeFi protocols are covered. Schwarzschild's framework will provide users with confidence and peace of mind, knowing their digital assets are protected against potential vulnerabilities and risks inherent in the DeFi ecosystem. This pioneering effort represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption, where the public can trust that their digital assets are as secure as their traditional financial holdings.

With a recent price dip seemingly nearing its end, analysts are eyeing a potential breakout that could propel AVAX to new highs. However, amidst the bullish whispers, experts advise a dose of cautious optimism before investors jump on the bandwagon. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market A Consolidation Phase Hints At Breakout Potential The current price movement of AVAX has analysts glued to their charts. The coin is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a technical indicator that often precedes a bullish breakout. This consolidation suggests a healthy correction after a previous downtrend, explains prominent crypto analyst Worlds Of Charts. $Avax Consolidating In Falling Wedge Chart Pattern Seems Like Healthy Correction Has Almost Completed Now Getting Ready For Breakout & Preparing For Bullish Continuation Expecting Move Towards 60-65$ In Case Of Successful Breakout #Crypto #Avax pic.twitter.com/XafWguyk8w — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) July 1, 2024 The falling wedge is a key signal that AVAX might be coiling up for a significant upward surge, the analyst said. Worlds Of Charts predicts a price surge towards the $60-$65 range if the breakout materializes. Backing this sentiment, CoinCodex, a popular crypto prediction platform, offers a more aggressive forecast. Their data suggests a staggering 227% increase for AVAX, propelling the price to a lofty $91.46 by August 2nd, 2024. On-Chain Metrics Reveal Investor Confidence Meanwhile, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock paints a picture of investor confidence. Over half (51%) of AVAX holders are currently in profit, showcasing a positive long-term outlook. Further bolstering this confidence, a whopping 45% of investors have held onto their AVAX for over a year, indicating a commitment to the project’s long-term vision. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Inches Closer To All-Time High – Will TON Hit $8 This Week? The dominance of large investors, often referred to as whales, in the AVAX ecosystem is another noteworthy point. These whales hold a significant 72% of the circulating supply, contributing to a sense of stability. Whale activity can significantly impact price movements, and their continued investment in AVAX suggests they see value in the platform’s potential. A Call For Measured Optimism The recent price dip also serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. While the falling wedge pattern suggests a potential reversal, a confirmed breakout remains to be seen. With careful analysis and a well-defined investment strategy, Avalanche could be poised for a significant climb. However, for now, investors are wise to exercise caution and avoid being swept away by the current of bullish enthusiasm.

The institutional wave of ETF buying has yet to arrive, wrote Markus Thielen.  Traders often mistakenly cite round numbers as critical support or resistance levels, but in this case, the $60,000 level bitcoin {{BTC}} is currently flirting with could truly prove important.  ""We estimate that the average bitcoin ETF entry price is $60,000 to $61,000, and re-testing this level could result in a wave of liquidations,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said.  Since their debut on Jan. 11, the 11 U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have amassed over $14 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors. Per Thielen, 30% of the flows are part of a non-directional arbitrage strategy called the basis trade instead of outright bullish bets.  Bitcoin's late April break below $60,000 bottomed out at around $56,500 after BlackRock said heavyweight institutions like sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and endowments were likely to trade in the spot ETFs. However, JPMorgan recently revealed that 80% of the inflows into the spot ETFs came from existing crypto market participants.  ""When Bitcoin dipped to 56,500 on May 2, Blackrock claimed ‘sovereign wealth and pension funds’ were coming,"" Thielen noted. ""This helped arrest the decline, but now Blackrock says that 80% of their Bitcoin IBIT ETF buying is from retail, not institutions.""  Bitcoin has dropped nearly 14% in four weeks, predominantly due to faster sales by miners and old wallets, Germany's divestment of crypto holdings and fears that reimbursement by defunct exchange Mt.

42417797,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyCD,1720011600,Obol Labs Forms Industry Group to Push for Decentralized Validator Technology,"Blockchain startup Obol Labs has formed a new industry group that aims to advance the growing field of distributed validator technology – at the heart of the latest push by developers to eradicate single points of failures within decentralized networks like Ethereum.  The Obol Collective includes a consortium of Ethereum ecosystem players ""dedicated to the security, resiliency and decentralization of Ethereum consensus,"" according to a blog post Wednesday from Obol Labs. The company is the primary developer behind Obol Network, seen as one of the leading distributed validator projects.  Obol Labs says the collective includes more than 50 staking protocols, client teams, software tools, education and community projects, professional node operators, home operators and stakers. Early participants in the collective include EigenLayer, Lido, Figment, Bitcoin Suisse, Nethermind, Blockdaemon, Chorus One, DappNode and ETH Stakers.  Consensus layer  Obol's distributed validator technology is designed to enhance the security of a key category of players in Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus system: its validators – the companies, pools, and individuals who operate hardware to run Ethereum behind the scenes.  Validators can use Obol to spread control of their hardware across multiple parties, a setup designed to make the whole process more resilient to failures and bad actors.  Ethereum's infrastructure consists of two layers: the execution layer, which handles apps and transactions, and the consensus layer, where validators agree on the system's state.  ""Obol has been helping build DVT and doing its own part to strengthen and decentralize the consensus layer with distributed validators,"" said Thomas Heremans, the CEO of the new Obol Association, which was established to support the Collective. ""We're realizing that we can bring together many more actors on that layer together to achieve that vision together.""  According to Heremans, the pitch for DVT has become especially relevant now that U.S. regulators have approved the first ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds.  ""If I was a regulator looking at staking, DVT just makes sense,"" Heremans told CoinDesk. ""I would want these ETFs to be powered by DVT. I think it just makes sense to reduce the risks.""  Today, 1% of the staking rewards produced by Obol's distributed validators go towards its recently-established retroactive staking fund, or ""RAF."" Over time, Obol plans to build out a community governance process that will distribute those funds to members of the new collective.  Obol launched in 2022 and has been adopted by key players like Lido, the biggest staking pool on Ethereum, which uses Obol's DVT tech for a small portion of its validators.  Most big validators, including Lido, continue to operate the bulk of their hardware conventionally, meaning they rely on centralized parties to run their systems.  ""Today, the security and decentralization of consensus depend primarily on social pressure and mutual trust that staking protocols and operators will do what’s best for Ethereum: this is the 'won’t be evil' phase,"" Obol stated in its blog post. ""At Obol, we’re making distributed validators (DVs) readily available, offering not only protection against client issues and key mismanagement, but also byzantine fault tolerance: ushering in the 'can’t be evil' phase.""",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/03/obol-labs-forms-industry-group-to-push-for-decentralized-validator-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/447c93c6f8a6c2f70e80efad1bdeb33ae2c37c3b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417793,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZyA9,1720011600,What Bitcoin and the American Dream Have in Common,"The United States of America says, after Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”  It's full of platitudes, too: Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, A Shining City on a Hill. They've become platitudes as time has passed and the country (and the people who make it up) have changed. Changed just as its national motto has, from a fitting e pluribus unum (""from many, one"") to a frankly puzzling “In God We Trust.”  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  What hasn’t changed, at least in name, is the U.S.’s animating myth: The American Dream. The idea that anyone can achieve success through sacrifice, talent, hard work, and grit, rather than just plain old luck.  The American Dream means different things to different people, though. I am a first-generation Greek-American, so to me, the American Dream means taking advantage of the opportunities I had because of a sacrifice my grandparents made by leaving their home country with their children.  Does the American Dream mean the same thing to those whose families came from England ten generations ago? Or five generations ago from Ireland? Or Italy? What about those whose ancestors came here on slave ships?  Probably not.  This ambiguity isn’t necessarily a problem. It’s true of many big, important ideas: democracy, for an easy example. Just because there isn’t broad, ubiquitous agreement on what an idea means doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to glean from it. There are guiding principles embedded in these ideas. At risk of sounding full of non-sequiturs, it’s in this way that Bitcoin and the American Dream fit together.  Bitcoin and its multitudes and platitudes  Yeah, I know. Bitcoin!  Platitudes include: Bitcoin Fixes This, Bitcoin is [Synonym for Hope], You Wouldn’t Get It, Number Go Up, Have Fun Staying Poor.  It might seem trite to compare Bitcoin to the American Dream, but from my vantage point the commonalities are painfully obvious.  At the surface level Bitcoin and the American Dream are a decent match. Success through “hard work”? That’s exactly how bitcoin mining works: the more work you put in, the more you’re rewarded.  We can ask more questions.  Is bitcoin peer-to-peer, electronic cash? Is bitcoin digital gold? Is bitcoin a store of value? Will Bitcoin enable a clean energy transition? Will Bitcoin use all our water? Can the Bitcoin protocol supercharge ransomware? Can Bitcoin empower the individual in oppressive regimes? Will Bitcoin cripple the Federal Reserve? Will Bitcoin bankrupt you? Will Bitcoin make you rich? Is Bitcoin Resistance Money? Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?  The answers to these questions depend on whom you ask. For this reason, Bitcoin and the American Dream are even more alike that they appear.  Bitcoin means something different to me, a fully banked American citizen with access to basically any financial product I can dream up and to a relatively stable local currency, than it does to Roya Mahboob, an Afghani woman who uses Bitcoin (among other technologies) to help girls in Afghanistan overcome gender inequality and get an education. It means something different yet to Argentinians and Venezuelans facing hyperinflation.  All these meanings of Bitcoin can be and are true. Bitcoin is large, it contains multitudes. Freeing those multitudes to transact without permission is the ethos of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer, electronic cash system.  Bitcoiners can agree that Bitcoin can be many things in the same way that Americans can agree that the American Dream (and America, for that matter) can be many things. One thing is for sure: as Americans are tied together by the American Dream, there is an ethos of Bitcoin, the freedom to transact, which ties bitcoiners together.  A supersized side of cynicism…  I intentionally sidestepped a question above because it is top-of-mind right now for both America and Bitcoin.  Is America captured by corporate interests? Is Bitcoin?  George Carlin famously said in a stand-up comedy routine that “it’s called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.” To his mind, the country had long been co-opted by profiteers. In a way, I share some of that cynicism. Consumerism and the obsession with acquiring things embarrass me as an American.  This cynicism is echoed by the father of gonzo journalism, Hunter S. Thompson, in his acclaimed book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream. The title conveys the point: Las Vegas, as an epicenter of gambling and entertainment, is a caricature of American excess and consumerism, both of which (along with the drugs that feature prominently in the book) threaten to sully America’s name.  As for bitcoin, it is now being peddled, in a sanitized form, by the likes of BlackRock, the biggest, most mainstream financial firm in the world, through the U.S. spot ETF. Bitcoin, the idea and asset born from the ashes of the Great Financial Crisis as a rejection of the Icarian behavior of the leverage-ridden, synthetic derivative-obsessed financiers who birthed the crisis, is now being advertised for purchase by those same institutions. Has Bitcoin been captured by corporate interests?  Perhaps, at least partially.  All that said, I believe one of the best parts about being American is being able to complain about America. That’s one of the best parts of being a Bitcoiner too. And both are better for it, even if there are both Americans and Bitcoiners who will yell at you for doing so.

IBIT has accumulated $19B AUM and trades nearly 28M daily shares. IBIT may be a good buy as Bitcoin has formed a bullish cup and handle pattern which could set up a break-out to new all-time highs. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a gamechanger for many investors. Cryptocurrency had always been too risky for risk-averse stock traders like myself, and ETFs offered peace of mind. That said, not all funds instilled me with confidence. It doesn't matter what the asset class is, AUM's under $100M, poor liquidity and little known fund sponsors put me off. Thankfully, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) was one of the funds launched in January, and it ticks all the boxes. Introducing IBIT IBIT is sponsored by BlackRock, which is ""the world’s largest ETF manager by AUM, managing $3.5T in global ETF investment vehicles as of December 31, 2023."" The BlackRock iShares range of ETFs covers just about any investment theme you could think of. While they vary greatly in terms of quality and performance, they are the household name in ETFs, ubiquitous and reliable. That all said, we should still do our own research into the safety aspects of the fund. As FTX showed us, nothing is too big to fail. Safety The prospectus details the arrangements for holding its Bitcoin with a custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. The Bitcoin Custodian keeps custody of all of the Trust’s bitcoin in segregated accounts in the Vault Balance, other than the Trust’s bitcoin which is temporarily maintained in the Trading Balance with the Prime Execution Agent as described below in “—The Prime Execution Agent.” ...The Bitcoin Custodian keeps all of the private keys associated with the Trust’s bitcoin held at the Bitcoin Custodian in the Vault Balance in cold storage. Cold storage is a safeguarding method by which the private key(s) corresponding to bitcoin is (are) generated and stored in an offline manner. Private keys are generated in offline computers or devices that are not connected to the internet so that they are more resistant to being hacked. It sounds safe enough, but nothing is guaranteed. Later on in the prospectus, there is a warning, ... the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust and the security procedures may not protect against all errors, software flaws or other vulnerabilities in the Trust’s technical infrastructure, which could result in theft, loss or damage of its assets. There is some insurance on the assets, but not nearly enough to cover the AUM. Coinbase Global maintains a commercial crime insurance policy of up to $320 million, which is intended to cover the loss of client assets held by Coinbase Insureds, including from employee collusion or fraud, physical loss including theft, damage of key material, security breach or hack, and fraudulent transfer. The insurance maintained by Coinbase Global is shared among all of Coinbase’s customers, is not specific to the Trust or to customers holding bitcoin with the Bitcoin Custodian or Prime Execution Agent and may not be available or sufficient to protect the Trust from all possible losses or sources of losses. The potential for hacks or other losses do seem low given the cold storage of keys, but clearly some risks remain and investing in Bitcoin ETFs is different than investing in stocks or equity ETFs. Most Bitcoin ETFs use Coinbase as a custodian, so the same risks are inherent. However, Fidelity uses an in-house custodian for its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ). Expenses IBIT has already accumulated AUM of $19B, eclipsing all other Bitcoin ETFs. It trades on average nearly 28M daily shares, which is multiples higher than its peers. AUMs (Etf.db) The expense ratio started at 0.12% when the fund was launched in January 2024 and will rise to 0.25% in January 2025. Currently, the fee is a mix of 0.12% on the first $5B AUM and 0.25% on AUM above $5B. As per the fund page, If the fund exceeds $5.0 billion of the Trust’s assets prior to the end of the 12-month period, the Sponsor’s Fee charged on assets over $5.0 billion will be 0.25%. All investors will incur the same Sponsor’s Fee which is the weighted average of those fee rates. After the 12-month waiver period is over, the Sponsor’s Fee will be 0.25%. With a YTD price change in Bitcoin of over 60%, the fractions of percent in the expense ratios make little difference. However, I like to know I am not throwing away money and IBIT compares favorably to other funds, especially Grayscale ( GBTC ) with its exorbitant 1.50% expense. FBTC has waived its expenses for a limited period to the end of July, when it will become 0.25%. Expense Ratios (Etf.db) Price Behaviour Another consideration is whether IBIT actually correlates closely to Bitcoin spot prices. As shown below, there are periods where there is a premium / discount, but these are brief as the fund seeks to minimize these by arbitraging with Baskets of 40,000 shares. Premium/Discount (iShares) Buying at a discount is always desirable, but you would have to be lucky to catch a discount of over 1%. For the most part, IBIT follows Bitcoin spot prices very closely. BTCUSD v IBIT (Tradingview) Bitcoin Forming a Bullish Pattern IBIT ticks all the boxes I would look for in a Bitcoin ETF - safe, liquid, low expenses and a stable correlation. It may be a good time to buy, as Bitcoin is forming a bullish technical pattern called a cup and handle. This forms when a rally consolidates around the previous highs to create a ""handle"" to set up a break-out. Cup and Handle Pattern (Investopedia) The pattern is quite clear on the Bitcoin chart. Bitcoin Daily Chart (Tradingview) Bitcoin has been consolidating for over 3 months now, and while it could continue in a sideways pattern for longer, it may be about ready to break out to new all-time highs. I prefer to buy a dip during the low volatility consolidation rather than chase the break-out when prices are already much higher. I therefore think IBIT is a buy around the current price of $35. Conclusions IBIT is the largest Bitcoin by ETF from the largest ETF provider. It is about as safe as you can get in this space, but still has some additional risks compared to stock and equity ETFs due to the necessity to store its large holdings in Bitcoin with a custodian. Its low expense ratio compares well to its peers, and this is my preferred Bitcoin ETF, followed in second place by FBTC. I currently rate IBIT a ""buy"" as Bitcoin is consolidating its gains in a bullish pattern that appears to be setting up a break-out to new all-time highs.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702241-ibit-the-gold-standard-in-bitcoin-etfs-ishares-bitcoin-trust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30340161.jpeg

30340097,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627586,1720009825,"FET Bearish Descent Targets Key $0.966 Level, More Dips Ahead?","Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is experiencing a prolonged bearish trend, pushing its price closer to the critical $0.966 support level. This sustained downward pressure has raised concerns among investors, as the cryptocurrency continues to extend its bearish momentum. The $0.966 resistance mark now serves as a significant point of interest, determining whether FET can reverse its current trajectory or continue its descent. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, analyzing technical indicators and market sentiment to gauge the potential for a rebound or further decline. This article aims to analyze the extended bearish trend affecting the digital asset and its impact on the cryptocurrency’s price as it approaches the $0.966 resistance level. FET’s price was trading at around $1.30 and was down by 3.10% with a market capitalization of over $3 billion and a trading volume of over $99 million as of the time of writing. There has been a 24-hour decrease of 3.28% and 29.79% in FET’s market capitalization and trading volume respectively. FET Price Under Bearish Pressure Currently, FET on the 4-hour chart is actively bearish trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the bearish trend line, dropping toward the crucial $0.966 resistance mark. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also confirms more bearishness for FET as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator continue to trend inside the oversold zone. On the 1-day chart, it can be observed that FET is very bearish trading below the 100-day SMA and the trend line. Following a rejection at $1.862, the price of FET has been on an extended bearish move heading toward the $0.966 support level. Lastly, the 1-day composite trend oscillator signals that FET may extend its bearish trend toward the $0.966 support level as the signal line and the SMA are still trending in the oversold zone. Will FET’s Price Breakthrough Or Face A Rejection Conclusively, it can be noted that as the price of FET continues to move toward the $0.966 resistance mark, it may break through its bearishness or face rejection and begin to rise. Therefore, exploring the possible outcomes of the coin, it was discovered that if FET’s price reaches the $0.966 support level and breaks below, it may continue to decline to test the $0.459 level and potentially move on to challenge other lower levels if it breaches the $0.459 level. However, if the crypto asset faces rejection at the $0.966 support level, it will begin to ascend toward the $1.862 resistance level. When this level is breached, it may continue to climb to test the $2.564 resistance level and may move on to test other higher levels if it breaches the $2.564 level.

42417827,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0uT,1720008355,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Falls to $60K as Mt. Gox Overhang Looms,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} fell to $60,000 during the European morning on Wednesday, a drop of 4% in the last 24 hours. BTC was the worst affected amidst a decline across crypto majors. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has fallen nearly 3.3%. The declines came after U.S. spot BTC ETFs snapped a five-day streak of inflows, recording $13 million of outflows on Tuesday. There are also concerns of further selling pressure from distributions by defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. ""The Mt Gox release is also slated to happen this week,"" QCP Capital said. ""This overhang of up to 140,000 BTC should continue to weigh on markets, especially since the exact release schedule is unknown right now.""  U.S. election-themed meme tokens are taking a hit, with several down nearly 95% from peak prices. Solana-based Jeo Boden (BODEN), a play on Joe Biden, has dropped 70% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows. BODEN is now down 80% in the last 30 days, and back to levels last seen in early March, when it was just issued. Even Donald Trump-themed tokens have dropped, despite Trump's electoral chances surging post-debate. The political finance (PoliFi) sector has contracted by 11% in the last 24 hours, contrary to expectations of a rally following the June 27 debate. Austin Freimuth, a research analyst at Messari, has said that the significant event could be Trump's selection of his running mate, should it trigger the creation of new meme coins.  The crypto industry is beginning a major growth phase and is in a far better place than it was two years ago, investment bank Architect Partners said in a quarterly report published last week. The value of the crypto industry climbed more than $750 billion in the first half, the company said. The report described crypto as ""the stepchild of the internet"" and said it ""exceeds the internet's value at the same portion of their respective life cycles."" Crypto and the internet, both of which are disruptive technologies, have very similar characteristics, the report said, noting that the cryptocurrency market is recovering from the so-called crypto winter much faster than the internet rebounded after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows renewed selling in BTC after the bulls failed to establish a foothold above the descending trendline, which characterizes the pullback from $72,000.  The horizontal line from the late April low of $56,500 is the next significant support.

The correlation between the bitcoin price and capital invested has broken down as venture capital activity has struggled to keep up.  Galaxy said allocators may be getting ready to return to the market, which could lead to an increase in venture capital activity in the second half.  The cryptocurrency venture capital market extended its rebound into the second quarter of the year with founders and investors reporting a more active fundraising environment than in previous quarters, Galaxy (GLXY) Research said.  Still, “data still seems slightly less robust than the prevailing sentiment,” analysts Alex Thorn and Gabe Parker wrote in a Tuesday report.  The deal count slipped to 577 from 603 in the first quarter, while capital invested grew to $3.2 billion in the second quarter from $2.5 billion, the report said.  The median deal size rose slightly to $3.2 million, but “median pre-money valuation surged dramatically to near all-time highs” of $37 million, the note observed, suggesting that the resurgence of the cryptocurrency market in recent quarters is leading to “significant competition and fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors.”  Galaxy notes that the correlation between the bitcoin {{BTC}} price and capital invested in crypto startups has broken down, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency has increased significantly since the beginning of January last year while venture capital activity has struggled to keep up.  The successful introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this January and the emergence of Bitcoin layer 2s, combined with regulatory challenges and macro headwinds, have all contributed to this divergence, the note said.  The amount of capital invested has risen year-to-date, but remains well below the levels seen when bitcoin last traded above $60,000, between 2021-22, Galaxy said.  Early-stage companies received 78% of capital in the second quarter, with 20% going to later-stage firms, the report noted. Larger, more generalist venture capital firms have either exited the sector or materially reduced their activity, making it harder for later-stage startups to raise cash.  Due to the resurgence of liquid crypto, allocators may be getting ready to return to the market, which could lead to more venture capital activity in the second half, the report added.

42417815,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0ez,1720005567,TradFi Liquidity Stress Indicator Surges. What Does It Mean for BTC?,"The secured overnight financing rate surged Monday, indicating liquidity stress in the U.S. banking system.  That's a concern for markets in the short term, according to FRNT Financial's David Brickell.  Signs of liquidity stress are emerging in the U.S. banking market, which may not bode well for risky assets such as bitcoin {{BTC}}.  On Monday, the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), which shows how much it costs for banks to borrow cash collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities overnight, rose to 5.4%, matching the six-year high reached on Jan. 2, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The increase is a sign of tighter liquidity and constraints in overnight borrowing, a market dynamic last observed in September 2019, after which the Federal Reserve injected liquidity into the repo market, where institutions borrow and lend money for short periods by using Treasury securities as collateral.  Some observers believe the latest spike in the SOFR is likely to recede in the coming days. For now, however, it could weigh on markets.  ""It is something for the market to worry about in the short term,"" David Brickell, head of international distribution at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial, told CoinDesk. ""There might be some funding stress hangover post the [second] quarter-end. Yet, It's reminiscent of the repo funding rate blow-up we experienced in 2019, We're starting to see the strains of excessive government debt and Treasury bill issuance.""  Brickell added that ultimately, the Fed would need to end the quantitative tightening, or balance sheet contraction, and restart liquidity injections akin to quantitative easing.  ""The financial system can't digest this level of debt without Fed liquidity ... Ultimately, the Fed will soon be back in balance sheet expansion mode as the liquidity provider of last resort,"" Brickel said.  Renewed liquidity support by the Fed could bode well for BTC as it did after the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  Bitcoin has declined by 13% in the past 30 days, decoupling from Nasdaq's continued rally.

42417824,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0oH,1720004794,"Ahead of the U.K. Election, Major Parties Remain Silent on Crypto Issues","The Labour Party is leading the polls, with 42% of voters expressing support, while the Conservatives have 19% according to a June Ipsos poll on voting intentions.  Most leading parties have not mentioned crypto in their election manifestos.  The Labour Party, the favorite to win tomorrow's U.K. general election, has barely mentioned crypto during its campaign, leaving the future of the industry in the country up in the air.  Other than a few words on wanting the country to be a tokenization hub and support digital pound plans, the party has been tight-lipped about crypto.  The topic did not come up during the last debate between Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour's Keir Starmer, which was dominated by welfare, immigration and the relationship with the European Union. While the Conservative government pushed a number of crypto-forward policies, its current manifesto – like those of Labour and the Liberal Democrats – makes no mention of it.  Labour leads in the polls with 42% of voters expressing support. The Conservatives have 19%, according to a June Ipsos survey on voting intentions. When the seats are counted, Starmer is likely to be prime minister with a large majority in Parliament.  The party's manifesto ""referenced a kind of pro-competition environment,"" said Laura Navaratnam, U.K. policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry group. ""It talked about the role of regulators, but all in a broader context. So still, nothing on crypto. But on the plus side, they haven't said anything negative either.""  Instead, the Labour manifesto focuses on economic growth, with plans to invest billions into building supply chains, adding more neighborhood police and cutting waiting times for the National Health Service.  Party representatives did not return CoinDesk's request for comment.  Read more: Labour Wants UK to Be a Securities Tokenization Hub and Advance Digital Pound Work  Not trendy  Roughly half the world's population will vote in general elections this year. In most of the more than 60 nations going to the polls, including South Africa, Croatia, Finland, Lithuania and France, crypto has barely been an issue.  The main exception is the U.S., where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has brought up crypto issues, though crypto was not addressed in the first presidential debate.  ""Looking at all of the manifestos in aggregate, no one mentioned crypto,"" said Jordan Wain, U.K. policy lead at Chainalysis, of the British parties' plans. ""But that kind of makes sense because manifestos are written for the electorate. They are written to show potential voters what that party thinks about wedge issues primarily.""  Health care, national security, crime and the economy are the chief battleground issues, he said.  Say something  Still, crypto industry participants hope the major parties will keep the issue in mind.  George McDonaugh, the co-founder and co-managing director of investment firm KR1, said in a statement that he believes the crypto industry will help ""foster growth and jobs.""  Eleanor Gaywood, head of strategy at Coincover, a protection firm, said it was ""encouraging"" that both Labour and Conservative supported innovation, but said concrete details are necessary. ""After the election, it will take time to gauge the next government's stance on crypto.""  The U.K. was expected to pass legislation to allow the Financial Conduct Authority to regulate stablecoins alongside staking rules. That didn't happen because Sunak called the election earlier than many anticipated.  Those rules are still needed, as are market abuse rules, Wain said. Guidance on the U.K. 's promotion rules is also needed, Navaratnam wrote in an opinion piece. Currently the regulators oversee crypto using the existing anti-money laundering registration regime and promotion rules, but the country needs more, crypto advocates have said.  Read more: U.K.'s Next Government Must Act Fast to Regulate (and Retain) Crypto Firms  It's a question of when will it happen?  The Conservatives have said they wanted the country to be a crypto hub, and last year passed legislation to help regulate the industry as well as measures to make seizing crypto easier in criminal cases. The Treasury Department consulted on how it wanted to regulate crypto and suggested a phased approach that starts with stablecoin legislation.  A Labour government won't necessarily put a halt to the country's crypto ambitions, Navaratnam said.  ""So one would hope that [stablecoin legislation] is a fairly uncontroversial piece of legislation, which is already off the back of something fairly big, i.e. the amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act, would be allowed to carry on in which case we would hope that we will see something in the autumn,"" Navaratnam said.  Chainalysis' Wain said he believes that a lot of the work that has been done by regulators won't just be swept under the rug.  ""A lot of the really important work has been done and it's not been done by the party's themselves, it's been done by government departments, It's been done by the FCA, they're the ones that are formulating legislation,"" he said. ""Whichever party comes in regardless of how quiet or how loud they've been they are not going to sweep all of that hard work off the table, it's not going anywhere.""  The FCA declined to comment.

Prices often experience dramatic swings that can make even the most seasoned investors dizzy. However, recent trends suggest TON might be entering uncharted territory – a period of eerie stability. This unexpected calm has set tongues wagging, with analysts predicting a potential explosion in volatility on the horizon. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market Low Volatility Hints At Brewing Storm Data analytics platform CryptoQuant has released data indicating TON is currently trading near its all-time high. However, unlike previous surges that were characterized by heart-stopping price jumps, this climb has been accompanied by a surprising decrease in volatility. At the time of writing, TON was trading at $7.83 down 2.4% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a 4.7% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Based on this figure, TON is just a few cents away from hitting a new all-time high of $8. Low Volatility Alert will hit $TON soon “Periods of lower volatility are followed by periods of higher volatility… Therefore, based on this chart, it is reasonable to anticipate a volatility expansion.” – By @JA_Maartun Link 👇https://t.co/HYoknuWpnV pic.twitter.com/asaR7IYv7k — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 1, 2024 This is reflected in a chart where a steady price rise sits alongside subdued “blue bars,” presumably representing volatility levels. CryptoQuant analysts interpret this unusual calmness as a sign of a brewing storm. They point to a historical pattern in Toncoin where periods of low volatility have been followed by dramatic price swings, both upwards and downwards. Toncoin Potential Price Surge Based on TON’s historical volatility and CryptoQuant’s analysis of the current low-volatility phase, analysts anticipate a significant increase in volatility in the near future. This prediction is further amplified by separate forecasts suggesting a potential 227% price surge for Toncoin by August 2nd, 2024. The prospect of a dramatic price rise is undoubtedly enticing for investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that the flip side of high volatility is the potential for a sharp price drop. Investor Guidance In A Volatile Market The current phase of Toncoin presents investors with a critical decision point. The token’s low volatility can be seen as a consolidation period, a time when the market gathers strength before a significant price movement, either upwards or downwards. To help investors navigate this potential volatility spike, CryptoQuant recommends utilizing on-chain metrics, which are data points generated by blockchain activity. By analyzing metrics like trading volume, active addresses, and transaction counts, investors can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and potentially predict the direction of the upcoming volatility. Related Reading: Market Expert Sees Big Things For LDO: $6 Price Increase On The Horizon? Looking Beyond CryptoQuant While CryptoQuant’s analysis provides valuable insights, investors should consider incorporating perspectives from other reputable analysts to form a well-rounded view. Consulting technical analysis indicators and price predictions from various sources can offer a more holistic understanding of potential market movements. Additionally, a deeper dive into the on-chain metrics themselves can provide a more granular understanding of market forces influencing TON’s price. This could involve looking at trends in exchange inflows and outflows, the number of new wallets created, and the average transaction size.

Solana-based Jeo Boden (BODEN) meme coin, a play on Joe Biden mixed with Doland Duck, has dropped 70% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows, after the President's “disastrous debate” performance called into question his political future.  BODEN is now down 80% in the last 30 days, and back to levels last seen in early March, when it was just issued.  Even Trump-themed tokens are down, despite Donald Trump's electoral chances surging post-debate.  TRUMP, the largest Trump PoliFi token, is down 10% on-day and 34% in the last week. TREMP, the counterpart to Boden, is also down double digits: nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, and 37% on-week.  Meanwhile, the YES side of a Polymarket contract asking if Biden will drop out of the race topped 60% by Wednesday afternoon Asia time.  As such, most PoliFi memecoins are in the red, with the PoliFi sector contracting by 11% in the last 24 hours. Trading volumes on the betting marketplace Polymarket have increased in tandem, however, suggesting that political bettors have moved over to the platform.  ""Contrary to expectations, top PolitFi memecoins failed to rally following the June 27, 2024, Presidential debate,"" Austin Freimuth, a research analyst at Messari wrote in a recent note shared over email.  Freimuth estimated that Trump's Vice Presidential selection is anticipated to be the next significant event in the PolitFi space.  ""This announcement could potentially trigger the creation of new memecoins related to the chosen running mate,"" he said.

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared insights into the expected timeline for the launch of the first spot Ethereum ETF. According to Geraci, current forecasts by Bloomberg predict a mid-July launch. He detailed the procedural timeline via X, stating, “Wen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th.” In parallel, Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, confirmed to Bloomberg on July 2 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF before the month’s end. Related Reading: ETH Price Dips As Ethereum ETF Approval Faces Delay Kurz emphasized the extensive groundwork laid in collaboration with the SEC, drawing parallels between the proposed Ethereum ETF and Galaxy’s existing spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), created with Invesco. Kurz expressed confidence in their preparedness, remarking, “We know the plumbing, we know the process… The SEC is engaged.” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, aligning with the mid-July expectations. He highlighted the SEC’s recent instructions to Ethereum ETF issuers for amending their S-1 registration forms by July 8, suggesting possible further amendments. Notably, the SEC approved rule changes under 19-b4 in May, facilitating the listing and trading of such funds, though the issuance of funds remained pending final approvals. Ethereum Price Holds Above Key Support The anticipation of these approvals appears to be having a stabilizing effect on Ethereum prices. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, commenting on Ethereum’s current price trajectory via X, noted optimism for a near-term breakout, stating, “ETH – Looking more optimistic for a Q3 breakout. Liking the chances of a run towards $4,000 this or next month.” According to the chart shared by him, ETH price needs to hold the region of $3,300 to $3,350 in order to rally to $4,000. Supporting this sentiment, Cold Blooded Shiller highlighted the crucial need for Ethereum to demonstrate momentum at the current price levels, specifically around the $3,400 mark, as a key indicator for a potential high-time-frame impulse. Related Reading: Ethereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024’s Worst Performer “ETH is still in a fine position but it really needs to start showing some momentum soon. LTF divergences around this $3400 low are probably where I take one stab at trying to capture any HTF impulse away from the consolidation,” he remarked via X. Adding historical perspective, analyst Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) compared the current market phase to Ethereum’s long consolidation in 2016-2017 before its massive rally, urging persistence and optimism: “In 2016-2017, ETH consolidated for 50+ weeks before rallying nearly 12000 percent. Today, people are giving up after less than 20 weeks, with ETH ETFs right around the corner. Stick to the plan boys. The best is yet to come.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,353.

From a seasonality standpoint, July is typically a phenomenal month for GBTC returns. Second only to October during the typical year. Investment capital flow for Bitcoin flipped back to positive in the last week of June, and stablecoin trends may foreshadow a BTC bid. There are serious risks, however. BTC's NVT valuation is astronomical and daily active addresses have been falling rapidly. When I last covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) for Seeking Alpha, I downgraded the fund and cited the ETF's uncompetitive fees relative to similar products in the United States. In the time since the publication of that article, we've seen further fee flight from GBTC culminate in the fund losing the top spot among US-based Bitcoin ETFs measured by BTC AUM: BTC ETF AUM (The Block) It only took about 6 months for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) to dethrone GBTC for largest spot BTC ETF, with over 31k more BTC than Grayscale's offering. Prior to the approval of spot ETFs in the United States, GBTC had over 619k BTC under management. That figure has since collapsed down to about 307k BTC - or roughly 55%. I won't belabor the point here. There are more cost-effective ways to get exposure to Bitcoin than Grayscale's flagship product. Grayscale still charges 1.5% and the market has determined that to be too expensive. Despite its high fees, in this article, we'll explore whether GBTC holders will enjoy capital appreciation anyway due to Bitcoin's fundamental setup. We'll look at network activity, capital flow, Bitcoin seasonality, and valuation. Network Activity One of the primary metrics that I've focused on regarding the health of Bitcoin's network is daily active addresses. Investors can think of this the way they might think of DAUs for an application. Though it should be noted that as a permissionless system, there can be no assurances that active addresses are synonymous with unique users. That said, the trend in daily active addresses for Bitcoin has significantly deteriorated since the launch of spot ETFs in the United States. Daily Active Addresses (30 day avg) (CoinMetrics) At roughly 650k average daily active addresses over the last month, Bitcoin is currently at main chain user levels not seen since the first half of 2019. This is somewhat unique to Bitcoin compared to other high value blockchain networks. In the chart above, I've added the same metric for Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). This multi-year trend is generally positive, with Litecoin's daily active address figures roughly 7-8x higher than early 2019 comparisons. One might posit that Bitcoin's users are simply migrating to scaling networks like Lightning rather than main chain usage. From what I'm observing, this is not the case: Lightning Network Data (mempool.space) It's certainly true that BTC-denominated Lightning Network capacity is trending back up near highs from 2023. However, the number of ""channels"" continues to track lower. This is important because declining channels are indicative of a network that is losing utility rather than gaining it. But the argument can certainly be made that Bitcoin flipped from a digital money system to a capital preservation system. Holding that view, assessing investment capital flow is potentially equally if not more important. Seasonality and Capital Flows The last week of June was the third consecutive week of negative net flow from crypto investment products, according to data from CoinShares. The good news for crypto bulls is the aggregate weekly net flow was down just $30 million. This would seem to imply a slowing of sell pressure on digital assets after what was previously back to back weeks with at least $500 million in negative net flow. Net Flow By Asset (CoinShares/James Butterfill) Breaking the data down by asset, Bitcoin's weekly net flow was actually positive. Multi-asset products experienced positive net flow as well. In fact, if one excludes the $60.7 million outflow from Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), it would have been a positive week for the digital asset space. Of course, none of this data is forward looking. According to data from TrendSpider, July is a seasonally strong month for Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies. GBTC Returns by Month (Trendspider) July has actually been the second best month for GBTC after only October going back the last five years. Four of the five preceding Julys have resulted in a positive return for GBTC shareholders. The same is true for January and March, but at a 15.3% mean, July's average return is stronger than each of those months. Taking these together factors, we're heading into a four-month period where GBTC investors have typically enjoyed two of their best months of positive returns during a given year. Something else to consider is exchange flows for stablecoins. June was the 8th consecutive month of net outflows from exchanges for stablecoins. During July, August, and October last year, stablecoin exchange net flow was positive in each of those three months. Meaning stables were flowing back to exchanges for off-chain activity: Stablecoin Exchange Flows (IntoTheBlock) I see this data as generally counterintuitive relative to things like ETF products for the more broad crypto bull. In this instance, stablecoin outflow from exchanges may actually be a very good thing for on-chain DeFi activity and altcoin swaps because it indicates asset usage rather than redemption. However, positive stablecoin net flow back to exchanges aligns with a seasonal bid for Bitcoin quite well. The theory here is that stablecoin capital flows back to exchanges, where it is used to purchase BTC in anticipation of better returns from BTC capital appreciation than from returns one would expect via on-chain DeFi protocols. Valuation Multiples As sympathetic as I am to the limited supply, possible store of value concept in a debt-based fiat monetary system, I am highly concerned about Bitcoin's collapsing usage and valuation multiple expansion. As I've pointed out via my SA articles many times, there are no real industry standards for valuing native digital assets of public blockchain networks, and BTC is no exception. For smart contract networks like Ethereum or Solana ( SOL-USD ), I think the price to fees ratio makes some sense. In the case of Bitcoin, it is new coin issuance rather than fees that is mainly driving miner compensation. So I don't think the P/F ratio is as relevant for Bitcoin specifically. However, one valuation multiple that I do like when assessing Bitcoin is the NVT ratio, or network value to transactions ratio. This figure divides the market capitalization of the coin by the USD-denominated volume that is transmitted over the blockchain daily. Again, there is no real rule pertaining to what is expensive and what is cheap. That said, looking at these metrics with 30 day averages and relative peers and prior periods can offer some signals. NVT Ratio (30 day avg) (CoinMetrics) At a 30-day average NVT ratio of 218, Bitcoin is the most overvalued it has been based on this ratio since September 2010. To put that in context, the last time BTC was this overvalued based on 30 day NVT, it was 4 months after ""Pizza Day."" And compared to a network like Litecoin, the divergence from historical norms is crystal clear. Bitcoin is commanding a 300% premium to the NVT ratio of what is, frankly, a very similar digital asset. Investor Takeaways We're seeing the impact of BTC supply moving to the balance sheets of companies like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and to spot ETF products. On one hand, this explains the surge in Bitcoin's NVT ratio and the decline in network usage. There will almost certainly come a time when NVT will have to correct lower. That can either happen from lower BTC prices or from an improvement in value transacted over the network. My preference would be the latter, but I think investors would be wise to acknowledge that the former is just as possible. Despite problems with both usage and multiple expansion, I suspect we will begin to see more capital flow to Bitcoin over the next several months as both seasonality and anti-fiat ethos potentially make BTC an attractive option as a hedge against election uncertainty in the United States and interest rate cuts globally with inflation figures still well ahead of 2%. I think BTC is a buy on weakness, and GBTC holders will be beneficiaries of appreciation in coin prices. That said, I wouldn't personally hold GBTC for a sustained period of time as long as Grayscale continues to charge 1.5%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702197-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-seasonality-says-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30331633.jpeg

After a stellar run, the past week saw LDO plummet 24%, mirroring the broader cryptocurrency market’s turbulence. However, amidst the dip, a sense of cautious optimism flickers among investors, fueled by potential market shifts and bullish whispers from industry gurus. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market Lido’s Prominent Role In Ethereum Staking LDO’s recent price tumble isn’t a solo act. The entire cryptocurrency market has been dancing to the tune of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price swings. As the king of crypto briefly climbed out of its recent slump, it injected a much-needed dose of confidence into the market, potentially benefiting altcoins like LDO, which is deeply integrated into Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. But the spotlight isn’t solely on Bitcoin. The much-anticipated arrival of Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) has also ignited a spark of optimism. These financial instruments are expected to attract a wave of institutional and retail investments into the Ethereum space. Given LDO’s prominent role in Ethereum staking, this influx of capital could act as a catalyst for its recovery and propel it past its recent losses. LDO Price Predictions Technical indicators might be painting a mixed picture, with some suggesting ongoing market volatility, but some analysts are throwing caution to the wind and placing their bets on LDO. Renowned analyst Javon Marks isn’t shying away from a bold prediction. $LDO (Lido DAO) continues to hold well broken out here with a target at $5.809!

His forecast is music to the ears of LDO bulls, projecting a price target of a staggering $5.809, a staggering 192% increase from current levels. Marks isn’t the only one singing a bullish tune. Various price prediction services are echoing his optimism, foreseeing significant gains for LDO in the near future. Their forecasts, however, come with a caveat: a sustained positive market momentum is crucial for LDO to reach a potential price surge of over 200% by August 2nd, 2024. Volatility Vs. Opportunity The coming weeks will be a delicate dance between navigating market volatility and seizing promising opportunities. The success of Ethereum ETFs and the resilience of Bitcoin will undoubtedly shape LDO’s trajectory. Investors are being advised to tread carefully, carefully evaluating these factors and considering their risk tolerance before taking the plunge.

42417830,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0vV,1719993679,Pre-ETF Ether Options Trend Mirrors BTC Except for One Key Difference,"Ether's options market shows a bullish bias over the 30-day and six-month period ahead of the ETF launch, mirroring bitcoin market trends in January.  Ether's market, however, shows no signs of bullish euphoria.  The measured bullish sentiment might lead to ether outperformance later.  The much-anticipated U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETF) that directly invest in ether {{ETH}} are expected to begin trading in mid-July.  Ahead of the debut, trends in the ether options market on Deribit closely mirror the sentiment in bitcoin {{BTC}} options in the lead-up to the BTC ETFs six months ago, except for one key difference that may be pivotal to traders.  At press time, ether's 30-day options skew, which measures what traders are willing to pay for an asymmetric payout in the upward or downward direction, held around 3%, according to Amberdata.  The positive value indicated a willingness to pay relatively more for call options, offering buyers an asymmetric payout in the upward direction over the next four weeks. A call gives the holder the right to buy an underlying asset at a preset price within a specific time frame and represents a bullish bet. A put represents a bearish bet.  Ether calls expiring in six months also traded at a premium relative to puts, with the skew hovering at around 5%.  In other words, traders are using options to position for ether strength heading into the ETF debut and over the next six months. Traders pursued a similar strategy roughly two weeks before BTC ETFs began trading on Jan. 11. In early January, BTC's 30-day and 180-day skews were around 3.5% and 5%, respectively.  The bullish positioning in the ether market is consistent with expectations that spot ether ETFs, which allow investors to take exposure to the asset without owning it, will unlock mainstream institutional demand worth billions of dollars. BTC ETFs have attracted net inflows of over $14 billion to date, per Farside Investors.  ""The upcoming ETH ETF launches are likely to have a much more material impact in ETH as it brings a new wave of investors. With ETH's supply being highly concentrated in long-term players, ETF inflows could have an outsized effect if they are proportionally as large as the one's Bitcoin received,"" analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter.  Sell the fact?  Bitcoin's 30-day options skew flipped bearish on Jan. 10, signaling a renewed bias for puts in a sign of traders prepping for a classic sell-the-fact pullback after the debut of ETFs.  BTC's price did fall by over 15% by Jan. 23, testing lows under $40,000 before rallying to new record highs above $70,000 in March.  So, ether traders might want to watch for a potential bearish flip in the 30-day options skew in the next few days.  No signs of euphoria  The one difference in how ether options are currently priced compared to bitcoin in January suggests the ether market is not as euphoric as BTC was seven months ago. That perhaps weakens the case for a sell-the-fact pullback.  BTC's seven-day skew showed a stronger bias for calls than the 30-day skew several times ahead of the ETF debut, a sign of heightened optimism or expectations of a price increase soon.  Usually, investors expect higher uncertainty or volatility in the distant future compared to the near term, ensuring longer duration skews return a higher value than shorter ones. That's the case in the ether market, where the 7-day skew remains below the 30-day skew, exhibiting a relatively measured bullish bias.  Note that the broader market mood is more somber than in late 2023 and early January. Ether has declined from $4,000 to $3,350 since late May, having failed to keep pace with bitcoin's rally to new record highs in the first quarter.  That's probably because several analysts are unsure the demand for ether ETFs will match the benchmark set by bitcoin ETFs. ""Bitcoin had the first mover advantage, potentially saturating the overall demand for crypto assets in response to spot ETF approvals,” analysts at JPMorgan, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said in May, adding that ether ETFs could see $3 billion in net inflows this year.  According to Ilan Solot, senior global market strategist at Marex Solutions, the pessimism might actually lead to ether outperformance.  ""The ubiquitous pessimism is a strong set-up for outperformance. Same for the sell the news strategy, many will try to replay from the BTC ETF,"" Solot said in an email.  ""However, I fear many inflow predictions could be over-benchmarked by comparing them to the BTC ETF numbers (like “ETH will attract 20% of BTC ETF inflows”). The prevalence of delta-neutral trades [carry trades] may muddle the comparison and overestimate potential price impacts.""  8:52 UTC: Corrects Solot's title to senior global market strategist.

42417823,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa0pJ,1719992899,Bitcoin Sinks Under $61K as One Trader Sticks to $150K Prediction This Year,"Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies experienced sharp declines during Asian trading hours, reversing gains made earlier in the week.  The price drop was attributed partly to concerns of large BTC sales from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange, which is set to distribute assets stolen in a 2014 hack later this month.  One trader continues to predict a BTC price of $150,000 this year, despite the short-term turbulence.  Bitcoin (BTC) led declines in Asian trading hours as major tokens wiped out gains made at the start of the week.  BTC dropped to $60,900 from over $62,000 shortly after Tokyo markets opened, with losses of up to 3% across ether {{ETH}}, Solana's SOL and dogecoin {{DOGE}}. XRP was little changed while Cardano's ADA pared some gains from a Tuesday rally as its development foundation published certain indicators to comply with European regulatory requirements.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the biggest tokens, has fallen more than 1.7% in the past 24 hours.  The declines came as U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking bitcoin recorded outflows of $13 million, breaking a five-day streak of inflows.  Concerns that large BTC sales would follow distributions by the defunct Mt. Gox exchange probably contributed to bearish sentiment, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast on Tuesday,  ""The Mt Gox release is also slated to happen this week,"" QCP Capital said. ""This overhang of up to 140,000 BTC should continue to weigh on markets, especially since the exact release schedule is unknown right now.""  Mt. Gox will start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack in July 2024, after years of postponed deadlines. The repayments will be made in bitcoin and bitcoin cash, and could possibly add selling pressure to both markets, as previously reported.

The first tranche will include a residential project, Keturah Reserve, which is being built by MAG in Meydan, Dubai. The tranche will also package a $75 million mega-mansion at ‘The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Dubai, Creekside’ development, part of the Keturah Resort.  Investors will earn yield through stablecoins and Mantra's OM token. They are expected to have receive yields of 8% from the stablecoins and be granted additional OM tokens.  ""The specifics of the yield, such as which stablecoin will be used and the amount of OM to be allocated, are under discussion among MAG and Mantra,"" the companies said, adding that they will start the final discussions in the coming weeks.

30327210,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627530,1719990041,"Cardano Breaks Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern, Analyst Predicts 70% Rally For ADA","Cardano (ADA) has correlated with the broader market, experiencing a retracement from its yearly high of $0.810 in March to as low as $0.357 on June 22. However, ADA has now deviated from the struggles of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), exhibiting a 2% increase in the past 24 hours and over 12% in the past two weeks. Explosive Rally For Cardano Intriguingly, technical analysts believe that ADA could be on the verge of an explosive rally in the coming weeks, potentially retesting its yearly high and setting the stage for a surge above the $1 mark. Crypto analyst Captain Fabik points to the confirmed Falling Wedge Breakout on ADA’s daily chart, with the token surpassing the crucial $0.407 price mark on Tuesday. Fabik predicts a bullish rally of approximately 70% for ADA in the coming months, envisioning a price around $0.704, just below the yearly high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Slow Down Selling In July, What This Could Mean For Price Echoing this sentiment, optimistic users anticipate a solid bullish rally for ADA, expecting a move toward the $0.80 mark shortly, citing the formed Falling Wedge pattern. However, not all analysts share the same level of bullishness. Crypto Bullet offers a more cautious perspective. While acknowledging potential price increases for ADA, Crypto Bullet does not foresee new all-time highs in this bull cycle. Instead, Crypto Bullet suggests that the highest ADA can reach during this cycle is the 0.786 Fibonacci level. The analyst sets macro targets at $1.15 and $1.80, highlighting the current gap of over 86% from ADA’s all-time high of $3.09 during the 2021 bull run. Bullish Sentiment Surrounds ADA Cardano (ADA), currently boasting a market capitalization of $14.6 million, shows further technical indicators on its daily chart, suggesting a bullish continuation of the current uptrend. Market expert Jesse Olson highlights the pending buy signal on the daily chart of ADA, accompanied by bullish targets set for the token. Indicators signaling this bullish sentiment include a bullish divergence, a buy signal on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and a bullish crossover on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Indicator (MACD). Analyzing the chart, Olson predicts a continuous climb for ADA’s price, initially targeting the $0.470 mark, followed by a move just below the $0.550 level. According to the analysis, the ultimate price target is $0.650. However, despite mounting bullish predictions, several resistance levels remain to be overcome. As ADA currently trades at $0.415, the token faces its first challenge at the $0.418 mark in weeks. On its path to the $0.600 level, Cardano’s native token will encounter key resistance walls at $0.438, $0.503, $0.517, and $0.590. The ADA must overcome these notable hurdles to reclaim previously lost levels. Related Reading: 36% Explosion! ENS Coin Steals The Spotlight In The Crypto Market As the bullish sentiment grows, attention turns to the upcoming Chang upgrade, which is set to deploy a new set of governance features to Cardano.

Bitcoin MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands Put Resistance At $65,800 In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed some price levels for Bitcoin that could be important based on an on-chain pricing model. The model is based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio is a popular indicator that, in short, keeps track of the ratio between the value the Bitcoin investors are holding right now (the market cap) and what they initially used to purchase their coins (the realized cap). This metric tells us about the profit/loss situation of the market as a whole. Related Reading: PEPE Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $14.7 Million Stack From Binance Now, a pricing model called the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands uses standard deviations from the all-time mean of the MVRV ratio to determine significant price levels for the cryptocurrency.

The chart’s yellow line in the middle represents the price level at which the MVRV ratio would become equal to its all-time mean. At present, this level is equal to around $52,900. The level above this line, colored in orange, corresponds to +0.5 standard deviation (SD) above the indicator’s mean. Currently, the cryptocurrency’s spot price is under this mark, implying that the MVRV ratio’s deviation is smaller than +0.5 SD. Ali notes that this level, corresponding to +0.5 SD, at about $65,800, is “one of the most crucial resistance areas” for Bitcoin. The graph shows that Bitcoin struggled to break above this level during retests in December 2023 and January 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Q3 Rally Possible As Miner Selloff Finishes, Quant Says The analyst says that if BTC can break past this resistance, the $78,700 mark, corresponding to +1 SD from the MVRV ratio mean, could be the next significant target. Historically, tops in the asset have become more probable to form when the MVRV ratio has deviated above this line. The all-time high (ATH) price earlier in the year, which continues to be the rally’s peak, also occurred soon after the asset rose above this level. From the current spot price of Bitcoin, a surge towards this potential target of $78,700 would suggest an increase of more than 27% for the cryptocurrency. Before the asset could dream of retesting this level, it would need to break past the $65,800 resistance. BTC Price Bitcoin surged past the $63,800 level yesterday but has seen a setback in the past 24 hours, as its price has now dropped to $61,800.

This sets the stage for a future trial about NFTs as securities.  A U.S. Judge in Massachusetts has denied a move by DraftKings to dismiss a class action lawsuit brought on by buyers of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The suit alleges that the tokens are investment contracts, setting the stage for a future court battle on whether NFTs are securities. DraftKings offers sports-themed NFTs on its marketplace via the Polygon blockchain.  Justin Dufoe, a buyer, first filed suit against DraftKings, on behalf of other owners in March 2023, alleging that these NFTs met the prongs for the Howey test.  In this recent ruling, a court agreed that DraftKings' NFTs involved an investment of money, pooled assets into a common enterprise with shared risks and profits, and created a reasonable expectation of profit from DraftKings' efforts, thus plausibly classifying them as securities under the Howey test.  It is plausibly alleged that the NFTs' values were dependent on the success of the DraftKings Marketplace, the court found, noting that the value moves in tandem with interest in that specific marketplace, an issue that has been addressed in prior cases examining NFTs.  Dapper Labs faced a similar case  All this comes after Dapper Labs agreed in June to pay $4 million to settle a similar class action suit. It was reported earlier by Fortune that the SEC had once launched an investigation into Dapper Labs but closed it in September 2023.  However, the difference between Dapper Labs' NFTs and those offered by DraftKings is that Dapper used the Flow blockchain while DraftKings issues its tokens on Polygon.  The use of Flow, a chain developed by Dapper Labs that was spun off in October 2021, the court decided, means Dapper Labs runs a higher risk of violating securities laws because that created a dependency on Dapper’s managerial efforts and success, satisfying the Howey test criteria of a common enterprise and expectation of profit.  A date to continue the DraftKings class action suit has not yet been set.

Investigations are ongoing into the attack, which is suspected to have been caused by a private key leakage, and Bittensor has been put into ""safe mode"" to prevent further transactions until more information is available.  The Bittensor blockchain was temporarily halted early Wednesday as team members detected an attack on several user wallets, with at least one wallet drained of $8 million worth of the project’s TAO tokens.  TAO prices dropped as much as 15% in the aftermath of the attack, but slightly recovered as core members said steps were in place to mitigate further mishaps.  “We are investigating, and in an abundance of caution, have recently fully halted transactions on-chain until there is more information available to us about the nature of this attack,” a Bittensor core team member wrote on the project’s Discord channel.  Later, co-founder Ala Shaabana confirmed on X that the chain was put on “safe mode,” meaning blocks were getting produced but no transactions were being processed. Blockchain trackers for the Bittensor network show the latest transactions and blocks were processed at or around 23:00 UTC on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, independent security researcher @ZachXBT said on his Telegram channel that one user was drained of 32,000 TAO, worth $8 million at the time, and suspected a private key leakage that led to the attack. A private key is a string of letters and numbers that acts as a password to protect and manage tokens in a wallet.  Investigations for the attack are ongoing as of Wednesday morning.

The project recently announced the beginning of the migration process with the delisting of Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and SingularityNET (AGIX) from crypto exchanges. However, FET is facing some pressure following its rebranding and supply update. Related Reading: Ethereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024’s Worst Performer ASI Token Merger Phase 1 Begins On July 1, the ASI alliance and Fetch.AI (FET) announced the multi-token merger to unify OCEAN, AGIX, and FET. As part of phase 1, withdrawals and deposits with OCEAN and AGIX would close in preparation for the migration to FET. Additionally, the delisting process from crypto exchanges would begin for the two tokens. Meanwhile, FET would continue to trade as usual, with spot and perpetual trading continuing under the same tricker. The initial phase of the merger aims to “onboard exchanges and data aggregators for a smooth transition.” Fetch.AI saw a rebrand across platforms. The project took the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance name and logo but kept its ticker. Moreover, the ASI alliance opened a migration platform on the SingularityDAO dApp to help users migrate their tokens. Some crypto exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, revealed they would not support customers on the ASI token merger. Kraken announced that the trading of OCEAN and FET will continue to be supported on the platform until further notice. The exchange also noted that users must withdraw their tokens to a self-custodial wallet to migrate them. Similarly, Coinbase informed its users that it chose to “not execute the migration of these assets on behalf of users.” Both exchanges also clarified they would not support the eventual migration from FET to ASI. FET Retraces Following Rebrand After updating the token’s name, supply, and market capitalization, FET flipped Render (RNDR) in the AI tokens sector. According to CoinMarketCap data, the token is now the 27th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with $3.38 billion. Following the rebrand, FET’s price dropped similarly to when the token merger delay news was released. At the time, the merging tokens saw an 8-10% price decline following the rescheduling of the merger. The delay was attributed to logistical and technical issues. FET fell from the $1.4 support zone on Monday to $1.27, a 9.7% drop in 12 hours. However, the AI token has recovered the $1.3 mark, currently trading at $1.33, representing a 3.6% decline in the last 24 hours. Some market watchers found this performance disappointing. Some investors believe it might be best not to get involved until the merger is completed. Sjuul Follings, crypto trader and founder of Alt Crypto Games expressed his disappointment with the token’s recent fakeout. Per the trader, he was optimistic about the late June price action, believing the token was about to break out and expand ahead of the ASI alliance. Nonetheless, FET could not reclaim the $1.8 support zone and retraced to the $1.4 support level over the weekend. Related Reading: Baked Or Burned?

ADA is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $0.4225. ADA price started a fresh increase and traded above $0.420. The price is trading above $0.4120 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There are two key bullish trend lines forming with support at $0.4120 and $0.4080 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless there is a close below the $0.40 support zone. Cardano Price Gains Traction In the past few days, Cardano started a decent increase from the $0.3800 support zone. ADA climbed above the $0.40 and $0.4050 resistance levels, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. It even cleared the $0.420 resistance and tested $0.4225. A high was formed at $0.4225 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the $0.4220 and $0.4200 support levels.

There are also two key bullish trend lines forming with support at $0.4120 and $0.4080 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. If there is another upward move, the price might face resistance near the $0.420 zone. The first resistance is near $0.4225. The next key resistance might be $0.4450. If there is a close above the $0.4450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.4850 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.50. Downside Correction in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.4225 resistance level, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.4120 level. The next major support is near the $0.4080 level and the second trend line.

30320151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627537,1719979220,ETH Price Dips As Ethereum ETF Approval Faces Delay,"Ethereum (ETH) price has encountered a setback after briefly surpassing the $3,500 mark on Monday, dropping once again to the $3,400 support level on Tuesday. The delay stems from the expected full approval by the SEC for Ethereum ETF applications, which have now been postponed to July 8. SEC Requests Revised Filings Analysts had initially anticipated approval by July 2, but the SEC has requested issuers to submit revised filings by July 8. Bloomberg ETF expert Erich Balchunas shared on social media that the SEC took additional time to provide feedback, resulting in a revised timeline. Balchunas stated: Unfort think we gonna have to push back our over/under till after holiday. Sounds like SEC took extra time to get back to ppl this wk (altho again very light tweaks) and from what I hear next wk is dead bc holiday = July 8th the process resumes and soon after that they’ll launch Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Slow Down Selling In July, What This Could Mean For Price SEC Chair Gary Gensler previously indicated that Ethereum ETFs would likely receive approval by “the end of the summer.” The SEC is currently reviewing and approving the S-1 forms, which represent the second step in launching spot Ethereum ETFs. Despite the delay, asset managers remain optimistic about the SEC greenlighting the first US spot Ethereum ETF applications that directly invest in Ether, with expectations set for mid-July. A recent Bloomberg report highlighted the constructive dialogue between asset managers and the regulator. Ethereum ETF Launch Inches Closer Per the report, the regulator’s feedback provided minor questions that issuers are currently addressing. In May, the SEC approved the proposal by exchanges to list these products, requiring a separate approval for their launch. Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, predicted the approval of an Ethereum ETF within the next couple of weeks. Galaxy Digital has filed for an Ether ETF, and Kurz expressed confidence in the process, emphasizing their familiarity with the requirements based on their experience with the Bitcoin ETF. Several prominent firms, including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, 21Shares, and Invesco, have filings awaiting approval. The disclosure of fees on the respective funds is a necessary step before trading commences. Assuming the funds receive a green light, one key question remains: Will Ether portfolios generate a similar level of demand as the historic debut of US spot-Bitcoin ETFs in January, which accumulated $52 billion in assets? $15 Billion In Inflows Within First 18 Months As previously reported by NewsBTC, Ethereum ETFs may attract significant inflows in the first few months of trading, although they may not have the same volume of inflows as the newly approved Bitcoin ETF market. In a note to investors Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Matt Hougan projected that these ETFs could see $15 billion in net inflows within their first 18 months of trading. To arrive at this estimate, Hougan considered the market capitalizations of Bitcoin and Ethereum, expecting investors to allocate to their respective exchange-traded products (ETPs) proportionally. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Beat The Odds And Fly To $300,000 By 2025? Hougan pointed out that US investors have already invested $56 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETPs, and he anticipates this figure to reach $100 billion or more by the end of 2025. Drawing from this reference, he determined that Spot Ethereum ETFs would need to attract $35 billion in assets to match the Bitcoin ETFs, a process that could take around 18 months. Additionally, he noted that the Spot Ethereum ETFs would launch with $10 billion in assets, thanks to the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,418, recording significant losses in the monthly time frame amounting to over 9%.

The Wall Street strategist highlighted Bitcoin’s strong bullish outlook, believing that the cryptocurrency will eventually pull out of bearish trends soon. Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 In 2024 In a recent interview with CNBC Television, Lee expressed bullish optimism over Bitcoin’s future outlook, reaffirming his previous prediction that the cryptocurrency would reach new all-time highs of $150,000 by the end of 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Place $500 Million In Spot BTC Bids Below Market Price Earlier in May, Lee made a bullish forecast for Bitcoin, anticipating a dramatic surge to $150,000 before the year ends. At the time, the Fundstrat head of research attributed his ambitious forecast to the cooling down of inflation in the United States (US) and a subsequent increase in the demand for BTC. However, now Lee adds that BTC could witness a sharp rebound following the conclusion of Mt Gox’s Bitcoin repayment process to creditors. During the interview, Lee suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin redistribution by Mt Gox might be driving the bearish pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Earlier in June, Mt Gox disclosed that it would officially start its $9 billion worth of BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) repayment plans in July. The redistribution will see creditors being refunded and compensated for the Bitcoin exchange’s hack attack in 2014. With $9 billion worth of BTC and BCH set to flood the market, speculations are rising concerning potential sell-offs from creditors. This sentiment has led to BTC’s downward spiral, triggering stronger selling pressures from investors. Bitcoin’s price also fell below $60,000 at some point, recording even more declines as miners sold off their holdings to purchase more effective mining tools. Lee believes that following any Gox’s repayment process, Bitcoin may have a “pretty sharp rebound” in the second half of the year. Bearish Trends May Be Over For BTC Bitcoin price has successfully crossed the $60,000 threshold and is now trading at $62,523, as of writing. Since early June, the cryptocurrency has experienced a sharp downward trend, crashing by up to 20% due to the substantial outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, Bitcoin may be getting ready for a fresh upside as analysts foresee a major rebound as miners’ selling pressure cool off and the broader crypto market stabilizes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Major Bullish Signal On 3-Day Chart, Here’s The Target Particularly, on-chain market intelligence platform, CryptoQuant has projected a potential upside for Bitcoin in the third quarter of 2024 (Q3). Furthermore, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has expressed bullish sentiment for BTC’s price prospects. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Martinez highlighted Bitcoin’s underperformance in the previous month, describing this bearish event as a “negative June.” Despite the downtrend, the analyst foresees a strong rebound for Bitcoin in July, with an average return of 7.98% and a possible price increase to $63,200 or $63,800.

BTC is now correcting gains and might revisit the $60,850 support. Bitcoin started a downside correction from the $63,650 resistance zone. The price is trading below $62,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $61,850 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might struggle to start a fresh increase above the $62,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price struggled to extend gains above the $63,650 and $63,800 resistance levels. A high was formed at $63,798 and the price started a downside correction. The price declined below the $63,000 level. The bears were able to push it below the $62,500 level and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was also a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $59,951 swing low to the $63,798 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $62,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $61,850 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The bulls are now trying to protect the $61,400 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $59,951 swing low to the $63,798 high. If there is another increase, the price could face resistance near the $61,850 level and the trend line. The first key resistance is near the $62,250 level. The next key resistance could be $62,500. A clear move above the $62,500 resistance might start a steady increase and send the price higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $63,250 resistance. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $63,650 resistance in the near term. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $62,250 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $61,400 level. The first major support is $60,850. The next support is now forming near $60,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $61,400, followed by $60,850.

Bollinger Bands Signal 200% Bitcoin Surge According to the analyst, the Bitcoin weekly Bollinger Band, a statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time, has shrunk to its second-lowest width in six years. Traditionally, such contraction has been a precursor to substantial price movements. Related Reading: Market Analysts Eye July for Potential Big Wins in Bitcoin and Ethereum — Here’s Why Wise advice disclosed that historically, a similar constriction was observed before Bitcoin surged 200% from a base of $24,000 to a high peak within five months. This indicator is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that market volatility is about to increase, potentially leading to a significant price rise. For context, Bollinger Bands are a set of trend indicators derived from a moving average and an upper and lower band, each set at a standard deviation from the moving average. This tool helps traders to assess how high or low the current price is relative to previous trades. A narrowing of these bands typically indicates a reduction in volatility. A sharp increase or decrease often follows it in price, as the market prepares to make a substantial move. Bitcoin Holders, Read this 🚨 The #Bitcoin weekly Bollinger band is now at its 2nd lowest level in 6 years. The last time it was this low, #BTC was trading at $24K, and it pumped 200% in just 5 months pic.twitter.com/jnud3pCjAr — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 1, 2024 Recent Market Activity and Bullish Outlook Despite a promising setup, Bitcoin has recently struggled to maintain its upward momentum. Over the past week, while there has been a modest 3% recovery, the price has faced resistance, peaking at $63,790 before dipping to around $62,563. This recent price action occurs amid broader market anticipation of a favorable July. Market analysts, including the team at QCP Capital, reference historical data showing Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound in July with an average return of 9.6%, especially after weak performances in June. This pattern of a strong July following a weak June is supported by additional market commentary. They are not alone in their optimism; other market analysts like Ali have also noted similar recovery patterns in past post-June slumps, hinting at a strong comeback in July. Supporting the bullish sentiment are the substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This Monday, these funds recorded daily net inflows totaling $129.45 million, marking the fifth consecutive day of positive flows and the most substantial intake since early June.

She explains that this is happening not just technically but fundamentally as well. A possible decoupling is bullish for the XRP price, given that it would be the start of a major price rally. Using the 1-Week chart, the crypto analyst highlights some technical developments that could be important to this possible decoupling. The first of these is that XRP is still testing the “Wedge resistance with the aim of breaking it.” Also, RLinda points out that volatility is decreasing as the consolidation is continuing at this point. However, this consolidation could be the reason that the price begins another rally. As for where the price could go from here, the crypto analyst points out that it could possibly rally as high as $0.6265 and even reach $0.73 by the time it is done. However, XRP must hold the support level at $0.4637 while breaking the resistances being mounting at $0.4962 and $0.5720. Factors Holding Price Down While XRP price continues to be one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market, a number of factors have suppressed. The major one is the lawsuit mentioned above. Even though Ripple has scored multiple victories against the regulator during this time, the fact that the lawsuit is yet to be officially over continues to present a major hurdle. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 45% Drop For Bitcoin, But Says It Won’t Go Below This Level In her analysis, RLinda points to these issues as being behind the price not performing well. However, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said that he expects the lawsuit and settlement to be complete by the end of this summer. This puts it sometime before September. If this happens, then it would mark a pivotal point for the turnouts in the XRP price. “The Ripple vs. SEC case is a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation, as a final victory would be a strong green sign for the entire cryptocurrency community amidst the SEC getting a number of restrictions on its activities lately due to overstepping its authority,” the analyst said.
