42424911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX25h,1369925834,What happens to Bitcoin if the lights go out?,"While it’s a robust protocol online, Bitcoin might not be so resilient (or, dare we say it, “antifragile”?) in the non-digital world.  What does that mean? It means that Bitcoin – like the internet itself – is dependent upon functioning global networks, reliable power supplies and standing cellphone towers. Switch off the routers and transformers, and knock down the towers, and Bitcoin has a problem.  Imagine, for example, trying to conduct local commerce with bitcoins in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy. People did get creative when it came to finding ways to keep their smartphones charged in the days and weeks following the Oct. 29, 2012, storm, but it wasn’t always easy.  So the question of how to keep a future Bitcoin economy functional after a natural disaster isn’t a purely academic one: these situations do arise – and have arisen – causing a lot of inconvenience, and frustration along the way. In a system where plain old paper cash and coin are still an option, even people with no heat or lights at home and no gas in the car can usually hoof it to the nearest convenience store to shop with their flashlights on and buy a few cans of Spaghetti-O’s, crackers and Spam.  It’s something to consider as a large coastal population in the Northern Hemisphere currently prepares to usher in Hurricane Season 2013 (set to start Saturday (June 1), and expected to be a doozy).  A March 2013 survey of nearly 8,400 residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut found that three-quarters of them went without power for at least one day after Sandy … “with a median of seven days.” Almost as many – 73 percent – reported losing TV and internet service after the storm.  Repeat that in a world where most people depend upon working smartphones and network communications to buy and sell stuff, and it could prove really difficult to nab much-needed bottled water or toilet paper following a disaster.  There’s actually a name for the fear that technophiles face in such situations: nomophobia, the fear of being out of mobile phone contact. Whether that affliction is more a state of being inconvenienced than real-life pathology isn’t a question we’ll take on here. NJ.com writer Allan Hoffmann, however, concluded after Sandy that it’s basically a “first world problem” … and that a dose of “digital isolation” once in a while might be the cure.  It’s also interesting to note that one of the reasons so many Sandy victims temporarily lost their links to the digital world is that mobile phone companies serving the Northeast US had resisted the Federal Communications Commission’s efforts to encourage them to make better emergency preparations. Yes, ultimately, wireless access to the internet hinges upon a certain amount of regulatory oversight … even though those two words (“regulatory” and “oversight”) are anathema to some in the Bitcoin community.  What, then, to make of Verizon Communication’s fight against “net neutrality” on the basis of free speech? That is, the company argues that government cannot prevent an internet service company from choosing to provide faster network speeds and access to some customers over others. Could that ultimately mean some peers on the peer-to-peer network are more equal than others?  So maybe a hurricane could kick you out of the Bitcoin economy temporarily, or a network service provider could reset its preferences and slow down some types of e-commerce. Still manageable in the long run, right? But what about a bigger assault on the system … like one by Mother Nature?  Solar storms – giant flares or coronal mass ejections – have been known to mess with radio, satellite and electrical transmissions here on Earth. The big ones don’t happen often, and that’s something to be grateful for.  The most recent solar superstorm, sometimes called the Carrington Event, occurred in late August and early September of 1859 ... long before Bitcoin, 4G, mobile computing or the internet. There were telegraph systems, though, and these failed across Europe, North America and even Australia. Some telegraph operators reported sparks flying from their equipment, sometimes setting off fires.  Today, with our homes, workplaces and shops more connected than ever in myriad ways, a similar event could “devastate” the modern world, warned the National Geographic.  “We live in a cyber cocoon enveloping the Earth,” said Daniel Baker, a researcher with the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, said in the article. “Imagine what the consequences might be.”  Baker imagined just that in a National Research Council report on solar storm risks. Those risks, he said, include transformers across the power grid being destroyed by power surges … not just here and there, but possibly by the hundreds. Being neither cheap nor off-the-shelf, these transformers could take months and months to replace across large swaths of the globe.  “Imagine large cities without power for a week, a month, or a year,” Baker said. “The losses could be $1 (trillion) to $2 trillion, and the effects could be felt for years.”  The possibility of something like this might not keep most Bitcoiners awake at night, but it is something that’s occurred to some. In a Bitcoin Forum thread titled “Do Bitcoins need something REAL to back them?” the conversation veered from gold to the zombie apocalypse to, eventually, electricity:  “Gold/fiat do have one advantage over bitcoin ... you can still trade with them when the lights go out,” noted forum member AlphaWolf. “Don’t get me wrong, I think Bitcoin is superior in many ways ... but imagine a world that trades exclusively in Bitcoin, and then imagine an EMP strike anywhere. We are close to this being an issue already with fiat being exchanged almost exclusively electronically, of course. I believe the smart course of action is ‘diversify’.”  He added, “Just as valid would be a major blackout, such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003 (and also 1965) in the US, or the 2012 India Blackout, or 2003 Italy Blackout... or any of the others on this list:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_power_outages#Largest  . With fiat, there exists the possibility that you could drive to another city with power, and extract some paper money from a bank. Bitcoin needs an easier way to transact physically, in person, even when the network if offline or inaccessible. Pretty big challenge ... given that the strength of Bitcoin *is* the network.”  Image credit: Flickr",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/30/what-happens-to-bitcoin-if-the-lights-go-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/533179f189825fe7bcc08d67d4b66485635a1d3d-640x298.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0J0,1369921279,Will the 'currency' of personal data win over Bitcoin?,"Money isn't what it used to be, writes Minyanville macroeconomics regular ""Professor Pinch."" And it probably won't ever again be what it used to be.  In a column published Wednesday, the professor begins by noting that Bitcoin is currently ""big"" simply because ""it's never been done before."" Part science fiction, part gold, Bitcoin, he writes, appeals to ""folks who mistrust government, central banks, and well, pretty much most of the rest of the world.""  Both gold and Bitcoin reflect a ""me, here, now"" philosophy, the professor writes. The problem with both those commodities, though, he notes, arises with the idea of credit. Credit, he argues, requires trust ... while the appeal of Bitcoin and gold is more in the ""every man for himself"" camp.  So is there even room for credit in the future economy? Professor Pinch sees the answer in personal data. He quotes Atlantic Media CTO Tom Cochran, who argues that personal information, ultimately, will become ""the currency of the 21st century digital economy.""  ""It has no transaction costs and does not decrease in value when the supply increases,"" Cochran reasons. ""Contrary to the laws of economics, it may even increase in value with greater supply. The more information you provide to companies, the more value they can extract from it.""  Handing over such personal information, however, implies trust, the professor notes ... not something either Goldbugs or Bitcoiners are big on. Contrary to ""me, here, now,"" information implies, ""us, everywhere, forever,"" he argues.  Which will win? The Minyanville writer says he suspects that ""people will buy into using data as a currency as much -- if not less -- than proponents of Bitcoin do today.""  Whatever the future of money ends up looking like, he adds, ""it's an interesting time to be alive.""

42397154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0E5,1369914856,"Student loans? Hedge with bitcoins, says Gold Silver Bitcoin","A company called Gold Silver Bitcoin is touting its commodities of choice as a way for college students and graduates to hedge their often-huge student debts.  To back its argument, the company cites reports that the number of graduates in the US who have fallen behind on their student loan payments has climbed to an all-time high.  In the third quarter of 2012, 11 percent of payments on student loans were 90 days or more past due -- considered ""seriously delinquent"" -- according to a report from the US Department of Education.  The department also reported that nearly one-third (around 30 percent) of 20- to 24-year-olds in the US don't have jobs or go to school.  While the employment rate for college graduates remains higher than for those with just a high-school diploma, a college diploma ""no longer guarantees a direct pathway to the middle class,"" said Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, the Department of Education agency that released the latest report.  Gold Silver Bitcoin says it was ""founded with the needs of the future bullion investor in mind."" It says it's concluded that Bitcoin is ""what modern precious metals investors needed as it offers privacy and can also be used as payment to anyone, anywhere in the world, instantly.""  According to American Student Assistance, the average student loan balance in the US was $24,301 in the first quarter of 2012. Total outstanding student loan debt is believed to be stand at around $1 trillion.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/30/student-loans-hedge-with-bitcoins-says-gold-silver-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93a533993527195e208416f4e8336bc77cfcb9cd-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0Jz,1369909402,Mt. Gox bans anonymous currency deals,"The world's biggest Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox will no longer accept anonymous accounts - the company is determined not to end up the next target of US secret service action.  The Japanese exchange, which claims 80 per cent of all Bitcoin trades, said it would continue to allow Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals but any currency transaction will need ID checks. It has taken on more staff to verify accounts and hopes to clear new accounts within 48 hours.  The news follows the arrest of five people connected to Liberty Reserve in recent days.  The Feds said Liberty Reserve's 200,000 US customers made 55m transactions, almost all of them illegal.  Mt.Gox's said:    The Bitcoin market continues to evolve, as do regulations and conditions of compliance for Mt. Gox to continue bringing secure services to our customers. It is our responsibility to provide a trusted and legal exchange, and that includes making sure that we are operating within strict anti-money laundering rules and preventing other malicious activity.      As a result, beginning May 30th, 2013 all Mt. Gox user accounts are required to be verified in order to perform any currency deposits and withdrawals. Bitcoin deposits do not need verification, and at this time we are not requiring verification for Bitcoin withdrawals.    In the past two months Mt. Gox has invested in more than doubling our verification support staff, and we are currently able to process most verifications within 24~48 hours.    We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Please visit the Security Center in your Mt. Gox account if you are not already verified, and keep in mind that being careful to submit the proper documents will result in a much faster processing time.    You can read this on the Mt.Gox website.  The decision will send shockwaves through the bitcoin community which has so far prided itself on protecting anonymity and not co-operating with any government agencies.

42397152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0C7,1369906099,Alternative payments growing fast in the UK,"UK punters are using more electronic money, but cash is still king on the High Street. In 2012 use of cash for shopping fell 10 per cent - and the rate of decline is accelerating. The big winners are debit cards and newer methods such as PayPal, for online purchases.  The numbers come from the British Retail Consortium and show that just over half of all transactions are still carried out in cash - 54.4 per cent. But this is down 6.7 per cent in terms of numbers of transactions and a fall of 9.7 per cent in terms of value - the first time both figures went down in 13 years of collecting data.  The BRC said there was 3.4 per cent fall in credit and charge card payments as people try and keep a handle on their finances. Five per cent of transactions now avoid traditional payment methods entirely - being made via PayPal or other alternative.  Accepting cards is still costing shopkeepers dear. Average processing costs for cards are 25 times as much as for cash- 38 pence versus 1.5 pence for cash deals.  Helen Dickinson, Director General of the British Retail Consortium, said:    New ways to pay and new ways to shop are shaping the retail landscape like never      before...    Cash is still the most popular way to pay, but our survey shows how rapidly    alternative and emerging methods are gaining ground, with growth more than    doubling on the previous year...    Against a backdrop of greater retail efficiency and innovation, the one    jarring note is that charges remain disproportionately high. They continue to    rise even though credit card use has fallen. It beggars belief that retailers    incur average charges of 38p per credit and charge card transaction, 25 times    more than for cash.    Although credit and charge cards account for only 10.6 per cent of transactions, they take up 50.1 per cent of costs for shopkeepers.  The survey covered 10bn UK purchases, or £182bn out of total UK High Street spending of £311bn in 2012 - more details on the BRC website here.
