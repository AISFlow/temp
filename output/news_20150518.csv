42398374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL4y,1431982710,21 Inc Confirms Plans for Mass Bitcoin Miner Distribution,"21 Inc released new details today confirming that its market strategy will focus on distributing bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices.  The formal announcement comes soon after a CoinDesk report that first revealed the startup's ambitions to use such products to promote the use of bitcoin for micropayments and as a means of mass consumer onboarding to the bitcoin network. When compared to a company overview created last fall, the latest release illustrates how the secretive San Francisco-based startup has since evolved its strategy even if its core mission remains largely unchanged.  For example, writing in a blog post on Medium newly-appointed CEO Balaji Srinivasan discussed how such a strategy would enable bitcoin to be used for device authentication and to subsidize the distribution of consumer smartphones to the developing world.  Still, the extent to which 21 Inc has gone to build a complete support system around its key product was confirmed when Srinivasan wrote:  ""Our team ... has built not just a chip, but a full technology stack around the chip — including reference devices, datasheets, a cloud backend, and software protocols.""  As with past communications from the company, the timing of some of the more concrete developments from the company was unclear.  Srinivasan indicated that former CEO Matt Pauker would be taking over as chairman, but offered no details on why the leadership shift was undertaken. IT giant Cisco and former ARM CSO Mark Templeton were also named as investors, though it was not clear whether 21 Inc has opened a new round of fundraising.  Also revealed was that 21 would seek to begin mailing development kits featuring its embeddable 'BitShare' mining chip to developers. The company's website is now accepting sign-ups for the kits, but no dates for shipping were provided.  21 Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Creating value  As with past public remarks, Srinivasan spoke out against speculative use cases for bitcoin, detailing how 21 would aim to create value for small amounts of bitcoin by increasing its utility and usefulness for users.  Chief among these would be the existing operators of large-scale data centers who Srinivasan said could benefit from integration of BitShare chips into their operations. 21 Inc had previously been involved in talks with companies including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Comcast and Intel to embed the chips.  ""This means any vendor can take a chip performing a normal function (say video decoding or networking), add 21’s BitShare technology and thereby enable the chip to continuously generate revenue simply by being connected to power and Internet,"" Srinivasan said.  Srinivasan also suggested the technology could be used by larger entities to cut the costs of certain services.  ""A wide variety of new Internet-connected devices require an associated SAAS subscription to work. Rather than paying a number of different subscription bills, by including the right-sized 21 BitShare with the device one can under many scenarios wholly or partially defray the expense of the cloud service,"" he wrote.  Consumer focus  In addition to serving enterprise clients, 21 confirmed it will seek to use its chips to onboard consumers to the bitcoin network.  As detailed in its 2014 company overview, this would be accomplished by pairing consumers with large entities in a larger mining pool that would split the proceeds from any payouts received.  Among the potential consumer use cases for the 'BitShare' chip were micropayments on mobile devices, which Srinivasan said would resolve the pain point consumers face in the developing world when needing to ""dig out their credit cards"" when making online purchases.  Additional consumer applications included subsidizing the cost of bringing new consumers online and providing them with financial services.  ""We believe the most significant long-term application of bitcoin may be reducing the upfront cost of internet-connected devices to make them more accessible for the developing world,"" Srinivasan said.  He cited the success of the iPhone, which subsidized its cost for new users, as a model that could potentially be replicated, reducing the upfront costs of phone buying in exchange for a consumer paying bitcoin over time.

42398386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLCq,1431957616,"$80,000 in Bitcoin Seized in International Dark Web Crackdown","Law enforcement agencies have seized $80,000 worth of bitcoin as part of an international undercover investigation that tracked the illegal selling of firearms on a dark web site, according to a statement by the Australian Federal Police (AFP).  Four people across Australia have been charged with attempting to buy illegal firearms, while a further 17 arrests have been made across Europe and North America, the statement reveals.  The joint investigation between the United States Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), AFP and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) focused on the international trade of illegal firearms by a US-based seller, who was later identified as a 33-year-old man living in Montana.  The operation first started when ACBPS shared information with HSI, enabling agents to begin a covert operation using the seller's account, which led to the identification of Australian-based customers attempting to buy illegal firearms.  The controlled delivery of six parcels to addresses in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory also resulted in the seizure of a wide range of illegal goods, including firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, drugs, computer equipment and mobile phones.  HSI acting special agent Kevin Kelly said the joint operation should serve as a warning to those using the dark web for the purchase of illicit goods, adding:  “Anyone who mistakenly thinks that they can get away with these types of crimes by hiding in the endless depths of the Internet must know that HSI will seek them out and bring them to justice.”  Steve Lancaster, national director of investigations and assistant commissioner at the ACBPS, noted the arrest of the US based supplier had removed a significant firearm threat to the Australian border.  He said: “People using these sites should not be fooled by claims of online anonymity, each transaction builds up a global web of intelligence which international partners are using to target you.”  In Europe and North America, the arrests resulted in the confiscation of additional firearms, ballistic armour and illegal drugs.  Possible idenfitication  Gwern Branwen, a security researcher, believes he has identified both the dark web marketplace and the alias used by the seller.  The expert exposed his findings in the DarkNetMarkets sub-reddit. Branwen linked the arrest of Justin Moreira, from Hyannis (Massachusetts), charged with attempting to buy a firearm from a federal undercover agent to the investigation undertaken by US an Australian law enforcement.  According to the criminal complaint, uploaded by Branwen, Moreira used the alias ""jd497"" to order his weapon on the Agora marketplace. The weapon is believed to have been sold by a user with the ""weaponsguy” alias.  Branwen also highlighted that the dates of the criminal complaint matched those included in the AFP's recent statement.

Decentralised peer-to-peer marketplace DeBuNe; blockchain equity issuer Otonomos; and bitcoin wallet provider Cryptosigma will join seven other startups in the three-month programme.  SBC  will give each of the participating startups approximately $18,000 in funding, free office space, mentorship and access to a network of angel investors and global venture capitalists such as DBS Bank, Mastercard and Route 66 Ventures in return for 8% in equity.  The Southeast Asian state, a global financial hub, is seemingly embracing digital currency startups.  In January, Singapore's government sponsored CoinPip, a bitcoin startup, to represent the country at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) cultural and conference festival which takes place in the US in March.
