42402791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyD1,1555093240,Ethereum Core Developers Debate Benefits of More Frequent Hard Forks,"How often is too often to alter consensus?  A group of ethereum's veteran open-source developers discussed the subject in a bi-weekly meeting Friday, wherein they aired the possibility that system-wide upgrades, also called hard forks, to the software could be enacted as often as every three months.  Wanting to ""check the temperature,"" the developer asking the question explained that certain upcoming ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) such as state rents would require multiple upgrades sequentially spaced out for full effect.  Three months, however, in the eyes of Joseph Delong, senior software engineer at venture capital studio Consensys, is “too quick for a turnaround.”  Team lead at the Ethereum Foundation Péter Szilágyi agreed, explaining:  “As a [software] client developer if you’re only job is to implement hard forks and do them then three months is fine but usually clients require a lot of maintenance. So, if you start doing three month hard forks it will essentially take all the time away from general maintenance and performance improvements.”  Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Hoste Swende, while agreeing that a hard fork every three months “would be a bad thing,” noted that particular cases with simple changes unanimously agree upon could have shorter run times.  “The idea would not be to schedule a hard fork every three months but see if feature X is finished and there exist test cases and it is implemented in all clients. If so, then we can hard fork pretty soon,” argued Swende during the call.  But encouraging developers to take their plans “one step” at a time, Fredrik Harryson CTO of Parity Technologies noted that even a timeline of six months for a planned ethereum hard fork has never been achieved.  “There’s a couple things we probably need to automate in order to do [shorter hard forks] really well. A lot of the time that goes into the hard fork is not just making the code. It’s everything that goes around,” said Harryson.  In addition to this, Ethereum Foundation advisor Greg Colvin noted that most teams building ethereum software clients do not presently have “the right person” to handle essential jobs for hard fork implementation such as “setting up testnets, running test cases, doing testing” among other responsibilities.  To this, Harryson responded the matter was about not having enough finances to onboard such team members. “For us, it’s money. We don’t have enough money behind it,” quipped Harryson.  Multi-step upgrades  But it’s not only a matter of whether or not there should be more frequent hard forks.  Developers during today’s call also discussed whether there was a need for ambitious, longer-term changes to the present ethereum blockchain in light of an impending move to ethereum 2.0 – a new ethereum network which once fully activated users would migrate over to from the current mainnet.  Suggesting that developers like Alexey Akhunov and ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin have cautioned against “changes that aren’t for the survival of the [present ethereum] chain,” Harryson asked:  “How much do we sway outside of this because [EIP 615] leads into a long chain of improvements that go into several years before we’re seeing massive benefits from it.”  EIP 615 is one of five proposals considered for inclusion in the next ethereum hard fork called Istanbul. It aims to introduce improvements to the very heart of the ethereum codebase known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which is responsible for executing all self-deploying lines of code – also called smart contracts – on the platform.  The EVM is also a key technology that other enterprise blockchain initiatives such as Hyperledger have been reported in the past to build interoperability with.  “The design of the EVM makes low-gas-cost, high-performance execution difficult. We propose to move forward with proposals to resolve these problems by tightening the security guarantees and pushing the performance limits of the EVM,” writes the authors of EIP 615 Colvin, Brooklyn Zelenka, Pawel Bylic and Christina Reitwiessner.  However, as noted by Swende during today’s call, EIP 615 as proposed would require at least two hard forks to fully execute and “a positive speed effect” to actual code computations in the EVM would not be noticeable until the latter hard fork is executed.  “That’s my main concern about this EIP, it’s a lot of work but I don’t think it will lead to a much better EVM. It might be better for the external tools like if you’re doing a reverse analysis of the security properties of a smart contract,” said Swende.  Such tooling Zelenka suggested is essential to ensure continued “forward compatibility” with forthcoming EVM upgrades like eWASM and a smooth onboarding experience for smart contract developers in light of “an undetermined ethereum 2.0 release date.”  “There are other options for smart contract developers out there. We need to keep ethereum 1.x alive and that means continuing to move,” argued Zelenka on today's call.  Agreeing to continue debate and discussion on the EIP in further weeks, Swende concluded that at present he remains skeptical about “implementing such large changes into the old engine which basically takes a couple of hard forks before it finally settles.”  But agreeing with uncertain sentiment around the future of ethereum 2.0, Harryson, who raised the initial question about ambitious, multi-hard fork upgrades said:  “We shouldn’t adjust our roadmap or thinking based on what ethereum 2.0 may or may not be.""

42402794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyFy,1555076153,Coinbase Exec Dan Romero Leaving Crypto Exchange After 5 Years,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is losing another executive.  Dan Romero, who works as vice president for Coinbase's international business, announced in a Medium post on Friday that he will be leaving the firm at the end of this month. Romero joined Coinbase in April 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile.  While he didn't provide a specific reason for departing the firm, Romero said:  ""Staying true to a mission often requires doing hard (or even unpopular) things. But I’ve been lucky to learn first-hand that it’s those hard things that often generate the most value.""  “I’m planning to take some time to figure out what’s next,” he continued, adding that he joined Coinbase when it had just 20 staff – it now has a headcount of over 700.  In his time at the firm, Romero has worked on “almost every aspect” of the Coinbase business, he said, including banking partnerships and both consumer and institutional businesses.  Despite Coinbase's status as one of the most popular and valuable crypto exchanges – it raised $300 million late last year giving it a valuation of $8 billion – there have been a spate of departures (and some arrivals too) in the months since.  Two weeks ago, Coinbase’s director of institutional sales, Christine Sandler, left the exchange for Fidelity Investments, one of the world’s largest financial services providers. Earlier this year, the exchange's director of data science and risk Soups Ranjan also left, as did senior compliance manager Vaishali Mehta.  And at least nine other senior or mid-level employees have left Coinbase since its October fundraise.  It was previously revealed that, since March 2018, the firm has been offering a cover up to $5,000 a year for treatments like egg-freezing in a bid to retain staff – that’s in addition to more standard health insurance options.  Coinbase did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on Romero's departure by press time.

The bank – Japan's fifth largest – announced the decision on Thursday, saying that it would cancel the remittance service provided through the app on May 13. It did not provide any reason for the decision, however.  Money Tap was launched last October with participation from three banks: SBI Sumishin Net Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona. The product provides bank-to-bank money transfers in “real time” using Ripple’s xCurrent payments product.  Money tap is built with distributed ledger technology, according to SBI. It enables users send funds to others at no cost using just recipients' telephone numbers or a QR code, and utilizes devices' biometric features, such as fingerprint scanning, for security.  Just last month, Money Tap received investment from 13 banks, which joined the project as shareholders but do not appear to be using its technology as yet.  Exactly a year ago today, CoinDesk reported that banking giant Santander was also launching a money app based on Ripple's DLT tech. Known as Santander One Pay FX, the app allows customers to complete international transfers generally within one day.

42402813,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyUj,1555066829,"Bitcoin Defends Psychological Support Line After Price Dip to $4,900","View  Bitcoin dropped to a low of $4,900 on Coinbase after a continued sell-off was seen from its April 11 breakdown. BTC has since moved back above $5,000 and is tentatively holding that line.  Prices remain bullishly above the 200-daily moving average at $4,548, but would flip to short-term bearish with a strong close below $5,000.  The 6-hour candle has closed below a key resistance line at $5,050 and will need to be scaled before the end of today's trading session.  Bitcoin dipped to a low of around $4,900 earlier today (according to Coinbase prices), but has since fought its way back above the $5,000 psychological support line.  Thursday's trading closed slightly up, after bitcoin back-tested support at $4,994 as a result of a failed breakout from the bullish ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart.  Prices would likely find a strong base of support at $5,000 should they maintain above that level. Conversely, a close below the psychological level would expose prices to greater losses with a potential drawdown to $4,841, as per Fibonacci retracement theory.  At time of writing, prices are trading at $5,070, as per CoinDesk BPI data. Modest levels of bearish volume on the intraday charts hint at greater selling momentum in a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, but that could change given enough time above the $5K mark.  Daily chart  As long as prices remain above the 200-daily long-term moving average (orange line) at $4,548 we can consider bitcoin's price action to be bullish in the mid-term.  The daily RSI shows that bitcoin's latest move has resulted in a pullback from overbought conditions with a dip below the extreme 70.00 line, currently 66.1.  If the cryptocurrency manages to cement a low at current levels and find more gains, it would result in a hidden bullish divergence and would go a long way in restoring lost confidence.  Six-hour chart        The six-hour chart shows a loss of bull momentum with an unsuccessful attempt to close above a key resistance line (formerly support at $5,050) in recent hours, but is beginning to show promise for more upside action.  That well-defined resistance needs to be scaled by the weekly close. A failure to do would place the bulls on shaky ground, having failed to make the most of the ascending triangle breakout late on Wednesday.  Hope remains, though, thanks in part to a long-tailed wick on the prior candle, hinting at consolidation and a potential push higher.

42402793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyGx,1555061119,'Onerous' FATF Recommendations Harmful for Crypto Transparency: Chainalysis,"It's unrealistic and bad for the crypto industry to expect exchanges to send know-your-customer (KYC) information to recipient platforms with every transaction.  That's the gist of a public comment letter filed this week by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, in response to a draft recommendation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization dedicated to combating money laundering and other financial crimes.  In the draft document, published in February, the FATF outlined a number of measures that national governments could adopt to more effectively supervise crypto transactions, and therefore prevent or mitigate money laundering risks.  But in Chainalysis' view, these measures may result in exchanges – or ""virtual asset services providers"" (VASPs) in FATF parlance – shutting down and decreased visibility into potentially illicit activity.  A possibly controversial recommendation came in section 7(b) of the document, where the FATF said that ""countries should ensure that originating VASPs obtain and hold required and accurate originator information and required beneficiary information on virtual asset transfers, submit the information to beneficiary VASPs ... and make it available on request to appropriate authorities.""  The FATF invited public comment on the section, describing the draft requirement as a preventative measure.  There are a number of issues with this potential requirement, Chainalysis COO Jonathan Levin and global head of policy Jesse Spiro wrote on April 8. For one thing, the ""beneficiary"" of a transaction – the recipient of the funds – may not be another crypto exchange.  ""Virtual Assets are designed to provide a way to move value without the need to identify the participants in a transaction,"" they noted, adding that funds may be moved into a personal wallet or another type of recipient unable to accept identifying information.  Forcing this requirement onto exchanges may also result in these platforms shutting down, as there is no infrastructure in place to support this type of information transfer, the Chainalysis executives wrote.  Moreover, it may be technically infeasible to change how blockchains operate to incorporate this type of transfer, they wrote, adding:  ""Forcing onerous investment and friction onto regulated VASPs, who are critical allies to law enforcement, could reduce their prevalence, drive activity to decentralized and peer-to-peer exchanges, and lead to further de-risking by financial institutions. Such measures would decrease the transparency that is currently available to law enforcement.""  A better way?  The transparency inherent in a blockchain does provide a ""technical opportunity,"" however, Levin and Spiro wrote. Exchanges can use data stored on a blockchain ""to form an effective risk-based approach.""  By storing KYC data themselves, exchanges can provide information on specific transactions or individuals to law enforcement, regulators and banks as needed to prevent any illicit activity, they argued.  They noted that Chainalysis has participated in numerous investigations, using blockchain data to identify wallets and funds which may be involved in illegal activity.  The company's other recommendations included setting up automated ""customer due diligence"" programs able to ""screen destinations for known illicit activity,"" as well as have beneficiary exchanges look for similar issues from any exchanges sending funds over.  If the FATF's recommendations are adopted, they will go into effect as a global standard in June 2019. While the group did invite public comment on section 7(b), the comment period was closed as of April 11, and it is unclear whether Chainalysis' response will be incorporated.

Participating in the round were VC firms Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Liberty City Ventures, as well as other independent investors.  The U.S.-based startup had initially been looking to raise $2 million, but ultimately received double its target amount, it said in an announcement Thursday. The firm – an entity spun off of Horizen (formerly ZenCash) – was officially launched yesterday.  Horizen Labs said it will build “inexpensive, time-efficient, and customizable” blockchain solutions for businesses with the investment. The firm offers a proprietary sidechains-as-a-service platform it says removes the need for entities to spend their resources on development and allows for quicker deployment of existing systems using pre-built functional sidechains.  Horizen Labs CEO Robert Viglione said:  “We have seen considerable demand from customers and businesses for custom blockchain solutions that are not expensive and time-consuming to build.”  “Through Horizen Labs’ proprietary Sidechain-as-a-Service platform, we aim to let companies benefit from the high-level security of Horizen, a privacy-focused blockchain platform with the largest node network in the industry,” he added.  Horizen said it will pilot design partnerships with third-party businesses seeking to implement blockchain into their operations. To that end, the firm is working with design partners in different business areas in order to bring its first sidechain solutions to market.  DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said Horizen provides “a seamless way for businesses to incorporate customized digital ledger technology into their operations, removing a significant barrier to blockchain adoption and advancing the industry as a whole.”  Last month, Digital Currency Group also invested an undisclosed sum in cryptocurrency futures exchange CoinFLEX.

Announced Thursday, the 100-year-old International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has partnered with Singapore-based blockchain startup Perlin to improve supply chain processes at member firms, making them more traceable and transparent. The ICC will help members spread across 130 countries to connect to Perlin’s blockchain platform and benefit from the application of the nascent technology.  Perlin, now an official ICC technology partner, will offer free access to its blockchain platform during the early stages of the project, and will focus on “practical, efficient and scalable blockchain traceability and transparency systems for value chains,” as per the announcement.  John Denton, secretary general of the ICC, said:  ""In collaboration with Perlin, which leads the field in blockchain and distributed ledger development, we can help facilitate practical and truly disruptive transformation for businesses across every conceivable industry sector.""  Perlin is already working on blockchain pilots with major firms, including one with sustainable materials producer Asia Pacific Rayon (APR). The pilot, called “Follow Our Fibre,"" aims to provide transparency to APR customers across the supply chain by allowing them to monitor key stages of production from planting to delivery.  The pilot will provide “permanent data on a secure blockchain database” to help ensure that APR is in compliance with relevant regulatory and industry-based standards and certifications, the firm said.  The Paris-based organization and Perlin are also working on other projects, including the ICC’s Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) initiative – created to raise awareness of the ""economic and social harm"" of counterfeiting and piracy.

42402796,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyHw,1555042548,Zooko Wilcox Envisions 'Ambitious' Changes for Zcash Cryptocurrency,"""We’ve been working on zcash for about five years and I expect it will take five more before it reaches the level of flourishing that has been on our minds all along.""  That's Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electric Coin Company (ECC) – the firm behind the privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash. He made the comments about the long-term trajectory of zcash during a conversation on the last day of the RadicalxChange conference, which took place February in Detroit.  Suitcase and coffee in hand at the time of interview, Zooko was just about to jet off on a plane to Tokyo to embark on an extended “zcash promotional world tour” in East Asia.  But as founder and CEO of ECC – the company that created the zcash protocol and continues to act as a central hub for zcash development – Wilcox admitted:  “In the two years, slightly more than two years, of [zcash’] existence, we haven’t added substantial changes outside of privacy.”  Launched back in 2016, zcash was originally created as an encrypted, privacy-enhanced fork of bitcoin. In October of last year, Zcash underwent its biggest protocol upgrade to date, nicknamed “Sapling.”  “Sapling I think was the biggest improvement of the protocol to date. It was huge,” Josh Cincinnati, executive director of the Zcash Foundation, told CoinDesk. “It makes privacy much more accessible and also opens up the door for mobile applications. That was a moonshot project by the Electric Coin Company and it succeeded.”  Now, Wilcox envisions another “three or four year long moonshot project” in order to develop zcash “in ways that are not specific to privacy.”  “I’m in favor of an ambitious scalability improvement,” says Wilcox. “I think we need high scalability at layer one in order for us to reach the mission of empowering everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.”  He went on to add:  “Even though I think layer two is cool and has a lot of potential and potential uses, I think we also need a scalable layer one. So that’s what I’m pushing for within my company and within the zcash community.”  But there are other proposals at hand, Wilcox noted. One of these includes extending “zcash to become programmable like ethereum.”  “Of course, the way we’d tend to do things is use zero-knowledge proof to make it so that execution of the smart contracts is private and off-chain,” said Wilcox.  All of these proposals will ultimately have to move through a process of community review and debate.  Called the Zcash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) process, Cincinnati told CoinDesk that for the first time in the protocol’s history new ZIPs will be reviewed by a representative from the ECC and the Zcash Foundation.  The new ZIP process  Originally, implementation of ZIPs was entirely up to the ECC,while the Zcash Foundation was primarily “a grant-giving organization.”  Last month  , the Foundation announced steps to become more actively engaged in the protocol development process alongside the ECC.  “The metaphor is that I want us to exist in a two-of-two multi-signature governance model where the Electric Coin Company holds a key and the Foundation holds a key and where broader decisions about zcash really have to be mutually agreed upon by the Foundation and the Electric Coin Company,” said Cincinnati.  As such, for the network upgrade scheduled by the Electric Coin Company to activate in April 2020, all ZIPs will undergo a process of review by two so-called “ZIP editors.”  “Both us as editors have to agree on what features should be accepted as ZIPs. It’s not as much us agreeing about what should be included as much as it is agreeing that there is consensus [in the community] that these things should be included,” highlighted Cincinnati.  The deadline for ZIP proposals into Network Upgrade 3 ended on April 1 and as Cincinnati tells CoinDesk a total of 8 proposals are currently undergoing review by the editors – Daira Hopwood at the ECC and Cincinnati from the Foundation.  One of these proposals would introduce a new polling feature enabling users to vote with funds held in invisible “shielded” addresses directly without moving funds to a public “unshielded” address. Another proposal seeks to lay the building blocks for a private layer-two payment network on top of the zcash protocol called BOLT.  And by the time these proposals are approved, tested and activated on zcash mainnet, Cincinnati points out zcash will finally have its second software – also called client – implementation for the protocol. Presently, all users rely on the ECC zcash implementation called ""zcashd.""  In light of a forthcoming multi-client ecosystem for zcash, Cincinnati explains that it's important to begin iterating on the ZIP process now, noting:  ""Eventually, if there’s many of these consensus compatible implementations running, you have to be able to share and collaborate on the roadmap and the feature set.""  Privacy as the mainstream  Outside of ZIP process, the Zcash network is also preparing for the activation of two backwards-incompatible changes in a system-wide upgrade also called a hard fork this upcoming October.  Nicknamed Blossom, the hard fork once initiated will increase block times on the network and will split up the network's 20 percent block reward tax into three set wallet addresses – one for the Zcash Foundation, the Electric Coin Company Strategic Reserve and the remainder.  The aim of this latter change – as stated on GitHub by ECC project manager Nathan Wilcox – is to decouple the once singular funding stream ""organizationally, legally and operationally"" and further reinforce ""transparency as to the structure of the Founders' Reward.""  ""It's just meant as clean up to make it easier for people to distinguish the stuff that's going to the Electric Coin Company, early Founders' Reward recipients, and otherwise,"" added Cincinnati to CoinDesk.  This model of sustainable development funding through a block reward tax Zooko Wilcox noted to CoinDesk has been copied by other cryptocurrency projects such as the recently launched privacy coin Beam. Beam which debuted back in January was shortly followed by the launch of another privacy-focused cryptocurrency leveraging similar technology known as Grin.  To the emergence of these new entrants to the cryptocurrency space, Zooko Wilcox tells CoinDesk:  ""I don't like their technology much ... [but] I really like the communities because they're that win-win collegial mindset, where they like to help other people, and I like to help them because we're all on the same side of history.""  And history Zooko Wilcox explains will eventually prove privacy coins like zcash, beam and grin as the norm for all cryptocurrencies in the future. Likening the present wave of privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies to the period in the 1990s when encryption for web browsing was introduced. Wilcox pointed out that after ""about ten years of political and activist struggle, encryption became standard.""  “In the early days, when HTTPS was invented, people perceived it as making the web into some kind of special privacy web that was dangerous and that could allow lawbreaking,” said Zooko Wilcox. ""Now, the United States government requires you to use HTTPS on everything that is sensitive and could affect users.""  A similar sort of struggle, Zooko Wilcox argued, is occurring right now with governments viewing cryptocurrencies like Zcash, Grin and Beam that host “strong privacy protection” as being “dangerous and scary.”  He said:  “In ten years, nobody is going to say, ‘Oh that’s a privacy coin.’ They’re going to say, ‘Oh, that’s a normal coin that you can use for all normal business anywhere in the world.’ Just like how today we don’t say, ‘Oh HTTPS, this must be a privacy website and I must be using a privacy browser.”  It is these grande changes to norms and technical protocol that Wilcox fully expects will happen sometime in the next decade. Once at the Detroit airport and ready to board his flight, Wilcox messaged me one last parting thought from our conversation – a quote.  ""We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten."" - Bill Gates  Zooko Wilcox image by Christine Kim",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/12/zooko-wilcox-envisions-ambitious-changes-for-zcash-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1988870f8adafabf3d57e5a54f6e75899843fa4-1500x917.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
