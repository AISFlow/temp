Bloomberg Tax first reported the news Tuesday. An IRS spokesperson confirmed the summit is set for next month.      The summit, to be held at IRS's Washington, D.C. headquarters, will consist of four panels addressing technology, issues faced by exchanges, tax returns and regulatory compliance. A list of panelists has yet to be finalized.      Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association advocacy group, told CoinDesk the IRS has been looking into setting up a summit since at least last month, when it reached out to industry participants for suggested panelists.      ""My understanding of the event is this is going to be something where the IRS is going to use this as an opportunity to learn from [participants] in the ecosystem but [it] may help inform IRS’s thinking,"" she said, pointing to compliance with existing regulation and guidance as one area on which the agency is focused.      While the IRS has not explicitly said the summit will inform its future guidance, Smith said she hopes the agency will use the information it gathers from the event to develop better regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrency moving forward.      The news comes days after the Government Accountability Office, a Congress-funded watchdog for government agencies, announced the IRS had declined to adopt several recommendations to clarify its existing guidance.      The IRS published fresh guidance around cryptocurrencies last autumn, addressing hard forks, how to calculate gains and valuing crypto income.

Starting today, CoinDesk will be publishing daily columnists such as Preston Byrne, Jill Carlson, Nic Carter, HASU, Stephanie Hurder, Jeff Dorman, JP Koning, Yorke Rhodes, Byrne Hobart, William Mougayar, Leah Callon-Butler, Lex Sokolin, Kevin Kelly, Ajit Tripathi and James Cooper.      Wherever you stand on bitcoin as an actual payment system, or whether you think additive X-for-blockchain business ideas went too far, you have to admit they’ve spurred debate in interesting ways.      Geopolitically important projects including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Libra, JPM Coin and many others were spawned from bitcoin (BTC). Together, they point to different futures for the financial system, the internet and our rights as digital citizens. These are all issues for discussion in February 2020 because of Satoshi Nakamoto's writings in 2008.      We plan to have fun conjecturing all this with the help of daily columnists, a diverse range of contributors, long-form interviews, books coverage and more. We want to bring you the best writers and writing every day, covering “generation crypto,” the shift to a new way of thinking.    Today: Time for a safe harbor?      First up at the plate we have SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce – aka Crypto Mom – writing about her Safe Harbor proposal, a radical reframing of the debate about whether tokens should be treated as securities. She wants feedback. ""I continue to urge people – this time in the words of Huey Lewis and the News – 'If this is it, please let me know ... if this is it, I want to know,'"" she writes of the proposal.

42383309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v9Sh,1582054873,A Safer Harbor: Improving Hester Peirce's Proposal for Regulating Token Sales,"Donna Redel is the former Chairman of COMEX, a Board Member of New York Angels and an Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School. Olta Andoni is an Adjunct Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. Peirce's CoinDesk op-ed is here. Further reactions were published here and here.      In February, Commissioner Hester Peirce proposed a new safe harbor which, if passed into a formal rule, would radically change the legal terrain for sellers of crypto tokens in the United States. This article addresses some critiques and point of views in response to the recent Safe Harbor Proposal from Commissioner Hester Peirce. The authors of this article met online (but not in a dating app) in a private Telegram channel where around 70 lawyers regularly engage in (sometimes fierce) debate regarding legal issues faced by the crypto industry. This article is informed by our having witnessed a wide spectrum of strongly argued opinions from different attorneys in the course of those debates.      Commissioner Peirce’s safe harbor proposal has inspired a discussion of alternatives and a variety of practical considerations that would be involved in implementing the proposal. We applaud her for “stirring up the pot,” which has resulted in many reasoned responses with wide-ranging views. We think the industry is in need of a healthy open debate and discussion to address the pathways to sensible regulation, standards, and best practices while balancing them with the mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We stress the importance of open debate since it appears that much important discussion takes place by lobbying the SEC in private meetings.    We cannot afford to revisit this dark period.    The safe harbor proposal should be viewed in the context of the ICO boom and bust that left retail customers shouldering billions in losses. The ensuing “bear market” for crypto assets set back the development of blockchain technology because many continue to conflate blockchain with bad-faith coin issuances, and unethical behavior by issuers. Today, institutional firms working in this space provide safer custody and products for all digital assets that attempt to adhere to existing regulations, i.e. Bakkt, Fidelity, CME. We cannot afford to revisit this “dark” period.      The safe harbor proposal touches on all aspects of the crypto-issuance ecosystem at once, but does not drill down into the functionality of the instruments, implications of its new features and nitty-gritty details about its actual workability. Perhaps the announcement of the safe harbor was a strategy to create vibrant debate, like the bold announcement of Libra. A comprehensive safe harbor entails so many different aspects of securities issuance and trading behavior that require unbundling and then rebundling.      We believe the safe harbor proposal should concentrate more on key public policy concerns such as registration, disclosure and markets trading. Commissioner Peirce proposes some guardrails for the projects to comply with during a three-year period, which would require companies to comply with disclosure rules around the instruments they are selling. In this regard, we believe that the proposal should go further.      The safe harbor proposal exempts tokens from being classified as securities during the precise time that such tokens are in fact securities; in most issuances, the tokens sold have been non-functional “vaporware,” or semi-functional at best, targeted to retail investors. These crypto securities are predominantly created, bought and sold for speculative purposes, mostly used for trading on under-regulated spot exchanges, most of which does not benefit the majority of the blockchain projects (unless insiders are also trading). Furthermore, when discussing network functionality and the security like features of a token, legal critics think that these characteristics are not mutually exclusive.      The SEC has authorized numerous exemptions to securities registration requirements. The venture capital industry has been investing in blockchain startup projects via private placements. Peirce has highlighted Reg A+, used by Blockstack, which we agree is a good starting point for regulatory reform. Making a few token friendly tweaks to Reg A+, especially the transfer agent requirement, would provide a viable alternative to registration for token issuers and would not require the creation of a new bespoke rule for token issuers, or any significant expansion of SEC authority. Additionally, the industry would benefit from the SEC speeding up the process of review of Reg A+, which would, in turn, encourage more utilization of this exemption.      Many think the timing of the safe harbor proposal is problematic considering that Feb. 19 is the court hearing on the temporary restraining order in SEC v. Telegram Group Inc. This is a key case related to the issuance of crypto tokens for investment purposes where the SEC is challenging the token sale as an illegal offering in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.      Under the the safe harbor proposal, a project may sell tokens and facilitate their secondary trading during the first three years, and then at the end of the three year period, self-certify if the network has achieved maturity or decentralization.      It is unclear who, during this three-year period, is protecting the retail customer. Distributing tokens to prospective users appears to involve from the onset trading on exchanges, most of which are not regulated by either the SEC or the CFTC. The abuses the New York Attorney General pointed out as well as numerous articles and research papers have shown that exchanges frequently condition listing on payment of large fees and do not provide the safeguards required of regulated securities exchanges. This asymmetry should be a key focus of regulators during 2020.      The safe harbor proposal should provide for regulation of secondary trading “exchanges,” and additional standards for these trading venues. Additionally, the SEC and FINRA should streamline the approval process for Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) for the security tokens to trade with greater liquidity in more venues thereby rendering this asset class more available to investors.      Let’s be practical. How much money does a startup need and why can’t smart contracts be used to have programmatic access to capital raised? Projects using tokens do not operate under a different set of decisions and capital uses than normal startups, except for perhaps additional treasury management risk. Moreover, it is often counterproductive to give an entrepreneur too much money. Meeting benchmarks is a great way to measure success and drive funding needs.    The proposal should consider better protections for retail consumers and the seemingly unlimited ability to fundraise during the three-year exemption period.    Recently, Gabriel Shapiro, a member of Hardcore Crypto Lawyers, wrote a open letter to Commissioner Peirce suggesting comprehensive modifications to the proposal to further align it with prevailing U.S. securities doctrine and policy. Shapiro’s proposal concentrates mostly on the analysis of the open network tokens as investment contracts, while also laying out a detailed analysis for network maturity criterias and secondary market regulations as they apply to securities intermediaries. Shapiro strongly disagrees with the three-year exemption period, seeing it as unfair to both traditional securities issuers and to participants in blockchain networks.      We hope these critiques can improve the safe harbor. The proposal should consider better protections for retail consumers and the seemingly unlimited ability to fundraise during the three-year exemption period. This amounts to a three-year look back option for the projects without sufficient remedies or consequences for investors.      Even if the safe harbor does provide an exemption period, it should at least provide the SEC with more effective recourse than was present in the settlements with Paragon, Airfox and Gladius Network. Those project teams ended up walking away from the terms of those settlements. For example, the development team could be required to set aside profits to refund investors, should the project fail. The funds could be governed through the use of a DAICO, as proposed by Vitalik Buterin. We again emphasize the need to have tighter controls and regulations on exchanges that trade crypto-securities.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Donna Redel, Olta Andoni",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/18/a-safer-harbor-improving-hester-peirces-proposal-for-regulating-token-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/270d8751d5f67440f1587d3e1c105ea36519d619-1200x1034.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCm9,1582050666,BitGo Acquires Harbor in Surprise Expansion Beyond Crypto Custody,"BitGo is expanding beyond crypto custody with the takeover of a onetime poster child of the adjacent market for digital securities.      The crypto custodian announced Tuesday the acquisition of Harbor, a security token platform best known for a failed bid to offer tokenized shares of a South Carolina apartment building.      Harbor’s subsidiaries, which include a broker-dealer regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and a transfer agent supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are included in the acquisition, the companies said. The move allows BitGo to expand its services from custody, becoming what CEO Mike Belshe said is the first ""full-stack"" service provider in the digital securities space. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.      The acquisition essentially allows BitGo to recreate all parts of the traditional financial system, Belshe said, noting that BitGo itself is a licensed custodian through the South Dakota Division of Banking.      “As we build the market infrastructure for crypto there’s a lot of pieces to put together. At the end of the day the existing market has this huge advantage in having built up its structure over decades and we’re trying to replicate that in a short period of time,” Belshe said.      The acquisition marks the first time a single entity in the cryptocurrency space holds broker-dealer, transfer agent and a qualified custodian licenses, Belshe said (FINRA and the SEC must approve the broker-dealer and transfer agent transfers to BitGo, a process Belshe said is already underway).      Qualified custodians can store securities on behalf of clients, including institutions; broker-dealers can trade these securities for themselves or for clients; and transfer agents act as intermediaries who help record transactions, among other duties.      While Belshe did not say how much the company holds in assets under management, he said BitGo conducts some $15 billion in transactions each month, including through its international clients.      The firm will add Harbor’s products and services under the acquisition, though an exact roadmap has not yet been finalized.    Port of call    The sale marks a turning point for Harbor, which originally set out to help other companies issue security tokens before later focusing on facilitating the tokenization of existing securities. In September 2019, the firm created ethereum tokens representing shares of four different real estate funds, totaling some $100 million.      The company secured its broker-dealer license and transfer agent registration last autumn.      “One piece that we’ve been missing is custody. We’ve had a partnership with BitGo and so when you’re under the same roof things become possible, you make things more integrated than you could before, we’re exploring that now with BitGo, we’re trying to figure out what exactly the roadmap looks like,” said Josh Stein, Harbor’s CEO.      While Stein is also joining BitGo, his exact role has not yet been defined.      BitGo plans to expand the number of assets it supports, particularly with security tokens, but Belshe said he could not specify which tokens this might include, citing regulatory ambiguity.      “We’re significantly decreasing the barrier to entry by pulling all of these things together,” Belshe said. “This gives us full capabilities around issuing and trading and transferring of security tokens.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/18/bitgo-acquires-harbor-in-surprise-expansion-beyond-crypto-custody,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59d7ae5c86008d781bf51090307c0608bb27f91a-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCp6,1582041687,"Peirce's Safe Harbor is Worth a Look, But It May Not Be Worth the Effort","Carol Van Cleef is Chair of the Blockchain and Digital Assets Team at the law firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings. Addison Yang is a regulatory consultant at Luminous Group, where Van Cleef is also CEO. Peirce's CoinDesk op-ed about the safe harbor proposal is here. Preston J Byrne's take is here.      We confess that, on first read of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s safe harbor (SH) proposal, we were skeptics. It is very limited in scope, is only a rough draft and appears to have little to no chance of becoming law as Peirce’s term as commissioner is scheduled to expire in June and no other commissioner has yet expressed support for the proposal.      Despite our skepticism, the proposal has attracted much attention and significant praise from the crypto community. Why? First, the community is starved for any constructive, supportive and engaged attention from policymakers in D.C. in addressing regulatory barriers to innovation.      Second, the proposal offers a potential solution to an important Catch-22 encountered by token-based networks before they are fully functional or decentralized. It would provide relief from federal securities law requirements often viewed as handicapping projects needing to get tokens into the hands of potential users to achieve full functionality or decentralization.      The important question is whether the crypto community should invest its time and resources in support of the Peirce proposal, given the odds against it. To answer this question, one must first ask (a) whether there are other ways to solve the problem more expeditiously and, more importantly, (b) if this particular proposal provides the most desired solution.      Alternative pathways. Although a fledgling group in Congress understands the technology and its potential, obtaining a legislative consensus on any one proposal is complicated under the best of circumstances.      Getting a bill to the President’s desk is rare. Based on data over almost 20 years, on average only 2 to 3 percent of all legislation introduced in Congress becomes law. Moreover, election-year calendars usually have fewer legislative days and this year has even fewer due to the recently concluded impeachment process. Realistically, passage of a bill usually requires either (a) a crisis or (b) years of work, lots of money and the buy-in of multiple constituents, including not only other members of Congress, but also the administration and independent regulatory agencies, as well as those outside of government, such as consumer advocacy groups. The process is much like driving over a very rough road with lots of rocks and potholes, any one of which could blow a tire, break the suspension or wreck the car.      Regulatory action involves far fewer people and potential pitfalls but it is not necessarily quicker or more certain. In the case of the SEC, the five commissioners are the decision-makers, supported by competent and respected professional staff. Its actions are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which prescribes specific steps the SEC and other agencies must follow if they want to establish new rules. These steps include a formal proposal and comment process that could take months if not years.      Limits on a commissioner’s power. Commissioner Pierce has offered a welcome oasis for the crypto community in a federal bureaucracy that tends to be more reactive than proactive. She earned her the nickname “Crypto Mom” because she is willing to listen and offer solutions, not excuses to difficult issues the industry faces with her agency. But her enthusiasm may not be enough to move the proposal through the SEC.      Without a doubt, as only one of five on the commission, which historically has been dominated by the chairman, Peirce’s ability to influence consideration of the proposal is limited. Without the support of one or more other commissioner and some senior staff, borrowing a football analogy, she is trying to pass from her own end zone with little or no pass protection.      Of course, she realizes there are skeptics: “I suspect some of you are asking, ‘Who cares?’ I get the point. I am one of five commissioners. I cannot write rules unilaterally,” she has said.      Borrowing another football analogy, she seems to be making a Hail Mary pass, throwing it long and deep, hoping someone will catch and run with it. Quoting from Bruce Springsteen, she says, “You can’t start a fire without a spark,” and asserts optimistically that “[i]t does not hurt to get the ball rolling. People change their minds.”      The monkey’s paw. A decision to support the SH should be based on a good understanding of the proposal itself, how it accomplishes its objective and the potential consequences, both intended and unintended. In this context, we should remind ourselves to be careful of what we wish for.      The proposed SH is narrow in scope: simplify the process of raising capital in certain types of token projects involving the development of a functional or decentralized network, thereby encouraging developers to continue innovating in the United States.      The SH would offer projects a three-year grace period to raise critical funding through token sales without registering the token as a security, provided certain conditions are met. During this period, the team would be required to make a good faith effort to create “liquidity for users.” Secondary market trading of tokens would be allowed, even encouraged (again, provided certain conditions are satisfied) on trading platforms that are similarly subject to the SH if they facilitate trading of these tokens.      The proposal also contains several provisions the consequences of which should be considered in evaluating the proposal as a whole:      Shifting responsibilities and costs? First, the proposal shifts to the private sector much of the SEC’s oversight responsibilities and eliminates the delays attributable to SEC review that often accompany public offerings. However, it is not a panacea – there will be costs associated with compliance, the burdens of disclosure have not been eliminated and the SEC will still have jurisdiction under the anti-fraud provisions of securities laws.      More transparency? Additionally, a detailed list of information about each project must be made available initially on a freely accessible public website and updated upon change. Undoubtedly, private services will seize upon the opportunity to use access to this information to develop new products and services that will facilitate analysis of the projects, potentially providing greater scrutiny of fundamentals and better oversight of the projects on an ongoing basis. Presumably, all investors in the project would have access to levels of information usually reserved for larger investors.      New de facto regulator? Furthermore, projects would become de facto regulators of trading platforms. If a project team decides to facilitate secondary trading on a “trading platform,” the team is required to seek one that can “demonstrate compliance with all applicable federal and state law and regulations relating to money transmission, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection.” By requiring them to ascertain the regulatory status of the trading platforms, the proposal effectively requires projects to police the compliance efforts of the platforms.    Whether the Commissioner is proposing a sandbox or a beach, neither will be created in a vacuum.    To what extent will projects be required to continuously validate platforms’ claims of compliance? Would they be allowed to rely on third-party validations? The only certainty is that lawyers for both projects and platforms will be busy writing opinions to satisfy this requirement.      Out of the frying pan, into the frying pan. Importantly, this requirement also subtly changes the focus on how trading platforms are regulated. Since the proposal exempts them from regulation as exchanges under the securities law, trading platforms for covered tokens are assumed by the proposal almost backhandedly to be regulated under money transmitter licensing laws. In other words, projects are not asked to certify that platforms are compliant with securities laws, but rather to verify the platforms’ compliance with state money transmitter licensing laws, further helping to cement project tokens’ non-security status.      Sandbox vs. beach? Some view this proposal as a sandbox. One publication referred to it as Peirce’s “beach,” borrowing upon a 2018 speech where she favored a beach rather than a sandbox, where “[t]he regulator monitors the landscape [like a lifeguard], steps in to stop violations when they occur, and stands ready to answer interpretive questions as people seek to understand how the rules apply to their situation… but the regulator leaves ample room for innovators to develop their ideas without the regulators sitting at their shoulder taking part in each creative decision.” Whether the Commissioner is proposing a sandbox or a beach, neither will be created in a vacuum.      Can crypto support change the odds? With the support of the crypto community, can the odds of the SH becoming law or regulation change? Should it allow itself to be distracted from other pressing priorities, given the seeming odds against adoption?      Commissioner Peirce is encouraging discussion and feedback on the proposal. That process will not necessarily improve the chances that it will eventually be considered by the SEC, but may help identify and refine what may be feasible in the future. If the community decides this proposal – or another – has value and ultimately should become law, it needs to engage both individually and collectively through industry groups and coalitions. Allies outside the crypto community are also critical, in both the private and public sectors. The consumer lobbies cannot be ignored. And above all, a commitment of time and money will be necessary.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Carol Van Cleef, Addison Yang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/18/peirces-safe-harbor-is-worth-a-look-but-it-may-not-be-worth-the-effort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/316bab1786f53570c9c922ce4de99c8e8c2d8a60-2560x1464.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzt1,1582038281,US Presidential Contender Michael Bloomberg Proposes 'Clear Regulatory Framework' for Crypto,"Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg proposed creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.  Bloomberg's campaign published a financial reform plan Tuesday, advocating for greater consumer protection measures and a stronger financial system. Specifically, the proposal suggests requiring financial institutions to monitor risk exposure, recording all financial transactions in a centralized database, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a number of other recommendations. The proposal also recommends creating a regulatory sandbox for startups and ""providing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.""  ""Cryptocurrencies have become an asset class worth hundreds of billions of dollars, yet regulatory oversight remains fragmented and undeveloped. For all the promise of the blockchain, bitcoin and initial coin offerings, there’s also plenty of hype, fraud and criminal activity,"" the full proposal said.  Bloomberg's plan recommends clarifying which agencies are responsible for overseeing the space, creating a framework to clarify when tokens are securities, ""protecting consumers from cryptocurrency-related fraud,"" clarifying the tax regime and defining the requirements for financial institutions in the space.  The campaign did not return a request for further comment.  Bloomberg became the latest of a small group of presidential contenders to address cryptocurrency during his campaign, following Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and Andrew Yang, both of whom have since dropped out of the race.  Swalwell accepted cryptocurrency donations briefly during his run, while Yang also called for a national regulatory framework to address questions around how the government would approach the space and supersede potentially contradictory state-level regulations.  Road to November  Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and founder of Bloomberg L.P. (the company behind the Bloomberg Terminal), entered the presidential race in November 2019, and has missed the first primary and caucus (New Hampshire and Iowa, respectively) due to joining late in the primary process (in comparison, former contender Andrew Yang entered the race in November 2017).  Despite his late entry, Bloomberg has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ad campaigns. As of press time, he is polling at roughly 16 percent, according to news site 538, enough to place second on the national stage.  However, his candidacy has recently been rocked by allegations of racism and sexism, including from his support of New York’s infamous “stop and frisk” practice during his time running the city.  The practice was later deemed unconstitutional, and while Bloomberg appealed the ruling, his successor, former presidential candidate and current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped the case.  Bloomberg has also reportedly settled a number of alleged sexual harassment cases and been accused of fostering a hostile work environment, according to The Washington Post.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/18/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67954a772908cabd2d9bddd125adac75cca3266e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404023,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhChE,1582035321,Preston Byrne: Peirce's Safe Harbor Proposal Would Be Hilarious if It Weren’t so Serious,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk's new opinion section, is an attorney at Byrne & Storm, where he advises cryptocurrency miners, decentralized protocol developers, custom software development shops, and interactive computer services businesses. This is his bi-weekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” an opinionated roundup of bigger legal topics in the crypto space. And, yes, it is not legal advice. Hester Peirce's CoinDesk op-ed about her Safe Harbor proposal is here.      Much ink has been spilled over the last six years about the extent to which U.S. securities laws can and should apply to the sales of cryptographic tokens by protocol developers.      The default position that a conservative law firm will follow is that in the U.S. the sale of a token by a protocol developer before a token network is launched is the sale of a security. Current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) policy appears to say that, in the life of any cryptocurrency, there will come a point when the token has been distributed to sufficiently many hands and the network’s architecture is sufficiently distributed – or as SEC corporate finance director Bill Hinman put it in 2018, “sufficiently decentralized – where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts,” and thus the token ceases to be a security.      SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, aka “Crypto Mom,” thinks the government should facilitate startups that want to have a go at turning their definitely-are-securities-today into maybe-not-securities-tomorrow. She has proposed a safe harbor to achieve this, whereby token startups will be given a three-year head start to take an ICO coin and turn it into a “decentralized” network, i.e. one which:    is not dependent upon a single person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts… (such that) the tokens must be distributed to and freely tradeable by potential users, programmers, and… secondary trading of the tokens typically provides essential liquidity for the development of the network and use of the token.    The three-year safe harbor period will allow protocol devs time to:    facilitate participation in, and the development of, a functional and/or decentralized network, unrestrained from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws so long as [certain] conditions are met.    In other words, under the proposal, crypto projects would be able to sell securities to the public and work towards “decentralization” by, among other things, selling still more of these securities and creating a robust market for these securities, in the hope that engaging in the sale and marketing of these securities will turn them into non-securities, despite the fact that they will function in the marketplace exactly as securities do today at all relevant times.      This proposal would be hilarious if it weren’t so serious.      The most significant issue is that the proposal relies on a standard for “decentralization” which isn't entirely certain today. Although the SEC has “decentralization” guidelines in print, projects that appear technically indistinguishable receive differing regulatory treatment for reasons that, to industry experts, are not immediately apparent.      Take, for example, Block.one, Sia and Telegram. Block.one claims to have raised north of $4 billion in a yearlong, rolling ICO for the EOS blockchain that kicked off with the purchase of billboard advertising in Times Square at the Consensus 2017 conference. Sia did an unregistered [initial coin offering] also, raising roughly $150,000.      Telegram, by contrast, endeavored to sell its tokens to U.S. persons via the Rule 506(c) exemption of Regulation D. At a predetermined future date, Block.one’s and Sia’s presale tokens converted to live network tokens. At a predetermined future date, Telegram’s presale tokens were to convert to live network tokens.      Block.one was fined $24 million, or about 60 basis points on $4 billion, and walked away, and its once-were-securities-but-I-guess-now-they’re-not coins continue to be listed on major exchanges. Comparatively smaller offender Sia was fined $250,000, or twice what they raised, and walked away. Telegram, by contrast, drew an emergency injunction in the Southern District of New York and the project has ground to a halt.      Of course, there are reasons why the SEC might be friendlier to some startups and less friendly to others. For example, startups that approach the SEC and cooperate will be treated more gently than those that do not. But, fundamentally, the real problem here is that the SEC’s “decentralization” test, as currently used, and as proposed to be used in the future, is unquantifiable to the point of being unconstitutionally vague.      There is no agreed statutory or technical definition of what makes a project more or less “decentralized.” When prominent developers and industry marketers cannot agree on a uniform definition of the term, which more often appears to be marketing-speak than as a definite, measurable quality, I struggle to see how the government should be in a better position to do so. For this reason, I would struggle to advise a client seeking to adhere to the “decentralization” test whether they are decentralized or not.      The only thing that is made clearer by this proposal is that, to paraphrase an industry colleague, “'blockchain technology' and Mom & Pop investors don’t have lobbyists. Coinbase does.” This proposal is fantastic for startups who need capital, market venues who need trading volumes to survive and the lawyers who advise them. For this reason, I don’t expect that many U.S. law firms will raise significant objections to this proposal which, if adopted, would almost undoubtedly be the single greatest creator of transactional legal work since the invention of securitization.      It would facilitate a headlong rush of issuers into the lightly-regulated crypto-capital markets as every company in the world sought to obtain American investors’ capital without selling them so much as a single basis point of equity or taking on a single dollar of debt, all without needing to sort out the details for 36 months.      If that’s the rule the SEC wishes to adopt and the result it wishes to bring about, that’s the Commission's prerogative. I might suggest that a simpler approach would be for the government to approach tokens like it approaches bitcoin: treat coins sold in an initial coin offering as something sold, a securities sale, and treat a mined coin as something made, a mere commodity, which will still allow for a great many experiments in blockchain tech to flourish without creating incentives for every company in America to launch its own token.    Crypto scam numbers on the rise    The Wall Street Journal reports on Feb. 8:    Seo Jin-ho, a travel-agency operator in South Korea, wasn’t interested in exotic investments when a colleague first introduced him to PlusToken, a platform that traded bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But the colleague was persistent. …His investment grew at a dazzling rate. He invested more—a lot more. In less than five months, he bought $86,000 of cryptocurrencies, cashing out only $500.    The story ends in a familiar way, with Seo Jin-ho losing all of the money he invested.      Crypto-analytics company Chainalysis estimates that after a fairly busy 2017 in which $1.83 billion was “invested” in crypto scams, 2018 was a quieter year. This is perhaps understandable given the noises that the SEC made from January through November.      In 2019, however, a staggering $3.99 billion – that’s billion with a B – was reportedly lost to crypto-investment scams. This suggests that regulatory intervention in 2018 was not aggressive enough to deter the continuing growth of “scam” activity.      Clamping down on scams is almost universally understood as an important prerequisite to mass adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a viable payment and financial services technology. When asking why investors seem so uniquely susceptible to crypto scams, it bears mentioning that each of the top ten coins in circulation was issued otherwise than through a regulated channel, with the SEC and Department of Justice, at least as far as the public is aware, declining to take action against ethereum, tether, XRP, litecoin, Binance Coin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin SV and tezos, and taking a $24 million punt on EOS, despite there being identifiable promoters for each project (usually a notionally non-profit foundation but sometimes a for-profit entity).      The absence of an adequate regulatory regime means that a new “scam” project is virtually indistinguishable from one that has shed that label through accidental success. The marketing material for, say, ethereum and for any “scam” currency are primarily found on informal channels such as internet fora and Twitter promotional posts rather than in the form of an offering circular. The closest thing to “legitimacy” that any particular project can obtain is a listing on Coinbase or Binance, commercial actors with commercial interests that call for them to list and trade more coins in greater volumes, regardless of the gain or loss to investors.      A “safe harbor” that made it more difficult for retail investors to distinguish bona fide projects like Blockstack from known scams like OneCoin for a three-year period would likely undo much of the progress towards mainstreaming crypto adoption that has been made to date, which has seen large institutional players like Bakkt or Fidelity Digital Assets enter the space.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Preston J.

42404027,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhClA,1582034567,Hester Peirce: Tell Me How to Improve My Safe Harbor Proposal,"Hester Peirce is a Commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The views here are her own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the SEC Commission or her fellow Commissioners. She can be contacted at CommissionerPeirce@sec.gov. Read on for reactions from lawyer Preston J Byrne, and Carol Van Cleef and Addison Yang.      Earlier this month, I proposed a securities law safe harbor for token distributions. My motivation was the fear that many crypto entrepreneurs have: that a token distribution might be deemed by my agency – the SEC – to be a securities offering. How, then, is a would-be network supposed to mature into a functional or decentralized network? Network effects are unlikely to take hold until tokens are distributed to, and freely transferable, among potential users, developers and participants of the network. The securities laws cannot be ignored, but neither can securities regulators ignore the conundrum our laws create.      The safe harbor seeks to balance the objectives of protecting token purchasers and providing the regulatory flexibility that allows innovation to flourish. Accordingly, the safe harbor protects token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to their needs, preserving the application of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, and enabling purchasers to participate in networks of interest. The safe harbor also provides network entrepreneurs the time and regulatory flexibility to build their networks.    Underlying the three-year grace period is a premise that the nuances and ambiguities in determining whether a token transaction represents a security transaction exist primarily in the earlier stages.    The safe harbor would provide network developers with a three-year grace period – exempted from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws – within which they could facilitate participation in and the development of a functional or decentralized network, so long as the following conditions are met:    The team must intend for the network to reach network maturity – defined as either decentralization or token functionality – within three years of the first token sale and undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to achieve that goal.  The team would have to disclose key information on a freely accessible public website.  The token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network.  The team would have to undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users.  The team would have to file a notice with the SEC to rely on the safe harbor.    When I announced the safe harbor, I emphasized that it is a work in progress, one that would benefit from the power of decentralized wisdom. The thoughtful discussion I had hoped the proposal would prompt has begun already. Reactions have ranged from enthusiastically supporting it, to dismissing it as unnecessary. Suggested improvements include clarifying how the safe harbor interacts with the laws of other domestic and foreign jurisdictions, allowing issuers to provide liquidity directly rather than through a third-party trading platform, and recasting the safe harbor around specific contractual obligations. Briefly, I will address two emerging themes in the conversation.      First, some commentators have worried that the proposal would reignite the 2017 [initial coin offering] craze. The safe harbor is designed to provide a safe path forward for legitimate projects and to make attracting funds more difficult for fraudulent projects. The safe harbor requires the disclosure of specific information about the project and development team, preserves the SEC’s antifraud authority over safe harbor token sales, and excludes bad actors.    'If this is it, please let me know ... if this is it, I want to know.' If this is not it, I want to know that, too.    A second area of concern is the lack of a bright-line test for whether a token is a security at the end of three years. To avoid the securities classification at the end of the safe harbor period, the network would have to be decentralized, which means it is not controlled and is not reasonably likely to be controlled, or unilaterally changed, by any single person, group of persons, or entities under common control. Alternatively, the network could be functional, which means holders can use the tokens in a manner consistent with the utility of the network.      Underlying the three-year grace period is a premise that the nuances and ambiguities in determining whether a token transaction represents a security transaction exist primarily in the earlier stages of the development of a network. The lack of control over the network or the functionality of the network should be demonstrable within three years, and if not, the development team must be willing to take a clear-eyed look at the viability of the project as originally envisioned in light of our existing regulatory structures.      My preliminary responses to these early concerns should not be taken as discouraging further dialogue on these and related issues. I continue to urge people – this time in the words of Huey Lewis and the News – “If this is it, please let me know ... if this is it, I want to know.” If this is not it, I want to know that, too. Give me a call, send me an email, stop by my office, provide feedback at the SEC’s FinHub webpage or post your comments online so that everyone else can see them, too.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Hester Peirce,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/18/hester-peirce-tell-me-how-to-improve-my-safe-harbor-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92806979fef614b395d98bd270b291d371c412d6-2560x1465.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404030,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCo7,1582031098,"DeFi Project bZx Exploited for Second Time in a Week, Loses $630K in Ether","Bad actors have made off with $630,000-worth of the ether (ETH) cryptocurrency after exploiting a price feed of the ethereum-based lending project bZx.      The attack – the second in less than a week – began at just after 03:00 UTC Tuesday, when attackers apparently took out a flash loan of 7,500 ETH (approximately US$1.98 million), using 3,518 ETH (~$939,300) to purchase synthetic USD stablecoin sUSD from the issuer, which they then posted as collateral for a bZx loan, according to an analyst on Twitter.      They then used 900 ETH (~$240,000) to bid up the value of sUSD through an integrated price feed from liquidity provider Kyber Network until the dollar stablecoin spiked at $2. Using this inflated collateral, they took out another loan of 6,796 ETH (roughly $1.8 million) that was used to pay back the original 7,500 ETH loan, pocketing the remaining 2,378 ETH.      The total amount stolen is worth approximately $633,000, according to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index. In its entirety, the attack took just over a minute from beginning to end. The exploiters have left an open loan with half the required collateral now that sUSD has returned to its dollar pegging.      The total amount of ether locked in bZx lending contracts has nearly halved from 40,000 ETH (~$10.7 million) to 23,000 ETH (~$6.1 million) since the exploit took place, according to statistics site DeFi Pulse.      The official Twitter account for bZx confirmed at 04:38 UTC the project had suspended trading after it detected ""suspicious transactions using flash loans and trading on Synthetix."" A bZx spokesperson confirmed on the group's Telegram channel the company itself, rather than any of the platform's users, would cover the shortfall.      The attack comes days after bZx fell victim to a similar flash loan-based attack where more than $350,000-worth of cryptocurrencies were extracted from the platform. It's unclear whether the two attacks were carried out by the same person or group.    What are flash loans?    The vast majority of DeFi lending facilities rely on overcollateralized loans: Borrowers can usually only borrow around 75 percent of the value of their collateral. Although that incentivizes users to pay back loans, it also requires lenders to have very high liquidity – sometimes in a diverse range of assets – in order to quickly liquidate loans.      Flash loans are instruments that allow traders to liquidate the loans on the lender's behalf. It works by having the trader take a loan out from the lender – this time not posting any collateral – then paying back the borrower's debt and collecting the deposit. Using the deposit they can pay back the original loan and pocket the remaining funds.      Flash loans were already available on other DeFi projects such as the non-custodial lending platform Aave Protocol, which has offered them since the beginning of the year.      bZx only launched its own flash loan instruments on Monday. CEO Tom Bean defended the decision to introduce flash loans onto the platform. ""By all accounts, the flash loan code on bZx was not what allowed this attack. It was just a tool used that functioned correctly and could have been swapped out for dydx and Aave flash loans,"" he wrote on the company's Telegram channel.      Kyle Kistner, bZx's chief visionary officer and operations lead, confirmed, also on Telegram, the flash loan hack was ""completely tractable."" He highlighted that bZx would accelerate plans to integrate Chainlink to diversify price feeds and prevent oracle manipulations from happening again.      A representative for bZx told CoinDesk the team was trying to resolve the exploit with its team of engineers.

42404047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhCq5,1582024828,Golden Cross Gives Little Relief as Bitcoin Risks Fall Below 2020 Bullish Trendline,"View  Bitcoin is struggling to draw bids despite a confirmed ""golden cross"" pattern on the daily chart.  That, coupled with bearish short duration indicators, suggests scope for a convincing break below the 2020 rising trendline currently near $9,700. That would expose the next support at $9,200.  The bearish case would weaken if prices return above today's Asian session high of $9,825.  A move above Sunday's high of $10,051 is needed to revive the short-term bullish setup.    While a long-term chart indicator has just made a bullish call, bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to gather upside traction and looks vulnerable near the seven-week rising trendline support.      In what was possibly going to gift bitcoin prices a lift, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed above the 200-day MA, confirming a golden crossover, a long-term bull market indicator.      The development has the crypto-market community excited because the same pattern saw bitcoin rally from $5,050 to $8,300 in the three weeks to May 16, 2019, following confirmation of the golden cross in late April.      ""Don't be late to the party,"" popular research analyst and blockchain enthusiast @crypto_blkbeard tweeted early on Tuesday, while drawing attention to the golden cross on the daily chart.      Meanwhile, @themooncarl informed his 21,000 Twitter followers the golden cross is a sign momentum has shifted in favor of the bulls.      So far, however, the buoyant mood surrounding the cross event has not translated into keener buying. That's evident from bitcoin's failure to keep gains above $9,800 during the early European trading hours and the subsequent drop to levels below $9,700 – the support of the trendline rising from Jan. 3 and Jan. 26 lows.      Prices now risk falling below the 2020 uptrend line. At press time, bitcoin is trading close to the trendline support at $9,723.    Daily chart    Bitcoin defended the ascending trendline on Sunday with a doji candle, neutralizing the immediate bearish view put forward by Saturday's close below $10,000.      Sellers did penetrate the rising support on Monday, but the breakdown was short-lived, as evidenced by the cryptocurrency's UTC close back above the level.      The two-day defense of the key support has so far failed to entice the bulls – as has the golden cross. Instead, the cryptocurrency charted a shallow bounce that later fell from the Asian session high of $9,825 to $9,700, a sign of weakening of bullish sentiment      Additionally, the five- and 10-day averages have produced a bearish crossover and the MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line. So, a deeper drop toward the support at $9,200 cannot be ruled out.      On the higher side, a move above Sunday's doji candle high of $10,051 is needed to revive the bullish setup, as discussed Monday.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin's upside break of the descending trendline confirmed during the Asian trading hours was short-lived. The failed breakout, coupled with the rising-wedge breakdown, suggests scope for an extension of the ongoing sell-off from recent highs above $10,400.      Supporting the bearish case, the relative strength index has formed a downside break of the rising trendline.      The bear case would weaken if prices rise above $9,825 during the U.S. trading hours. That would shift risk in favor of a move into bullish territory above Sunday's high of $10,051.

The company announced the news Tuesday, saying the Enjin Platform allows game engineers to take advantage of decentralized inventory, to integrate blockchain-based gaming and non-gaming assets, and to manage economic game play mechanics.      “Our platform is designed to integrate seamlessly into new and existing games alike, providing a competitive edge to studios of all sizes and across all genres,” said Enjin CEO Maxim Blagov in a press release.      The Enjin Platform is a suite of tools and services based on a web interface that supports ethereum's ERC-1155 token standard, which developers can use to integrate both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a single smart contract. NFTs, often used for so called crypto collectibles, are tokens that are able to have different and unique characteristics.      The platform also utilities the firm's own token, Enjin coin (ENJ), which is used as a ""minting resource"" to back the value of of in-game assets.      More than 2,500 projects making use of ERC-1155 have already been created on the testnet version of the Enjin Platform, according to the company. The standard is the same technology behind Microsoft’s Azure Heroes blockchain-based contributor rewards program.      The blockchain gaming company has more in the works, too, with Enjin confirming its development roadmap for Q2 2020 includes the public release of the blockchain software development kit (SDK) for Godot, its open-source game engine.      “For the last 12 years, minting, deploying and managing blockchain assets has been a challenging process that required specialized knowledge, but this all changes today,” said Enjin CTO Witek Radomski.",POSITIVE,ENJ,BLOCKCHAIN | ENJ | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/18/enjin-launches-game-development-platform-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a500a2c8a0fbce492d4b1212fcdfd2122dfc2a3-1392x752.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411661,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glXT9L,1582019166,Erik Voorhees: Within Five Years There Will Be a Major Financial Meltdown and Crypto Will Be Ready,"I first met Erik Voorhees in Amsterdam, back in the summer of 2018, while covering a fintech conference called Money20/20. The conference was a circus. (Literally a circus, complete with trapezes artists, mimes and a unicyclist.) The panels focused on stuff like artificial intelligence, biometrics at the cash register and how to use big data.  But where was bitcoin (BTC)? Where was blockchain? Sure, there were some panels on cryptocurrencies – maybe 15 percent of the total – but if we’re predicting the “future of money,” why didn’t blockchain have a starring role?  This is where Voorhees comes in. After his panel in Amsterdam, I asked the ShapeShift CEO why crypto didn’t have a stronger presence in the conference, and whether that bugged him. He basically told me, in a friendly way: you’re looking at it wrong. “I went to the second Money20/20 in Vegas a few years ago, and we were the only crypto-company there,” he said. “No one knew what bitcoin was. It was just a joke to some people. And now there are a couple dozen panels here. Money20/20 is about the banks, but even here, crypto is making a big impact.”  Voorhees looked at the conference, and the world, with a wider lens. He zoomed out. This strikes me as a useful metaphor for today’s blockchain space. It’s easy to look around and grumble, Why aren’t more people using crypto? Where’s the merchant adoption? Where are the use cases? It’s easy to get jaded.  Yet, Voorhees has been around since near the dawn of crypto (or 2011, technically), and he’s been enriched and bruised by the ups and downs. He survived the collapse of BitInstant, one of the first bitcoin exchanges. He created SatoshiDice – which, for better or worse, remains one of blockchain’s most successful implementations. The Wall Street Journal accused him of laundering $9 million at ShapeShift. (He disputes this.) In 2018, against every one of his libertarian principles – but for legal survival – he swallowed the medicine of implementing KYC on ShapeShift and says it “gutted” the company, forcing him to lay off 37 employees, a third of his staff.  Yet, here he is, still looking at the bigger picture, still bullish, still the happy-warrior-libertarian who rails against taxes (“I am morally opposed to taxation”), government (“I don’t think the federal government should exist at all”) and certain cryptocurrency regulations (“totally crazy,” “nuts”). Now, in the wake of the revamped ShapeShift exchange (which he frequently touts as zero-fee and non-custodial) and new FOX token, Voorhees feels primed for a comeback.  So I headed to the top secret ShapeShift offices in Denver, something of a blockchain hub, for a leisurely conversation with Voorhees. (Why Denver? I had assumed it was because of Colorado’s crypto-friendly regulations, but Voorhees tells me, with disarming honesty…not really – Denver is just a pleasant place to live. He’s not wrong.) In a wide-ranging interview, he opens up about the mistakes he made at ShapeShift, why the maximalists are short-sighted, why Libra could be good for crypto, his thoughts on Bernie Bros (not a fan!), why the price of bitcoin will hit $1 million (not a typo), and how we will soon – in the next several years – see the crumbling of the financial systems and the “twilight of fiat.”  COINDESK: You’re both the CEO of ShapeShift, but you’re also a “thought leader” who promotes bitcoin and crypto. How do you balance this?  Erik Voorhees: It's hard. I can't be as outspoken as much as I would like on controversial issues. As CEO, I have to be extremely careful about what I say, in terms of regulations and government. And I love talking about that stuff. So that's been really hard. But building a business is the greatest challenge that I've ever come across, and is really rewarding.  Well, since you mentioned regulation… Your current thoughts on BitLicense in New York?  Voorhees: I mean, it's the worst thing that New York has ever done in terms of financial regulation of cryptocurrency. There have only been around 15 licenses issued. Imagine the entire state of New York, one of the most populous in the country – and with the largest financial industry – and you only have 15 startups that have permission to do crypto projects. Totally crazy. The BitLicense application itself – I would recommend you try reading it, if you never have. It's 35 pages.  Just the application? 35 pages?  Voorhees: Just the application and questions. And it does things like making every shareholder get a background check. Let's say your grandmother invested in your little crypto startup because she thinks you're great, and she gave you $10,000 to start your business. If this was in New York you would have to have your grandmother go do a background check with the FBI.  I mean, my grandma's pretty shady.  Voorhees: For most of the companies that have applied for BitLicense, the application ends up being like 100 to 300 pages of documents. Just to apply for the permission to build a new business! And then there’s the whole story of Ben Lawsky, and what he did there is pretty atrocious. He created the regulation, and then he leaves and starts his own practice where he's helping companies navigate the regulation. So he enters private practice, charging companies to help navigate the rules and restrictions that he created. Horribly corrupt. And I don't know how that's not some kind or fraud or corruption crime, but apparently, that's totally legal.  Then after he did that for a couple years, he goes and joins the board of Ripple. So Ripple's paying him a gazillion dollars to basically help advise them on how to avoid these kind of regulations. The whole thing is just so corrupt, and the idea that the BitLicense was helping consumers is nuts. Like, ShapeShift actually built something that helped consumers, by not holding their money and not taking their personal information, which almost always gets hacked. We actually built something that protects consumers, and then the BitLicense basically made our business illegal.  So those are my thoughts on BitLicense.  We actually built something that protects consumers, and then the BitLicense basically made our business illegal.  Other than that, you love it. On that note, what do you think about the Federal Reserve, or central bank, potentially adopting digital currencies?  Voorhees: Yeah, so this is a hot topic in the last month or so. Their currency is already digital. The dollar's already digital. It’s backed by nothing. So when people bring up things like “central bank digital currencies,” what are they actually talking about? Are they talking about the dollar being on a blockchain? And if so, obviously the blockchain would not be permission-less, or open. It's going to be a permissioned blockchain that the Fed controls.  Fair…  Voorhees: And obviously, the Fed is not going to limit its own ability to create money. So basically, the two reasons that bitcoin is so cool - 1) the openness and the permissionless-ness, and 2) the fact that you know exactly how many units exists, and no one can inflate it - are all gone. So what the hell is the point of a digital dollar? It'll be no different than today's digital dollar, which just exists in bank accounts.  So you're not a fan?  Voorhees: It's not that I'm not a fan. [Laughs.] It's just not anything different than what dollars are now. It's kind of like this marketing gimmick for the central banks to feel like they're doing something. But dollars are already digital. Euros are already digital.  So you’re saying it might not be any worse than the current system, but it won’t add much value?  Voorhees: It will be worse than the current system, in that it will be easier to surveil and control. So it'll give the government more power over controlling it.  You’ve been critical of the maximalists, calling them shortsighted. What do you mean by that?  Voorhees: Yeah, it's shortsighted because if some of bitcoin’s virtue is its decentralization, then you have to realize that other blockchains increase the decentralization. They're different communities, different people, they have different mining algorithms, they have different incentive structures. They optimize for different features. So if you're for decentralization, but you're in favor of just one single monolithic chain, there's something in your brain that's not connecting.  Okay, on the subject of “different communities,” what do you think about Libra?  Voorhees: Yeah, I think Libra's awesome.  Wow, “Awesome?” I wasn’t expecting that!  Voorhees: Because first of all, it's freaking out all the governments of the world. Anything that does that is good.  But it’s not open-permission…  Voorhees: It’s not all open permission like bitcoin. But it’s also not just a digital dollar. It's actually a new currency with a basket of assets that back it. Some fiat and bonds and securities. And that new asset is sort of a super-national currency, created not by a government but by a private company. And I think that's an amazing step for society.  If it becomes widely adopted, the dollar loses some of its value. Facebook has more users than the U.S. has citizens.  You're not concerned about potential bad actors at Facebook or too much centralization?  Voorhees: I mean, none of it's more centralized than the dollar. So I see it in contrast to how the dollar works, and in fiat. Everyone around the world is using fiat and then here comes, finally, a private money created by a private company. It's still centralized, but a private company's money I would take any day of the week over a government money. So in that way, I think it's superior to fiat.  And it helps people think, Okay, well maybe it's not just governments that can make money. If they broke out of that spell, then they would realize that, Okay, there are different monies out there, and they have different attributes. And maybe I should be thinking more about what makes money good or bad.  Do you have any sense, in your gut, of whether the Libra will succeed?  Voorhees: So one big question is, will it launch at all? And that’s maybe 50/50. The other big question is, will it launch in its current form, or will it get watered down to basically just be a digital dollar? And there's a strong chance that that will happen, which would suck. The reason the government, especially the U.S. government, is so concerned about it is because, if it becomes widely adopted, the dollar loses some of its value. Facebook has more users than the U.S. has citizens.  That's a staggering fact.  Voorhees: By a significant amount. Facebook's coin is a credible threat to the dollar over the short term, over five-ish years. I think bitcoin's a credible threat over 10 or 20 years.  So, on to bitcoin: Are you concerned at all that there’s not more merchant adoption?  Voorhees: I think we got it backwards. So in the early days of bitcoin, it was all about merchant adoption. It was like, okay, this is a better form of money. When enough merchants accept, it'll just start to become ubiquitous, and that's how it takes over. That hasn't happened for a number of reasons, and yet bitcoin and crypto, as an industry, has grown at least as much as we hoped it would. I think merchant adoption will end up being at the tail end of the adoption.  When will that happen?  Voorhees: That will occur when lots of people have crypto. Because merchants will say, “Well, I should definitely accept this, because there’s 50 million with it.” And that'll sort of be the tail end, not the leading. And I think we all were wrong about that.  Interesting. Are you more or less bullish of cryptocurrency now than you were, let's say, in 2018?  Voorhees: More.  Why?  Voorhees: Each year that goes by that it hasn't failed, it’s more likely to succeed. Each year that goes by, it becomes more normal. Nowadays, if you ask a random person on the street if they've heard of bitcoin, nine out of 10 of them will say yes. In 2011, 10 out of 10 would have said no. And it has shed some of its shady perceptions.  What excites you most about the space right now, besides things you’re personally working on?  The DeFi [Decentralized Finance] stuff that's happening is so cool. The DeFi stuff built on top of stablecoins.  What about it, specifically?  Voorhees: It's a real use case, and it works really well. A normal person can turn $10,000 of dollars into USD stablecoin. No volatility, backed by Coinbase, which is at least as reputable as a bank. And then they can be earning 3 or 5 percent interest on that. Sometimes in a trustless way. And anyone in the world can do this. Someone in Australia or Africa or Asia can all access these open money markets just from a phone. That's really powerful.  Okay, getting to ShapeShift – you often mention that the exchange has zero trading fees. I get the sense from you that it’s not just a marketing gimmick, but something deeper there about no fees…almost a philosophical principle. Am I right on that?  Voorhees: No, you're not.  [Both laugh.]  Voorhees: Zero fees, we implemented for two reasons. One, because we needed a better messaging hook to get people to understand what the new ShapeShift was.  And the second?  Voorhees: Trading is very much a commoditized business. And those fees are going to decline over time. So why not just get out ahead of that?  Smart.  Voorhees: What matters more ideologically to us, at ShapeShift, is the self-custody aspect. Nearly all of the major crypto companies are custodial – the Coinbases, the Binances. And if the whole cryptocurrency movement just results in a bunch of new custodians, nothing really changes, right? But people go to what's easy. So I see ShapeShift as building the easy interface for crypto, that's self-custody.  What can we expect to see in the future from ShapeShift?  Voorhees: We'll go mobile. That’s the next obvious area that we're totally missing right now.  What’s the timeline on that?  Voorhees: Two or three months. Before Consensus, shall we say.  You’ve said that your long-term vision for ShapeShift is “social change.” What does that mean, exactly?  Voorhees: The way I think about it is that I am part of the startup that is crypto. And my long-term vision is that crypto actually changes the entire financial system of the world. My job in that startup is building a piece of it, which is ShapeShift. And ShapeShift's job is to build the best self-custody platform for people. So that crypto doesn't evolve into something where you just have a bunch of new PayPals holding everyone's funds.  Where would you say you are right now as a company?  Voorhees: We've had to rebuild everything from scratch. So in some ways, we're almost a six-year-old company, but in other ways, we're a nine-month-old startup, because we just launched a new product in July.  Right. Can you talk about the KYC implementation, and the fallout?  Voorhees: The KYC stuff happened in fall of 2018. So no longer could we let someone trade one asset for another without an account. Obviously we didn't want to do that. Our customers did not want us to do that. Our partners did not want us to do that, but we felt that it was too legally risky not to do it. So we made that change. It gutted our business, because all of our partners didn't want to use us anymore. They just went with alternatives. So we knew that we would have a huge hit. And it did. It destroyed our entire business.  Not to make you relive one of the worst chapters of your life, but can you elaborate? How much did you lose?  Voorhees: Most of our volume came from these partner wallets that plug into our API.  What are some examples?  Voorhees: You know, like Edge or Coinomi or Exodus or Jaxx. There are a number of these. And their users in their wallet would be able to trade coins seamlessly through our API. Once we required accounts [implemented KYC], that user experience totally broke, because then the wallet would have to send them to some other company, to us, to get an account signed up. And it's just not a good user experience. So I can't say I blame them. But those wallets just dropped us and went with competitors that don't KYC. So what do you do?  In 2017, all our numbers were flying, but we didn't know how to run a business. Now our numbers suck, but we know how to run a business.  What percentage of your customer base did you lose? Was it over, say, 50 percent?  Voorhees: Yeah, I mean, over 95 percent.  Whoa. And yet, hear you are, rebuilding…  Voorhees: Well yeah, so we were already working on the new platform by the time we knew that we would have to do KYC. It was sort of something happening in parallel. It was basically the 2.0 ShapeShift that we conceived in early 2018, and we were already starting to build. And then there was a weird period from the fall of 2018 through July of 2019 when the old product was totally gutted. The new one wasn't out yet, and we had a nine-month period where we were just kind of working on it.  Not to mention, you were in the depths of the bear market.  Voorhees: Right, in a horrible bear market, and that was during the time when we had our layoffs. So that was a shitty time for sure. But it was also fun, because we were rebuilding the new thing, and building new products is always the best.  All of that said, most CEOs talk about the importance of failure, and how their success comes from the seeds of these setbacks. What lessons have you learned?  Voorhees: Oh, yeah, we made so many mistakes in 2017 when we were growing. When you're growing that much, you don't notice the mistakes.  Like what?  Voorhees: Most of us were first-time executives trying to build a business. So we're learning this stuff as we go. Everything from hiring toxic people that shouldn't have been here, to ignoring some of the operational things that a business should do. Like on-boarding and off-boarding new employees. This is something unrelated to crypto. But it’s very important. Most people think that if you need someone, you go hire them. But there's actually a whole art and science to finding good people, bringing them in while onboarding them, acclimatizing them into your culture and teaching them.  We've learned all that stuff now. We've got the business stuff down. In 2017, all our numbers were flying, but we didn't know how to run a business. Now our numbers suck, but we know how to run a business.  On the personal front, how do you stay on top of the latest crypto developments? What’s your news consumption like?  Voorhees: So my pattern is generally Twitter, CoinDesk and then osmosis in the office. Twitter is very shallow but broad information about everything. CoinDesk is for deeper articles about specific things. And then people in the office, that's the entropy. That brings random things to me that I wouldn't know about. But I don't stay on top of it all. I constantly feel like I'm behind. I know a smaller portion of the industry today than I did six years ago.  Really? How is that possible?!  Voorhees: I spend all day, every day in this stuff, and yet I know less today, relatively to the industry than I used to.  Oh, so you mean your absolute knowledge has grown, but because the entire industry has grown so much, the percentage of what you’re current on - the percent of the pie - is smaller?  Voorhees: Right. There's like…entire new chains that are really cool and I know nothing about them.  What are your work hours like?  Voorhees: My hours aren't too crazy. I tend to work 9 [a.m.] to 6 [p.m.] most days.  How do you relax? Are you Netflix binging?  Voorhees: Yeah, Netflix, reading and just hanging out with my little daughter – those kind of things. I like to go out into the mountains, skiing and snowmobiling. Mountain biking.  What are you reading these days?  Voorhees: I've been reading Dune. And usually I’m reading both a fiction and a non-fiction book. So for non-fiction, I'm reading that Andy Grove book, ""High Output Management.""  Let’s talk politics. Do any of the Democratic candidates excite you at all?  Voorhees: No.  No one?  Voorhees: They're all horrible. All of them want to grow the government. All of them. Every single one of them will just grow the government. Every president grows the government. So the Democrats wanna grow it a little bit to the left. The Republicans wanna grow it a little bit to the right. They're actually pretty similar in almost every way. So yeah, I despise all of them. I don't think the federal government should exist at all. And I won't be voting for any of them.  You’ve been critical of the Bernie Bros …  Voorhees: I mean, all they want to do is steal money from other people. Right? They want to get their guy into power so he can take money from group A and give it to group B.  Okay, prediction time! I want three predictions from you: one for the short-term, one for the medium-term and one for the long-term, like 20+ years from now.  Within five years, you have a major financial meltdown. And crypto will probably be ready enough to be a credible alternative for a lot of the world.  Let’s start with something we’ll see in the crypto space this year, in 2020.  Voorhees: I think ETH gets back to all-time highs and DeFi goes a little bit parabolic in growth—I mean in user growth. I also think there will be a bitcoin rally this year, but I don't know if it will get to all-time highs. But I think Ethereum will be.  I think DeFi will be the theme this year. There will be a new set of… sort of ethereum-killer-type chains that are viable now. So there's Cosmos, Cardano, EOS, and maybe two or three others that are credible chains. (And maximalists will hate me for saying that.) They work as they’re supposed to, and they’re not just forks, and they’re innovating in different directions.  How about everyone’s favorite topic, coin dominance?  Voorhees: So I think this year, we're gonna see sort of bitcoin in the lead, of course. Ethereum (ETH) the clear number two. And a set of other smart contract chains that are all proof-of-stake that are vying for that number three spot.  Got it. Predictions for the next, say, three to five years?  Voorhees: In three to five years, the next financial crisis has definitely happened. Now I may have said the three or five years ago also. But I'm gonna restate it now.  [Both laugh.]  How bad do you think it will get?  Voorhees: This debt bubble can't continue. I think within three years, but certainly within five, you have a major financial meltdown. And crypto will probably be ready enough to be a credible alternative for a lot of the world. Not that any one chain can suddenly support every transaction of every person. But there's enough chains doing it, in enough different ways, that have evolved by then, with enough good UX and basic understanding, and trust from the public, that it will become a credible alternative.  This is fascinating. Can you break down a little more what, specifically, that kind of financial crisis would look like, and how crypto benefits? Because I think for a lot of people, they hear that idea and it sort of makes sense, but it also feels really abstract?  Voorhees: So I think there are three levels of financial crisis. There's a normal recession. Which happens normally, and isn't that big of a deal. That's where equities will go down for a while, and there's a year or two of recession.  Then there's sort of a really severe recession like the 2008 and 2009 kind of thing, where people start losing trust in financial institutions. There are large bankruptcies and bailouts of companies.  Then there's a third level, which is what I think will happen. And that is where you're actually getting the collapse of sovereign bond markets. When people realize that there's zero way that those debts get repaid. The only reason people are willing to hold U.S. government bonds is because they assume they can sell it to somebody.  They assume it’s rock solid, yeah.  Voorhees: Yeah, because they can always sell it to some other guy. Which is the definition of the greater fool theory, right? That falls apart at some point. The math doesn't work. So when bond markets fall apart, interest rates will spike, because people will demand vastly higher interest rates to loan money to people, especially to governments.  And this will destroy the whole financial system. Ultimately, what it will mean is the governments will end up printing money to try to solve the problem, just like they did in the last financial crisis.  If this does indeed happen, you need to make sure you’re not caught on camera like Mr. Burns in ""The Simpsons,"" rubbing your hands greedily, saying, ""Excellent. Things are proceeding as I had planned.""  Voorhees: Yes, I know.  [Both laugh.] Be careful.  Voorhees: So they'll print money like they always do, but the quantity that they'll have to print will—in combination with the loss of trust in the bond market—cause actual currency collapses of major fiat currencies.  And that’s the inflection point…  Voorhees: It's that last step that’s really the lynchpin for people to just get out of that stuff, that nonsense, and use real money. Open, transparent blockchains that can't be manipulated by any party, and that you know exactly how many there are. That'll happen within five years. It's gonna be a disaster.  So what happens to the price of bitcoin in that environment?  Voorhees: I mean in that environment, bitcoin is at $1 million.  But it would be crazy and violent and volatile. And it would be very surreal, because at the same time that basically these elites of the financial world are all falling apart, these banks and all that value is getting destroyed, you'll have all these other people—from the whales in bitcoin, to someone who just had a few thousand dollars of bitcoin hanging around, to little startups all over the world in the crypto industry. They suddenly become 100 times more powerful.  Lots of wealthy dudes in hoodies! Wait, this is all going to happen in three to five years?  Voorhees: Yeah, three to five years is when this crazy transition starts. The transition itself is probably five or 10 years long. There will be a really weird wealth and power transformation in a very short amount of time. And that won't happen in some kind of peaceful way. That will be really kind of scary and probably violent, where the people losing power do everything they can to prevent this process, but it's inevitable and can't be stopped. That transition will be the financial story of the century. That will be written about for hundreds of years. This is the twilight of fiat.  “Twilight of fiat.” Nice turn of phrase.  And after that happens, when people look back on how fiat and banks worked, and children are taught about this stuff in school, it'll all seem so preposterous that people used money that was created out of thin air, and they thought that had value. And the government could just make as much of it as they want. And people were okay with that. And you had this high council of high bankers that every couple weeks would release statements in which algorithms all over the world would look at each little word to see what changed, and billions of dollars in the markets would move based on the slight edits to the words coming out of the Federal Reserve. That will look absolutely preposterous.  This is how I feel about self-driving cars. Decades from now, people will look back at manual-driving cars and say, “What? You people actually DROVE those things yourselves?!” Because manual cars cause so many accidents!  Voorhees: I know. It bothers me, too. I look forward to when all the cars are automatic. There's some scary surveillance stuff with that, but it's inevitable.  All right, on that note, give me a long-term prediction. How about 20 to 40 years from now?  Voorhees: So at that point, 20 years on, finance will work with purely digitized open systems. And I don't know if it'll be blockchains or something that's surpassed them by then. But open, decentralized transparent systems where they are algorithmically trustworthy.  I appreciate your open-mindedness, that the ultimate solution might be blockchain, but it might not.  Voorhees: It doesn't really matter. The point is that the good features in bitcoin and blockchains will be there. And maybe it'll still be bitcoin, and maybe bitcoin is still the standard 20 years from now. But the point is, it'll be open, anyone will be able to use it, it will be borderless, and it'll kind of be like… mathematics, or language. Maybe language isn’t a good example…  …Maybe music?  Voorhees: Or music, right. Where there’s a set of rules that everyone in the world uses, and math and music are not set by nation states. They're cultural and they're open. Money and finance will work like that. 20 years from now, people will not have fiat bank accounts.  Governments will still be around though, right?  Voorhees: Of course. I'm not that lucky. [Laughs.]  You’re well-known as a libertarian. I’m guessing you must be frustrated that people have certain stereotypes of libertarians, or have some misconceptions?  Voorhees: The biggest misconception is that libertarians, and/or anarchists, are against order and against governance. I'm very much pro-order and pro-governance. The key theme for a libertarian is that that stuff should emerge through peaceful means, versus coercive means.  What do you mean, exactly?  Voorhees: If you look around you, there's order all over the place, right, in markets and in nature. A tree grows, and it has order to it, and structure. But no one commanded the tree. It was an organic process that was decentralized.  That feels almost Buddhist.  Voorhees: There's a lot of overlap and themes in nature, and how the markets work. So I think the best kind of libertarian is someone who's just seeking order through peaceful means, versus coercive means. So the haters are always like, ""Well you hate poor people and want them to die without health insurance."" It's like, “No, I would love everyone to have health insurance. I just don't think you should steal from some other person to give this other guy health insurance."" I don't think that's charity, I think that's theft.  So yeah, that's the major misconception. It’s a misunderstanding of the fact that order can emerge, rather than being imposed by force.  What’s blockchain’s role in all of this?  Voorhees: I think it is a demonstration of this emerging order. Exactly that. There are all sorts of forms of money in the crypto world. Bitcoin is the major one, but there are lots of different competitors with different attributes, and it's messy and chaotic. But there's an order to it, and a rationality to it. And these various projects from all over the world, there's no central person coordinating all this stuff. There's no person setting the monetary policy of crypto. It's an emerging order and it's peaceful.  This is what’s so powerful about that: It takes the major way that governments control people, which is through control of the financial system, and it provides an alternative that even the most powerful government in the world can't stop. And there's something incredibly magical about that.
