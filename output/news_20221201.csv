42413533,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9dgm,1669932900,Crypto Markets Today: CFTC Chair Proposes Pause to Overhaul Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Bill,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX might not have happened if the firm was under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's watch, the agency's head argued Thursday.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, testifyingbefore the Senate Agriculture Committee at the first of several congressional hearings expected on FTX, said his agency couldn't have prevented the collapse because FTX wasn't an entity regulated by his agency.  Behnam asked the lawmakers for broader authority to directly oversee spot cash market exchanges, which aren't regulated by any federal agency now (tokens that are deemed securities are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission).  Most of the senators didn't seem to make much of a distinction between FTX US, the company operating within the U.S., and FTX.com, the global exchange based in the Bahamas. FTX.com has been facing broader issues, including apparently sending customer and corporate funds to Alameda Research, a trading firm that's affiliated with FTX.  Benham said the DCCPA would have banned the commingling of customer and corporate money and also require better corporate governance and actual bookkeeping. He said this sort of activity would have been prohibited if the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), the bill sponsored by committee heads senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.), had been in effect.  Benhnam suggested revisiting the bill to ensure it addresses possible misconduct that may occur at other companies.  Other News  In a highly anticipated interview at Wednesday’s DealBook Summit, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried expressed regret over his exchange's collapse, but clung to the narrative that its failure was due to a bet gone wrong. During the interview with the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bankman-Fried didn't answer many of the questions investors would want answered, nor did he deliver the mea culpa many crypto industry observers have hoped to hear from the 30-year-old former crypto billionaire. “I didn’t ever try to commit fraud,” he said.  “Gas tax:” Coinbase has disabled non-fungible token (NFT) transfers on its iOS wallet app because of a dispute with Apple over the company’s in-app purchase policy. Taking to Twitter on Thursday, Coinbase said Apple is demanding it pay its gas fees using Apple software, which would make those gas fees subject to Apple’s 30% app tax.  U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks on Wednesday signaled a likely slowing down in interest rate hikes as soon as the central bank’s mid-December meeting, causing mixed results in equity markets. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.09% and 0.56%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.13%. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis firm DataTrek Research, wrote in a note that as much as Powell is “trying to contain investors’ animal spirits by talking about persistently high interest rates, markets are rejecting that message.” Colas added, “Instead, [markets] are looking through his rhetoric and think they see the inflection point for monetary policy.”  Altcoin Roundup  Polygon: Polygon-based applications can soon run on fully decentralized application programming interface (API) operating on indexing service The Graph, away from the current hosting service. Joining Web3, The Graph Network will allow Polygon developers to find the data they need to improve the efficiency of their decentralized applications (dapps), according to a Thursday post. Polygon’s MATIC token surged earlier in the day and was recently trading up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.  Solana: Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), has integrated with payments heavyweight Stripe to power its fiat-to-crypto transactions.

In response to Apple's ( AAPL ) demands, Coinbase ( COIN ) said it cannot comply with the requirement ""even if we tried"" due to the fact that the iPhone maker's in-app purchase system does not support crypto. Apple ( AAPL ) ""has introduced new policies to protect their profits at the expense of consumer investment in NFTs and developer innovation across the crypto ecosystem,"" said Coinbase, while noting the 30% tax makes it a ""lot harder"" to transfer NFTs to other wallets. In response to the policy change, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said “When someone imposes rules that can’t be followed, you should ask why.""

42413529,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9deu,1669931785,US CFTC Commissioner Cites Latest Crypto Sanction in Call for New Rules,"As the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission awaits legislation to establish its place in crypto oversight, Commissioner Kristin Johnson says the agency should start using its existing powers to strengthen requirements for keeping customers’ assets safe.  The CFTC should tap “existing authority to further mitigate potential risks to all customer assets,” Johnson said in a statement on Thursday, citing the cryptocurrency industry drama ignited by the detonation of the FTX exchange. She labeled her statement a “call to action” against digital-assets fraud.  “Liquidity crises and a lack of responsible governance at cryptocurrency exchanges and other prominent crypto-intermediaries have roiled the digital asset ecosystem,” Johnson said. “A series of bankruptcy filings reveals a grim portrait of some of the most egregious corporate governance and risk management failures in recent financial markets history.”  Johnson made the statement as the CFTC sanctioned another crypto industry player: Jeremy Spence, who as “Coin Signals” was convicted of defrauding investors for $5 million and was imprisoned earlier this year on a 42-month sentence.  Still, any agency rule-making will only extend to the firms currently regulated or that are seeking to register. That’s part of the problem that’s been repeatedly underlined by agency leaders, including Chair Rostin Behnam in testimony in the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday. He explained that his agency is hamstrung by limitations that only let it reach FTX’s derivatives-trading arm, the affiliate formerly known as LedgerX.  Specifically, crypto spot markets currently lack any federal regulatory oversight. The CFTC’s jurisdiction ends at derivatives platforms and potential fraud within the underlying commodities markets.  While Behnam told lawmakers he couldn’t comment on any potential enforcement actions against FTX, he also said that “enforcement cases take time, but we’re moving expeditiously.” He also described his enforcement team as “laser-focused on this right now.”  In her statement, Johnson also predicted a wave of mergers and acquisitions in crypto.  “As we unravel the tangled web of interconnected financial transactions and relationships among cryptocurrency trading platforms facing liquidity crises, we should anticipate a season of mergers, acquisitions and consolidation,” she said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/01/us-cftc-commissioner-cites-latest-crypto-sanction-in-call-for-new-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d9fac63bf692475387cdfb0b3e58fb851370fe8-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Supply & demand both dwindling, who wins? https://t.co/pZN96vS27a — Evan Kirkpatrick (@evankirkpatrick) December 1, 2022 The Fed might be willing to pivot on its monetary policy in this context, thus allowing Bitcoin and risk-on assets to rally and extend their bullish momentum. However, Director of Macro for investment firm Fidelity Jurrien Timmer believes it might be too soon to call a victory. The experts claim many other factors to consider before calling the bottom. In equities, a sector that Bitcoin is following closely, the next earnings seasons will be crucial. Companies must show growth early next year, or the stock market will risk another blow. So far, Timmer believes the chances of significant growth are “unlikely” as measured by the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). This index measures the state of the manufacturing and service sectors. The metric offers a view of the current and future health of businesses. The chart below shows that the metric has room to keep crashing. Based on the PMI cycle, the market might see an effective relief in 2024, which has a confluence with the Bitcoin Halving. This event is a major bullish catalyzer for Bitcoin. Timmer said: (…) It seems premature to expect a bottom for earnings anytime soon. If earnings growth won’t bottom for another year or longer, then an October price bottom seems rather ambitious. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Usher In December Near $18,000 If It Moves Past This Resistance However, Timmer also clarified that there is a precedent in which stocks rallied before a good earnings season. The market experience these rallies in the 1970s and 1990s, but as mentioned, this possibility is unlikely in the current environment. Of course, in our current cycle, earnings growth peaked coincident with price, so the market might follow a more conventional playbook rather than repeat that hopeful outlier from the early 1970s. /END — Jurrien Timmer (@TimmerFidelity) December 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-hits-17000-but-is-it-too-early-to-call-the-all-clear-on-the-bear-market/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5023055.jpeg

42420849,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVgj,1669925551,Crypto Market Analysis: Ether’s Recent Strength vs. Bitcoin Reaches Key Crossover Signal,"Ether's price has outperformed bitcoin over the past 10 days, increasing 15.4% versus BTC's 7.7% rise.  Momentum in the ETH/BTC pairing over the same time period spiked 39%, using the 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a proxy for price acceleration. The RSI is a technical indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes for an asset. It can be used by investors to determine the speed of price movement, allowing it to be compared to past price levels.  The current RSI for the ETH/BTC pair is 57.22. Filtering for RSI levels above 55 but below 58 for data dating to 2017 yields inconclusive results. In more than 1,845 observations, the RSI for the ETH/BTC pair has fallen within this range just 116 times.  The average seven-day return following each occurrence was 2.1% higher. The 30-day return was a much less impressive 0.1% increase, implying that prices have tended to trail off.  The potential crossing of the ETH/BTC 10-day moving average above the 100-day moving average is poised to occur Thursday. This so-called moving average crossover occurs when a shorter time frame moving average crosses above a longer period moving average. A positive crossover is often a bullish sign.  Data over the same time period shows positive results, but also highlights how infrequently it has occurred. Since 2017, data shows that the 10-period moving average of the ETH/BTC pair has crossed above the 100-period moving average just 16 times.  Over that time frame, the average seven-day return following the crossover was 1.5% higher, while the average 30-day return expanded to 6.1%.  The data suggests that a crossover is either such a rare occurrence that it should be exploited immediately, or that the sample size isn’t large enough to come to a definitive conclusion.

42413526,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9daE,1669925517,November Jobs Report Due Friday as the Fed's Powell Confirms Slower Pace of Rate Hikes,"Speaking Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell more or less confirmed what has been suggested for weeks – that this month the central bank was going to ratchet back the pace of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points.  Equity markets soared on the news, led by the Nasdaq’s 4.5% advance. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied as well, briefly topping $17,000 from the mid-$16,000 area (it’s trading at $16,900 at press time). The rallies were somewhat surprising as bets on a smaller-than-usual rate hike in December barely changed after Powell’s comments on Wednesday.  According to the CME’s FedWatch Tool, after Powell's address market participants saw a 77% chance of a 50-basis point move coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee's mid-December meeting, up a hair from 76% prior to the Fed chair’s speech.  The small change signals that traders may be waiting for more data from the jobs report on Friday.  November’s payroll report from the Labor Department on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show 200,000 added jobs, according to economists polled by FactSet. That would be down from 261,000 in October and the slowest monthly increase in hiring in two years.  “I don’t think a weak report is a non-event,” said Bob Iaccino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. “The probability hasn’t really moved much, which tells me that 50 basis points is not truly priced in yet,” he added.  While a slowing pace of job growth might signal the Fed is getting its wish of a weaker economy and possibly less inflationary pressure, Powell on Wednesday reminded it’s not necessarily enough. He noted another survey showing there remains a lofty 1.7 job openings for every person searching for a job.  “So far we have seen only tentative signs of moderation of labor demand,” Powell said, pointing out only “modest” declines in wage growth that remains well above where the Fed would like it to be.  “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing,” he said. “But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/01/november-jobs-report-on-deck-as-powell-confirms-slower-pace-of-rate-hikes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98ad6a0b1c7bddfb62e71a40e5c3cbff420ec187-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413530,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9dc6,1669922467,CFTC Chairman Suggests 'Pause' to Overhaul Senate Bill Following FTX Debacle,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX may not have happened if the firm was under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's watch, the agency's head argued Thursday.  CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam, testifying in the first of several congressional hearings on FTX before the Senate Agriculture Committee, said his agency couldn't have prevented the collapse because FTX wasn't an entity regulated by his agency. He asked the lawmakers for broader authority to directly oversee spot cash market exchanges, which aren't regulated by any federal agency now (tokens that are deemed securities are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission).  Most of the senators didn't seem to make much of a distinction between FTX US, the company operating within the U.S., and FTX.com, the global exchange based in the Bahamas. FTX.com has had the broader issues, including apparently sending customer and corporate funds to Alameda Research, a trading firm that's affiliated with FTX.  Still, this sort of activity would be prohibited if the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), a bill sponsored by committee heads Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) had been a law, Behnam said.  The DCCPA would ban the commingling of customer and corporate money and also require better corporate governance and actual bookkeeping, Behnam said. Still, he suggested revisiting the bill to ensure it addresses possible misconduct that may occur at other companies.  ""Given the circumstances of the past few weeks, I think we should take a pause and look at the bill and make sure there are no gaps or no holes,"" he said. ""Where the bill may be strengthened [is] disclosures around financial information of the entity, the crypto entity and conflicts of interest, obviously an issue that many members have talked about today, given the brazen conflicts that occurred at the non-regulated entity.""  With or without a pause, Behnam stressed the importance of moving quickly to pass legislation that could give his agency greater oversight of spot markets.  ""Strengthening the bill and filling the gaps is one thing. We need to move forward as soon as possible. We don't want this to happen again in the next few months and have the risk of customers losing money because of these gaps,"" he said.  Behnam said at present all of the CFTC's crypto-related enforcement activities are tied to tips and whistleblowers, saying ""that is not healthy."" He wants his agency to be able to spot possible issues itself.  ""We need registration of exchanges. We need surveillance of market activity. We need direct relationships with custodians who are holding customer money so that we can prohibit and prevent money moving around,"" he said. ""There are so many tools in a comprehensive regulatory framework that will put us as boots on the ground in the entity to prevent all of these illegal activities.""",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/01/cftc-chair-suggests-pause-to-overhaul-senate-bill-following-ftx-debacle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b44f34c5e7d30560a5cee92b2def89273b1540a-4899x3266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm performs Bitcoin mining operations in various locations worldwide. IREN has suffered due to the dropping price of Bitcoin and rising hashrate and mining difficulty and may lose large parts of its mining fleet to lender repossession. My outlook for IREN is to Sell the stock. A Quick Take On Iris Energy Iris Energy ( IREN ) went public in November 2021, raising approximately $232 million in gross proceeds from an IPO priced at $28.00 per share. The firm operates as a Bitcoin mining company using primarily renewable energy to power its mining operations. Given the extremely unfavorable bitcoin mining market and the company's apparent SPV financing default status, my opinion on IREN is to Sell the stock. Iris Energy Overview Sydney, Australia-based Iris was founded to operate Bitcoin mining computers that seek to use renewable energy as a power source. Management is headed by co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts, who has been with the firm since inception and was previously employed at Macquarie Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers with experience in the finance, renewables and infrastructure industries. The firm has been mining Bitcoin since 2019 and does not hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The market value for mining depends on the price of Bitcoin, since the majority of value going to the miner is a function of the current Bitcoin reward rate of 6.25 Bitcoin per successfully mined block.

Commentary On Iris Energy In its last earnings call ( Source - Seeking Alpha), covering FQ4 2022’s results, management highlighted the shift in bitcoin mining from a previous emphasis on the computing component to a current emphasis on energy and infrastructure. Iris hasn’t held bitcoin on its balance sheet as a matter of policy, liquidating its bitcoin rewards on a daily basis. In recent quarters, the company has energized its large purchases of mining computers, so revenue from bitcoin mining has risen despite the fall in the price of each bitcoin. As to its financial results, however, with the fall of bitcoin’s price, the firm has yet to make a profit. Furthermore, operating income has turned negative in the most recent reporting period. Additionally, the company holds its bitcoin mining fleet inside subsidiaries [SPVs] that are financed by lenders that have limited recourse to the main corporate entity. Instead, they have recourse to the mining equipment itself, subject to the terms of those financing agreements. The company recently published an update on the status of those SPVs, indicating that the two larger SPVs are not generating enough cash to pay their debt obligations and their value is well below lending agreement requirements. Management is seeking to negotiate additional terms to those agreements but has not divulged the current status of those negotiations. In the meantime, the company has sold some pre-paid miners to a third party for net cash of $8.6 million. The stock was recently downgraded by Cantor Fitzgerald as the firm believes Iris will not be able to renegotiate its financing arrangements and revenue will fall precipitously once those mining computers are repossessed by the lenders. The primary risk to the company’s outlook is the continued low price of bitcoin combined with an enormous overhang in hash power, resulting in an unprofitable net hash price. Given the extremely unfavorable near-term bitcoin mining market and the company's apparent SPV financing default status, my opinion on IREN is to sell the stock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561790-iris-energy-faces-miner-loss-as-economics-worsen?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5021167.jpeg

42413518,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9dSk,1669921200,Magic Eden Launches Protocol to Enforce Creator Royalties,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden has updated its position on creator royalties, saying Thursday that it is launching a protocol that will enforce royalties on all new collections that opt-in to using the tool.  The Open Creator Protocol (OCP) is an open-source tool built on top of Solana's SPL managed-token standard and will give creators launching new collections the choice of whether they want to have royalties protected. Beginning Dec. 2, Magic Eden will enforce royalties on all collections that adopt the standard and will give creators the option of banning marketplaces that don't enforce royalties.  For creators that don't adopt OCP for their NFTs, royalties will remain optional on the platform.  ""The Solana community has been waiting for solutions to NFT royalties,” Jack Lu, CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden, said in a press release. ""Our intention with Open Creator Protocol is to immediately support royalties for creators launching new collections while continuing to coordinate with ecosystem partners for more solutions.”  In addition, the new protocol also offers dynamic royalties, a feature that outlines a relationship between an NFT's sale price and royalty amount based on a linear price curve, along with customizable token transferability, which allows creators to gamify the rules of their collection's trading behavior.  Upon launch, the platform will be hosting a free ""Magic Mint"" for users to test out the Open Creator Protocol and its features.  Read more: Retract Royalties, Reduce Revenue: NFT Creators Are Suffering and so Are Marketplaces  The new protocol arrives a month after the top Solana NFT marketplace switched to an optional royalty model, saying in a Twitter thread at the time that the move had ""serious implications for the ecosystem."" Optional royalties favor traders who are looking to sell fast and make a profit.  ""Unfortunately, royalties are not enforceable on a protocol level, so we have had to adapt to shifting market dynamics,"" it said at the time. Several other marketplaces, including X2Y2 and LooksRare, also opted to make creator royalties optional, though the former recently flipped its decision after receiving pushback.  Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea also took a clear stance earlier this month against making royalties optional, noting that the space was ""trending toward significantly fewer fees paid to creators.""  Meanwhile, NFT marketplace Exchange.Art launched a new standard earlier this month called the “Royalties Protection Standard,"" which ensures royalties are enforced on secondary sales of NFTs that originate on its platform.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | SPONSORED | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/01/magic-eden-launches-protocol-to-enforce-creator-royalties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1da4cbff8cce8e7dcb00618dc1ebf2efdda79fc3-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For now, the exchange is trying to keep customers' trust after the collapse of rival exchange FTX by implementing ""proof of reserves,"" which is a way to show customers that their assets are fully backed. But the process has been slow, Hillman said Thursday on CoinDesk's “First Mover” program.  “It will be a multistep process, including bringing in a third-party auditor,” he said. “It takes time to go and be able to conduct an audit of the scope and scale that is required of Binance.”  Read more: Binance, Coinbase Among Crypto Firms Questioned by US Senator After FTX Mess  Binance, alongside other prominent crypto-based companies, is participating in an ""industry recovery initiative"" for Web3 to help fund startups in the industry.

He added that the exchange is “confident” in its reserves, and despite not disclosing how much money is held on its corporate account, the exchange is implementing its Merkle Tree analysis, which is a way users can verify their assets on the platform.

In fact, he advised that the industry “ditch” the word “crypto” altogether.  “Please, if we are going forward, let's not call it crypto anymore. Please, don't call it criminal money. Just call it digital currency or something. Just ditch the crypto,” he said.  Bewicke-Copley – whose official title is Lord Cromwell – said the crypto industry needs to work to get regulators on board, and may need to do some rebranding.  The APPG met to discuss the challenges and opportunities of crypto. Cromwell, a member of the Parliament’s upper chamber, said that U.K. regulators like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are dealing with a tough landscape, and “so all this initial talk about this is a great opportunity and we want to be the center for it, that may be guff that politicians give you.”  The “guff” he was referring to is Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s well-publicized goal of making the U.K. a crypto hub – intentions Sunak had announced in April when he was the finance minister. That was just before a series of high-profile bankruptcies and company collapses crippled the industry and markets.  Andrew Griffith, Sunak’s economics secretary, reiterated the U.K. government’s commitment to turn the country into a crypto hub in the wake of FTX’s demise, saying lawmakers would be “foolish to ignore the potential of the underlying technology” during TheCityUK’s National Conference in Edinburgh on Thursday.  Cromwell took aim at lawmakers’ fear of missing out on the fintech innovations crypto promises.  “You talk about missing the boat. The harbor is full of boats that have been loaded with explosives that are going off all around you, that are sinking. That is the landscape that the FCA is looking at,” he said, adding that the ""bad boats"" should be left at sea to ""burn away.""  All eyes are now on the implosion of failed crypto exchange FTX, but crypto lenders BlockFi, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital have also filed for bankruptcy protection this year. In May, crypto issuer Terraform Labs collapsed and dragged crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital down with it.  Read more: UK's Crypto Agenda Won't Be Derailed by FTX Collapse, Minister Says  Crypto’s ‘Lamborghini phase’ is over  Crypto exchanges and custody providers looking to operate in the country must register with the FCA and comply with the country’s anti-money-laundering rules. On Monday, at the Financial Times crypto summit, APPG Chairwoman Lisa Cameron said the crypto community had complained that adhering to the FCA’s requirement was “difficult.”  Earlier in November, FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi said, “We have refused applications, or they have been withdrawn, 85% of cases, because we have not been satisfied that they would meet the standards that we believe are proportionate and reasonable.”  Just months before the collapse of FTX, the FCA warned U.K. customers that the exchange wasn’t authorized to operate in the country. Cromwell said the regulator breathed a sigh of relief for not letting FTX in.  “The reality is FTX blowing up was about the last straw. There are good bits of crypto. God knows, I have been promoting it long enough. But if you think that you’re cheerfully looked at by the regulator now, you are wrong,” Cromwell said at the meeting.  Industry experts in the room agreed with Cromwell.  “The Lamborghini phase of crypto is over. We need to show utility and how we are going to bring financial prosperity and/or access to the next billion users. That path needs to be laid out very clearly,” Teana Baker-Taylor, the U.K. and European Union vice president of policy and regulatory strategy at stablecoin issuer Circle, said at the APPG meeting.

42413521,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9dRo,1669915701,MakerDAO Community Votes to Hike DAI Rewards to 1%,"The community of MakerDAO, one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, voted to increase the rewards rate for its DAI stablecoin to 1%.  Some 71% of voters favored a 1% hike, the highest available option, during the voting, which ended Thursday.  The rate increase will come into effect on Dec. 13, according to a statement from MakerDAO.  Increasing the rewards known as the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) means that investors can earn a 1% annualized return on their DAI holdings, giving an incentive for investors at a time when decent yields in crypto are scarce. The return is still much lower than what is available for traditional yield-generating assets such as U.S. government bonds.  MakerDAO issues the $5 billion DAI stablecoin, which is backed by more than $7 billion worth of assets in its reserves. The protocol is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in which holders of the protocol’s governance token maker (MKR) can vote on proposals.

Each of CoinGecko’s three timeframes—daily, weekly, and biweekly—showed BTC in a positive light. This is fantastic news for the cryptocurrency market as a whole, as BTC is the dominant currency in the sector. Here’s a quick glance at how Bitcoin is performing of late: Optimistic market movement and surprising investor buying The technical indicators reveal a range of possible outcomes, some bullish and some bearish, but bears are still there There will be no significant price hike this next week. Next year could see a break of the $17,500 barrier It is clear to some that Bitcoin is growing in popularity, as today’s transaction volume reached as much as $7.12 billion. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days Forecast: Bitcoin At $18,000 The $17,000 mark has been mentioned as a key level by several credible Twitter analysts. Recently, Michael Poppe has presented a study predicting that Bitcoin will hit or soar to over $18,000. And yet, is it possible that Bitcoin might reach these heights by December? As they say, anything can happen in crypto. The leading cryptocurrency’s relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought upper half, suggesting a possible pullback. So far, so good on #Bitcoin. Would be nice to hold the previous level of resistance for support (around $16.6K) and then continue towards $18.3K for a good run. pic.twitter.com/vsfoDWWgZB — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 30, 2022 The current price of $17,000 is sustained at $16.8k, which is a somewhat unstable support given the volatility of BTC’s price. This is all within a 4-hour timeframe. The daily timescale is currently quite positive, with the coin’s rise breaking its prior decline. The only thing that could allow it to reach its $18,000 is the rather narrow Bollinger band, which indicates a narrower trading range in the next days. A regression analysis reveals an R value of 0.855, indicating a robust and healthy uptrend in its infancy. MFI confirms this rally with a movement of its own. The money flow index of Chaikin demonstrates complete bullish dominance, limiting the potential impact of an RSI-supported trend correction. If the price falls today, we may see a decline towards the $16,800 support level. The bulls might exploit this support to target the current barrier at $17,500. Slow And Consistent For The Target Investors and traders should remember that the market is highly volatile. The price will rise significantly if a cautious and consistent buying momentum is generated. According to CryptoQuant statistics, BTC holders are in the capitulation phase, as an increasing number of individuals realize their losses. Consider the analysis to be totally theoretical, as this may merely be a glimpse of better things to come for the coin. As the market recovers from the catastrophe, BTC may surpass the $17,500 milestone.

Nubank is a Brazilian Fintech that has recently launched its own cryptocurrency and holds Bitcoin in its balance sheet. Buffett says to buy when others are fearful, and we are reaching maximum fear in Bitcoin today. (Update Note: Originally the published article described the Bitcoin exposure as ""significant"". This adjective has been removed, and we'll leave to to readers to assess the significance of the exposure.) Thesis Summary While Warren Buffett has openly criticized Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), he has actually built some exposure in the asset through his stake in a Brazilian “crypto bank”. This has become increasingly relevant now that Brazil has actually legalized cryptocurrency as a payment method. Banking on Crypto As of February of this year, it is known that Warren Buffett invested $1 billion in Nubank ( NU ), which was labelled as a crypto-friendly bank. After recent events, calling Nubank crypto-friendly might be an understatement. First off, in May, Nubank announced that it would be offering Bitcoin to its customers and that it would also be committing 1% of its portfolio to Bitcoin. That means Warren Buffett is exposed to Bitcoin, even if it is indirectly. Interestingly, Buffett initiated a position in Nubank just as he exited from positions in traditional financial stocks like Visa, Inc. ( V ) and Mastercard Corporation (MA) But there is more. At the beginning of November, NU introduced Nucoin , its own digital currency. For now, Nucoin is being developed with the help of 2000 customers, with the intention of launching officially by 2023. Initially, Nucoin will be a way for customers to receive rewards, but it will also trade as any other cryptocurrency does. Nubank is clearly committed to the idea of crypto, and this is something an investor like Buffett must have been aware of at the time of investing. But is that all he knew? Yesterday, Brazil, the country where Nubank is based, passed a law making cryptocurrencies a legal payment method . This was approved by the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil but still requires the signature of the president. It’s important to understand that this doesn’t mean that crypto is legal tender, like in El Salvador, but it is a step in that direction. Whether by luck or, more likely, foresight, Buffett has interest in an up-and-coming fintech with crypto exposure which is located in a country of 214 million people that just legalized crypto. Do as I say, not as I do Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have made themselves a name as value investors guided by fundamentals and cash flow. This is the foundation of their publicly traded company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) ( BRK.B ). It's hard to justify Bitcoin as a value investment, and this is something that Buffett himself has talked about: ""Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don't know. But the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything,"" Buffett said. ""It's got a magic to it and people have attached magic to lots of things."" Source: Warren Buffett However, Buffett must see some potential in at least some new financial technologies since he sold ""traditional"" financial companies in favour of Nubank. This is also not the first time Buffett has invested in Brazilian fintech. In 2018 he bought 14 million shares, 8% of StoneCo Ltd.'s ( STNE ) IPO. This is a company that offers similar services to Square ( SQ ). Also, while Munger has also positioned himself as a cryptocurrency detractor, he did not speak fondly of fiat currencies in this interview with Yahoo Finance. ""The safe assumption for an investor is that over the next hundred years the (fiat) currency is going to zero."" If fiat can't be trusted either, then what is the solution? Buy When there is Blood on The Streets There is definitely wisdom in Buffett's words, and I am particularly fond of this quote. ""I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful."" Source: Warren Buffett The best time to buy stocks is when everyone is too afraid to. Big panics lead to generational buying opportunities and this can be applied to Bitcoin too. In the 13 years since its inception, Bitcoin has given investors a lot of reasons to panic but has so far never failed to recover. BTC chart (Author's work) Bitcoin has suffered three episodes of +80% drawdowns, which is where we sit now, roughly 74% below the recent peak. The next rally could be very close, and if history is any indication, we should easily be looking at triple-digit returns. Final Thoughts Bitcoin has been dead many times before, and this time is no different in my opinion. In the grand scheme of things, today’s prices offer a great opportunity to buy. Of course, there are always other things to consider, which is why I provide regular analysis on Bitcoin and the crypto markets for my subscribers. With the right approach, you can enjoy the massive gains of Bitcoin while also limiting your risk exposure.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561719-warren-buffett-has-exposure-to-bitcoin-so-should-you?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5015278.jpeg

Those decentralized finance (DeFi) reference rates and indices, which are not tradable futures products, will be calculated and published by CF Benchmarks starting December 19. The move comes in response to rising interest in DeFi projects and a growing need for transparent, regulated and round-the-clock pricing. Recall in October when the companies teamed up to introduce reference rates and indices for avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), filecoin ( FIL-USD ) and tezos ( XTZ-USD ). ""These three new benchmarks, together with Uniswap launched earlier this year, will capture more than 40% of the total value locked in DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain,"" said Giovanni Vicioso, global head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME. The rates allow users ""to confidently and more accurately value cryptocurrency sector specific portfolios and manage price risk around various blockchain-based projects,"" he added. Pricing for the new benchmarks will be provided by a slew of crypto exchanges, including Coinbase Global ( COIN ), Bitstamp, Gemini and Kraken.

Insurance options for miners are severely limited, in part because traditional insurers have had a hard time coming up with plans for the nascent industry. The new ""low cost"" plans protect in case of fire, theft, government action and electrical damage, said Will Foxley, director of content at Compass and a CoinDesk contributor.  ""Bitcoin mining is a burgeoning, young industry. Simple protection products like this should be considered a financial primitive,"" Jameson Nunney, the company's chief strategy officer, said in the statement.  The newly launched product is available to customers hosted in Texas, South Carolina, Nebraska and Oklahoma partner sites. Compass will expand it to other sites after completing the initial rollout to its core clients.  Compass doesn't own the facilities where its clients plug in their machines. It acts as a broker between customers and facilities owners.  ""Our protection plan is one step downstream of an over $75 million insurance policy we've created with our brokers,"" Foxley said.  The mining firm has seen its fair share of trouble in the past few months.

The Tweet implies that this will make it possible for someone to utilize PancakeSwap to “farm” HFT tokens for profit. For a decision to be voted on by PancakeSwap users, it must be supported by the votes of 60% of HFT token holders, as is customary in the DeFi community. Let’s take a quick glance of how CAKE has been performing of late: Overall, the DEX is making great strides When compared to its risk, CAKE’s volatile price and low return make it unappealing If a bearish breach occurs, the price might fall below $3.575 The positive developments for PancakeSwap don’t end here. The DEX made headlines in October when it offered to its community that it switch from the BNB chain to the Aptos mainnet. The overwhelming majority of locals responded favorably to this plan. In contrast, CAKE, PancakeSwap’s native coin, is struggling. From what we can tell, CAKE is on the upward, but a monthly pessimistic comment casts a shadow over the positive picture. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days Not Appealing Enough To Potential Financiers? CAKE may be a sweet-sounding asset, but it is currently performing poorly. After dropping precipitously due to FTX’s demise, the price is now only fluctuating sideways. The token has recovered since then, with recent support being located at $3.943. Its price fluctuates between $4.433 and $3.575 per share. Chart - TradingView As a token, Messari metrics likewise do not look particularly attractive. Sharpe’s ratio is -1.96, indicating a discrepancy between the asset’s inherent risk and return on investment. The asset’s volatility is also at its highest level since June. The technicals are a mixed brew of neutral and bullish indicators. With an R-value of 0.22, regression analysis indicates that the sideways trend will continue. The RSI is on the rise, which may be indicative of a near-term price increase. Can CAKE Once Again Be Tasty? The unexpected stability of the Bollinger band increases the sideways price movement. As most moving averages, including the EMA ribbon, are displaying strong sell signals, the moving averages pose an issue. The support at $3.93 is unquestionably robust, as the red candle currently has a longer bottom wick as a sign of strength. However, the rising triangular formation will provide some support for bears. If the bears gain traction and break through $3.93, investors and traders can take consolation at $3.847, and a drop to $3.575 is possible.

The question remains, though, whether it has enough liquid assets to fund redemptions in the event of financial stress. The stablecoin issuer, based in the British Virgin Islands, disclosed secured loans of $6.1B as of September 30, or 9% of its total assets, compared with $4.1B as of December 31, 2021, or 5% of total assets, according to its website . Those short-term secured loans are ""fully collateralized by liquid assets,"" Tether said, but specified little about the borrowers as well as the specific collateral being accepted. Overall, outsiders are left with only a partial view of Tether's financial health since it does not release audited financial statements. A Tether spokesperson, meanwhile, told The Wall Street Journal that all of the secured loans listed in its latest report were issued and denominated in tether ( USDT-USD ), the world's largest stablecoin (dollar-pegged) by market cap that's widely held by market participants. Unlike other assets that Tether holds, namely U.S. Treasury bills, its loans are not as easily converted to dollars given the possibility that the borrower does not make a payment or if the collateral is not sufficient enough. That, in turn, could prompt investors to redeem their tether ( USDT-USD ) in a time of crisis, otherwise known as a bank run. And the huge drawdowns seen in crypto from a year ago could ""mean that some collateral held by Tether could be worth less than it was when the loans were made,"" The WSJ noted.

That being the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and the contagion it continues to spread across the industry, made evident again this week when crypto lender BlockFi declared bankruptcy.  Of course, we should take note that BlockFi’s difficulties are not at all unexpected because the company began reducing headcount as its value dropped by more than 66% earlier this year. The FTX collapse was just a nail in the troubled firm’s coffin.  All that said, those of us who are experienced investors know that often the times of greatest calamity provide some of the best investment opportunities.  In addition to seeking advice on how to protect and store their own digital assets amid the chaos, the crypto-curious clientele of financial advisors are surely interested in hearing about these opportunities – but where are they?  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Funds  One likely source of opportunity is already being exploited by leading investors like Cathie Wood, chief investment officer of technology-oriented ARK Investment Management: crypto funds.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been trading at as much as a 45% discount to their net-asset value in recent weeks. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.) Several other closed- and open-ended crypto funds have been trading at similarly steep discounts.  Read more: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Buys $1.5M in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Shares  If one feels fairly confident that the value of the digital assets these funds hold will start to rise once again, then buying funds at such a large discount could be the rough equivalent of buying a dollar for 55 cents.  Of course, there’s no guarantee that such funds will trade at a premium to their assets – or even reach par in the future – but most financial assets demonstrate some level of reversion to the mean.  Options and futures  Another potential option for crypto-curious investors seeking a little security: options, according to emailed comments Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Proshares Investments.  “Bitcoin futures-linked ETFs, such as ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), provide a belt-and-suspenders approach,” wrote Hyman. “They use regulated futures to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns, and they do so in the efficient, regulated wrapper of an ETF.”  Hyman noted that ProShares bitcoin futures ETFs have been trading with tight spreads and little deviation from their NAV, despite the recent volatility in crypto asset prices.  Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs  Crypto stocks  Major institutions, including large pension funds such as the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and private investment specialists like Sequoia Capital are writing off millions of dollars of investments in FTX.  As a result of these tax deductions, there should be a bit of a chill in institutional investment into the crypto space as public pensions in particular are scrutinized for their allocations. This chill is also spilling over into retail investors spooked by the swoon in token prices and the wave of bankruptcy filings.  Publicly traded crypto stocks such as Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the Coinbase crypto exchange, have experienced declines in value of nearly 90% from their 52-week peak. While many crypto stocks may have been overvalued during retail investors’ digital gold rush, today’s stock pickers may find opportunities for valuation expansion in some companies.  Sign up: Introducing Our First Newsletter Course: Learn Crypto Investing  Or, you know, just buy the tokens  Despite the recent swoon in token prices, rising uncertainty about their future trajectory and even the doubts about the current crop of crypto tokens’ long-term viability, it might not be such a bad idea just to buy the tokens themselves, according to recent research from the CFA Institute.  Over the past 12 to 18 months, crypto critics have seized upon token prices’ growing correlations to U.S. equity indexes, particularly large-capitalization indexes like the S&P 500 and sector funds like XLK, the iShares ETF covering the U.S. technology sector.  The CFA Institute, in researching asset prices from the past three years, dispelled some of these concerns by finding that five of the largest crypto tokens – BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and ADA – have relatively weak correlations compared to a full range of equity style indexes and sector ETFs. While the correlation is still positive – when the indexes go up or down the tokens follow in the same direction – it's not a one-to-one correlation.  “Cryptocurrencies’ low positive correlation with mutual funds and ETFs may indicate an increase in cross-market trading and signal crypto’s growing popularity,” wrote the CFA Institute’s researchers.  “Moreover, in a rising interest rate environment and amid the diminished efficacy of the traditional 60/40 equity/bond portfolio, crypto’s weak correlation to traditional assets may offer potential diversification benefits for long-horizon investors who can withstand added short-term volatility. Not all cryptocurrencies display the same lack of correlation to traditional assets, however, so investors need to be discerning about which ones they target.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/01/theres-still-investment-opportunity-after-the-fall-of-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac6a3d032d581d964372acc0165d2a120b68a179-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
5011300,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510772,1669901870,Chainlink (LINK) Is About To Launch Staking – These Are The Next Target Zones,"While Chainlink staking v0.1 will go live on the mainnet on December 6, the LINK price has shown a strong performance over the past week. At press time, LINK was trading at $7.58, and thus up 13.5% over the last week. Still, Chainlink has been going sideways for seven months. However, thanks to dovish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell during a speech yesterday, the horizon for relief rallies within the crypto market are widening again. Looking at the daily chart, Chainlink is still in the middle of its 7-month range, yet the introduction of staking could generate much more interest for the project. Related Reading: US Institutional Investors Flocking Back To Bitcoin – Is The Bottom In? LINK has not made new lows within the 1-day time frame recently, which suggests bull strength from a technical perspective. Chainlink (LINK) price has risen 35% since its recent low. Nevertheless, the upper end of the 7-month range remains the next crucial target in the daily chart. If LINK is able to break out, the next target could be the zone around $12.30. On a smaller time frame, LINK is in the middle of its 7-month range, where key resistance zones can also be found. In the 4-hour chart, a correction was recently observed, after which a renewed upswing occurred. From a technical perspective, LINK should not fall below $6.70. Once LINK begins to hold here, it is prudent to look at the $8.50 to $9.50 zone, where the next key resistance is located. Chainlink Staking As Catalyst For A Price Boost? With Chainlink staking v0.1 released on the Ethereum mainnet on December 6, the project aims to complete an iterative approach to developing future versions of staking beyond this initial release. Originally, a lock-in period of 12-24 months, based on a conservative release cycle, was planned. However, after discussions with a number of community members and node operators, it is now clear that a faster iteration with frequent releases, each with a compressed scope, will be the final solution. Related Reading: Polygon Surges 12%, Edging Bitcoin And Ethereum, In Last 24 Hours The next version of staking (v0.2) is now scheduled for release in 9-12 months. At that time, stakers from v0.1 will be able to unlock or migrate their staked LINK and rewards for the first time. On December 6, only a few addresses will initially be eligible for staking. They will be able to stake up to 7,000 LINK worth about $53,000 in a capped staking pool. On December 8, the staking pool will be open to all. Again, there will be an initial cap on the pool of 25 million LINK. As staking reduces the supply of liquid LINK, it could be a potential price catalyst, boosting the Chainlink price out of its 7-month range. Investors should therefore closely watch LINK’s performance over the next two week.",POSITIVE,LINK,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | LINK | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/chainlink-is-about-to-launch-staking-next-target-zones-for-link/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Meanwhile, ether lost 21% during the month. The hardest-hit digital assets were a group of tokens commonly associated with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced ex-CEO of fallen crypto exchange FTX. FTT, the utility token of FTX, tumbled 90% to $1 from $26. Serum (SRM), the native token of a decentralized exchange on the Bankman-Fried-championed Solana blockchain, sank 70%.  Traditional-finance giant TP ICAP has registered as a digital-asset provider with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority. The world’s largest interdealer-broker is attempting to break into the crypto world via its Fusion Digital Assets marketplace. TP ICAP is working with Fidelity Digital Assets to offer the platform, which will match orders and execute spot crypto trades.  Telegram is pushing forward with a buildout of crypto infrastructure. The messaging app, which is already a go-to for many crypto traders, is planning to build crypto wallets. The app has sold $50 million in usernames in less than a month through its blockchain-based auction platform, Fragment, CEO Pavel Durov said Wednesday.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows U.S. financial conditions have eased notably since the release of the October inflation report on Nov. 10.  The more the Federal Reserve pivots away from aggressive liquidity tightening, the greater the loosening of financial conditions and the bigger the risk of the central bank missing its inflation target.  Therefore, the Fed may push back against easing financial conditions, more so as investors on Wednesday focused on Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging the slowing in the rate hikes while ignoring his core message of stubbornly higher core inflation.

42388507,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHuCf,1669900316,Polygon APIs to Soon Deploy on Web3 Indexing Service The Graph,"Indexing service The Graph will soon add support for the Polygon blockchain.  Polygon-based applications can soon run on fully decentralized application programming interface (API) run on The Graph, away from the current hosting service.  Joining Web3 The Graph Network will allow Polygon developers to find the data they need to improve the efficiency of their dapps, according to a Thursday post. Polygon node operators can play a role by becoming indexers for Polygon to serve the decentralized applications (dapps) running on the network. Indexers earn rewards and query fees for the subgraphs they serve.  An API is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. The Graph’s hosting service allowed dapps to index and query user data from multiple blockchains, regardless of the network they were based on.  Projects with complex smart contracts like Uniswap store data on the Ethereum blockchain, making it very difficult to read anything other than basic data directly from the blockchain. This meant developers could face complexities or delays in querying data from other dapps for use in their own products.  Services like The Graph solve this infrastructural problem by indexing blockchain data through the creation of ""subgraphs,” which function similarly to an API and can be queried with a standard GraphQL API, an open-source data query computer language for APIs.  Polygon is the second-biggest supported chain by usage after Ethereum and followed by Gnosis.  The integration of Polygon is part of a broader plan to cease The Graph’s hosted service, which now supports 39 networks, in favor of The Graph’s bespoke decentralized network Gnosis.

The price rose above $17,000, driven by the statement that smaller rate hikes are likely imminent and could begin in December. Ultimately, analysts see a 50 basis point hike in December almost a lock. The FED was merely trying not to make it look dovish, but it will come, was the tenor of the market. On Wall Street, the remarks were met with applause. The Dow Jones and the S&P500 saw a strong relief rally. This euphoria also spread to the crypto market in a muted form.

If this can be overcome, a push into the $17,800 to $18,000 region would be possible, where massive resistance could lurk. US Institutional Demand For Bitcoin Is Coming Back As CrytoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju noted, market sentiment among large investors in the United States is recovering. Ju comes to this conclusion as the hourly BTC price premium on Coinbase has turned positive for the second time since the FTX bank run. The Coinbase Premium Index has long been a reliable indicator of sentiment among institutional investors for the crypto community. It also includes institutional investors, of which Coinbase has the majority, according to its report for the third quarter of this year. The index is rising due to increased trading volume on the exchange, which indicates a return of confidence in Bitcoin from institutional investors.

The funding will accelerate the development and launch of a decentralized content and application delivery network called Fleek Network, which will be released in the spring or summer of 2023.  “Currently, there is a missing piece in the Web3 infrastructure stack: trustless content delivery and acceleration. This is the gap Fleek Network fills,” Fleek co-founder and CEO Harrison Hines told CoinDesk in an email.  Hines noted that while there are several decentralized storage and data protocols such as Filecoin and Arweave, those protocols share a common problem in that querying the files, data and content from the networks they are stored on loads slowly.  From the consumer side, developers or projects needing a content-delivery network can provide content to the Fleek Network. Fleek accelerates that content using a decentralized network of nodes. Consumers prepay for the bandwidth in the native FLK tokens, said Hines.  Other investors in the round included Protocol Labs, Arweave, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group, North Island Ventures, Distributed Global, The LAO and Argonautic Ventures.

More investors are storing crypto in their own wallets instead of with centralized exchanges, and that is reflected in higher trading volumes and user growth for decentralized-finance (DeFi) spot and derivatives trading platforms, the report said. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.  On-chain data shows “higher momentum on user acquisition, and activation post-FTX.” In the past 60 days, both revenue and the number of transactions have grown, analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  While these are early trends, the transition to on-chain markets, with their greater transparency, is a positive development in “crypto’s journey to rebuilding customer and policy-makers' trust,” Bernstein said.  The Arbitrum and Optimism blockchains are seeing the strongest momentum in user growth and in transaction and revenue momentum since the FTX unwind, the note said. On-chain momentum indicates which blockchains are driving more economic activity and thus benefiting from investor flows, the note added.  Solana, which was viewed as the native blockchain for the FTX/Alameda ecosystem, is deteriorating the most. Users have moved to other chains following the demise of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, the report said.  Binance Smart Chain has made modest gains in active user trends over the same period, the report added.

5005010,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510740,1669887607,ApeCoin Falls Below $4 Again As Its Treasury Sells Its Own Token Holdings,"ApeCoin (APE) seems to be ignoring the push that the broader crypto market is making that enabled many cryptocurrencies record significant price increases during the previous 24 hours. In fact, the digital currency that currently ranks 35th in terms of market capitalization has gone down by 3.1% for its intraday performance as it once again fell below the $4 marker. According to latest information from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, the asset is trading at $3.99 and its weekly and bi-weekly gains have now dropped to 15.2% and 33.2%, respectively. Over the last 30 days, ApeCoin has declined by 15.7% as it continues to struggle and although the prevailing crypto winter and the implosion of FTX are some of the possible reasons for this, some experts believe there’s more to it than just these. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days More Than $19 Million Worth Of ApeCoin Disposed At least five APE treasury wallets were found to have been using one address, referred to as “0xa29d” as a means for relay between other addresses linked with Coinbase, Binance, and the crashed FTX to facilitate and hide the massive sell of tokens. A little over 4.6 million ApeCoins worth $19.7 million have been moved out from the project’s treasury wallet and were distributed among various addresses. “0x876c” accounted for the largest chunk of the moved assets while around 50,000 tokens were found out to have been sent to “0xa29d.” As it would appear, ApeCoin itself is actively and aggressively selling its holdings while exerting a lot of effort to hide its tracks by using new addresses before sending a boatload of tokens to different crypto exchanges. As for the reason, it’s anyone’s guess up to this time as developers has yet to address the matter and offer an explanation as to why its treasury is selling its APE coin holdings. ApeCoin Faces Daunting Road To Recovery After peaking at $23.63 back in April 29 this year, the crypto asset has been on a steady decline until it stopped the bleeding on November 10 when it changed hands at $2.85. Although it has managed to reclaim the $3 and $4 territories, it is still far from its pre-dump levels and is now being considered as pain in the head for investors that made it part of their portfolios. There might be some breathing space left for the cryptocurrency as Coincodex predicts it will go up by 12% over the next five days to trade at $4.43. However, the start of 2023 appears to be a gloomy one for the project and its problematic token as the crypto is forecasted to enter next year with a changing hands value of $2.97.

42388527,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHvdX,1669885508,"Bitcoin's Price Action Is Encouraging, But It May Not Signal Bottom: Traders","It's still winter in the digital-assets market, and yet crypto Twitter is going bottom fishing.  And why not, as bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has recently bounced 10% to over $17,000 despite lingering FTX contagion fears and crypto lender BlockFi filing for bankruptcy.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday signaled that the central bank could slow the pace of its liquidity-sucking interest rate hikes starting this month. Popular technical analysis indicators signal downtrend exhaustion in bitcoin.  Some experts, however, called for caution as bitcoin's price action is yet to satisfy all conditions necessary to confirm a bear market bottom and a bullish revival.  ""As we have seen three attempts this year that eventually failed, we need to wait for bitcoin prices to trade above their 21-week moving average ($20,851) in order to call for a sustainable rally and a cyclical low,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said.  Bottom fishing refers to investing in an asset with a substantial price decline. The high-risk, high-reward approach is based on the assumption that the asset is undervalued and due for a reversal higher.  Bitcoin turned lower from its 21-week moving average in early November and fell to a two-year low of $15,460 on Coinbase. The late March attempt to scale the average also paved the way for a deeper sell-off.  Therefore, a convincing move above the average is needed to confirm a bottom.  According to Caleb Franzen, founder of research firm and newsletter Cubic Analytics, a bull revival would be confirmed once bitcoin prints a positive ""Heikin-Ashi"" candle on the monthly chart.  Heikin-Ashi and traditional candlesticks are constructed using an asset's open, high, low and close prices for a specific period. Heikin-Ashi, however, is an averaged version of traditional candlesticks. Therefore, it helps cut through the noise and facilitates better gauging of trend reversals than traditional candles.  ""After 5+ months of red candles, a green monthly candle has [historically] marked the end of each bear market,"" Franzen tweeted Monday, calling for patience on the part of the bulls as bitcoin produced its 12th consecutive red monthly Heikin-Ashi candle in November.  The latest red streak on the monthly Heikin-Ashi chart is the second longest on record. Bitcoin produced 14 straight red candles from February 2018 to March 2019 before confirming a bull revival with a green candle in April 2019.  At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $17,080, a 0.5% drop on the day.  The cryptocurrency's weekly chart shows a bullish divergence of the relative strength index, a popular technical analysis tool used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions.  A bullish divergence occurs when the RSI doesn't confirm a new low/cyclical price low. In other words, while the price goes down, the RSI remains steady or goes up.  Chart analysts and traders consider it an early sign of an impending positive trend change.  ""It's interesting to note that the relative strength index peaked already in January 2021 for this cycle and did not confirm bitcoin's second top in 22. Now, this indicator also signals that the downturn may have fully played out,"" Thielen said in a note to clients on Wednesday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/01/bitcoin-price-action-encouraging-but-yet-to-tick-all-boxes-in-bottom-confirmation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/407fe1b20535a0bc8bece7e659ed99c84a05602f-2270x1158.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is the latest in a series of jurisdictions to pause or slow down the approval of new crypto mining operations, driven by the worry that the miners' load might adversely affect local communities.  ""We can't simply say, 'Well, anyone can take whatever [energy] they want to take and we'll simply build dams',"" Finance Minister Cameron Friesen, the minister responsible for the province's utility Manitoba Hydro, said on Monday, according to reports by CBC and CTV News Winnipeg. A spokesperson for the province's utility confirmed the news to CoinDesk via email.  Manitoba Hydro is to stop processing new and existing applications from crypto mining operations looking to connecting to the grid until April 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 16 government directive. The directive also calls on Manitoba Hydro to review how the crypto mining industry affects the grid and engage with the Public Utilities Board as well as the government's finance department and to come up with a regulatory proposal.  The existing 37 mining facilities will not be affected, according to the reports.  Miners have flocked to Canada for its cheap electricity, with Manitoba having the second-cheapest electricity rates in the country after Quebec, according to reports.  Manitoba Hydro has a capacity of about 6.1 gigawatts (GW), and if ""every cryptocurrency operator who has shown interest in the last 16 months,"" was connected to the grid, the total load would increase by 4.6 GW across 240 operations, a spokesperson for the utility told CoinDesk.  ""There are currently 37 cryptocurrency customers in the province of Manitoba, but over 240 potential new operations have been in touch with Manitoba Hydro since July 2021,"" the spokesperson added.  Manitoba Hydro's debt has tripled in the last 15 years as it took on loans to built two new mega projects totaling CAD3.7 billion (US$2.75 billion), Keeyask and the Bipole III transmission line. About 40% of consumers' utility fees go to servicing debt, according to Manitoba Hydro.  The Finance Minister did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment.

MATIC is nursing a 12% intraday increase The crypto has breached the $0.90 barrier and pushed its market cap to over $8 billion Polygon NFT sales up by 191% According to latest tracking from Coingecko, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $0.94, registering an increase of 12% in its intraday performance. Over the last seven days, MATIC has pumped its value by 10%. Among the top 10 digital currencies tracked by the online crypto information provider, Polygon was the day’s top gainer as BTC and ETH could only manage to go up by 4.9% and 7%, respectively. Moreover, with this bullish movement, the asset managed to push its total market capitalization to $8.32 billion, registering an inflow of around $400 million from the $7.60 billion valuation it was nursing when it was trading at $0.87 just the other day. The Signs Were There All Along For Polygon Last week, following all the chaos that ravaged the crypto space including the collapse of FTX and the closure of many related businesses, MATIC reacted negatively and plunged all the way down to the $0.81 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rises: Over 60% Of Holders Continue To Profit Despite FTX Nightmare Source: TradingView However, yesterday, some of the digital asset’s technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicated the resurgence of a bullish movement for Polygon. Tallying an increase of 3.65% within the last 24-hours, the altcoin pulled itself back up to $0.86 and in doing so has teased a breakout above the $0.90 mark. In addition, the cryptocurrency was able to increase its trading volume by 1.90%, further solidifying the bullish thesis of analysts that were trying to determine where its price trajectory is headed. It turns out, the experts made the right call as MATIC is enjoying one of the best recent performances that the crypto space has witnessed so far. It still has ways to go but with its current level, it is extremely close to hitting the psychological $1 territory. NFT Sales Go Up By Almost 200% One possible reason for MATIC’s impressive showing right now is the incredible growth that is being enjoyed by its NFT department. According to information shared by crypto analytics portal Messari, since the end of September, Polygon-based NFT sales went up by 191% on its way to posting the best blockchain result by far. This development could be attributed to the project’s integration with Starbucks and Meta (Instagram), which, according to experts, greatly helped its native token during the crypto collapse.

In the last week, the coin has surged over 9%. Although SOL might be moving up slowly, from a technical standpoint, the altcoin has recovered and might stage a rally in the upcoming trading sessions. Buyers were gradually re-entering the market, indicating that SOL registered accumulation. However, capital inflows remained low. With consistent upward price action, capital inflow will also register a positive change. Now that SOL has made small gains each day, the next resistance mark for the coin stands at $15. If Solana’s price breaks past $15, the coin can rally to $18. Although the Solana price has shown signs of recovery, it is still too early to say if the coin has gotten out of the woods. One push from the bears will bring SOL down to its closest support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Enters Sell Zone Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was trading at $13.73 at the time of writing. At the moment, SOL was resting above the $13 support line. There needs to be support from buyers and the broader market for Solana to topple above the $14 price mark. The aforementioned price ceiling should not be too difficult to surpass, given that the altcoin has been trading quite close to that level. On the other hand, the first support for Solana’s price was $13. Failing to remain above that will bring the coin down to $10.50. The amount of Solana traded in the past session was green, depicting a bullish preference. Technical Analysis SOL had witnessed quite the plunge in the month of November. The altcoin entered the oversold region twice this month. At press time, however, Solana had portrayed an increase in demand. The Relative Strength Index noted an uptick and inched closer to the 40-mark. This reading denoted a rise in accumulation. Solana’s price was also above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which indicated bullishness and that buyers would drive the price momentum in the market. In terms of institutional interest, SOL has registered mundane performance for months. Despite the chart’s recovery, SOL’s capital inflows have remained low, mostly due to the broader market’s weakness. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicated capital inflows and outflows. CMF was below the half-line, indicating that outflows were greater than inflows. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) displays the trend and price momentum. AO was positive with green signal bars, which were tied to the buy signal for the altcoin. This also suggested further gains for Solana investors.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Fed Chair's Moderate Remarks Send Cryptos Higher  By James Rubin  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wasn't exactly dovish in a speech Wednesday, but his suggestion that the Fed could live with a more moderate interest rate hike at its mid-December meeting sent cryptocurrency prices, not to mention other assets, higher.  Bitcoin was recently trading over $17,150, up 1.4% over the past 24 hours, and its third consecutive day of gains. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had started surging on Monday amid investor hopefulness that Powell and other Fed officials have found reassurance in economic indicators showing inflation and the threat of a harsh recession waning. BTC sank below $15,500 two weeks ago as markets chewed on Genesis Global Capital's decision to halt withdrawals, part of the fallout from crypto exchange giant FTX's implosion. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Bilal Little, president of DFD Partners, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that this week's rally also reflected a price reordering that often follows periods of distress. ""Anytime you have an episodic event, markets tend to oversell, and what also happens is you see the immediate look to contagion, and everyone starts pointing fingers. Then as markets gain more clarity, you see the fair market value come back into alignment.""  Ether was recently changing hands over $1,290, up 1.5% from Tuesday, same time. Other major altcoins were largely in the green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 scaling tool Polygon, rising more than 5%. Popular meme coin DOGE countered the trend, falling more than 3% after soaring about 50% over the previous eight days. DOGE is trading well over 10 cents.  Prices moved little late on Wednesday, seemingly unimpressed by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's latest non-confessions in a New York Times live interview about the missteps leading to FTX's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried spoke in generalities, often looking down at the floor as the Times' uber-reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin peppered him with questions. ""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said at one point.  Cryptos' upswing was small compared to equity markets, which soared on Powell's remarks at the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Washington, D.C., that the Fed would likely raise interest rates 50 basis points (BPS) instead of continuing its recent diet of 75 bps increases. Investors were also heartened by the U.S.'s third quarter GDP, which grew 2.9%, up from the Commerce Department's original 2.6% estimate.  DFD Partners' Little was pessimistic about crypto prices continuing to climb, saying that bitcoin would likely sink to the $12,000 to $13,000 level before topping $22,000, a level it last reached in October. ""It's going to be on the back of what are the other contagion impacts, around this particular event, FTX"" he said. ""Different providers are going to struggle to not only meet liquidity demands but also counter-party risk.""

Although this funny internet money was subject to booms and busts, the programmability of blockchain technology was supposed to unlock trillions of dollars of real value. Beijing had identified it as a strategic technology, after all.  But despite the $3.1 trillion in unlocked value that Gartner promised by 2030, industry use cases for blockchain continue to fade away.  Recently, Maersk and IBM announced that TradeLens, the blockchain-based transparent ledger that was supposed to improve freight processing and customs clearance, will be wound down in 2023.  “TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business,” Maersk Head of Business Platforms Rotem Hershko said in a statement.  Keywords: commercial viability. This seems to be the theme with enterprise blockchain applications. Executives aren’t able to determine why we need this as opposed to more traditional database technology.  Earlier this month, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was canceling a planned blockchain-based upgrade to its clearing house system. The existing system was performing well enough, and executives at the bourse couldn’t justify spending on a system upgrade that might not do much more than its predecessor.  Amazon: Why blockchain?  Tim Bray, one of the godfathers of web software development, offers an anecdote about all this on his blog. Until early 2020, Bray was a vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS) beforere signing as a high-profile defector, vocally criticizing Amazon for its “vein of toxicity.”  In 2016, presumably during happier times in his career at the company, Bray was in a meeting with Andy Jassy, then-CEO of AWS, and the topic was blockchain. Bray writes (the entire post is worth reading) that Jassy was hearing from his clients that AWS needed a blockchain strategy. But Jassy couldn’t understand why blockchain was necessary when existing tools provided sufficient solutions.  AWS was already making a ton of money from blockchain. Many of the world’s crypto exchanges or other infrastructure projects host their products on the platform (see: the $4.6 million AWS bill to Alameda/FTX). But this is different than what the world’s industrial and commercial giants were being told they wanted. They needed to integrate blockchain, investors said, and it was up to AWS to implement this.  “I can’t remember the details of how our findings got back to Andy. They were of the form 'Ledgers are useful, cryptography tech is useful, blockchains aren’t, the field is full of grifters, but we could build distributed-ledger infrastructure and then these cool services on top of it,’” Bray wrote. “I’m not prepared to say that no blockchain-based system will ever be useful for anything. But I’m gonna stay negative until I see one actually at work doing something useful, without number-go-up greedheads clamped on its teats.”  AWS still has a blockchain segment, and is said to be in the process of preparing to double down on China, the only market where enterprise blockchain continues to exist at scale because of state diktat (where’s the on-chain data?).  Meanwhile, its competitor, Microsoft Azure, has shuttered its cloud blockchain services. As CoinDesk reported last year, IBM’s blockchain division is a “shell of its former self.”  Bray noted in his post that it wasn’t the role of AWS to “ascertain market realities.” They needed to build what the customer wanted. Jaffy, the executive in charge of the division, was “possibly the world’s single most accomplished person at listening to people talk about Enterprise IT problems and the tools needed to fix them,” and if he couldn’t see the value of this technology, it probably wasn’t worth anyone’s time.  But at the time, if you questioned the technology, you were a “peasant,” as Bray noted, because all the ""Serious Enterprises full of Serious People” were about to adopt blockchain.  And now, those that did are abandoning it.  Let’s just admit that it was all a failure.

42394029,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3VF,1669855992,Full Transcript: NY Times' Interview With Sam Bankman-Fried,"Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times interviewed former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on Nov. 30 at the DealBook Summit. What follows is a transcript of that conversation.  Read CoinDesk's coverage of the interview here.  Andrew Ross Sorkin (ARS): In the span of about one week, Sam Bankman-Fried went from a billionaire, the white knight of the crypto world and running one of the largest exchanges, to what some people think has become a wanted man. FTX was once valued at $32 billion. It's now effectively worthless in bankruptcy. We're going to talk about that and whether investors will ever get money back. There are multiple billions owed to creditors and big questions. In the wake of the collapse bitcoin fell to its lowest price in two years, and on Monday, BlockFi, which had been bailed out by FTX, filed for bankruptcy. The rapid fall of this empire has left so many questions about crypto, about the future of it and whether it can be trusted again. Sam Bankman-Fried joins us right now, live from the Bahamas.  Sam, I want to thank you for joining us this afternoon. I appreciate your willingness to have this conversation. As I said at the outset of today, there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and also need to be answered.  As you know, a lot of people have been hurt, genuinely hurt. And my hope is that over the time we have together, that we can have a candid conversation about what happened, how it happened. There are people who are angry and they are seeking answers. I just want everybody in the audience to know that I received thousands of letters and emails, even the past couple days, from a lot of these people who feel like they're victims, and some of them have questioned whether we should have this conversation, whether we should have this interview. There are people who don't believe that this conversation should happen. And I just want to say that I think our job as journalists is to have those conversations, is to ask those questions and seek those answers on behalf of the public. And that is especially true right now.  Sam, here's where I want to start this conversation, if we could. I think at this point, there are two ways to view what has happened at FTX. And I know we'll get into all of the details in a moment. But I'm just gonna go very basic. There's a generous view. And the generous view is that you are a young man who made a series of terrible, terrible very, very bad decisions. The less generous view is that you have committed a massive fraud, that this is a Ponzi scheme, a manipulation of the system. And I want to start there because I think that there's so many people who have that question, which is what is this and what did happen?  Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF): Yeah, look, thanks for having me. And at the end of the day, I was CEO of FTX and that means whatever happened, why ever it happened, I had a duty. I had a duty to all of our stakeholders, to our customers, our creditors, I had a duty to our employees, to our investors and to the regulators of the world to do right by them, to make sure the right things happened to the company and clearly I didn't do a good job with that. Clearly, I – I made a lot of mistakes or things I would give anything to be able to do over again. I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I, I was excited about the prospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened this month. And, you know, reconstructing it, were there things I wish I had done differently.  ARS: Well, let's talk about some of the things you, you would want to have done differently. But I don't want this to be an abstraction for folks because it's a lot of big numbers, and often doesn't feel human. One of the letters I got I want to read to you, Sam, because it's from a gentleman who said that he lost his life savings. And the subject line is, ""Sam Bankman-Fried stole $2 million from me."" It says, ""Andrew, can you please ask SBF why he decided to steal my life savings and the $10 billion more from customers to give to his hedge fund Alameda. Can you ask him why his hedge fund was leveraging long all of these s-coins?"" I'm gonna keep it polite for the kids. ""Please ask him if he thinks what happened was fraud."" These are the kinds of letters that I've been getting repeatedly over the past several days. What do you tell this man?  SBF: Yeah, I mean, I'm deeply sorry about what happened. You know, for the long and short of what happened – and I'll start by saying just to make a distinction here – you look at the U.S. platform, you look at the international platform, U.S. platform is a U.S.-regulated platform with American users. To my knowledge that's fully solvent, that's fully funded and, you know, I believe that withdrawals could be opened up today and everyone could be made whole from that, that none of these problems plagued the U.S. platform.  Then you look at the international platform, for their non-U.S. users. And, I mean, as the letter says, Alameda Research did have a long position. And, you know, the international platform, it's a margin-trading platform. It's a derivatives platform. It's a platform where all the clients were, you know, going on placing something as collateral and using that to put on a position, whether that's a futures position, a spot position, a borrow. And, you know, what the exchange is storing was the collateral from all of those positions. Alameda Research was one of those that put on positions there. And as I try and reconstruct this, you know, over the last month, I have limited access to data, but my, my, my, my view of it, from what I have been able to see is roughly that, you know, basically, look, a year ago Alameda had, I think, something like 10% leverage, had something like 10 times the assets of the position that it had on.  Over the course of the last year there were a number of market crashes that drove the value of those assets down and the leverage up. I think it was, to my knowledge, still under 2x leverage, you know, as of a month ago. You look at what happened this month and, you know, in a few days an all-out. I mean, PR assault, which led to a total market collapse in a pretty short period of time, no bid-side liquidity. I think more than $10 billion wiped off in the matter of days, and, realistically speaking, no ability for FTX to be able to, to liquidate that position and generate everything that was owed from it.  ARS: But I think the bigger question is where Alameda got the loan from, which is to say that there is a view that this is about commingling of funds. And in that letter that I just read you, this gentleman actually copied and pasted the terms of service for FTX into the email and I just want to read you this. It says, ""None of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading. FTX Trading does not represent or treat digital assets and users' accounts as belonging to FTX Trading."" So how is it possible that Alameda had this loan of such a large size?  SBF: So, there's that piece from the terms of service. But there were a number of other parts of the terms of service and there's a number of other parts of the platform on top of that. There is the borrower lending facility where users were lending billions of dollars of assets to each other, you know, collateralized by assets on the exchange. You had, obviously, futures contracts where they are leveraged positions on. Now, of course, all of this, it's meant to be the case that these are positions where FTX could, if it needed to, margin call those positions and close them down in time such that it would cover all of those, all of those shorts, all of those liabilities. Obviously, that wasn't the case here. And that's a massive failure of oversight of risk management, and of a huge diffusion of responsibility from, from myself running FTX.  ARS: But just make this very straight, was there commingling of funds? That's what it appears like. It appears like there's a genuine commingling of the funds that are of FTX customers' that were not supposed to be commingled with your separate firm.  SBF: I didn't knowingly commingle funds. And, again, one piece of this, you have the margin trading. You have, you know, customers borrowing from each other. Alameda is one of those. I was frankly surprised by how big Alameda's position was, which points to another failure of oversight on my part. And a failure to appoint someone to be chiefly in charge of that. But I wasn't trying to commingle funds.  ARS: Well, let me ask you this: The Wall Street Journal reported that [Alameda Research CEO] Caroline Ellison told Alameda staffers that Alameda used FTX client funds to cover loans that were being recalled because of the LUNA-triggered credit crunch. Caroline says that she, Sam, Gary were aware of this. How do you square that with what you originally said over Twitter, that this was an $8 billion accounting mistake?  SBF: So, I'll point to two things. And first of all, obviously, I don't know what anyone else is thinking here. You know, I can only talk about it from what I know, from what I knew. And a lot of this is reconstructing it over the last month. I have limited access to data, but, you know, what it seems like happened is in the middle of the year, a lot of – most of the borrow-lending desks in this space blew out or closed down. And it seems like Alameda had, you know, margin positions opened with them, and that it likely moved a bunch of that over to FTX this year when they shut down. And that means, you know, I think it was over-collateralized positions, but positions that involve substantial size and substantial U.S. dollar size on the borrow side.  In terms of the accounting mistake, again, looking through what happened, I think that there is a substantial discrepancy between what the financials were – what the audited financials were – the true financials – what the exchange understood. All of that was, was, was consistent. Versus what the dashboards that we had displayed for, for Alameda's account there, which substantially under-displayed the size of that position. And, so, that's one of the reasons I was surprised when we dug into everything at, at how big that position had become.  ARS: But you would agree that there is a much more closely connected version of FTX international and Alameda than previously understood. Fair to say?  SBF: Yeah, I mean, given the size of the position, I think it was, if not in intention, it was in effect tied together substantially more than I would have ever wanted it to be.  ARS: So, you did an interview earlier this summer with Bloomberg, and you were asked about the connection between Alameda and FTX, and you said that ""obviously came from the, the same place because it started that way and the same original people, but most of the remaining nexuses,"" you said, ""have dropped off.""  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ""I know the people from Alameda decently well,"" almost as if you don't know what's happening there. ""And there isn't, like, a large amount, you know, of ways remain that we are actively working together, anything like that. Alameda is a wholly separate entity. They're different offices, like, different principal offices, we don't have any shared personnel. We're also not the same company. We not all are under the same corporate umbrella or anything like that."" And yet it seems like Alameda people were living in the same penthouse, where you may very well be right now, all together.  SBF: Most of Alameda was not, was not there. I don't live there now. But – or, you know, not there now – I have not lived there for most of the time. But, you know, I did live with, with, with one or two members of Alameda for a little while. And also I'll say that, you know, as I was, earlier this summer, looking at the relationship – and this is a pretty big mistake in oversight of mine – I was viewing it primarily from the trading volume perspective, because that's what drives our revenue. And so when I was looking at how intertwined are FTX and Alameda, you know, I was looking at, well, what what fraction of trading volume, what fraction of liquidity on the platform does Alameda represent. That had fallen off from something like 45% in 2019 to something like 2% this year, but in terms of positions and balances, it was a much larger fraction. I hadn't been looking at that. That's a pretty big oversight.  ARS: But, Sam, I think the question is whether you were supposed to have access to these accounts to begin with, you know? If, if I worked at a bank and was a bank teller, and I decided to leave the bank at the end of the evening and take the cash that I ostensibly had access to, even if I intended to bring it back to the bank later even with more money to give them back, I still stole the money.  SBF: I mean, look, I wasn't running Alameda. I didn't know exactly what was going on. I didn't know the size of their position. A lot of these are things that I've learned over the last month that I learned as I was sort of frantically digging into this on Nov. 6, Nov. 7, Nov. 8. And, and, obviously, that, that's a pretty big mistake [unintelligible]. That's a pretty big oversight that I wasn't more aware. I think I was, you know, scared of – I was nervous because of the conflict of interest about being too involved. And, obviously, that shouldn't have meant that I didn't have real oversight, or that really shouldn't have meant that I failed to appoint anyone to be in charge of that oversight, that relationship. But I, I haven't been running Alameda, I haven't been thinking about its finances. I haven't been, you know, making those decisions. But, you know, as CEO of FTX it was still my duty to make sure I was doing diligence.  ARS: But you owned it.  SBF: I was, I was a large owner of it. That is true. And I, I had a lot of exposure on that side.  ARS: So why haven't you been focused on it, if, in fact, that's actually where the profits were?  SBF: Well, I don't know that that's where – I mean, I think Alameda had made trading profits over the last few years, but FTX had made profits as well. FTX had been a profitable, growing business. And I was – that was more than a full-time job. I didn't have the bandwidth to run two companies at once. I didn't have the, you know, attention for it. And, again, I was nervous about a conflict of interest between those two, and so was pretty intentional about not being very involved in what was happening at Alameda.  ARS: When did the commingling of assets begin?  SBF: So, and, again, you know, lots of traders had open margin positions on FTX, where they would have borrows of assets where they would be short some asset against, you know, against other assets as collateral. That being said, I, again, looking through this now, I think that that position size for Alameda got substantially larger over the course of 2022. And that it was, I think, substantially larger by October 2022 – probably by July of '22 – than it had been in April.  ARS: But it sounds like it's fair to say that there was always a connection between Alameda and FTX and almost – I mean, not almost, but from the very, very beginning – and then it never really stopped.  SBF: Well, I think it had been, in some ways, reducing. I mean, when you scroll back to 2019, Alameda and FTX were very connected in a number of ways. You know, one of these was that Alameda was the primary liquidity provider on FTX. It was, you know, 40-something percent of volume. It was the backstop liquidity provider. And, you know, you scroll forward to 2022, it was down to 2% of volume. We had a lot of backstop liquidity providers. But it still had a big margin position on, and I, I was failing to pay nearly enough attention to positions and positional risk on the exchange and to Alameda's in particular. And I also, frankly, made a mistake that I feel pretty embarrassed to have made – and a lot of these are – but I substantially underestimated what the scale of a market crash could look like, and what the speed of it could look like. And how correlated it would be.  ARS: But that just suggests that you were just hoping, perhaps hoping against hope, that this would all work out and that nobody, therefore, would realize what this commingling was all about?  SBF: So, it's not how I viewed it. And, in particular, again, most of the firms had margin positions. Most of the firms had borrows on FTX. The problem here, this one was, this was too big. It was – I was surprised by that size of what it was.  ARS: But it's not just too big. It's, it's, it's assets that, look, it sounds like there were assets that, that may have been allowable to be loaned. But then there were assets that weren't allowable to be loaned, no?  SBF: So, I'm still looking into the details of some pieces of this. But I do think that in addition to what I had seen as sort of lot of the standard borrows here, that we scroll back to 2018 or to 2019, I guess, FTX didn't have bank accounts. It didn't have any bank accounts globally. We were trying to get them. It took us a while, it took us a few years, and, you know, there are customers who wanted to wire money to FTX. And so I think in the meantime, some of them were wiring money to Alameda Research to get credited on FTX, and I think that was a substantial sum. And I think that the FTX's internal accounting did correctly, effectively try to debit Alameda for those funds, but it didn't happen in the primary account and so it didn't happen. It created a discrepancy between the display of the account and what was really going on there. And I'm still looking into exactly how that, how that worked mechanically. But I – that, that did make that position size substantially larger than, than I thought and I think than what you would have gotten from, from most normal avenues.  ARS: What do you make of the argument that Alameda was used to effectively wash money into FTX. That American investors, who, by the way, were not technically allowed to even invest on FTX, were doing so and FTX was doing it knowingly because the, the know-your-customer rules were being flouted by using this separate vehicle.  SBF: How would that allow customers to flout the know-your-customer rules? Are you talking about people who are trading on FTX US or are you talking about customers of FTX international?  ARS: International. You just said that there was money being sent to Alameda, and that Alameda was then providing credits onto FTX.  SBF: Right. But those users still had to go through the know-your-customer policy on FTX in order to do that. In order to use that ramp, customers still had to go through FTX's normal KYC onboarding.  ARS: So, when do you think you knew there was a problem?  SBF: So, the time that I really knew there was a problem was Nov. 6. Nov. 6 was – that was the date that the tweet about FTT came out. And by late on Nov. 6, we were putting together all of the data, putting together all the information that obviously should have put together way earlier – that obviously should have been part of the dashboards I was always looking at. And I, you know, when we looked at that, there was a potential serious problem there. And, you know, Alameda's position was big on FTX. It had just taken a huge hit. It had taken hits over the course of the year, but that was a particularly large one and very abrupt. And we're seeing a run on the bank start and that was leading to $4 billion a day of client withdrawals. At that point, you know, we started calling prospective, you know, sources of financing, because I was, I was nervous about what was going to happen there. You know, if you rewind even a few days, I was, I was a little bit nervous, but not on nearly the same scale and I, I was thinking about, you know, risks that were substantially less.  ARS: When you say you were nervous, you were nervous the company was gonna go under? You were nervous you were gonna get caught? What were you nervous about?  SBF: On, like, on Nov. 6 or before then?  ARS: Either.  SBF: So, I think, before then what I was nervous about was that basically – and this started, I would say Nov. 2 or so when there was the leak of the Alameda balance sheet through CoinDesk. And when I started to think a bit more about this, you know, I was nervous that that would lead to substantial losses for Alameda and that, you know, it would be a bit messy. I didn't think it was existential for FTX. I didn't think it was going to lead to a massive loss for FTX's customers. I was thinking of this as more like Alameda is gonna to be really tight on funds and that, you know, maybe it would end up having some small impact on FTX, but not, not a significant one, not one that hurt customers at all. When you're talking about Nov. 6 – late Nov. 6 – then and, and especially as we bleed into Nov. 7 and 8, I start to become nervous that FTX is not going to be able to fulfill customer withdrawals. And, you know, by late Nov. 6, I am very nervous about that. And I'm starting to think about, like, emergency scenarios and I'm starting to think about, like, things might, things might end quite badly here. And, and, and the core metric that I'm thinking of there is will we be able to make sure all customers are whole. And, you know, on Nov. 5, I was feeling quite good about that. On Nov. 7, I was feeling quite uneasy about that.  ARS: I want to go back in time for a moment. This summer you were described oftentimes as the J.P. Morgan of crypto, referencing the 1907 panic that he helped prevent. And you had purchased BlockFi, were making investments in Voyager and all sorts of other things. When you were doing that, at that time, how much of that was an effort to prop up the value of things like FTT, which was the token of FTX, knowing that if a company like BlockFi, which owed a ton of it, that if it collapsed FTT would collapse and in large part, the ""collateral"" that you had for Alameda would collapse.  SBF: So, I don't think any of the borrow-lending desks, to my knowledge, owned a lot of FTT. I think a lot of them, you know, may have been using it as collateral – or, you know, taking it as collateral. I don't think they owned it though or were gonna sell it. And I think that most of them ended up closing down effectively all of their lines with Alameda one way or another. And so at that point, I think that that was close to a sunk cost and so I wasn't viewing it as having any impact on FTT in particular. I did view it as important for the industry's health. I did view it as a thing where I wanted to try to keep the industry stable, but I don't think it had any, you know, really large FTT-specific impact.  ARS: And did it have – you didn't think it had any impact – it would have no impact on Alameda or FTX if, for example, BlockFi were to have failed.  SBF: I don't think it would have had a large direct impact and the reason I say that is that I believe that Alameda ended up returning the vast majority of its open, you know, borrows of its margin positions with the borrow-lending desks in the middle of this year anyway. And so at that point, there wasn't that much left to save from that. You know, the – at that point, I think the bigger thing was just not wanting the industry to implode.  ARS: Let's talk about collateral. Because I think this is – this entire experience has been a revelation for a lot of people about what might be collateral. And clearly you were using FTT and Solana and other tokens as collateral, and part of that required you to mark them in a specific way – a value to them.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: Do you think that you were marking them properly?  SBF: In Alameda's case, I don't think I was marking them the way I wish I had from a risk perspective. And I want to sort of differentiate your, like, expected value or, or sort of, like, worth or something like that from security. And, you know, I think that I don't have any strong statements to make about, you know, what value they're assigned from sort of, like, an upside perspective or even a median case perspective. But clearly, I was, I was not nearly cautious enough from a downside perspective – from the extreme downside perspective. And, you know, I can tell you, in my head, I was looking at a 30% down move over a few-day period as a sort of, like, extreme tail-case event that, you know, we had seen once before, and, and then, you know, what happened here was, I mean, a 95% down move over the course of a year, and a, you know, 60% down move over a few-day period with very little liquidity and all happening at once in all of these coins in a correlated fashion in which hedges didn't mean as much also because this was a specific crash on assets associated with Alameda Research, rather than all assets. And so even correlated hedges had limited use there, and a run on the bank at the same time. And all that are things, in retrospect, I should have expected might happen in an extreme scenario, because that's how markets work. And, you know, we've seen other examples of that in history where, when things get really bad, they get really bad for all the relevant things at once, in a very direct and correlated and quick way.  ARS: I want to go to the BlockFi acquisition for a moment. How much money do you think Alameda – I'd say that they had a lot of FTT but – that Alameda had borrowed from BlockFi at the time of the bailout?  SBF: I honestly don't know, but I, I would have guessed, like, $100 million, maybe couple hundred million, but I, I, I honestly don't know the answer – I wasn't, I wasn't, like, paying detailed attention. That's my guess.  ARS: And were you using FTT and Serum and other things to collateralize the loans at BlockFi, do you think? I mean, this goes to the whole idea of both the value of these things and also whether you were trying to buy BlockFi, in fact, to continue to support effectively Alameda over FTX.  SBF: Right, you know, it might be, I would guess it was but, but, you know, to your point, my guess is that, like, the amount paid for, for BlockFi is probably bigger than the amount that Alameda had opened with it. I mean, I don't know that for sure, again, I – but I wasn't even looking at what that number was really. But I think that's, that's about right.  ARS: I want to go back to the Alameda piece of it for just another moment, if you'd stick with me here. You had told investors and regulators that you were not involved in Alameda decision-making. And yet, in the case – Alameda invested $1.15 billion in Genesis Digital Assets without your consultation or approval – that's the question. And my understanding is you also served on the board of Genesis Digital Assets. And so I'm trying to understand how you wouldn't have been involved with Alameda?  SBF: So, I was somewhat involved with venture investing and that was done out of a separate entity than, you know, any of Alameda's proprietary trading, than its activity on FTX or other crypto exchanges. But I was consulted on, on some of its, its VC investments, including with GDA.  ARS: What are your lawyers telling you right now? Are they suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking?  SBF: No, they're very much not. And, I mean, you know, the classic advice, right? Don't say anything. You know, recede into a hole. And it's not who I am. I mean, it's not who I want to be. I don't have – I, I have a duty to talk to people. I have a duty to explain what happened. And I think I have a duty to do everything I can to try and do what's right if there anything I can do to try and help customers out here, and I don't see what good is accomplished by me just sitting locked, you know, in a room pretending the outside world doesn't exist.  ARS: You're in the Bahamas right now. Are you in the Bahamas because you think you can't leave?  SBF: No. I'm in the Bahamas. I mean, I have been in the Bahamas for the last year and, you know, I've been running FTX from the Bahamas. You know, I've been running FTX Digital Market, our, you know, primary operating entity down here, you know, with the Bahamian regulators and, and others in, in, in contact and I, you know, right now, I'm, you know, looking to be helpful anywhere I can with any of the global entities that, you know, that would want my help.  ARS: Do you think you could come to the United States or go elsewhere?  SBF: To my knowledge I could.  ARS: Have you thought about doing that?  SBF: I've thought about it and, you know, I mean, I've seen a lot of the, obviously, a lot of the hearings that have been happening. I would, you know, not be surprised if, you know, sometime I am, you know, up there talking about what happened to our representatives or, you know, wherever else is, is most appropriate.  ARS: How concerned are you about criminal liability at this point?  SBF: So, I don't think that, I mean, obviously, I don't, I don't personally think that I have, you know – but I, I think the real answer is that it's not – sounds weird to say but, but – I think the real answer is that's not what I'm focusing on. It's – there's gonna be a time and a place for me to sort of think about myself and my own future, but I don't think this is it, like, right now. I mean, look, I've had a bad month. [Audience laughs.] This has not been a fun month for me. But that's not what matters here. Like, what matters here is the millions of customers. What matters here is all the stakeholders in FTX who, who got hurt, and, and trying to do everything I can to help them out. And, you know, as long as that's the case, like, I don't think that, I don't think that, you know, what happens to me is the important part of that. And I don't think that's what it makes sense for me to be focusing on.  ARS: Sam, help me with this. On Nov. 7, you tweeted, and then deleted, a tweet that said, ""FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don't invest client assets, even treasuries. We've been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be."" You then deleted that tweet and literally just moments ago, you told me it was on Nov. 7 that things took a turn.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: You're telling the truth?  SBF: So, things were changing fast. And, you know, when you look at Nov. 6, I was feeling nervous, but I felt like things were probably going to end up OK. We still had, I mean, you know, assets way larger than liabilities and, yeah, there's increasing withdrawal demand, but we were meeting all of it. We were processing all of it, although it was a weekend so we were a day delayed on a lot of wire transfers and stablecoin creations and the Bitcoin node was overloaded, but, you know, their assets were continuing to process. By Nov. 8, I did not think the odds were that high that we were gonna be able to meet all client demand and, and I was worried that there was going to be a substantial liquidity shortfall. Nov. 7, that was sort of the transition day and, you know, even just the start versus the end of Nov. 7, I felt fairly different, you know. And I can't remember exactly what I was thinking or, or, or, or when I sent that but, you know, I remember trying to think about feeling conflicted about what to say and trying to think about what I could say that I believed and, you know, by, by not that long later, I no longer believed that. I no longer – that no longer felt like it had much, like – that was a, a at all reasonable representation of where my mind was at. And I don't remember exactly when I deleted it. But I remember at some point, I was, like, that shouldn't be there.  ARS: Let me ask a different question, because this is all around the same time. The New York Times reported that $515 million was ""suspiciously"" transferred from FTX wallets after – after ...  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: ... the bankruptcy filing.  SBF: Yes.  ARS: And there have been accusations that this is the assistance, effectively, of theft. Where did that money go?  SBF: So, I will caveat this by saying at that point, I was being cut off from systems. And so I'll give you the answer to the extent that I know it, which is that I believe that a few different things happened within a short period there. I think that the U.S. team took actions to seize some of the assets, and put it in custody, from the exchange. I believe the – it has been announced that, you know, the Bahamian regulators took some of the assets into safekeeping as well around that same time. And I think there is, in addition to both of those, there's also been some actually improper access of assets on the exchange. And I don't know the details of that. I don't have the resources to trace through exactly what happened there. And I don't know who is behind that third part.  ARS: I want to go back to one thing about the Bahamas. The Bahamian authorities have now admitted, effectively, that they ordered the transfer, it sounds like, of certain FTX assets to wallets under its control, after the U.S. bankruptcy was filed. Did you help them with that? Did you discuss that with them?  SBF: So, I, I can't discuss specifics, but I will note that prior to Chapter 11 having been filed, the Bahamian authorities had placed FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamian entity, which is the primary operating entity of FTX international, under supervision of a JPL system in the Bahamas with oversight from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas. And, you know, were, to my knowledge, taking actions to protect FDM's clients and, and customers there.  ARS: Can we just go back for just one second, and I apologize for belaboring this point, but we're talking about FTX and the derivative piece of it earlier. And I had made a note earlier about this, because you had told the Senate – you were sitting in the Senate at the time on Feb. 9, 2022, during a hearing – and you said, ""On FTX US Derivatives, all of these contracts are fully collateralized."" Was that true?  SBF: Yes. And, again, FTX US, to my knowledge, totally solvent. FTX US Derivatives, totally solvent, and, in fact, I believe FTX US Derivatives, LedgerX, may even be up and running right now. I'm confused why FTX US is not processing customer withdrawals right now. I would think it should be because I believe, to my knowledge, that it could be and could make all Americans 100% whole from this. So, and FTX US Derivatives, as I said there, doesn't even allow leverage of any sort. It was, you know, close to a spot trading platform. And so, yeah, to my knowledge, all American customers and all American-regulated businesses and exchanges here are, I think, at least in terms of client assets, are, are, are OK. Obviously, I don't know what's happened with, you know – you can make your own judgments about the enterprise value of those businesses, but ...  ARS: Over the summer you paid a $2.5 billion loan to Barry Silbert's Genesis [Editor's note: Genesis Global Trading is owned by Silbert's Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk]. This was in August. And I was just trying to think through the dynamics of what might have been happening at your firm and was wondering where did the money come from?  SBF: So, when you say ""you"" did that, I presume that that's Alameda Research that did that, is that right?  ARS: Yes, that's the case.  SBF: So, I don't have all of the details there, but my understanding is that – and I don't know exactly what was going on on Genesis' side then, and I don't know now – but my understanding is I believe Genesis tried to call in a large number of loans from Alameda. I believe that that happened, and that that closed down a lot of positions that Alameda had opened with Genesis and other trading desks. And, you know, that was what I was thinking at the time. And that's what I think happened there. I also think that may have led to an increase of position size of Alameda on FTX, in retrospect.  ARS: You did an interview, I think, perhaps, inadvertently, over Twitter DMs ...  SBF: Oh, boy.  ARS: ... with a reporter at Vox and had spoken about ESG, but also about what you described as the shibboleths of what it meant to look good in corporate America today and that a lot of the things that you were doing were not necessarily things you actually believed or believed in. Can you speak to that?  SBF: Yeah, absolutely. And I was a – a frustrating experience. It was not meant to be a, a public interview. It was a longtime friend of mine who I stupidly forgot was also a reporter. I thought I was speaking in a personal capacity. I'm not sure what they thought the capacity was at the time, but it certainly ended up being reported on. And, you know, I think what I would say is, look, there are a lot of things that I think have really massive impact on the world. And, ultimately, that's what I care about the most. And, I mean, I think that, I think frankly, that, that, you know, the blockchain industry could, could have substantial positive impact, but, you know, I, I was thinking a lot about, you know, bed nets and malaria, about, you know, saving people from diseases no one should die from, the animal welfare, about pandemic prevention. And, you know, what could be done on a large scale to help mitigate those. Those things I think matter and, and, and there's, you know, among the most important things to me. Separately from that, there is a bunch of bullshit that regulated companies do to try and look good. And these are things that everyone who does them basically knows they're kind of dumb, that these are not things that are making large impact on the world. These are not looking at saving thousands of lives. You know, these are the kinds of, like, you know – if it's like three different quarterbacks throw a touchdown in the same game for the same team, we'll donate two used cars to charity-type campaigns where it's not gonna happen. It's never happened. There's no expectation of a car getting donated. It's just a PR campaign sort of masquerading as do-gooderism. And, you know, things like greenwashing are, are things which, I think, end up in a similar area.  ARS: Fair to say you participated in this?  SBF: Yeah, we all did. And, and I, I, I and, you know, FTX did as well. And there are things I felt like we needed to do for the business. There are things that I felt like were, were crucial for us being able – I mean – I wish the world didn't work this way. I wish that these weren't relevant to your ability to get regulated, to your ability to get bank accounts, but they they, they were and I – yeah, you know, we had promotional campaigns, we had, you know, marketing slogans and, you know, we thought about what we could do to – and, you know, we thought of ourselves as legitimately trying to do good, but we also thought about what we could do to make sure that our image reflected that, and there's a lot, a lot of just unimpactful things there that, ultimately, I, I think, in some circles got more attention than actually impactful things. And, you know, I think that on the more tasteful end of the spectrum, you can see, you know, things like a small scale but real charitable initiatives. And on, I think, the less tasteful end of the spectrum, you know, frankly speaking, I mean, I think even things like making sure that all materials have perfect English grammar is a thing where that was important to me.  ARS: Sam, let me ask you about this, though, because the other piece of it is using, using your money and influence – and I think there's a question about whose money you were using, but – to donate, for example, to the Democratic Party, in large part, to influence regulation. And I think as people have looked through now, some of the regulation you were pushing for at [the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission], for example, some of that regulation would have allowed you, frankly, to ""self-certify"" a lot of what was going on at FTX, and there are people who look at that and say it was all part of a scheme.  SBF: So, unpacking pieces of that, when you look at like this, the CFTC regulation there, ultimately, there may have been an ability to self-certify contracts. But prior to that, we went through a congressional hearing, a public comment period, a public roundtable, a year of inquiries, and tens of thousands of hours, you know, thousands of pages of submitted documents. And still had not gotten to the point of having a license to offer emerging futures in the United States. And so it was an extraordinarily long and hard process that we were going through with the CFTC. And I, you know – it was by far the most intensive regulatory process that I've ever seen.  ARS: Can you speak to the lobbying piece of it, though ...  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: ... and the donations piece of it? Because I think that's become part of the story ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... as to whether you effectively were influencing lawmakers to do your bidding, and given the state of your current company, questions about whether that should be the case.  SBF: So, I mean, lawmakers were not ruling on FTX. FTX didn't have an application before Congress for anything. You know, my donations were mostly for pandemic prevention. And they were looking at primary elections where there were candidates who are outspoken in favor of doing things now to prevent the next pandemic. That was the primary thing that I was supporting with those contributions. And, you know, it was on both sides of, of the aisle primarily operating both primaries because it wasn't – I wasn't viewing it as a partisan exercise. There is not, you know – most of this was not looking at donating to one party to beat the other one in the general elections here. You know, not only was it on both sides, but even within each side, it was between two candidates in the same party and it was looking at pandemic policy.  ARS: Where did the money come from for those donations?  SBF: So, I, you know, basically profits. I mean, you know, it was substantially smaller than the, you know, amount of trading profits that Alameda had made over the prior few years.  ARS: Related to this, you had a meeting with [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair] Gary Gensler. You also met with the folks at [the CFTC]. Do you think you needed to buy your way into those meetings?  SBF: I mean, I don't think I needed to buy my way into them. I do think it was harder than I would have thought it would be to get to the point of being even able to have meetings with some regulators. And, I mean, I spent hundreds of hours, probably thousands of hours in [Washington, D.C.] trying to get to the point where I could even have meetings with, with, you know, some of the relevant regulators. But that was not a – that wasn't a money thing. And, I mean, there's no donations to Gary Gensler. He doesn't even have a campaign to donate to in the first place. That was, like, elbow grease. I mean, that was just asking again and again and again to have meetings with relevant regulators and, you know, submitting hundreds and thousands of pages of documents.  ARS: You also made big investments in a number of media companies. And I think that's raised a lot of questions about whether you were trying to buy influence. Can you speak to that?  SBF: I mean, I think media matters a lot, and I want support good media ventures. That was the whole thesis there. And I, you know, I don't have, like, governance over any of these. I wasn't looking for governance over them. I was looking to support journalists doing great work because I think what they do is really important and I think that there needs to be a critical eye on stories. I'm certainly seeing, you know, being on the, the – getting the brunt of a lot of that right now. And, you know, frankly, I think it's healthy for the world that there is real investigative journalism.  ARS: Your parents are law professors. What did you tell them when all of this happened?  SBF: I mean, I don't remember exactly when I reached out to them, but, you know, I think I, I called them up and said, ""Hey, guys, I think there might be a problem, like, things – looks like Alameda's position might be imploding here, and there might be liquidity issues. And I'll tell you more when I know more."" That, that is – that's my guess about roughly, roughly what I said, but honestly that, that week so much happened. It's a little bit of a blur to me exactly what was said.  ARS: And what are they telling you now?  SBF: And look, it's been – it's been a hard period for anyone who was close to me, and none of them deserved that. And I feel really – I mean, look, a lot of, obviously – the largest number of people who are hurt here were customers, and I feel incredibly bad about that. But anyone who is close to me, you know, including my parents, including employees, co-workers who, you know, fought with the company to, to push forward, were hurt by this and bore no responsibility for that. I feel really bad about that. And, I mean, I feel really grateful for the support my parents are still giving me, you know, throughout all of this.  ARS: Can you explain the real estate piece of this to us? I think there's been a number of headlines ...  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: ... as you know, about FTX the company buying a lot of real estate up in the Bahamas ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... where you lived, at least at the time, was owned by the company. But then there's also reports that your parents signed and were effectively provided with what seemed like a vacation home.  SBF: So, I don't know the details of that house for, for my parents, but I knew that it was not intended to be their long-term property. I know it was intended to be the company's property. I don't know how that was papered in and I think that was where it was, was – and will – end up. I think they may have stayed there while working, you know, with the company sometime over the last year. When you look at the rest of it, there were a lot of property purchases in the Bahamas. You know, the reason for that is we had, you know, 100, you know, basically 100 Silicon Valley, you know, top Silicon Valley employees come down here to work for FTX. And, you know, we were trying to incentivize that and to, you know, make sure that they had an easy way to find a comfortable life so that they'd be willing to move and, and help build out the product. And so, you know, those 100 people put together here did end up, you know, buying a substantial amount of property. And I feel kind of – I feel bad about some of how those investments may turn out for them.  ARS: Can you just speak to the idea of this company that, at least from the public perspective, seemed like a regulated company or ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... something that was very focused on compliance. You would go to Washington, you'd talk about compliance, you'd talk about trust.  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: Crypto, ultimately, is actually about trust.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: It's about not having to trust others. Frankly, it's supposed to be a trustless system.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: That's why you trust every – trust it so much supposedly.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: But it seems like when you read the stories, it sounds like a bunch of kids who are on Adderall having a sleepover party. [Audience laughs.]  SBF: I mean, look, I screwed up. Like, I was CEO, I was the CEO of FTX. And, I mean, I say this again and again, that that means I had a responsibility, that means that I was responsible ultimately for us doing the right things and, I mean, we didn't. Like, we, we messed up big.  ARS: But there were people, though, that were telling you that you needed more compliance, no?  SBF: There were, but I, I think that compliance – we were spending an enormous amount of our energy on compliance. We were spending an enormous amount of our energy on regulation on licensure. We were getting licensed in dozens of jurisdictions. I think, frankly, we were spending probably too much of our energy getting licensed, in retrospect, and, you know, there were some places where I think that the reporting and transparency obligations from that licensure actually did help. I think when you look at, I mean, FTX US Derivatives, I think when you look at FTX Japan, which I think is fully solvent, which I think could make all customers whole tomorrow if it were – if, you know, the sort of relevant teams were to allow it to. I'm confused why it hasn't. But I, but, you know, I think that a lot of what we ended up doing and focusing on was a distraction to some extent from one unbelievably important area that we completely failed on, and that was risk. That was risk management. That was, you know, customer position risk. And, you know, frankly, conflict of interest risk. And, you know, there was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional risk of customers on FTX. And that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect, because that was – you go back to 2019, even 2018, and ask me, why am I starting to build out FTX? What's the point of it? And what I would have said was, look, the existing crypto derivatives exchanges have large risk management failures that every day there are millions of dollars that are being lost by customers because of risk management failures that these contracts are paying out 75 cents on the dollar week after week after week because of risk management blowouts. And that, that needs to be overhauled. And that was what I was focused on for the beginning of FTX. I was not focused on that for the last year or two. I got less grounded from that and I started focusing on the bigger picture, on, you know, future business avenues on, on licensure, on a lot of things. And, I mean, we lost track of a really important part of the business and of the product. And, so, there absolutely were management failures, huge management failures. I bear responsibility for that. There were oversight failures, transparency failures, reporting, like, so many things we should have had in place. I think that a lot of it was on the risk management side, rather ...  ARS: Let me ask you about that. Which is, we had [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink here today, and he had a stake ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... in FTX. And Sequoia and Paradigm and some very big venture capital firms had, had, had given you money, and I'm curious if they ever asked you questions about this risk management and whether they bear any responsibility for what clearly now appears that you're saying was at minimum a lack of oversight, if not something much worse.  SBF: I don't think that they bear responsible. I mean, like, when you look at – when you put your eyes – you put yourself in the eyes of an investor, of a venture capital firm. What you're thinking about primarily is upside. Right? What you're thinking about primarily is investing in a private company, and thinking might this 3x, might this 5x, might this even 10x on the upside cases, and, yeah, there's some chance that will go down, there's some chance that maybe it will go down to zero. But that's counterbalanced by the upside propositions here. And so most of what they were focused on was, you know, I think, like, what might FTX become, what's the pathway to get from here to there, you know, what would it take? What are the missing pieces? You know, rather than, you know, at the point where you're dwelling on all of the various precise downside scenarios and risks for a prospective venture investment, that means you're not investing. Like, if that's where your head's at, you know, if you think the odds are that that's where things are going to end up, why, why would you do that investment?  ARS: Can I ask you about the drugs?  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: You, you have tweeted about it. Caroline has tweeted about it, others have tweeted about uppers and downers ...  SBF: Right.  ARS: ... and all sorts of things. There have been pictures taken of something called Emsam ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... which apparently increases levels of dopamine to the brain to – actually for Parkinson's. Were you taking that? It's a patch.  SBF: So, I, it's, it's funny hearing this. I, I had my first sip of alcohol after my 21st birthday, and I think I, I have maybe half a glass of, of alcohol a year, roughly speaking. There were no wild parties here. When we had parties, we played board games and, you know, 20% of people would have three-quarters of a beer each or something like that. And, you know, the rest of us would not drink anything. I didn't see any illegal drug use around me, you know, at the office, at, at these parties. Like, and, and, and, and when I say parties here, I mean, like, you know, having people over for dinner is what that meant. And, look, I can't talk about anyone else, like, you know, what they're prescribed is between themselves and their, their, their doctors or psychiatrists. I can say for me, I don't know, like, I, I have been prescribed various things at various times to help with focus and concentration. I, and, I think they have done that. I haven't felt any of, you know, the sort of impacts that I think people have been theorizing here from it. And it's not a huge impact, you know, in the first place, anyway. I think, you know, these have all just been totally on, on-label use of, of medications. And, you know, I think things that have on the margin helped me focus a little bit. I wish I had been a lot more focused over the last year.  ARS: I may have been unfocused in this last moment because I actually wanted to follow up on the question when we're talking about venture capitalists.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: Sequoia and Paradigm invested in you. But there have now been questions about the fact that you invested in them, and whether these were what some people describe in the business, round-trip deals. Can you speak to that?  SBF: I mean, I think well after they had invested in FTX, and I don't know the details, but I think there may have been a small investment into some of their funds. I think, you know, it was something that we did because – and I would believe in what they're doing, it seemed like a, a good opportunity. And didn't think too much about it.  ARS: I'm curious just on a very personal level, because we are close to ending this conversation, to the degree that there's been a lesson in this and that what you see as your future at this point. I know you're taking it day to day, obviously.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: And I know you're an optimist as well. We've talked about that.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: But what do you think realistically is your future?  SBF: So, what is my future? I don't know what my far future is. And, you know, when you fast forward, I have no idea what I'm gonna be doing, you know, a long time from now. I think when I look at, you know, the near- and medium-term, what am I thinking? What I'm thinking is – and, again, I don't know what's going to happen. And a lot of it's not my hands at this point. But I want to be helpful wherever I can to regulators, administrators, you know, internationally, who are working to, you know, to help FTX's customers, and I want to be helpful wherever I can on anything that could help bring a lot more value to those customers. And, you know, I don't know where that will lead. I can say that prior to filing, there had been a lot of interest in, in financing. A lot of fairly strong interest, you know, many billions of dollars' worth. I don't – I can't make any promises about anything, but I, I would have thought that there would be a chance for a pathway forward here that would bring more value to customers than what would happen if you just sort of sold everything off for, you know, scraps, and I don't have confidence. I, I can't promise you – I can't promise anyone anything there, and it's not really in my hands to a large extent. But, but I would think that it would make sense to be exploring that, because I, I think there's a chance that customers could end up made a lot more whole, I don't know, maybe even fully whole, if there was a really strong, concerted effort.  ARS: How would that happen?  SBF: So, you know, there have been examples of this before in crypto history where that happened. Obviously, you can look at what happened with Bitfinex back a number of years ago where it got hacked and then ended up making, over a few-year period, customers whole. There are a lot of assets that are on hand here, although many of them are not liquid. They were worth quite a bit more than the, you know, liabilities a month ago, even, a lot of them a year ago. You know, there's – at least a month ago, there were, you know, or, I guess, you know, three weeks ago, billions of dollars of potential funding opportunities. You know, I don't know that it would have been great for my stake as a shareholder of FTX. But that's not what matters here. And I think it would have brought more financing to customers. You saw, obviously, you know, the TRON facility which was open for a little while on FTX, which allowed some customers to get liquidity. And, you know, you put some of these together. You know, there's obviously, you know, equity in the business. Where's that lead? I don't know exactly. And, again, it's not going to be my decision to make at the end of the day, but I, but I think there's a shot for a real value.  ARS: Sam, we're gonna have to wrap up, and a couple of just quick other questions.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: One is, given what you know about compliance, or the lack of it in this business  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... in this industry ...  SBF: Yep.  ARS: ... I think there are a lot of people who are holding crypto today, perhaps on exchanges like Binance and other places.  SBF: Yep.  ARS: What should they think, given what you do know and to the extent that you can tell us the truth about what you know?  SBF: What should they think? And, and, I, I presume you're asking, what should they think about the safety of their assets going forward?  ARS: Correct.  SBF: Yeah. So, look, I don't – I obviously don't know exactly what's going on at other exchanges. I can tell you what I would think as a customer, you know, if I were a customer here, which is: Look for the things that I wish FTX had been able to supply, things like proof of reserves is helpful. Look for as rigorous of that as you can. Look for regulatory reporting, right. You look at what the [Financial Services Agency] had in place in Japan. You look at what FTX US Derivatives had with, you know, sort of frequent reporting to regulators of exactly what, you know, customer assets, balances, liabilities, distributions are. And ...  ARS: What about the governance piece?  SBF: Yeah.  ARS: What about the governance piece, because one of the things we have not talked about, is you had no board and you had no CFO. And that should have been a red flag, frankly, for all of us.  SBF: So, interestingly, in some ways, we had too many boards, we had ...  [Sam Bankman-Fried's video cuts out, but is then restored within a minute.]  ARS: Sam, thank you for coming back. We were in the middle of the conversation about no board, no CFO, and you said something which I think raised a lot of eyebrows here. You said you thought you had too many boards.  SBF: Yeah. And can you hear me here?  ARS: Yep, we can all hear you.  SBF: Cool. So, we didn't talk about it much but there's a board of FTX Japan, there's a board of FTX US Derivatives, FTX Australia, FTX Singapore, FTX Europe. You know, we had, I think, more than a dozen boards, when you look at all of the entities put together. And, you know, many of these boards had regulatory functions. I think the problem to some extent was, OK, sure, you have all these boards. But at the end of the day, when push comes to shove, who's the person who's in charge of global – or the board or, or, or the function that's in charge of, you know, global site, customer risk management. Like, you know, there's a diffusion of responsibility to some extent on that front. And, you know, there needed to be, I think, a single or a small set of entities, whether – of boards, people, of responsible parties that were sitting there saying, ""I feel responsible for what happens on FTX."" And, you know, we had, we had actually audited financials. From the FTX finances perspective, we had infrastructure, but from the customer risk and finances perspective, much less.  ARS: Sam, how much money do you have left at this point?  SBF: I mean, to my knowledge, like, close to nothing.  ARS: What does that mean?  SBF: I mean, everything was just in the companies. I mean, it's ...  ARS: You didn't put away some money?  SBF: No, no, I, I don't have any, you know, hidden funds here. Everything I have, I'm disclosing and, you know, I'm, I'm down to – I think I have one working credit card left. I think it, I think it might be $100,000 or something like that in, in that bank account. And, I mean, I, you know, everything that I had, even all the loans I had were, those, you know, those were all things that I was reinvesting in, in the businesses that – I had put everything I had into FTX.  ARS: I want to ask you two final questions. Were you truthful with us today?  SBF: I, I was as truthful as, as I, as, you know, I'm knowledgeable to be. There's, there's some things I wish I knew about more. But, yes, I was.  ARS: So let me ask you this. Do you agree that over time you also lied?  SBF: Do I believe – do I agree that I lied? I don't know of times when I lied. I think, look, there are certainly times when I was acting as a, as a representative, as a marketer for FTX and when I was looking for how can I, you know, in a way which is truthful, but, you know, paint FTX as, you know, compelling a way as possible, as exciting and optimistic a way as possible. And, you know, I wasn't thinking about – I wasn't talking about what are the risks involved with FTX, you know, there. I obviously wished that I had spent more time dwelling on the downsides and less time thinking about the upsides.  ARS: Sam Bankman-Fried, I want to thank you for this interview. I hope that some of the answers have been helpful as we've tried to understand and untangle what is a still-tangled story. Sam, I know that this has been a difficult conversation and a tough conversation. And on behalf of everybody here and on behalf of the public, I want to thank you for engaging in it at a time, in truth, when I know you've been advised not to, so thank you so very, very much.

42388519,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHuxR,1669853802,Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried: 'I Didn’t Knowingly Commingle Funds',"The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire left customers with missing funds and unresolved questions.  But Bankman-Fried’s highly anticipated Wednesday interview with the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin didn't answer many of those questions, nor did it deliver the mea culpa many have hoped to hear from the 30-year-old former crypto billionaire.  Bankman-Fried clung to the narrative that FTX’s collapse resulted from an untimely market crash, and maintained that he had not knowingly committed any crimes. He joined the conversation virtually from his residence in the Bahamas, against the advice of his lawyers.  “I didn’t ever try to commit fraud,” Bankman-Fried said.  Click here or here for CoinDesk reporters' live tweets of Bankman-Fried's interview.  Bankman-Fried’s FTX.com and FTX US exchanges were once valued at a combined $40 billion, but the entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month after a CoinDesk story highlighted balance sheet irregularities in FTX's trading arm, Alameda Research. Preliminary court proceedings reveal billions of dollars in FTX customer funds remain unaccounted for.  Bankman-Fried acknowledged becoming nervous after publication of the CoinDesk story on Nov. 2, although he ""didn't think it was existential for FTX.""  One theory is that Bankman-Fried improperly transferred those funds between the FTX exchange, and Alameda, which squandered them through a series of bad trades. When asked repeatedly by Sorkin whether he improperly took customer deposits and lent them to Alameda, Bankman-Fried said he “didn’t knowingly commingle funds.”  Bankman-Fried attributed the situation to an accounting mistake, saying there was a “substantial discrepancy” between the company’s legitimate audited financials and the figures displayed on the exchange’s faulty dashboards. “I was surprised,” said Bankman-Fried, who fidgeted during the interview and repeatedly looked down at the floor, although he did not appear to be simultaneously playing video games, as he often does during media interviews.  When pressed about the relationship between Alameda and FTX, Bankman-Fried said it had decreased over time.  “I was primarily looking at it from a trading perspective,” said Bankman-Fried, adding that Alameda accounted for only about 2% of FTX’s volume in 2022, down from about 45% of FTX’s volume in 2019. He said the fact that FTX employees lived with Alameda employees did not seem inappropriate.  When asked about his future and whether he had any criminal liability, Bankman-Fried stuttered, “I don’t personally think that ... that’s not what I’m focusing on.”  “There’s going to be a time and place to think about myself and my future,” Bankman-Fried said. “I’ve had a bad month. Right now, that’s not what matters here.”  UPDATE (Dec. 1, 2022, 0:30 UTC): Adds line about Bankman-Fried's nervousness.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/01/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-i-didnt-knowingly-commingle-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3075029bbc168fbcc86edcae23cf3f014228710-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
4987797,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561555-apecoin-staking-is-just-days-away?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1669853142,ApeCoin: Staking Is Just Days Away,"Summary ApeCoin has been one of the best-performing crypto assets since the FTX-fueled crypto crash in early November. Token holders have increased over the last several months, in part because of the lead-up to APE staking. Horizon Labs is developing APE staking but will be geo-blocking US consumers from accessing the official front-end application of the smart contract. 2022 has been a horrible year for just about every single cryptocurrency or blockchain-based asset. There are numerous examples of the breadth of the speculative mania that was digital assets from 2020-2021, but the best example of deviation from value reality may have been from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (or BAYC) NFTs. I detailed what I felt was a massive overvaluation of the ""ape ecosystem"" in late April 2022 in a post called "" Insanity of the Apes ."" At the time, the market cap of the original BAYC was $4.3 billion based on a 147 Ethereum (ETH-USD) floor price per NFT - that floor price is now just 64.44 ETH. At a $1,290 ETH price, the 10,000 ape pictures now have a collection market cap of $832 million. Meaning the BAYC collection has collapsed 80% in value since that subscriber-only article. Interestingly, ApeCoin ( APE-USD ), the official currency of the ape ecosystem has actually held up better and is up substantially since the FTX-induced crypto collapse from early November: Since FTX Collapse (Seeking Alpha) ApeCoin is now up nearly 50% from the depths of the crypto selloff caused by the collapses of FTX (FTT-USD) and Alameda Research earlier this month. ApeCoin is now beating both Ethereum and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the last several weeks. Why did ApeCoin go up? The biggest catalyst that ApeCoin currently has is the activation of ApeCoin staking. The ability to stake APE is something that Horizon ( ZEN-USD ) developer Horizon Labs has been working on. While previous target dates have been pushed back, Horizon Labs has announced December 5th for the launch of apestake.io with reward accrual to begin on December 12th. According to Horizon Labs, there are four different staking pools that will allow ape ecosystem participants to get returns on their staked assets: ApeCoin pool BAYC pool MAYC pool Paired pool The staked assets and token allocations vary by pool. But the lowest barrier to entry for Ape staking is simply with the APE token where there is no minimum threshold for staking rewards. In anticipation of the ability to stake assets, the amount of total holders of APE has increased from a little under 91k at the beginning of October to over 103k now: APE Holders (Dune Analytics/Marcov) At least some of that November spike in token holders is likely attributable to the movement toward taking assets out of centralized exchanges that has been broadly felt throughout crypto, but there is no denying the trend in APE token holders has been positive even before the FTX blowup. How to stake ApeCoin Like just about any staking asset in the cryptocurrency space, users who wish to stake their coins can engage directly with the smart contracts if they are technically savvy enough. This is generally not how people typically stake assets, however, as developers usually provide front-end applications that allow DeFi users to engage with the contracts with much less effort. This will not necessarily be the case for ApeCoin initially depending on which jurisdiction the user is in. In its pre-launch summary, Horizon Labs indicated that it will be geo-blocking several countries from interacting with apestake.io, including the United States and Canada. We are aware that geoblocking some users in North America is inconvenient for many members of the ApeCoin community. Unfortunately, in today’s regulatory environment, we had no good alternative Given Horizon Labs' presence in the crypto community elsewhere, this action may not be because of fears of crypto regulation broadly. It is possibly more out of an abundance of caution with the Ape ecosystem and APE specifically. The SEC is probing BAYC creators Yuga Labs and APE distribution is reportedly part of that investigation. This alone should give investors pause when entertaining the idea of buying ApeCoin. But even if the SEC probe wasn't a factor, there is still a lot I don't like about APE as an investment today. Is ApeCoin a good investment? We've seen other instances of coins under SEC scrutiny not getting listed on the major exchanges, Ripple ( XRP-USD ) being the best example. That said, just because something may face SEC scrutiny doesn't mean it's a terrible investment if it has value in other jurisdictions. Still though, I can't get behind buying APE today given the level of coin dilution that is still scheduled through 2025. APE Supply Schedule (Messari) There are still just 361 million of the 1 billion APE coin supply in circulation. At just 36% circulating supply, APE still has a very high level of inflation remaining before the max supply is met. Market Cap Rank Creator Coin Circulating Supply 31 ApeCoin 36% 42 Chiliz ( CHZ-USD ) 69% 44 THETA Network ( THETA-USD ) 100% 49 The Sandbox ( SAND-USD ) 50% 84 Basic Attention Token ( BAT-USD ) 100% Source: CoinMarketCap It's true that APE was just released this year, but that is one of the lowest circulating supply levels of the top creator coins in the entire crypto market. Dune Analytics/Carl5 Furthermore, ApeCoin is supposed to serve as a payment coin in the ape ecosystem, yet the weekly active users of the coin have been steadily declining over the last several months and haven't sniffed the peak from the coin's launch. Summary I think there are too many other coins that are more interesting in this market to justify going long APE given the obvious regulatory concerns, the low engagement with the coin, and the high remaining level of dilution. I think the surge in token holders can probably be linked to the expectation of staking rewards. The problem is there are many who have likely bought the coin to generate those rewards who will not be able to interact with the developer's staking interface because of geo-blocking in the U.S., Canada, and other countries. To be fair, other developers who are not associated with Horizon Labs or ApeCoin can also create a front-end solution that will enable APE staking in the U.S. and elsewhere, but Horizon Labs is clearly avoiding the market for a reason. Because of that, I think it would be wise to avoid going through other actors to facilitate staking APE token. There may come a time when Yuga Labs and the ape ecosystem have the all-clear from regulators to continue building what they're attempting to build. At that time, APE might become more interesting if the ape ecosystem can maintain interest beyond crypto winter. You can read my previous ApeCoin article from May if you would like more insight into the ecosystem. But until we have regulatory clarity, I personally am not touching APE. While I would definitely not short it, I think holders would be wise to swap out.",NEUTRAL,ETH | APE,ETH | ICO | MARKET | REGULATION | APE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4561555-apecoin-staking-is-just-days-away?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4987797.jpeg

A Litecoin Whale Has Taken Out 835.8k LTC From Binance As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, two large LTC transfers have been spotted on the chain during the past day. The first of these Litecoin transactions involved the movement of 73,794 LTC, worth just under $5.8 million at the time of the transfer. Massive transfers like these usually belong to a single whale, or an entity made up of multiple investors. Depending on the intent behind them, such transactions may have noticeable impacts on the market. Here are some additional details about the transfer that might shed some light on why it was made: Looks like the sender had to pay a negligible fee of 0.00004518 LTC for the coins to go through | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in this case was attached to a wallet associated with the crypto exchange Binance, while the receiver was an unknown address. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Prediction: Why LTC Could Hit $100 and Outperform Bitcoin Unknown addresses like these are usually personal wallets, and are unaffiliated with any known centralized platform. The second Litecoin transaction saw a whopping 762,073 LTC move on the chain, equivalent to $59.8 million according to the exchange rate at the time of the transfer. Below are the details regarding this transaction. This massive transfer seems to have taken only $0.02 in fees to be possible | Source: Whale Alert It looks like this transaction also went from the crypto exchange Binance to an unknown wallet, much like the other transfer. Related Reading: Klaytn (KLAY) and Litecoin (LTC) Gains Will Be Short Lived! Experts Pick Snowfall Protocol (SNW) As The Next 1000x Gainer! In fact, both these transactions involved the same sending and receiving addresses, implying the same whale might be behind both of these. Transfers where coins exit the centralized custody of exchanges are called “exchange outflows.” Usually, investors withdraw their coins from these platforms for accumulation purposes. Hence, large outflows like the ones observed during the past day can be a sign that whales are accumulating, and can therefore be bullish for the price of Litecoin. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin’s price floats around $77.5, down 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has gained 37% in value.
