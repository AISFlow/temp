42386772,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVG07,1621461105,Senate Banking Chairman 'Concerned' by OCC's Crypto Charters,"Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu that he is ""concerned"" about the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) granting national trust charters to ""financial and non-financial companies.""      Some of the companies seeking OCC charters are unable to meet the OCC's regulatory requirements, Brown said in the open letter, first reported by Politico. The lawmaker specifically pointed to the three crypto companies that have secured conditional OCC trust charters in the past five months: Paxos, Protego and Anchorage, and asked that Hsu ""reassess"" the conditional trust charters.      These companies market their ""federally chartered status,"" Brown said.      ""In other words, these companies suggest that the OCC’s approval of their charters guarantees their business model is as safe, stable and dependable for customers as a local community bank,"" Brown's letter said, adding:    ""The fact is, given the many uncertainties present in the digital asset landscape as identified by other regulators, the volatility of digital asset valuations and the disproportionate influence individuals can have on entire cryptocurrency markets, the OCC is not in a position to regulate these entities comparably to traditional banks.""    The senator also said it was ""unclear"" whether the OCC had conducted the ""appropriate due diligence"" before granting the three conditional charters, pointing specifically to former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks' tenure.      Brooks, an appointee during the Trump Administration, encouraged crypto companies to seek a trust charter because it was ""just a faster charter to get,"" Brown wrote.      ""I urge you to review the procedures and guidelines followed within the OCC regarding the evaluation and approval of the Anchorage, Paxos and Protego charters to ensure that the OCC’s supervision and licensing standards remain both rigorous and equitable among charter applicants,"" Brown said.      Brown's letter comes on a day of extreme volatility in the crypto market, with bitcoin falling close to $12,000 before rebounding nearly $8,000. Much of the market remains in the red over the past 24 hours.      Hsu, who took office barely two weeks ago, already indicated that the OCC is reviewing how it approaches digital assets when he testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this week.    Read more: New OCC Chief Signals Greater Caution on Crypto    Importantly, the trust charters Anchorage, Protego and Paxos have are conditional. The OCC would have to grant a final trust charter after a number of months.      “Since its inception, Paxos has sought to be the most regulated, compliant and trusted operator in the crypto and blockchain infrastructure industry,"" Paxos spokesperson Rebecca McClain said in a statement, adding:    ""Six years ago, Paxos was the first company to secure a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter. That charter requires all customer crypto assets to be held in bankruptcy-remote, segregated accounts. Paxos is not involved in deposit-taking or consumer lending. All Paxos-issued stablecoins have been approved by our regulators and are fully backed by U.S. dollars and U.S. treasuries in FDIC-insured, U.S. bank accounts. The quality of our Board of Directors demonstrates our culture of compliance. We are held to the same BSA, KYC and AML standards as all NYDFS-regulated banks. This oversight includes regular on-site examinations. We look forward to working with Chairman Brown to ensure that all industry players meet these same high standards.”    UPDATE (May 19, 22:25 UTC): Updated with additional context.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/19/senate-banking-chairman-concerned-by-occs-crypto-charters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3412b1d3b663c361ca7c5ebd477c611dcca02783-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVG7f,1621457203,"Market Wrap: Capitulation City as Bitcoin Dumps to $31K, ETH to $2K Before Reversal","An unusual confluence of bearish fundamentals caused all cryptocurrencies to fall Wednesday, but traders seem to be scooping up cheaper crypto, sparking something of a rebound.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $39,461 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Down 8.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $31,926-$43,602 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,609 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 23.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,089-$3,447 (CoinDesk 20)  ‘Cascading liquidations’    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was in the red Wednesday by 8.7% as of press time. BTC was above the 10-hour moving average and below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      The total drop for bitcoin in the past 24 hours was 26.7%, going from a high of $43,602 around 21:15 UTC (5:15 p.m. ET) to as low as $31,926 around 13:15 UTC (9:15 a.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin has recovered somewhat from that low, at $39,461 as of press time.      Bitcoin has fallen almost 50% from its high on April 12, said Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer for quantitative firm Global Digital Assets.      Over $8 billion in liquidations occurred during bitcoin’s journey downward.      “What we saw today was a black swan event of cascading liquidations,” Friedman said.    Trading volumes surge    However, BTC is trending back up. Wednesday is shaping up to be the highest spot volume day for bitcoin in 2021. As of press time, daily volume is over $14 billion on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk.      Global Digital Asset’s Friedman sees price support at $37,000, where traders will keep scooping up more bitcoin should the price head back down to that level.      “We have more than likely seen the bottom here,” Friedman said.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Plunge ‘Feels Like Capitulation,’ Says Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz    Bitcoin 'scare factor' proven on exchanges    Over the past week, and based on closing data from Tuesday, activity involving investors depositing bitcoin on exchanges has declined by about 40% to around 51,000 transactions, according to data aggregator Glassnode.      “A huge market is scared,” said Greg Magadini, chief executive officer for data aggregator Genesis Volatility.      Magadini said fear that China may be cracking down on crypto after it reiterated its previous crypto bans is just one of the catalysts that may have caused newer entrants to sell. This may further reduce exchange activity over time, an interesting data point to watch.      “China has played this game before where they have banned crypto and brought it back,” said Steve Ehrlich, chief executive officer for financial service firm Voyager Digital. “There are reports that China is focused on their own digital currency within the government, so it’s possible that this was the motive.”    Bitcoin dominance roars back    After briefly touching 40% Tuesday, according to data from charting software TradingView, bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the greater crypto market capitalization) is flashing green, up four percentage points to 44.01% as of press time.      Mostafa Al-Mashita, vice president of trading at Global Digital Assets, saw Wednesday as value-buying day, with some market participants rotating back into the supposed safe haven of bitcoin, waiting out what entrepreneur and amatuer crypto troll Elon Musk might say next on Twitter.      “Buyers today will be rewarded, at least short term, for picking up coins at discount prices,” Al-Mashita said. “Elon's tweets are quite eccentric and unfounded from his end, but show the fickle nature of this market reacting to a single participant.”    Ether still outperforming bitcoin    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,609 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 23.1% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.      The total drop for ether in the past 24 hours, going from a high of $3,447 around 21:30 UTC (5:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday to as low as $2,089 around 13:15 UTC (9:15 a.m. ET) Wednesday was 39.3%, according to CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has recovered somewhat from that low, at $2,609 as of press time.      Despite a more precipitous fall Wednesday, ether has been destroying bitcoin in terms of overall performance this year. As of press time, ETH’s percentage gain is in the triple digits, while bitcoin has eked out a gain of around 59% this year.    An era of hot money    In its latest investor note, quantitative trading firm QCP Capital questioned why, in an era of hot money, only bitcoin has been labeled the inflation buster of crypto.      “We were always of the opinion that the biggest misconception out there is that BTC is a safe haven or inflation hedge,” the note states. “The moves in the last few months validate this entirely while the BTC enthusiasm has been sucked out last week by the confluence of Elon's corporate ESG stamp of disapproval [and] the [U.S. Federal Reserve] running way hotter, leading to much lower real yields.”      Read More: Crypto Market Loses $460B as Ether, Altcoins Follow Bitcoin’s Deep Dive    DeFi deflates, ETH fees explode    As the crypto market dumps Wednesday, the amount of cryptocurrency held in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has decreased by $20 billion in the past week. Some of this is due to falling crypto valuations but might also have to do with investors pulling out ASAFP.      One indicator to watch are the ridiculously high fees exacted on Ethereum of late. According to data aggregator Dune Analytics, a simple ether transaction cost $38.10 Wednesday. Trading on decentralized exchange Uniswap carries a hefty $230.25 fee.      The need for alternative blockchains besides Ethereum to run DeFi is clear during market downfalls, noted crypto venture capitalist Constantin Kogan.      “This is why a lot of DeFi projects are moving to Binance Smart Chain or Polkadot, etc.,” said Kogan. “The future is multichain.”      The DeFi market also experienced a high number of liquidations Wednesday, the most since Feb. 22.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all red Wednesday. Notable losers as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    eos (EOS) - 31.3%  tezos (XTZ) - 30.6%  litecoin (LTC) - 29.5%    Equities:    In Japan the Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.3% as a rise in coronavirus infections and concern over the still-planned Tokyo Olympics this summer led to bearishness.  In Europe the FTSE 100 ended the day in the red 1.2% as concerns over inflation, which doubled in the U.K. in April, influenced traders to sell.  The S&P 500 in the United States slipped 0.30% in a volatile session, with tech stocks falling but the market recovering somewhat by day's end on strong earnings reports.

Think back to 2018, when Consensus was held at its traditional venue at a Hilton on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. By all accounts, it was mayhem.      That was the year Consensus had its largest attendance (a reported 8,400), when attendees struggled to get to the second-floor registration area (because of a crush at the bottom of the stairs) and Decred's giant Stakey man-puppet dominated the exhibition area. The New York Times commissioned a photo essay titled “When Thousands Filled a Hilton Ballroom to Ponder the Future of Bitcoin.”    CoinDesk is hosting the all virtual Consensus 2021 event May 24-27. Register here.    “It’s a barometer for the industry,” Jacob Donnelly, one of the organizers of Consensus 2018, said in an interview. “We were coming off the ICO (initial coin offering) boom. Bitcoin had hit $20 K. People who were obscure were suddenly in the New York Times,"" he said.      “When an industry is ripe like that – and to be clear, my suspicion is the industry is like that right now – there’s a certain exuberance,” he said. (Donnelly is now at the newsletter-based media startup MorningBrew.)      History may not repeat itself, but it sometimes rhymes. Three years ago, everyone had an idea for a decentralized Uber or a price target for BTC at $100k. A rally in XRP, driven by the eponymous army, briefly made Brad Garlinghouse wealthier on paper than Mark Zuckerberg.      This year, a serious market risk assessment might include Elon Musk appearing on a late-night sketch comedy show. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell fielded a question about dogecoin. Everyone from Paris Hilton to Procter & Gamble have minted non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Still, as exuberant as crypto can sometimes be, there is real work being done.    Reality check    “I thought to myself, ‘what the f**k have I gotten myself into?’” Mark Yarm said, recalling his first day on the job as a reporter for BREAKER Magazine on what happened to be the first day of Consensus 2018, the largest ever in-person blockchain conference. “I come into this convention center, and it's just packed. I mean, I think there were 8,000 people. It was, like, thousands of people, thousands of tech bros. It was just overwhelming.”      Yarm, now features editor for Input, was breaking into crypto media in search of stability (shocking, right?) after years of freelancing. He had bylines at esteemed publications like Wired and The New York Times. And just enough crypto knowledge to “help get me hired.”      “It was a really strange first day of work, for sure,” Yarm said. Although he doesn’t remember talking to anyone at the event (besides his BREAKER colleagues), Yarm will never forget the atmosphere of that Consensus.      His head filled with stories about Crypto Castles and the nouveau riche microdosing while zipping through Miami Beach in orange Lamborghinis, he was startled by what he actually experienced. “I got the sense that this was becoming mainstream,” he said. “As somebody coming in cold, it felt like cryptocurrencies were being taken very seriously by a lot of people.”      There’s often a discrepancy between how crypto exists in the public imagination and what is actually happening on the ground. Often dismissed as a group of white, male libertarian ideologues, building energy-intensive Rube Goldberg machines designed to separate you from your cash, the crypto industry is anything but. Sure, there’s plenty of tech bros. And scams. But the reality is so much more staid. Nowhere was that more on display than at Consensus.      Donnelly agreed. It wasn’t the Aston Martins given away on a yacht, Justin Sun’s face plastered street level on the side of The Hilton or Snoop Dogg performing at a late-night XRP event that stood out for Donnelly, but the business-mindedness of the whole affair.      He, like Yarm, remembers a bunch of impromptu meetings, bankers talking to developers wearing hoodies, people practicing their sales pitch waiting in line for their badges. (“Did people wait a long time? Absolutely. There was a long line,” Donnelly said.) It’s not that the ostentatious displays of wealth were fabricated or misremembered, but almost beside the point.      That said, not everyone had such a congenial time. Months after the event, CoinDesk columnist Jill Carlson wrote: “Consensus - where 24 year olds were literally accosting me with elevator pitches for their funds and I couldn’t move three feet without someone handing me a QR code for their ICO and afterparties involved lambo giveaways.”      Luke Powell, a developer for Decred, has an insider’s view here. Decred was one of those crypto upstarts that placed down a chunk of change to have a booth and presence at the conference. The project managers had an idea to hire someone to wear a foam costume of the blockchain’s mascot, Stakey.      It was a way to compete for attention in a crowd of projects flush with cash from ICOs (Powell noted Decred never had a token offering) that were handing out T-shirts and other swag. “That was during the peak of when we actually were experimenting with spending money directly on marketing,” he said. “Everybody, you know, was basically still living through the peak end of the 2018 run-up.”      Despite the lingering “good feelings” from the money high, Powell said the event was also exhausting. It didn’t feel like work, necessarily, but it was mostly a blur of manning the booth, talking up Decred, and shuffling around to interviews and media appearances. “It's one of those love, hate things,” he said, where after 10, 12 hours you’re just thankful to collapse in a hotel bed.      Swinging it back around to work, Powell said the big “value add” of the conference was being able to refine his pitch. “You're saying it so many times over a short period of time, and you're getting that in‑person interaction,” he said. It was invaluable being able to see people’s reactions, especially considering the “sheer number of people” walking around, eating pigs in a blanket.      “We knew that it was going to be bigger. But we didn't anticipate quite that scale,” Donnelly said. Still, he was surprised by how many people bothered to show up. After all, the bubble had burst.      “I think it was a good total immersion into it,” Input’s Yarm said of his first experience with crypto through Consensus. It set him up to interview the “bona fide billionaires” he would later profile. The people who went to Consensus to build likely still are.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | XRP | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/19/when-8400-bitcoiners-went-to-a-hilton-to-talk-about-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e46512d4625e841781e50421caa4098fe76469ec-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Series A funding round closed May 13 and also included participation from the Tezos Foundation, Wedbush Capital and others, according to Vertalo CEO Dave Hendricks.      The four-year-old company helps to digitize assets from real estate to equity in the form of security tokens, using distributed ledger technology – relying primarily on the Tezos and Ethereum blockchains.      “In 2020 we started licensing the platform to broker dealers, capital providers, funds and multi-asset issuers so they can issue security tokens and onboard investors at scale,” Hendricks told CoinDesk in an interview.      Vertalo booked $1.5 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2021, Hendricks said.      One of the company's primary offerings is blockchain-based capitalization table management, using ledgers to keep track of the owners of shares and assets along with relevant information such as amounts, prices paid, purchase dates and options. The system allows ownership records to be updated in real time when trades are settled via smart contracts. It aims to reduce the errors and complexity involved in managing traditional cap tables, which are often manually updated on spreadsheets.

Per the activation rules set by Speedy Trial, 90% of blocks mined within one of Bitcoin’s difficulty periods need to signal support for the upgrade for it to be locked in for activation in November.    Read more: Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Hits New High; Taproot Begins Its Second Signaling Attempt    Currently, mining pools that represent 94% of Bitcoin’s hashrate have now included the Taproot “signal bit” to show their support for the upgrade. But it won’t be until the next difficulty period that we could see the upgrade locked in because the current difficulty period has already seen too many non-signaling blocks for miners to hit the threshold.      Bitcoin’s next difficulty adjustment is in approximately nine days. This next adjustment will mark the third of six possible signaling periods under Taproot’s Speedy Trial activation process, which began on May 1.      Czechia-based Slushpool was the first mining pool to signal for the upgrade, followed by Foundry, F2Pool, Poolin and Antpool. Notably, mining pools have signaled, un-signaled and re-signaled for a variety of reasons so the signaling percentage can oscillate. Poolin's signal, for example, dropped off in response to technical snafus while BTC.com's recently changed its status from signaling to not signaling for unknown reasons.    What is Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade?    Taproot is Bitcoin’s most anticipated upgrade since SegWit. The actual change, an alteration to two lines of code, is minimal, but Taproot will outfit Bitcoin with a new signature scheme known as Schnorr signatures.

With bitcoin down about 13% in the last 24 hours, and closer to 34% for the week, these are questions that a lot of people are asking themselves for the very first time. 2020 and 2021 saw a huge wave of new entrants into cryptocurrency, thanks first to sheer boredom, followed by the kind of get-rich-quick rubbernecking that turns everyone into a crypto expert every three years or so. To pick just one metric out of a hat, active Bitcoin wallet addresses have grown by roughly 35% since the start of the pandemic in March of last year.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist    It’s inevitable that a lot of these new entrants still have a limited understanding of the extremely nuanced technology behind true cryptocurrencies, or of the speculative and often head-spinning theories about how and why they will transform society. It’s not surprising or even particularly blameworthy. Whether we’re talking about crypto or stocks, most people just want to go to the beach, eat some ice cream, and occasionally FOMO into a hot asset they heard about on the internet.      That is, of course, a great way to stay poor. But new entrants to the 2020 crypto bull market have been indoctrinated in an even better approach to losing all your money: speculative day trading. I might not go so far as to call him Patient Zero, but Barstool Sports CEO Dave Portnoy is certainly the most prominent and emblematic vector here. He started livestreaming his stock day trading early in the pandemic and then aped into crypto during the summer of 2020.

Now, 24 hours later, he’s down about $15k on that bet. Portnoy also sold all his bitcoin last August, at around $11,500, after holding it for a whole week. He then bought back bitcoin two weeks ago at $48,000.      I don’t have a total picture of Portnoy’s activity, and it’s extremely likely that the broader bull market has left him way, way up since last summer despite his complete lack of discipline. But viewed with an even slightly critical eye, Portnoy has been doing a one-man extended performance art piece about why, according to a 2016 survey of data from trading platform Etoro, 80% of private day traders lose money over the course of a year. The median 12-month return of all traders in the dataset – not just the ones who lost money – was a 36.3% loss.      Today’s massive crypto crash is a great illustration of why. Most day traders, even the most disciplined and rigorous, trade based on market sentiment, and ""panic"" is a pretty overwhelming sentiment. The playbook for a typical day trader, at a moment like this, screams ""sell.""    Most private day traders are the microscopic, twitchy, anxious krill that slow-moving whales suck down for lunch    Meanwhile, longer-term investors use price dips to add to their holdings in assets they believe in long-term. That is the kernel of one of Warren Buffett’s most famous investment maxims: “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.” It’s why, in the ecology of asset markets well beyond crypto, most private day traders are the microscopic, twitchy, anxious krill that slow-moving whales suck down for lunch.      One caveat: There many individual day traders who make money trading even good old stocks. When it comes to crypto, the news-driven chaos creates tons of volatility, making it an even better way for truly skilled traders to profit. Traders also serve a far more useful function in highly speculative altcoin markets than in perhaps any other asset class, their ""skin in the game"" driving research, scrutiny, and price discovery of various projects. But it's not something you should dabble in.      And today, with total crypto market cap down nearly 20%, is a good time for recent crypto entrants to consider whether they want to remain speculative traders or become investors.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Why Cathie Wood’s ARKK Is Still Betting on Coinbase    Day traders bet on short-term changes in asset prices. Short-term trading momentum, these days, is usually driven by changes in sentiment more than by real changes in market conditions. As a day trader, you don’t care what a piece of news truly means, or even, ultimately, whether it’s true. You just care about guessing the next ten thousand traders’ reaction to it and positioning yourself to profit from it.      That approach is formalized in part through technical analysis, which is broadly touted as a way to measure and predict market sentiment. Technical analysis is explicitly framed as requiring little or no knowledge of the underlying asset – the chart tells the only story you want or need to know.      This is all in contrast with investment proper. Rather than focusing on sentiment, investors bet on how an asset will behave in the real economy. That generally means ignoring short-term fluctuations and heavily discounting market sentiment. There are grey areas, of course: Investors in tradeable “growth” assets like early-stage public companies have to do a subtle dance as they balance economic performance and market sentiment.      But most investors base their positions on a “thesis,” either about a company or a sector: a detailed, complex picture of what the future would look like if a company or project succeeds in its stated goals, and an evaluation of how likely that success is. That’s the source of the ""target prices"" issued by equity analysts, which project the price of a stock 12 months in the future. (Investments often have longer horizons – bitcoin being one – but generally professional investors don’t act on projections beyond two or three years out, precisely because they are based on real-world conditions that can’t be predicted.)      So today is the day to ask yourself: Why did you buy the crypto that’s currently destroying your hopes of ever owning a home, much less a Lambo? Did you have a thesis? And if so, has that thesis changed?      If you didn’t already have a thesis for your crypto investments, the middle of a crash is not a great time to seek one out. A thesis is your source of confidence and resolve as an investor, and it’s tough to build that airplane when you’re already at 5,000 feet and falling fast. Maybe your best bet for a good night’s sleep really is to sell everything.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    But maybe you just need a reminder of why you’re here. I’ll give you four.    1) Despite the rise of racist, xenophobic despots worldwide, globalization isn’t going anywhere. There’s a strong case that crypto is in some instanceshttps://www.americanexpress.com/us/foreign-exchange/articles/bitcoin-a-part-of-the-international-payments-landscape/ a more effective medium of cross-border payment than the traditional banking system.    2) The pandemic has blown a huge crater in national budgets, increasing debt issuance and the threat of inflation, most importantly in the U.S. dollar. Personally I’m on the fence about the idea that bitcoin is an ""inflation hedge,"" but many believe it.      3) Decentralized finance, which uses the trustless base layer of blockchain and automated smart contracts to issue and service loans, grew by 7,239% between January 2020 and April 2021.      4) Cryptocurrency is the only viable 21st-century solution to financial censorship, a huge risk of the digital age that hands massive power to governments and private corporations, and which is only growing.

42386767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVFtp,1621443693,DeFi Liquidations Up 14-Fold in Broad Crypto Sell-Off,"Borrowers on decentralized lending platforms are unwinding positions fast, most likely to avoid expensive liquidations as the global cryptocurrency market tumbles Wednesday.      According to decentralized finance (DeFi) wallet provider Debank, liquidations of collateral are up 14-fold during the most recent bad days on the lending market.      Over the last 24 hours, DeFi platforms have shaken off $662 million in loans, led by the Binance Smart Chain lending application Venus, Aave (versions 1 and 2) and Compound, Debank data shows.      A normal day has liquidations across DeFi products of $1 million to $5 million, according to Debank. On May 12, there were $39 million worth of liquidations.      When major cryptocurrencies lose a large amount of value on the spot market, it can cause many corresponding positions, such as bullish bets in the form of derivatives and loans, to unwind rapidly. That can prolong a sell-off and drive the pain deeper, if temporarily.      Highly financialized markets can accelerate downturns, noted Taylor Monahan, founder of wallet provider MyCrypto.      ""Leveraged positions get liquidated at humanly psychological barriers (40k / 3k) and when that collateral is liquidated, it drives the price down more, which triggers more liquidations which then sell at market, which drives the price down more, which triggers more liquidations,"" Monahan wrote in an email.      In DeFi, users can borrow assets without credit checks because they supply ample collateral. If the value of the collateral drops below the minimum to keep the loan current, third-party liquidators can trigger a function that sells the collateral off, levying a hefty liquidation fee on the borrower. Once the loan and fees are paid, the remainder returns to the borrower.      It's a painful haircut, though, and borrowers often rush to close positions when the market falls. That may explain why some stablecoins, which normally trade around $1 by design, briefly traded above their peg on Wednesday.      Total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum-based smart contracts has fallen by $11 billion since Tuesday night, dropping to $66 billion, according to DeFi Pulse. On Binance Smart Chain, TVL is down by the same amount, falling to $29 billion worth of assets functioning as collateral, according to Defistation.      Over the last year, the second-worst day for liquidations came on Feb. 22, when $129.6 million was liquidated.      For comparison, last year's so-called Black Tuesday, March 11, which particularly shook the MakerDAO community, saw only $16 million in liquidations, with another $5.7 million the next day.      Following that flash crash, MakerDAO added the stablecoin USDC as a collateral source in order to decrease its exposure to highly volatile assets.      It's not clear exactly what caused the crypto market, led by bellwether bitcoin, to pull back. Various explanations include China's reiteration of trading restrictions or simply an overdue correction.      ""My best guess is [investors are] simply deleveraging after a pretty euphoric period in the markets,"" said Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of data provider Coin Metrics.

This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Bitcoin, rangebound below $60,000 for weeks, is now changing hands below $40,000. Does this portend a reckoning? A correction? Some see it as a buying opportunity.      They will tell you, “BTFD.” Buy the dip, as it were. Let’s decode what the meme means.    It means to buy the dip.    Don’t overcomplicate it.      (Please don’t take investment advice from someone who writes about memes. And be wary of taking investment advice from memes.)    It’s a reminder that even though bitcoin is volatile, it trends up.    In 2015, bitcoin advocate Alex Millar released a video that offered unconventional investment advice for the crypto industry. “Don’t buy bitcoin,” he said. “It’s going to crash.”      Zooming out on a multi-year chart, Millar looked at the notable boom-and-bust cycles in bitcoin’s trading history. Bitcoin, in 2011, he said, went from 6 cents to 36 cents, then crashed. Months later, it went from 85 cents to approximately $29 before cratering to $3. In January 2014, bitcoin was trading above $1,000. The next year, one BTC was worth $239.      The trend is clear: Bitcoin will crash. Left unsaid was that in four years bitcoin went from being worth pennies to dollar parity to swinging between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars, with downward swings in between.      At the time, Millar cautioned against buying the dip. “You know it’s going to crash,” he said. It seems like he’s changed his tune.    See also: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know    “As an investor, you gotta ask yourself if an asset is worth its price. If you answer yes, then you gotta buy. And if the price then decreases from there for bad reasons, you need to double down if you want to respect your original analysis,” Millar told CoinDesk in a direct message.    It’s a show of solidarity.    Cryptocurrencies are novel – largely unproven – technological and monetary systems. Assets like BTC, ETH or DOGE buck the investment wisdom taught in prestigious business schools. They lack the cash flows or expected returns that historically have been used to value stocks or start-ups. Instead, crypto trades based on user demand and investor sentiment. All bitcoiners have is a codebase, community and a story to tell.      That goes a way toward explaining all of bitcoin’s death pronouncements over the years. The “greater fool” analysis of crypto, or the idea the price will continue to go up as long as new investors can be persuaded to buy in, must lead to a cataclysmic crash, critics say. Every dip could be that great unravelling, when the crowd suddenly gets wise.      Crowds are known as much for their wisdom as their madness. Buying the dip is just picking a side.    Where FOMO fits in.    On trading forums, the saying is, “The best time to buy bitcoin was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.” Trying to time markets is tricky and there is always a fear of missing out (FOMO). Bitcoiners have developed a trading strategy to mitigate both risks: Amass as much bitcoin as possible and never sell. A dip is just a reminder to buy.    Read more: Missed the Bitcoin Rally? Here’s a Low-Risk Strategy to Ride the Bull Market  It is an expression of a deeper belief.    Sometimes an investment is more than a simple allocation of capital, a calculated bet that something may be more valuable over time. Sometimes, an investment is emotionally or politically motivated.      The “smart money” that has moved into bitcoin this past year has often followed a galaxy-brained investment thesis. Paul Tudor-Jones, a hedge fund manager credited with sparking the institutional wave into bitcoin, said the cryptocurrency could become an inflation hedge. Another outsized fund manager, Stanley Druckenmiller, said bitcoin is on its way to becoming a global reserve currency. Meanwhile, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey has long said bitcoin will be the native currency of the internet.      If bitcoin succeeds in any of those roles it would be massive. But there is another motivation many hardcore bitcoiners are motivated to buy as much as they can: It is stealing power from the state.      I'll leave you with one thought, what happens when the dip keeps dipping?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/19/the-node-btfd-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31357a73f3b04c402daf9dbdac8cca349a2f79b6-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCYDh,1621441144,"OCC, Fed, FDIC Mulling Forming an Interagency Policy Team on Crypto","The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may set up an interagency policy team to examine the cryptocurrency sector.      Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu told a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., that he had spoken with fellow regulators Randal Quarles, vice chair at the Federal Reserve, and Jelena McWilliams, the chairwoman of the FDIC, about forming a ""sprint team"" around crypto. His response was to a question from Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.).      ""Prior to this meeting, Vice Chair Quarles, Chair McWilliams and I had talked about potentially putting together an interagency policy sprint team just on crypto because of exactly the concerns you've described,"" Hsu said.      Later in the hearing, in a response to a question from Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Quarles said this work could include creating a legal definition for what a cryptocurrency is in the U.S.      ""We are engaged with the other agencies in a joint effort to think through some of these crypto definition[s] and some of the applications in crypto areas, and I'm sure that would be part of it,"" Quarles said.      Emmer, who is the new ranking member on the House Financial Services Oversight Subcommittee, asked the agency representatives how they are addressing crypto.      Quarles pointed to the Boston branch of the Fed's work with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative in researching a central bank digital currency. McWilliams noted that the FDIC just published a Request for Information about how banks interact with digital assets.      Todd Harper, chair of the National Credit Union Administration, said his regulatory agency created an office to examine financial technology issues, which will include crypto.      ""I think the rise of crypto has garnered a lot of attention,"" Hsu said.      In prepared remarks published Tuesday, Hsu said the OCC was reviewing all of its pending matters, including the crypto-related guidance published over the past year.    Digital dollar    The question of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) also came up during the hearing, with Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) asking Fed Vice Chair Quarles about the central bank's work with MIT.      Green specifically asked how regulators could ensure cryptocurrencies aren't used for illicit purposes like ransomware payments.      ""It's a complicated question because there's a range of types of instruments that count as cryptocurrencies,"" Quarles said.      However, any financial institutions that interact with cryptocurrencies would have to comply with existing anti-money laundering regulations, he said.      A CBDC specifically could prevent ransomware payments, Quarles said, hinting that know-your customer (KYC) rules may play a role here. However, he also noted the Fed has not committed to launching a digital dollar just yet.      ""Whether we would have a central bank digital currency is way premature at this point,"" Quarles said.

42434408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCYZh,1621441118,Risk-Off: Sour Sentiment on Wall Street May Have Added to Bitcoin's Plunge,"Bitcoin's steepest price correction since March 2020 coincided with a growing sense of risk aversion on Wall Street, where investors are becoming concerned that rising inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy – a move that could undermine the bullish case for riskier assets.      Stocks, oil and industrial metals were nursing losses. Prices for gold, seen as a traditional safe-haven asset or inflation hedge, rose. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds slipped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.62%. Falling yields on the U.S. government bonds are often taken as a sign of risk aversion.      The declines in traditional markets were nowhere near the 12% slide in prices for bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether (ETH), the second-biggest, tumbled 19%.      But the dour sentiment hitting cryptocurrency markets might reflect the nagging concerns witnessed in traditional markets.      ""If anything, we would assign investor worry around rising inflation risk and the impact this is having on stocks as a more legitimate reason to reconcile weakness in crypto,"" Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, said in an email. ""Crypto is considered to be an emerging market and, as such, a risk correlated market vulnerable to downturns in global sentiment.""    'Digital gold?' Not right now    While the jury is still out on whether bitcoin is digital gold or a risk asset, the cryptocurrency's current price action suggests it's anything but a haven or store of value asset.      Bitcoin fell as low as $30,000 on Coinbase early today and was trading at time of writing near $37,000 at press time, representing a 13% drop on a 24-hour basis.      The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks was trading 1% lower. Oil was off 3% and copper was nursing a 3.3% loss. Gold was bid 1% higher at $1,880 per ounce.      Concerns that the Federal Reserve might have to scale back its efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy have grown as the distribution of coronavirus vaccines leads to business reopenings and a resumption in travel and potentially hiring. Investors say that an uptick in hiring, spending and activity could combine to push wages and consumer prices higher.      A Bank of America report published last month showed inflation worries spreading beyond crypto markets and bond markets to Wall Street. A week ago, the U.S. government reported its Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods, energy and housing, rose 4.2% in the 12 months through April, the most since 2008.      The renewed inflation scare has boded well for gold but not for bitcoin. Since early April the yellow metal has rallied by 12% while bitcoin has declined by more than 35%.      Bitcoin's ugly performance during a shift from low-inflation to high-inflation environment has weakened the popular narrative of the cryptocurrency being a superior store of value asset than gold.      ""We were always of the opinion that the biggest misconception out there is that BTC is a safe haven (or inflation hedge),"" QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel. ""The moves in the last few months validate this entirely.""      One possible explanation for bitcoin's poor performance could be the recent uptick in the odds of an early interest rate hike by the Fed. A rate hike dilutes the appeal of perceived inflation hedges.      However, gold has managed to stay bid despite rate hike bets, possibly because the dollar, the yellow metal's biggest nemesis, has taken a beating in recent weeks.      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, has dropped from 9.3.40 to 89.80 in the past six weeks, reversing the entire first-quarter gains.      Bitcoin largely moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index last year and in the first quarter. However, the recent weakness in the dollar index hasn't brought cheer to the cryptocurrency.

The investment strategy has been in development for months and is likely to be available to qualified investors around mid-June, Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told Business Insider on Wednesday.  “We think the cryptocurrency space has just kind of hit an evolution and maturation of its development that allows it now to be a viable investable asset,” Cronk said.  In December, John LaForge, head of real-asset strategy at Wells Fargo, said the bank is not recommending bitcoin to clients because it didn’t have the infrastructure to hold crypto in their accounts.  Cronk said that crypto is an evolving asset that requires deep due diligence. He labelled it an “alternative investment” rather than “strategic allocation.”  Wells Fargo is one of the U.S.’s largest financial services companies, with assets of almost $2 trillion.

Digital Renaissance Foundation and venture firms D1 and SevenX backed the Arweave-based startup, as did Arweave’s founding team.      The funding gives ArDrive some runway as the business of file storage experiences continues to shift. In China, a run on hard drives has triggered localized shortages and price spikes. Meanwhile, cloud companies such as Dropbox are reporting upticks in revenue and users.      The start-up now stores 570 gigabytes of data atop Arweave’s permanent database, said CEO Phil Mataras: “We just had 50 gigs uploaded two days ago. It's really exploded.”      Those storage numbers are puny against the industry’s top names. Dropbox, for example, offers consumers 2 terabytes of data for $20 a month.    Read more: 'Permanent Dropbox' App Launches on Arweave    Even so, Mataras believes ArDrive’s strategy – charge by the file, not by the month – gives the eight-person start-up a competitive advantage if “subscription fatigue” begins to take hold.      “People just don’t like having another $9.99 bill to pay,” he said, pointing toward “microtransactions” as a potential workaround.      In ArDrive’s case, that means charging one-time fees – less than a penny for a Word doc, two for a photo – to store users’ data for eternity.

42434405,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCYRh,1621429200,Nym Opens Up Staking in New 'Finney' Testnet to Counter Sybil Attacks,"Privacy-infrastructure company Nym Technologies announced details of opening up its “Finney” testnet (named after the famous cypherpunk Hal Finney) for anyone to run a node on – with a few qualifiers.      Nym is developing a ""mixnet,"" or a tool to obscure metadata tracking at a network level. The mixnet itself is hosted by a decentralized network of nodes. Nym said the system provides ""full-stack"" privacy, allowing developers to build applications that give users strong guarantees against metadata surveillance.    Read more: Privacy Startup Nym Will Pay You in Bitcoin to Run Its Mixnet    Nym’s initial testnet, launched in April 2020, was the victim of a Sybil attack. A Sybil attack is when a single actor tries to take over a network by spinning up multiple nodes that validate data and transactions on the network. If one actor has a disproportionate amount of control over the system, it compromises the system's underlying integrity because the nodes under the attacker's control could refuse to receive or transmit blocks on a blockchain. In November, a Sybil attack increased the initial testnet to more than 12,000 nodes overnight – about twice the size of the Tor network.      As a science fiction fan, Dave Hrycyszyn, chief technology officer of Nym, likens Sybil attacks to the Agent Smith move from the movie ""The Matrix,"" where beleaguered actor Keanu Reeves has to fight thousands of identical opponents who can multiply at will. How do you beat an attack like that?      “You need to impose some kind of cost on the attacker to slow down or stop unwanted replication of attackers in your system,” Hrycyszyn said.    Countering Sybil attacks by staking on Nym    In the case of the Finney testnet, that cost now comes in the form of a staking token, HAL, which is based on the Tendermint blockchain and Rust-based Cosmos implementation. A HAL doesn't hold value; its purpose is purely for staking on Nym. The transition to this new testnet on April 15 removed the Sybil nodes from the previous network and now allows anyone who can claim a unique Telegram name to spin up a ""mixnode.""      “In Nym's case, the transition to mixnode staking means that anyone can start a node,” Hrycyszyn said. “But this is limited by the amount of available cryptocurrency that node operators can get hold of. Currently, we're slowly giving out testnet tokens in our Telegram channel, so the growth of the mixnodes in the network is slowed down by the need to request tokens at a rate we control.”      On the eventual mainnet, tokens will need to be bought, imposing a stronger limit on attackers.      Nym initially set an artificial limit of 1,500 nodes on the Finney testne,t but has now removed that cap.      “We're seeing rapid growth,” Hrycyszyn said. “Currently, we're at about 4,500 nodes, which is about 3/4 the size of Tor, making us one of the largest privacy systems in the world.”    Read more: Tor Developers Pursuing ‘Anonymous Tokens’ to Stop Hacks and DoS Attacks    Hrycyszyn was candid in saying that by opening the network to everyone, the Finney testnet is getting some people who come only for rewards but don’t know a single Unix command or how to run a server. As a result, the nodes they are running are mostly misconfigured.      While fewer of the nodes are high quality, Hrycyszyn said he is happy the network's architecture held up, as the Sybil attack increased the level of active Nym nodes from 500 to 12,000. But the staking dynamics will weed out poorly run nodes over the next few weeks and drive quality up.      “We have not yet started rewards by actual packets mixed but rather by pure uptime/presence,” he said. “Later this week when we change the rewards, these lower quality nodes will be eliminated.”    What are mixnets?    When thinking about a mixnet, it’s helpful to understand how the internet works today.      On a normal internet network, most traffic can be tracked. Browsers like Tor offer a degree of protection against network surveillance by running traffic through a number of relays to obscure a user’s location and usage. Such networks are still susceptible to metadata observation, however. Highly capable adversaries like the National Security Agency in the U.S. are able to see the timing of data packages being sent across a network to get an idea of what’s going on, even if they can’t see the actual content of the packages.    Read more: Sentinel’s Decentralized VPN Protocol Launches on Cosmos Mainnet    A mix network, or “mixnet,” on the other hand, (taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes”) obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network.      Basically a mixnet acts like a game of Yahtzee, Hrycyszyn told CoinDesk previously, where the data packs are like dice: They get shaken around on the mixnet and come out in an entirely different manner than they went in.      Sam Hart, grant manager at the Interchain Foundation, the nonprofit behind Cosmos and a backer of Nym, said people think about virtual private networks and Tor as pretty different things, but Nym will allow users to have Tor-level privacy in any situation where they would use a VPN.      “Combining these two means the addressable user base is larger, and a larger anonymity set increases the overall privacy of the system,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/19/nym-opens-up-staking-in-new-finney-testnet-to-counter-sybil-attacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/421cffb672e2ac0705ee5751f77c35ac2d7f29fd-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report by Bison Trails, a unit of crypto exchange Coinbase, examines digital currency proof-of-concepts launched by more than 11 countries and cities, including Hong Kong, Thailand, China, Australia, Singapore and Japan. The report also looks at the role of private digital currencies such as Diem.      CBDCs are moving toward global implementation, and the infrastructure of a digital currency is critical for a successful rollout, according to the report.      Facebook-backed cryptocurrency Diem, formerly known as Libra, is motivating many central banks to develop CBDCs, the report noted. Most recently, Diem formed a partnership with Silvergate Bank with plans to test the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin later this year.      “Diem offers a whole new paradigm in economics: a diverse association of enterprise and social impact stakeholders developing digital currencies on a permissioned, open-source chain built with the most cutting edge tech – with a built-in global market and limited barriers for growth once live,” said the report titled “Infrastructure and Design of Central Bank Digital Currencies.”      According to the report, the development of Diem has been considered a “catalyst” for the Chinese government to accelerate its plans for its digital currency issued by the state bank People’s Bank of China.      China is close to launching the digital yuan and is testing the CBDC with commercial institutions and the public.      “The Chinese government remains intent on establishing itself as a central player in the emerging global digital currency market,” the Bison Trails report stated.      The U.S. Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach regarding the issuance of a CBDC with no firm commitment to date.

At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands at around $38,500, after dropping below $31,000 earlier Wednesday. The price was down 9.8% since 0:00 coordinated universal time (8 p.m. ET Tuesday). As recently as April, the price had hit an all-time high of close to $65,000.      The latest crash shook out bullish leverage from cryptocurrency derivatives markets, leading to more than $8 billion in position liquidations due to margin calls.      Just in May alone, the bitcoin price is down more than 30%.      This month's slide was exacerbated by recent tweets by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who terminated the electric-vehicle maker's acceptance of BTC as a form of payment because of his concerns about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining. But as reported by CoinDesk, indicators from price charts and blockchain data had been signaling a downturn recently.    See also: Bitcoin Crash vs. Correction: Do You Know the Difference?    The top cryptocurrency slipped earlier Wednesday to below its 200-day simple moving price average (SMA) of around $39,825, which had been seen as a key level of support. The average has come into play for the first time since April 29, 2020. Back then, the long-term technical line was located at about $7,977.      While bitcoin has shed 40% in the past 24 hours, other top 10 coins such as ether (ETH), internet computer token (ICP), binance token (BNB), cardano (ADA), XRP (XRP) have suffered even bigger losses, according to data source Messari. Bitcoin's 24-hour slide the biggest single-day percentage sell-off since the crash of March 12, 2020.      Amid the market-wide risk aversion, exchanges offering crypto futures have liquidated $8 billion worth of positions, according to data source bybt.com. Bitcoin futures account for almost 50% of the total market-wide liquidations.      Total liquidations seen in the past 24 hours, however, are still short of the record $10 billion worth of forced closures observed on April 17, when bitcoin fell sharply from $60,000. Since then, the market has mostly seen daily liquidations of less than $4 billion, barring today's brief spike.      The data shows the major part of the recent decline from $55,000 to below $40,000 is primarily driven by increased selling in the spot market. The number of bitcoin held on exchanges has risen by more than 65,000 BTC in the past seven days, according to data provided by Glassnode. Investors transfer coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings.      The first leg of the correction – the drop from $60,000 to $52,000 seen in mid-April – was mainly due to the record liquidations. Forced closure of longs added to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency, leading to an exaggerated price drop.    What's next for bitcoin    The correction could soon run out of steam as technical indicators show oversold conditions. Further, the order book is flashing signs of capitulation, the point at which traders trying to enter long positions begin throwing in the towel.      ""We are nearing capitulation to the downside,"" crypto research firm Jarvis Labs noted in a post on Medium early Wednesday, while drawing attention to the relatively low concentration of leveraged longs at deeper price levels on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume.      ""The pink bubbles buried underneath the price represent 25x leveraged longs. Red bubbles are 50x longs, which hardly exist, and yellowish-orange are 100x longs, which are virtually non-existent,"" the post on Medium said. ""Bubbles above the price line are showing not only a large amount of 25x shorts but also 50x and even 100x.""      Capitulation is widely considered the final stage of the price sell-off.      Analysts, however, stand divided on whether the market has bottomed out. Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk that the market needed a correction, and prices could consolidate at lows before moving higher.      ""Our desk is buying the dip,"" Heusser told CoinDesk.      Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, tweeted that he had bought $152.8 million worth of BTC at an average price of $36,686.      Stack Funds Chief Operating Officer and co-founder Matthew Dibb said the pullback to the 200-day SMA is nothing out of the ordinary, and noted that a further decline to $30,000 is possible.      Bitcoin has taken a beating over the past week, falling sharply from over $50,000 to 3.5-month lows under $40,000.      ""The BTC enthusiasm has been sucked out last week by the confluence of ""Elon's corporate ESG (environmental, social and governance) stamp of disapproval, the SEC's (U..S. Securities and Exchange Commission) public un-enthusiasm for any ETF (exchange-traded fund) & the CME backwardation,"" QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel. Backwardation is when the current price of an asset is higher than its futures price.      Musk attempted to calm market nerves late Sunday with a Twitter announcement stating that the company hasn't sold its bitcoin holdings.

BTC was trading around $39,000 at the time of writing and could see further declines towards the next level of support around $34,000. Price recoveries should remain limited at short-term resistance levels between $42,000 and $45,000.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart has been oversold for the past few days. However, an oversold reading of 25 is not as deep as the March 2020 reading around 14, which suggests selling pressure could persist over the short term.  The weekly RSI continues to recede from extreme overbought levels and is not yet oversold. This indicates further selling pressure towards lower support zones.

42434409,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCYbh,1621423800,Valid Points: What Eth 2.0 Validators Can Expect After the 'Altair' Upgrade,"As Ethereum developers prepare for their 11th backward-incompatible, system-wide upgrade, or “hard fork,” Ethereum 2.0 developers are getting ready to release their first one ever.      Named after the brightest star in the northern constellation of Aquila, the “Altair” upgrade is tentatively scheduled for activation this summer, either in July or August.      Around this time is also when Ethereum’s 11th hard fork, dubbed “London,” is expected for release. One of the goals will be to line up Altair and London for around the same time so that validators can upgrade their Ethereum and Eth 2.0 software in one go, rather than on two different occasions.      The London upgrade is expected to contain controversial code changes such as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, which dramatically alters Ethereum’s fee market. The Altair upgrade, on the other hand, will make minor revisions to the dynamics of Eth 2.0.    Pulse check: What can Eth 2.0 validators expect from Altair?  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    The Altair upgrade ups the ante on validator responsibilities.      Currently, fully inactive validators lose roughly 11.8% of their staked ether balance. After the upgrade, they’ll lose about 15.4%. In addition, validators who are slashed by the network for malicious behavior such as double-signing or double-proposing blocks will get fined 0.5 ETH after hard fork activation instead of 0.25 ETH.      The aim here is to bring network penalty values for validator inactivity and misbehavior closer to what was originally set out in the Eth 2.0 protocol. These values were intentionally reduced to encourage early user participation in the network at its most experimental and nascent phase.      Now that the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain has been running smoothly and successfully for more than six months, the Altair upgrade will ensure the network isn’t as forgiving of offenses by increasing the slashing and penalty parameters.      It’s not all bad news for validators, however.      The Altair upgrade also corrects a slight imbalance in the distribution of rewards. The vast majority of earnings for validators comes from votes and attestations of the correct block. Only 3% of overall rewards is earned from proposing the next block in the Eth 2.0 Beacon chain.      After Altair, block proposal rewards will jump up to about 12.5% of overall validator rewards so that the earnings for different validator responsibilities becomes more evenly split.    New frontiers: Warming up with Altair    Altair is considered a “warm-up upgrade” meant to prepare Eth 2.0 protocol developers for a much higher-stakes upgrade upcoming later this year or early next. This latter upgrade expected to follow Altair will permanently fuse the Ethereum blockchain with the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain and fully transition Ethereum to a PoS protocol.      Since our January write-up of what we expected in the Altair hard fork, the contents of the upgrade have changed somewhat.      While the upgrade still adds simplifications to the Eth 2.0 protocol, making it easier for users and developers of the network to track validator participation rates, rewards and penalties, it will not include code designed to enforce a specific development timeline for the network.    No ice age on Eth 2.0    On Ethereum, the development timeline for making the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol is enforced through the “difficulty bomb” feature. The difficulty bomb is code designed to kick in at a certain block number that makes the production of new blocks beyond that point exponentially more difficult to mine and slow to produce.      Since the merge of Ethereum and Eth 2.0 is expected to happen at the end of this year, the London hard fork will delay activation of the difficulty bomb and the “ice age” that follows until December.      There was debate among Eth 2.0 developers over whether a similar incentive should be baked into the Eth 2.0 protocol as an additional motivator for activating the merge in accordance with a set timeline.      Ultimately, they did not deem it necessary in light of other stronger motivators at play for Eth 2.0 development. One such factor is the nearly $16 billion worth of ether locked in the protocol as of May 18.    Gearing up for 'light client' functionality    Developers have also affirmed the creation of validator “sync committees” through the Altair upgrade. In January, they decided creating these sync committees was an important step toward building out new Eth 2.0 software clients that can run with low computation and data costs.      These new software clients, called “light clients,” are envisioned to run at a fraction of the cost that would typically be required of a Eth 2.0 validator. Light clients are aimed at empowering more users to independently verify the Eth 2.0 blockchain, potentially from inside their own web browser, as opposed to through a centralized third party such as Infura.      There have been two versions of the Altair upgrade released thus far for review and iteration by Eth 2.0 developers. The plan is to complete code specifications for the upgrade this Friday, May 21. They will then spend the month of June activating the code on various public test networks to ensure Altair is ready for a main network launch in July.      Speaking to the significance of the Altair upgrade overall, Eth 2.0 client developer Ben Edgington said in a Mapping out Eth 2.0 podcast:      “It’s time to take the training wheels off a little.

42434383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTzh,1621388361,BlockFi Botches Promo With Outsized Bitcoin Reward Payments,"Bitcoin and crypto lender BlockFi has been incorrectly depositing and then trying to reverse excessive amounts of bitcoin to users’ accounts, according to people who spoke to CoinDesk and others who posted their experiences on Reddit.      The issue is apparently connected to a March promotional giveaway, specifically the March Trading promotion, in which qualifying clients were eligible for a bitcoin reward bonus if they traded a certain volume in U.S. dollars during the promotional period that ran from March 18 to March 31. The bonuses were to be credited to people’s accounts by May 31.      On May 14, however, BlockFi tweeted that there was an issue and some participants might see an inaccurate bonus displayed on their transaction balances.      But not everyone seems to have gotten the message. The result is a plethora of emails threatening legal action have gone out to some users who say they withdrew their erroneous bitcoin rewards before they realized the situation. Other users who did not participate in the promotion say they have also seen their withdrawals suspended, though it is not clear if these issues are related.      In a statement sent to CoinDesk and also shared on Reddit, a BlockFi spokesperson said that on May 17 fewer than 100 clients were incorrectly credited with cryptocurrency associated with ""a promotional payout that did not belong to them.""      “Certain withdrawals were delayed and trading paused while BlockFi contacted clients to rectify the issue,” said the spokesperson. “At this time, withdrawals and trading on the platform have resumed. The situation did not affect any of BlockFi’s ongoing operations and measures have been taken to ensure that an error like this will not be possible in the future. Client funds are not impacted and are safeguarded.”    Read more: Crypto Lender BlockFi Raises $350M at a $3B Valuation  Reversing the excess bitcoin rewards    One user who reached out to CoinDesk said he received a large sum of BTC in his account which he thought was a reward for referring friends – so he sent it to his cold storage wallet.      BlockFi’s previous promotion was a friend referral promotion that offered (albeit small) BTC rewards.      The user said after looking at the transaction in more detail, he realized it was an error, so requested a cancellation of the withdrawal. The cancellation request was confirmed via email and the account shows the BTC transaction was reversed, with a note specifying the bonus transaction had been reversed. Nevertheless, the user said the bitcoin reward ended up in his cold storage wallet. He shared these documents with CoinDesk, and the blockchain shows the funds were indeed transferred to the person's wallet address.      The next day, he said he received a phone call and an email (which CoinDesk has reviewed) from BlockFi threatening legal action if the funds weren't returned, but also offering $1,000 worth of the stablecoin GUSD for any trouble caused.      Other users on Reddit posted images of BlockFi’s “generous” giveaway, with one deposit amounting to over 700 BTC. That transaction, according to the user, was reversed. Another said their friend received 5 BTC and was, in fact, able to move it off the platform.      Yet another user said he received both BTC and GUSD, only to have the BTC reversed.
