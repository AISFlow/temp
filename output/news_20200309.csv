42431600,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FJh,1583790970,You Call That Volatility? Bitcoin Traders Scoff at Wall Street's Gyrations,"It was just another Monday in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets, which stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.      Traders in the 11-year-old digital-asset industry described few changes in business activity or sentiment as coronavirus-related fears gripped Wall Street and sent stock markets reeling.      “We're not the ones uncomfortable with the volatility today,” said Ricky Li, co-founder and head of Americas at Altonomy, a cryptocurrency-focused proprietary trading firm.      Prices for bitcoin (BTC) slid by 2.9 percent to about $7,800 as of 16:48 UTC (12:48 p.m. Eastern Time) Monday. That decline was less than half the 7 percent plunge in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, a drop so fierce it tripped market “circuit breakers,” temporarily halting trading under exchange rules designed to help limit investor losses.      The latest sell-off in stocks left the S&P 500 down about 18 percent since its record high on Feb. 19. Since then, bitcoin has fallen by about the same percentage. Yet, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is still up about 8.6 percent, in contrast with a 7.7 percent loss so far in 2020 for the S&P 500.      Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (the ""VIX""), a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, is trading at its highest levels since the financial crisis. Sometimes called the ""Fear Index"" by traders, the VIX measures the S&P index's expected volatility in the coming weeks and usually rises when the market expects stocks to fall.      ""Few assets are safe when a 'black swan' event such as the coronavirus takes hold of the markets on a global scale,"" Connor Abendschein, a research analyst for Digital Assets Data, said in an e-mail. ""Bitcoin may find its footing and shine further down the road during this financial crisis.""      One clear takeaway Monday was that as traditional markets undergo a level of anxiety not seen since the 2008 recession, the cryptocurrency industry showed few existential signs of distress.      In fact, bitcoin’s “hash rate” — a gauge of the amount of computing power working to confirm data blocks on the underlying blockchain network — was holding steady at around 122 exhashes, or quintillion hashes, per second, according to Blockchain.com. That’s roughly double where it stood in mid-2019.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital-asset firm Bequant, said he was seeing interest in new loans from borrowers who have become more bullish on bitcoin following the recent price drop.      He spent a good portion of Sunday morning trading WhatsApp messages with one client who wanted a loan denominated in stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is linked to a government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar. The borrower wanted to use the loan to buy new computers for data processing on the network, known as bitcoin mining because the rewards are paid out in units of the cryptocurrency.      “We're not seeing any change in sentiment,” Vinokourov said. “There's no mining capitulation.”      TradeBlock, a digital-asset analysis firm based in New York, wrote Monday in a blog post that the average daily price swings in the S&P 500 recently surpassed those for bitcoin. According to the firm, that hasn’t happened since October 2018.      Steep gains and losses are nothing new to cryptocurrency traders; indeed, bitcoin naysayers from traditional finance have consistently mocked the notion that bitcoin could ever serve as a “safe haven,"" or reliable store of value similar to gold or U.S. Treasury bonds.       Bitcoin’s price jumped 13-fold over the course of 2017, only to tumble by 73 percent in 2018. Last year, it rose 94 percent, roughly triple the gains charted by the S&P 500.       Vladimir Cohen, an over-the-counter broker, said he knew of clients who had taken advantage of a price rally in bitcoin earlier this year “to get rid of such a volatile and unpredictable asset.”       Konstantin Plavnik, chief operating officer of the Moscow-based crypto derivatives exchange Xena, said bitcoin’s recent sell-off in synch with stocks might be a bullish sign — bitcoin is “becoming a more effective, full-fledged part of the global financial markets.”       “Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and during the crisis, investors switch to cash,"" Plavnik said.      Prices for gold, seen by many big investors as a traditional store of value in times of economic and market distress, are up about 10 percent this year — roughly on par with bitcoin’s 2020 gains.      U.S. government bonds, another asset category long considered a reliable safe haven, have also rallied, with yields on the 10-year note declining by 0.2 percentage point to a record low of 0.51 percent. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.      Yin Shao, co-founder of the trading firm Reciprocity in New York, said he didn’t see anything too notable in bitcoin’s price movement Monday — or any unusual business activity.      “The folks that we generally trade with are not terribly connected to or in tune with what's going on in traditional markets,” Shao said.      U.S. stocks tumbled even amid signs government authorities are moving quickly to provide economic support and fresh liquidity injections for ailing markets.      The U.S. central bank’s New York branch on Monday offered to pump more cash into distressed markets, increasing one overnight lending program for Wall Street dealers by 50 percent to $150 billion. Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have upped bets the Federal Reserve will soon make a steep cut in interest rates for the second time this month to support the economy.      Bloomberg News reported that Trump administration officials are drafting measures to blunt the economic impact, beyond the $7.8 billion emergency spending bill passed last week.      Bitcoin, launched in the wake of the 2008 crisis by coders as a new type of money theoretically free from government control, has no such safety net, which serves as a dampener on market volatility.      Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lender and vendor, said it’s typical for big crypto traders to borrow more bitcoin during times of heightened volatility — to place transactions designed to capture profits from price dislocations.      “When things move, there's more stuff for them to do,” Prince said. “I wouldn't say we're seeing anything particularly different from the way things usually work.”      Anna Baydakova contributed reporting for this article.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/09/you-call-that-volatility-bitcoin-traders-scoff-at-wall-streets-gyrations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/497a51c447729c3d0d1b1da1c145b823f6d0bb85-1245x1048.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431595,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4F5h,1583790786,What the Oil Market Says About Bitcoin's 'Safe Haven' Status,"Monday’s historic financial tumult reached beyond stocks, sinking commodities and even bitcoin markets.      “I don’t think any asset is safe right now – except cash, U.S. dollars,” said Ali Khedery, formerly Exxon’s senior Middle East adviser and now CEO of U.S.-based strategy firm Dragoman Ventures.      While bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped nearly 10 percent over the weekend, Saudi Arabia slashed its export oil prices when Russia refused to support an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effort to reduce oil production. Coronavirus quarantines mean fewer cars on the road, economic slowdown and less demand for oil, experts warn.      Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, described the current state as an “oversupplied” oil market where Saudi Arabia made a drastic move, harming everyone’s bottom line, in an effort to “to get Russia back to the negotiating table.”      Smith said it will be difficult for nations to reconfigure their supply chains to circumnavigate the oversaturated market. Although nations like Iran appear to be interested in using the bitcoin mining industry to turn cheap power into global assets, both Smith and Khedery agree there’s no serious interest in bitcoin as a market alternative any time soon.      “In times of crisis, all markets correlate,” Smith said, arguing the dip contradicts bitcoin’s “safe haven” narrative.      Plus, an anonymous bitcoin mining farm operator in Iran said many operations are stalled by regulatory setbacks such as penalty fees for subsidized electricity. Bitcoiners may be thrilled about the potential to turn surplus energy into bitcoin, but so far it doesn’t appear as though OPEC members are prioritizing mining infrastructure for that approach. The Iranian miner said the local industry doesn’t appear to have any connection to strategies for abating a broader market crisis, at least none civilians are aware of.      Yet, if the oil market continues to plummet, Khedery said, “It may cause Iran, Iraq and Venezuela to collapse.”      “Iran is in deep trouble,” Khedery added, speaking of the oil-exporting nation hampered by both sanctions and a coronavirus outbreak.      Regardless, bitcoin bulls remain unfazed. Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg tweeted bitcoin may become a safe haven asset in the future. Bitcoin-focused investor Tuur Demeester said he expects the broader market chaos to increase bitcoin’s dominance on exchanges.      “What you want in a period of crisis is options,” Demeester said. “You’ll be attracted to an asset that’s liquid. … There are some people who are being forced to sell [bitcoin]. But, overall we’re in a very healthy [bitcoin] market.”      Likewise, Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck/MVIS, said adopting a bitcoin strategy is in the best interest of any country heavily involved in energy markets.      “While for now the petrodollar system remains dominant and the U.S. dollar outperforms other currencies, sovereign nations are increasingly searching for alternatives,” Gurbacs said, adding the safe haven narrative hasn’t been disproven because “bitcoin is a relatively young asset and it’s not a full-fledged store of value yet.”      There were, indeed, rumors at the World Economic Forum in January that some nations are actively looking for alternative currencies to settle energy market trades. But such forum participants generally dismissed bitcoin as too nascent, and alternative fiat systems as a poor substitute for the dollar, at least so far.      “The Russians and Chinese have been trying for years. And failing, it seems,” Khedery said.      Regarding the proverbial petrodollar, he added nations “can’t displace [USD] until there is a viable alternative.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/09/what-the-oil-market-says-about-bitcoins-safe-haven-status,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61a9b87b58976ae334d067e6cdd51c4e0b85707d-1500x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431605,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FNh,1583788993,I Attended a Bitcoin Conference in VR and Still Got Sick,"Human frailty knows no bounds – even the virtual ones.      I attended a virtual reality meetup hosted by bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer on Sunday for the MIT Bitcoin Expo. Instead of jaunting up to Cambridge, Mass., for the afternoon, I donned virtual goggles in Southern California to enter the world of “non-deterministic bitcoin scripts” and other cypherpunk conversations.      And despite all the coronavirus-fueled excitement around virtual gatherings being a viable alternative to germ-swapping IRL events, I still got sick. Still, my foe was much more mundane: motion sickness.      “Kudos to all you brave souls who are still here in meatspace,” said Casa Chief Technology Officer Jameson Lopp as he opened his talk, addressing the sparse physical crowd at MIT.      Truthfully, it's pretty cool that you can roam a tech conference from the comfort (and safety) of your own home. To date, some 45 tech-related conferences have been canceled, postponed or moved to online platforms. That’s a lot for a distributed industry that has long relied on hackathons and meetups for forward progress.    Conference fever    Wertheimer’s VR experience ran on Mozilla Hubs. A fairly buggy platform compared to others such as VRChat – which hosted a four-hour VR “afterparty” for the MIT Expo.      My experience was, I’d say, closer to Harry Potter’s Azkaban prison than San Francisco’s (now-postponed) Bitcoin 2020.      Mozilla Hubs can run on two platforms: desktop or VR goggles. At first, I logged on to the desktop version I had become familiar with in the week prior for fun. Here’s a picture of me as a donut at the Parthenon:      It’s important to note Hubs’ current status as more of a proof-of-concept than full VR simulation, especially on desktop alone.      You can move about, talk to attendees and even teleport, but it still lags severely and crashes after about two-dozen people join the virtual room. The VR group I joined does not plan on using the platform again (although Mozilla is marketing the product to event organizers like SXSW).      “When Jameson joined we had some severe audio problems, he could hear only some of the people so it was a bit of a mess. Still lots of fun though,” Wertheimer told CoinDesk.      After lobbying my editor, I purchased an Oculus Go for the event, the cheapest headset you can get on Amazon. (At about $150 on Amazon Prime, it has never been cheaper to distance yourself from reality.)      Linking my Oculus with Hubs, I re-entered into the MIT Expo hall. Or rather, under it by about 60 feet:      No, being virtually buried alive is not quite as suffocating as dwelling in the dirt, but it wasn’t enjoyable either.      I felt quite trapped beneath the virtual tent and its 30-some avatar guests. More still, I was incapable of moving. My controller worked whenever I exited the Expo to pick a new avatar character, but was worthless inside the event itself. I was left spinning around my apartment looking for some virtual buttons to click. This, in turn, was greeted by lagging images of a mountain backdrop and distant echoes of a conversation about bitcoin scripting language.      Health experts caution that COVID-19 is asymptomatic until an acute turning point, wherein hospitalization is generally required. My experience with VR bears similar warning.      Unexpectedly, nausea set in some 30 minutes into the Expo. Nonetheless, I was determined to carry on.      My resolve did not last.      Perhaps the digital world is more weighty than the physical. I abandoned the VR world for the comforts of meatspace after multiple (failed) attempts at moving toward the tent entrance.    Bitcoin and the VR moment    Like bitcoin, VR isn’t ready for the big stage quite yet. It may never be.      The limitations of VR are still quite tangible. Clunky and expensive hardware is met with underdeveloped software infamous for making users disoriented and seasick. For one, I’m glad vomit doesn’t transfer to the digital realm.      Most VR applications such as VRChat cannot handle more than a few hundred attendees without crashing. Mozilla Hubs can only run about 30 people before sending applicants into the digital abyss. There’s also that little voice in the back of your head wondering if what you are doing is entirely normal.      “Not all VR experiences are equal. In particular, the platform we used on Sunday appeared to have performance issues once we maxed out the number of people who were allowed to join the virtual space,” Lopp told CoinDesk via email. “In general, though, some platforms enable interesting functions that you wouldn't be able to do in real life.”      Silver linings certainly exist in the VR clouds. Wertheimer said participants felt more comfortable addressing conference speakers in one-on-one conversation. Privacy-minded attendees, who often do not attend real conferences, happily showed up under pseudonyms.      “Having the person next to you nodding, explaining things with their hands, looking at what you’re describing. It sounds simple but it makes the interaction feel a lot more ‘human’ than most online interactions,” Wertheimer told CoinDesk.      Like bitcoin, expect VR innovations to grow in stature as the list of nixed conferences continues to lengthen. Regardless of its defects, VR remains an attractive way to make the tent bigger for crypto.      Clearly, nausea beats the flu any day of the week.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/09/i-attended-a-bitcoin-conference-in-vr-and-still-got-sick,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ca9d84e0eb6b61540aaba0e0ca4c20a4efcda1b-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431598,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FDh,1583783356,"Pitch Deck Says Solana Is Courting Dish Network, Kik for Its 'Web-Scale' Blockchain","DISH Network, a major U.S. television services provider, and Kin, the payments platform built by Kik, are reportedly looking to tap up-and-coming Solana as the basis for their blockchain networks.      According to a Solana pitch deck seen by CoinDesk, which indicates the company is looking to raise at least $2 million and potentially up to $12 million, software engineers at DISH could use Solana's protocol as the basis for a tokenized 5G network that could be used to hire space on-chain for web-connected devices.      DISH is reportedly nearing the final stages of a proof-of-concept demo that uses Solana. The television provider did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      There are multiple versions of Solana's pitch deck. Some say Solana is looking to raise $10 million in a strategic round, but others indicate it is only seeking $2 million in a sale of native tokens to retail investors later this month. The tokens are not currently publicly tradable. Solana is targeting a $125 million valuation with the raise.      Founded by former Qualcomm developers in 2017, Solana claims to provide a scalable layer-1 protocol with a throughput rate hitting 50,000 TPS in tests. That's a little below the 60,000 TPS that Visa handles, according to the card payment processor's 2019 annual report.      It isn't just DISH that is reportedly interested in moving to Solana. Kin, the social media and payments network, might also move to Solana's blockchain network, a little over two years after first moving to Stellar.      According to the pitch deck, Kin – which reportedly processes over $1 million transactions per day – has apparently ""outscaled"" Stellar and believes Solana is ""the only solution"" that will allow it to continue scaling in line with its growing user base.      When mobile messenger app Kik – which is currently embroiled in an extended legal tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – hosted its $100 million Kin token sale in 2017, the project said its social media and payments platform would be based on Ethereum. But that December, Kik Chief Executive Ted Livingston announced Kin was moving to Stellar, citing Ethereum's scaling limitations.      “Stellar was built by the guys at Ripple and the thing we like about it is it’s custom-built for an application like Kin. It’s not like Ethereum where it’s trying to be everything to everybody, and that makes it general purpose and slow,"" Livingston said at the time.      Tanner Philp, Kik's technical adviser to the CEO, told CoinDesk that migrating to a highly scalable network would enhance Kin's performance in line with increasing token network usage.      ""Solana is one option we thought could be interesting for Kin so we have been doing some initial evaluations, but right now we have nothing to announce,"" he said.      Solana's pitch deck claims Kin could move over to the new protocol as early as this month. Philp did not respond to CoinDesk's request for clarification on this point.      In July 2019, Solana raised a $20 million Series A funding round, led by Multicoin Capital, with NEO Global Capital (NGC), Distributed Global and BlockTower Capital participating. The mainnet is scheduled for launch sometime in 2020.

42431591,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4F3h,1583778049,Old Rivals Oracle and IBM Want Their Blockchains to Talk to Each Other,"Rival IT giants IBM and Oracle are working to make their blockchains communicate with each other.      The groundbreaking interoperability work is happening on blockchains built using Fabric, Oracle developers said at last week's Hyperledger Global Forum in Phoenix, Ariz.      Mark Rakhmilevich, Oracle’s senior director of blockchain product management, said the Fabric interoperability initiative began just before the first Hyperledger Global Forum in Basel, Switzerland, at the end of 2018.      “We have done full testing with IBM and SAP. The three of us have basically done cross-network testing on Fabric,” Rakhmilevich said in an interview. “So if somebody comes and says they want to run a network on Oracle but have some members whose preference is to be on IBM, we can show them the process which is tested and certified.”      To some extent, this is about making blockchain nodes run on both IBM and Oracle’s clouds. But it also opens the door to connecting the consortia of firms clustered on the two platforms.      The technical aspects include ironing out the exchange of information across networks in a format the other side can digest. “The long-term goal should be to create a simple user interface that you can click into and set up. But for now we tested manually going through and connecting,” said Rakhmilevich.    The shipping example    Enterprise blockchain is a team sport, as is often heard among the distributed ledger technology (DLT) set. However, groups of companies are often aligned with particular platforms even when, in some cases, they are addressing the same use case (shipping container tracking, for instance) and using the same underlying open-source blockchain (such as Fabric).      A good example is Oracle Blockchain and CargoSmart’s Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) consortium, which includes shipping carriers like CMA CGM, COSCO Shipping Lines and Hapag-Lloyd, and uses Fabric.      Meanwhile, IBM and Maersk launched TradeLens in 2018, which also counts CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd as members as well as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Ocean Network Express, and runs on the Fabric-based IBM Blockchain Platform.      Both consortia also include a range of shipping ports around the world, as well as freight forwarding companies and the like, meaning any step towards harmonizing these projects has potentially enormous value to the participating industry players.      Building consortia is a tough job and it’s not surprising tech vendors want to guard the big names on their platforms. To make the process more agile, Rakhmilevich recommends starting with “code first,” while the heavy lifting of establishing a formal consortium can be done in parallel.      “Creating the consortium framework is going to take a lot of time, so let's go and start building this while the lawyers are talking, something people can run without having this formal consortium,” he said.      The blockchain teams at IBM, Oracle and SAP, who all know each other, are perhaps more sanguine about creating a harmony between firms participating on different deployments of Fabric. The decision-makers on the business side might see things differently.      “Large IT firms have this history of competition, but it makes sense at technical levels to cooperate, whether it's formal standards or informal things,” said Rakhmilevich. “Particularly when talking about blockchain, which is an ecosystem play, that's going to involve multiple parties, so you have to make sure that you can support it across multiple clouds and multiple vendors. You still compete in the field, we will do that every day.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/09/old-rivals-oracle-and-ibm-want-their-blockchains-to-talk-to-each-other,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c782845c4ea980d52063ed8febccf703c77a56d5-1500x936.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431604,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FTh,1583777563,Bitcoin's Plunge Was Foreshadowed by Miner Inventory Data,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price drop has caught many investors off guard. However, a key metric showing worry among the network’s miners gave a warning several weeks ago.       The miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, created by crypto markets data company ByteTree to measure the changes in inventory levels held by these key market participants, remained below 100 percent in January, suggesting a lack of confidence in the 30 percent price rally that month.       An MRI above 100 means miners are selling more than they mine and running down inventory, while a below-100 MRI indicates hoarding – miners selling less than they mine and amassing inventory.       Conventional wisdom says that a seller always sells high. Thus, some investors may take a sub-100 MRI reading as a sign miners are anticipating a price rally and are therefore hoarding with an aim to liquidate at a high price at a later time.       Miners, however, operate on cash, notes Atlantic House fund manager and ByteTree founder Charlie Morris, and are always sellers in the market liquidating rewards (bitcoins) received for mining blocks to cover their operational costs.       A below-100 MRI level is not necessarily a price-bullish indicator, but represents fear among miners the market is too soft to sell into. On the other hand, an MRI above 100 reflects a strong market able to absorb miners’ selling pressure.       January’s MRI of 79 percent, the weakest in over two years, was essentially a warning sign that a bull trap was in the works. Bitcoin topped out near $10,500 in mid-February and has been falling ever since.       At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at two-month lows under $7,800 and is just $640 away from turning negative on a year-to-date basis.      Miners generated 53,955 bitcoins and sent 42,451 bitcoins to exchanges in January, yielding an MRI of 79 percent, according to data from blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis.       Historically, returns are poor when miners sell less than they mine, while returns have been strong when miners have sold more than they mined, according to Morris.       To put it another way, miners tend to build inventory during bear markets and run down inventory during bull markets.          Drawing parallels with central banks    While it may seem counterintuitive to read hoarding as a bearish signal, an analogy from the traditional financial system is instructive.       Central banks in countries running account deficits depend on hot money inflows to build foreign exchange (usually, U.S. dollar) reserves. For example, the Reserve Bank of India will buy dollars in the spot market when the Indian rupee is trending higher and is able to absorb the RBI’s bid for U.S. dollars.       Buying dollars during a downtrend in the rupee would be risky since that would only add to bearish pressures around the local currency.       Similarly, miners hoard or avoid selling when they feel the market lacks strength to absorb their offers. Selling into a weak market would lead to deeper price drop and, in turn, hurt profitability.     Miners influence the market    More than any other constituency in the market, miners have the biggest influence on price. Mining pools account for the highest percentage of total bitcoin flowing into exchanges, for example.       As of January, over a quarter of all BTC received by exchanges came from mining pools. Meanwhile, hosted wallets and merchant services – payment gateways or processors – accounted for just over 10 percent of the total BTC supply to exchanges.       Miners therefore have to be extra careful while offloading their holdings as their actions can translate into a big sell-offs.       Such was the case when weak miners, facing losses courtesy of bitcoin’s slide from $14,000 to $8,000 in the third quarter of 2019, began dumping their holdings in the fourth quarter, as noted by Adaptive Capital analyst Willy Woo. That precipitated a bigger drop to $6,500 by mid-December.       As it stands, widely used mining computers such as the AntMiner S9 and Avalon 851 are already struggling to generate daily profits, according to data from the mining pool Poolin. If the price slide continues, the small and inefficient miners may shut down operations and sell their holdings to mitigate losses.     A view from the trenches    However, some miners are still optimistic about future bitcoin prices and remain unfazed as they look to the anticipated halving event in May.       “In the medium and long term, we have a very positive view on the price,” Xiao Yang, chief executive at Chinese crypto mining and miner firm PandaMiner said in an interview. “Despite short-term volatility, we expect to see market demand at a relatively high level while it is getting harder to mine bitcoins from the supply side.”       As bitcoin prices see a sharp drop, some miners would consider turning to lending platforms to collateralize their bitcoins in exchange for cash. That would help to sustain their cash flow, which has been strained by recent low market price, according to Yang. This move is meant to help miners not be forced to sell their bitcoins at a low price when running out of cash.       Besides lower prices, the fast-growing hash rate has made it even harder for miners to hold their bitcoins; they need to borrow more from lending agencies, Yang added.       According to btc.com, the bitcoin mining difficulty growth rate is now at 6.88 percent, up from negative 0.38 percent on February 25.       Yang said another phenomena showing the mining industry is generally confident about future bitcoin prices are the new mining computers marketed by the likes of Bitmain and Canaan Creative. Bitmain has unveiled its latest product, the S19, on March 10, while Whatsminer will launch its new product in April.       Miners consider the drop in bitcoin prices, correlated to the U.S. stock market sell-off, as a temporary change in the market, according to Yang.       “We are still focused on long-term price increase and not too concerned about short-term market moves,” Yang said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, David Pan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/09/bitcoins-plunge-was-foreshadowed-by-miner-inventory-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09c7af12c3ed9c083ddc433486f71cdad7b77bfd-2560x1416.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431607,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FRh,1583776341,Market Liquidations Cause Cascade in Bitcoin Price,"The price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply over the past 24 hours, down 5 percent as of 16:00 UTC. Although the leading cryptocurrency crossed above a bullish $9,000 threshold as recently as last week, a confluence of events has led traders to hit the sell button.       Coronavirus fears continue to weigh down traditional markets Monday, with the Dow industrials down 7 percent and the S&P 500 index down more than 5 percent.      In crypto markets, the selling of 13,000 BTC by China-based PlusToken is fueling speculation operators of the alleged Ponzi scheme are attempting to liquidate large holdings, pushing prices lower.      “Everything is getting pummeled and even traditional safe havens like gold are barely up today,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for digital asset management firm Koine. ""There is only one asset class that people are piling into: U.S. Treasuries.”      The moves may be more about large holders conducting business as usual than worries about larger issues, according to one market participant.      “This isn't Covid- or PlusToken-related. Just mini-whales taking orders from large institutions to liquidate longs at $9,000 and $10,000. This has been done in this range for months,” said James Hapak, a Toronto-based digital asset manager and over-the-counter market trader.      A ""whale"" refers to individuals or entities holding large amounts of digital assets.      Indeed, BitMEX longs were liquidated to the tune of $190 million yesterday, particularly around 15:00 UTC, an event that coincided with large amounts of volume on Coinbase, with over 6,300 trades over a two-hour period.      ""There are many who say crypto is falling because of PlusToken or due to the coronavirus scare. To some extent they are right, but what people should understand about crypto is that the market seems tightly controlled by groups with large amounts of capital,” said Jack Tan, co-founder of Taipei-based algorithmic trading firm Kronos Research.      “This, combined with a thin market, makes conditions ripe for manipulation of prices in large ranges while these groups profit,” Tan added.      Despite the recent sell-off, bitcoin is still up 7 percent year to date while the S&P 500 is in the red 12 percent for 2020.      Cryptocurrency stakeholders are expecting more pain in the short term. But overall, many traders remain bullish.      “Longer term, the market will be more driven by fundamentals, and our view is increasingly bullish for the asset class. Therefore, we have continued to buy on key support levels, most recently taking longs here around $7,686 for bitcoin and $194 for ether (ETH),” said Tan.      Other cryptocurrency markets are red across the board. Notable losses include Lisk (LSK) down 10 percent, Dash (DASH) losing 8 percent and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also in the red 7 percent.",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/09/market-liquidations-cause-cascade-in-bitcoin-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/829666d3b51068b164f8a098c8311c25cf1778fb-1263x731.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Hong Kong-based First Digital Trust (FDT) announced Monday it had received a $3 million investment from Taiwanese venture studio firm Nogle. The funding will support FDT's offering, including the Rapid Settlement and Clearing Network (RSCN), an institutional-orientated trading platform for the Asia region to launch in May.      ""A lot of the funding will be deployed to building out the First Digital Trust tech stack,"" First Digital Chief Operating Officer Gunnar Jaerv said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""We are also deploying capital into compliance building for financial services that, not only meet our global clientele requirements but also worldwide regulatory standards.""      FDT started out as the digital asset subsidiary for Legacy Trust, a major Asian trust and custody company, but was spun out in September 2018.      When it unveiled plans for the RSCN in February, FDT said its settlement layer would provide an alternative regional solution to the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which forces crypto firms to make settlements under tough U.S. regulations by virtue of Silvergate Bank's stateside location. RSCN would also support local currencies alongside the U.S. dollar, according to Jaerv.      Established in 2014, Nogle has supported projects it believes will help develop the future digital payment landscape. Its portfolio includes payment gateways, digital ID providers and a proprietary cryptocurrency exchange, BTSE.      Nogle founder Jonathan Leong told CoinDesk the company saw the value in First Digital as both a custodian solution and institutional settlement layer. Beyond just funding, Leong said Nogle will assist in tech development and third-party collaborations.      ""Based on their current platform, we're looking to build up their settlement layer and put up more formal partnerships,"" Leong said. ""Basically to have more businesses plug into the settlement layer.""

42431601,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FHh,1583763213,"Bitcoin, Bonds and Gold: Why Markets Are Upended in a Time of Fear","Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.      The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.      Anyone seen the movie “Parasite”? You know, the one about class mobility, creative solutions and scary basements.      I thought of that film after reading Jill Carlson’s op-ed a couple of days ago – she looks at our collective surprise that bitcoin is not a safe haven, and in a gentle way asks “well what did you expect?” She highlights that bitcoin (BTC) is too young to be considered a safe haven because its narrative is not yet formed. That doesn’t mean it won’t eventually get there, though.      What does this have to do with a South Korean Oscar winner? Well, in “Parasite” we spend the first hour thinking the film is about one thing but it turns out it’s not, it’s about something totally different.      The same thing is happening in cryptoland. Jill’s right: Bitcoin’s narrative is the key driver of its price trends, and it will change over time. The story isn’t about what bitcoin “is” but about what it “will be.”      An even more interesting narrative shift, however, is unfolding elsewhere.      I’m talking about the rest of the market. Almost all of it, in fact. Narratives are shifting all over the place.      For instance, everyone knows you should have bonds in your portfolio because they offer income and stability. I mean, there’s no way rates could go negative, right?      This week the yield on 30-year and 10-year U.S. government debt dropped to their lowest levels ever. The S&P 500 now yields more than Treasurys, calling into question the entire concept of “risk distribution.”      Even gold is behaving strangely. We hold it up as the ultimate example of a “safe haven” investment, and yet market structure shifts are calling that into question. Last week the gold price dropped almost 5 percent in one day, the largest daily fall in seven years, due to deleveraging pressure from derivative positions. And we tend to forget that gold fell almost 30 percent at the height of the 2008 market rout.      Gold’s role as a safe haven is entirely based on narratives: that shiny and yellow are desirable qualities (surely that’s subjective?), that supply is limited (we don’t know that for sure) and that heavy is good (you’ll have heard the derogatory expression “such a lightweight!”). These days, heavy – as in very difficult to pick up and take with you – is perhaps not the indicator of utility it once was.      Even though we can all agree gold’s metallic properties are impressive, its position as the world’s safe haven is no longer universally unassailable, and through no fault of its own. The narratives around it are changing, and the resumption of the gold price rally at the beginning of the week seems less based on conviction the metal will hold its value in times of trouble and more of a desperate realization there’s nothing out there that can yet take its place.      Now, why so many narrative shifts all of a sudden? Actually, narratives are always changing – but the pace of change is usually much slower than what we are witnessing today.      What we are witnessing is a breakdown of assumptions, in a time of fear. We’re worried about the economy, the banking system, the climate, living conditions, politics, education and the automatization of jobs. Add to that a growing feeling of vulnerability and concern about health and contagion.      In times of fear, we fall back on what we know, what we can be sure of. These days, that’s not much.      In his poignant 1944 paper called “The Social Psychology of Fear,” philosopher Kurt Riezler pointed out that “If we do not know the nature of a danger, we make an assumption. Without such an assumption, we cannot act.”      But what are assumptions if not conclusions based on narratives? We assumed interest rates would never go negative. We assumed house prices would never go down. We assumed profits were a good thing, and social media would liberate us.      So now, confronted by many dangers we are still struggling to understand, we are reaching for assumptions we no longer trust.      Bitcoin’s narrative is changing, as is to be expected for such a young and complex innovation. But so are the narratives that guide just about every other aspect of investing.      A few years from now, when the new narratives have settled into some semblance of normality, we’ll look back on this time and realize that the bigger story was in front of us all along.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/09/bitcoin-bonds-and-gold-why-markets-are-upended-in-a-time-of-fear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/248875d33ee17f9da094e4687abb8dc3f853c7e0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The People's Bank of China (PBoC) is to receive 32.35 million yuan (around $4.7 million) in ""special funding"" from the government over a three-year period for research and development into the trade initiative, officials confirmed to local media.      Known officially as the Bay Area Trade Finance Blockchain Platform, banks and businesses store order, logistics and transaction data on the system to create new transaction efficiencies. It's also said to provide regulators with greater oversight and gives small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to more sophisticated financing tools.      Led by PBoC's Digital Currency Research Lab, the trade finance platform is available to businesses based in Shenzhen, a mainland city neighboring Hong Kong. Major commercial banks, including Bank of China, Ping An and Standard Chartered, were invited to trial the platform when it entered the public testing phase in September 2018.      In January, Xinhua reported the platform was used by a network of 38 banks with total combined volumes exceeding 90 billion yuan ($13 billion). The new funding from Beijing is expected to help PBoC drive adoption for its trade finance platform among businesses.

42431606,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FPh,1583754922,Bitcoin's Sharp Price Drop May Have Been Prompted by $120M Scam Sell-off,"Bitcoin has plunged to two-month lows since Sunday, possibly due to an over-$100 million liquidation by PlusToken scammers, analysts say.      The top cryptocurrency fell by nearly 10 percent from $8,900 to $8,000 on Sunday to register its single-biggest daily decline since September 2019, according to Bitstamp data. Then on Monday, bitcoin (BTC) slipped further to two-month lows below $7,700 during the Asian trading hours.      At press time, the cryptocurrency’s global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, has recovered somewhat to $7,925.      While the sudden price drop has taken place alongside a bloody day in the traditional markets, there may be another factor driving down bitcoin's value so severely.      “The sudden drop in prices seems to arise out of the selling of BTC by PlusToken,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co told CoinDesk.      On Saturday, scammers in control of the remaining wallets of the China-based Ponzi scheme moved 13,000 BTC (worth around $101 million currently, but close to $120 million at the time) to so-called “mixers” and may have offloaded their holdings, causing prices to fall sharply, according to Singhal. Mixers are used to obfuscate the source of a crypto transaction by outputting batches with different coins than are sent in.      PlusToken had posed as a cryptocurrency wallet and swindled investors out of possibly as much as $2 billion in cryptocurrency by promising rewards. While six of its masterminds were arrested in June 2019, the authorities could not seize 180,000 BTC, 6,400,000 ether (ETH) and 111,000 tether (USDT), which were sent from scam victims to PlusToken wallets, according to Chainalysis.      Trader Kevin Svenson has also associated the latest price drop with PlusToken holdings being dumped into the market.      People in control of the PlusToken wallets have been liquidating their stolen bitcoins since August and likely played a big role in pushing bitcoin down from $12,000 to $6,500 in the four months to November. as noted by Ergo Research at the time.      Back in December, the scammers still controlled 20,000 bitcoins, of which, 13,000 look to have been moved for liquidation over the weekend.      The onchain activity on Saturday was again noted by Ergo Research:    Macros or scam?    Some, of course, may argue that moving coins to mixers does not necessarily result in liquidation and the sell-off seen from Sunday was caused by the coronavirus-led crash in the global financial markets.      Indeed, negative global macro factors – such as the equity market sell-off and record low in the U.S. government bond yield – may have also played a role in pushing bitcoin lower, as noted by popular analyst Jacob Canfield.      Still, a major PlusToken liquidation could well have weighed heavy over bitcoin’s price if it did occur. The cryptocurrency was trading steadily above $9,000 on Saturday as the scammed coins were being moved to mixers and fell sharply the following day. Further, traditional markets were closed over the weekend.      Canfield too listed a PlusToken dump as one of the factors possibly responsible for bitcoin’s price drop.    Chart view    So how did bitcoin's price drop look from a technical perspective?      “Bitcoin needed higher prices on the 4-hour chart to get itself into a neutral stance between $9,200-$9,600,” popular Twitter analyst Mr. Anderson told CoinDesk.      “Once that battle was lost it left the 12-hour chart in an ugly position as well and things snowballed quickly,” Anderson said.    Daily chart    In the aftermath, the head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern, seen on the daily chart suggests the rally from December lows near $6,400 has ended and the bears have regained control.      The bias will remain bearish as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of the neckline, currently placed at $8,450.      A bullish reversal now requires a convincing UTC close above the March 7 high of $9,213. That would invalidate the lower-highs setup.

As part of a $39.7 million investment in FAT Brands, the owner of ""fast casual"" eatery chain Fatburger, DBRS Morningstar has for the first time rated securities issued on a blockchain. Ethereum, to be precise.      As reported by Forbes on Sunday, the Toronto-headquartered ratings firm – which says it rates investment assets from over 2,600 issuers worldwide – actually rated a traditional debt security backed by franchise royalties and upfront fees coming in via Fat Brands companies, which also include Buffalo’s and Ponderosa Steakhouse.      However, the security was structured to include several Ethereum tokens in the investment process. With help from New York-based structuring consultant Cadence, ERC-20 tokens digitally representing the debt security were issued Friday to all investors' wallets, with transactions logged on the Ethereum blockchain. Quarterly payments will follow in the same way, according to Forbes.      Morningstar reportedly said in its rating that using Ethereum would speed up access to data on the securities, as well as boost transparency.      For the blockchain side of the investment process, $40 million in $CDG, a stablecoin linked to the U.S. dollar, was held by the trustee, UMB Bank, while FAT Brands held other tokens representing two tranches of the debt security.      A smart contract completed the settlement of the trade, passing security tokens to the investors and $CDGs to FAT in transactions visible on blockchain explorers.      “It's definitely the first rated securitization with a digital asset element, and we're using it the way it was intended: to provide that level of transparency,"" Nelson Chu, founder and CEO of Cadence, told Forbes.

42431596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4F7h,1583746815,tZero-Affiliated Firm Hopes SEC Will Pass Updated Proposal for Security Token Platform,"Boston Options Exchange (BOX) is trying again to calm regulatory concerns about Ethereum's role in storing ownership records as it seeks permission to launch a security token platform.      To that end, the firm has filed an amended proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), dated Feb. 28, which was published in the Federal Register on Friday. That opens the proposal up to feedback from interested members of the public.      BOX wants the SEC to sign off on its new subsidiary, the Boston Security Token Exchange (BSTX), a trading platform for tokenized equity that will also store ownership data on the Ethereum blockchain.      The amended filing, with notable tweaks from the version submitted by BOX in December, increases the number of market makers required for an initial listing from two to three, and makes listing standards closer to those set by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).      The exchange also took pains to stress once more that BSTX records held on Ethereum would only be ""ancillary records that would not create or convey any ownership of security tokens or shareholder equity."" In other words, Ethereum won't be used as a substitute for conventional ownership records anytime soon.      BSTX is a joint venture announced by BOX and tZero, the company that hosted one of the first proper security token offerings (STOs) back in 2018. BOX filed its first version of a ""rulebook for the first regulated security token exchange"" in May 2019, which the SEC published for public consultation in October the same year.      Judging by the summing-up section, BOX looks to be trying to allay any possible concerns from the SEC so it can make the ""important first step"" in integrating blockchain into the U.S. financial system. Success might mean that other entities, including traditional finance institutions, could also begin experimenting with the technology, the filing suggests.      A BOX spokesperson said the firm was not able to comment at this stage of the process.      Although blockchain technology enables round-the-clock permissionless trading, BOX has also reiterated that, in keeping with U.S. financial regulation, BSTX would only be open during U.S. market hours and users would need to be approved first before they can begin trading on the exchange.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/09/tzero-affiliated-firm-hopes-sec-will-pass-updated-proposal-for-security-token-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf9d9e12fc723a5ce0ac769204c37c1d6d6da2c5-1500x952.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4FBh,1583738842,The Gig Economy Is Unfair. Here's How Token Models Can Help,"Gys Hough is managing partner at Coinstone Capital, an Amsterdam-based digital asset investment fund focused on tokenization. Gys is also a partner at Digital Asset Consulting (DIAC), a consulting firm specialized in asset tokenization.      Imagine a web-based taxi company where the drivers are the co-owners, a company that automatically distributes its increasing profits to its drivers. Or imagine a delivery platform that pays its couriers higher wages as it gets more popular.      Unfortunately, the driving forces behind the growing gig economy, companies such as Uber and DoorDash, do exactly the opposite.      The growth of the gig economy is a huge concern for governments and policymakers worldwide. Technological innovation is a crucial part of every modern economy, but the companies that have created the gig economy consistently exploit the rights of their workers and users. The examples are numerous: Uber drivers having to work 60 hours a week to earn the minimum wage, startups not contributing to retirement. The list goes on.    Blockchain-based co-ops can help governments create an economy of inclusion, and re-write the social contract for the 21st century.    There is a solution to this problem and it does not lie in stricter regulation. Traditional regulatory approaches for old-fashioned companies don’t work well for borderless digital platforms. It lies in creating a regulatory framework for a viable alternative: digital cooperatives. Co-ops are usually associated with agriculture or banks, but the digital platforms of the internet economy – social networks, takeaway delivery, holiday rentals and taxi platforms – actually are the embodiment of cooperative work. The cooperative efforts of the contributors and customers of these platforms create the real value – the platforms themselves only coordinate the efforts.      The technology that would enable the creation of digital cooperatives is blockchain. Bitcoin (BTC), the digital currency, has become the most prominent example of blockchain technology. But there are many more uses for it. The keyword is tokenization. Tokenization is the creation of a new digital currency – or tokens – that serves as the exclusive payment mechanism for these digital cooperatives.      Let’s take the example of Uber. This web platform has been establishing footholds in many countries by initially subsidizing taxi rides. These cheap rides create demand from passengers, which leads to drivers joining. But as more drivers join, competition increases. Uber can then force its drivers to accept less pay and increase its margins. The beneficiaries of this race to the bottom are Uber’s investors and shareholders.      If Uber, or a company like it, was a tokenized digital cooperative then the dynamics would change dramatically. The drivers of this cooperative taxi platform would be paid in its own currency, which would easily be exchanged for dollars or euros. Because a limited total amount of these tokens would be created, their value will increase as the popularity of the service grows. This would attract more drivers, which will lead to more customers and another increase in demand and value for the tokens.      This digital cooperative model has a lot of benefits for other sectors of the digital economy as well. Think of a social network, like Facebook, but one that pays its users for selling their data to advertisers. A network of users are also members and have a say in the governance of it.      Tokenized digital cooperatives will help people cooperate because everybody involved will benefit. Pooling resources, sharing equipment or new kinds of pension and insurance schemes are a possibility as well. All transactions will be entered into a blockchain and can, therefore, be verified. Blockchain-based co-ops can help governments create an economy of inclusion and re-write the social contract for the 21st century.      A clear regulatory framework is needed for this to happen. The way these digital co-ops and their tokens can be created needs to be enshrined in law. Expanding current cooperative law by including digital co-ops and the creation of tokens, plus tokenized owner and membership, could be a good way forward. Regulators have been wary of the dark sides of bitcoin, which has slowed innovation in token-based business models.      A clear legal status for digital co-ops would allow cutting-edge technology to use market mechanisms to solve one of the bigger issues of our times: the shift to a digital economy that harms many workers. Tokenized digital cooperatives also provide the possibility for investors to support startups with capital in exchange for a certain number of the tokens created. This way, they will become part of the inclusive economy and no longer need to gain wealth on the backs of customers or workers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Gys Hough,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/09/the-gig-economy-is-unfair-heres-how-token-models-can-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28f4a89bd9673779f9439a926667b360f7a87cc8-2000x1249.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dumping by a Ponzi scheme played a mighty role in the selloff, market sources said. Read more here.      The price of bitcoin has fallen to a one-month low below $7,900, amid a wider sell-off in the global financial markets.      As of writing, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $7,837, the lowest in the past 30 days and a 10 percent decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The price decline comes as the global financial markets suffer a wider sell-off, with Brent crude oil dropping over 30 percent on Sunday, its biggest single-day decline since 1991.      Underscoring the severity of the global flight from assets perceived as risky is the drop in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield below 0.5 percent for the first time ever, down over two percentage points from a year ago.      Bitcoin's sudden price dip also comes as the network's computing power and mining difficulty (a measure of competition among miners) are both expected to reach a new high in just five hours.

42431587,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Exh,1583730000,Paradigm Leads $12M Round for DeFi-Friendly Wallet Startup,"It’s about to be easier than ever to take risky bets using ethereum-based financial products, thanks to the crypto wallet startup Argent.      Paradigm, spearheaded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, just led Argent’s $12 million Series A, along with Compound founder Robert Leshner and Index Ventures. The London-based wallet startup has now raised $16 million since it was founded in December 2017.      “I don’t know what the revenue model will be, but we know it’s going to attract a lot of users.” Leshner said of Argent. “They are creating one of the smoothest on-ramps to DeFi [decentralized finance] products.”      Leshner said he was attracted to the investment opportunity because the startup offers a unique combination of “smart contract architecture” and a “convenient user experience.” Plus, the crypto wallet has social recovery features so users can get their accounts back if they lose phones.      Argent Chief Executive Itamar Lesuisse said there are more than 3,000 active user accounts already during the six-month closed beta, and more than 1,000 people on the waiting list for the public launch in April. He said so far more than half of them use DeFi products, like loans and interest-bearing deposits.      “DeFi was the reason to come to Argent,” Lessuisse described the user feedback as being.      Users can now take out a crypto-backed loan, for example, with just a few clicks of a button. These DeFi products involve technical risks, he added, related to “bugs inside the smart contracts.” But he said the DeFi companies, not the wallet itself, are the ones responsible for disclosures related to specific products.      One such provider, the Maker Foundation, said in a press statement it’s “very supportive of Argent's work to make it more easy, more secure and more convenient for more people to participate in DeFi.”      Paradigm partner Matt Huang said his firm was attracted to Argent because it “strikes a nice balance between security and usability.”    DeFi risks    Lesuisse said his 17-person startup’s mobile wallet is “as simple as Venmo,” and will expand its DeFi product options this year.      The mobile wallet is indeed designed for simplicity. It allows users to purchase crypto with their debit cards or Apple Pay accounts, through partnerships with Wyre and MoonPay. Yet, critics like blockchain consultant Udi Wertheimer say once funds from the wallet are plugged into the DeFi ecosystem, then Maker or Compound manage funds and the funds can be taken away from users at any point.      This wallet has a unique identifier associated with the phone and a back-up recovery method set up with either Argent or the user’s friend or relative, which is unique compared to similar mobile wallets with private keys. However, the DeFi loans and contracts taken with the wallet are still arguably under the realm of various providers such as Compound. Last month, the DeFi project bZx, which isn’t accessible through Argent, was hacked through a smart contract vulnerability that led to a loss of just under $1 million.      “Although we make the experience simple, these are still complex financial products,” Lesuisse said of DeFi.      Argent is not currently focused on monetization. Instead, it receives some small fees from DeFi providers like the Kyber exchange. So far, Lesuisse said, the average user has roughly $2,000 in their Argent wallet.      “It’s an easy way for consumers to interact with DeFi. Argent can’t prevent some of the risks that might occur in the DeFi space overall,” Huang said, acknowledging the risks associated with smart contract bugs. “As a user, you’re still exposed to and should be comfortable with the actions you take.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/09/paradigm-leads-12m-round-for-defi-friendly-wallet-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da757cc562919de20c75d5765962c6a2ce29adf4-1400x1051.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431589,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Ezh,1583726400,The Tokenization Delusion,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics.      Let me tell you about a lovely dream. In some utopian future, all assets will be represented as tokens on blockchains. Everyone will issue their own tokens, backed by their own assets. And because those tokens are backed by assets and their ownership is transparently recorded on an immutable decentralized blockchain, everyone will accept everyone else’s token as money. There will be no need for trusted central institutions to issue money. In the new world of tokens and blockchains, private asset-backed money will be ubiquitous, and everyone will be their own bank.      Currently, the principal use of asset-backed tokens is to make illiquid things liquid. Say you have a stash of something valuable but difficult to transport. Twelve-foot steel girders, for example. You put up an advertisement on Craigslist saying, “Steel girders for sale, buyer collects” and you wait. For a long time.      The problem is this transaction suffers from “coincidence of wants.” Storing girders takes up space, as you know (because your garage is full of them). And there isn’t much of an investment market for girders. So the only people who are likely to want to buy your girders are people who have an immediate use for them and – importantly – can transport them. You might get lucky – there could be a local builder who needs some steel girders for a project. But if buyers have to come some distance, they might not bother. After all, you probably aren’t the only person in the country offering steel girders for sale at a hefty discount.      But suppose, instead of selling your girders, you decide to monetize your stash. Steel girders are rather good things to monetize because they don’t decay, they aren’t appetizing for rats and mice, they can survive some fires and floods, and they are “fungible,” which means one girder is indistinguishable from another. So you create a token – a stablecoin – linked to girders: one token represents one girder. To market the token, you set up a fancy website, publish a white paper using stuff you found on the internet and issue a bunch of press releases saying GirderCoin is the money of the future and early adopters will be billionaires. Don’t miss out, buy some now!      Humans have been monetizing assets in this way since time immemorial. Representations of valuable objects are far easier to trade than the objects themselves, and they have at times been used as money. They also make it possible for delicate objects to be kept in controlled storage: Cans of vintage sardines, for example, which require climate-controlled conditions and careful management if they are to age properly.      But trading representations of objects rather than the objects themselves creates an opportunity for fraud. If GirderCoin takes off – and many coins of this type do take off, at least for a short while – you will rake in a lot of money without physically delivering your girders. Of course, your girders now belong to other people and their ownership is permanently and transparently recorded on a blockchain. But “possession is nine-tenths of the law,” as they say. So when a local builder turns up at your door saying, “Hey, man, I need some girders,” you do a deal, don’t you? You sell some of the girders to the builder for cash. GirderCoin still exists – in fact, it’s doing rather well – but it is no longer backed one-for-one by real girders. It is now “fractionally reserved.” Banks, of course, have been doing this for centuries.    The cost of reliably linking tokens to real assets inevitably drives the market towards consolidation, oligopoly and even monopoly.    But you now have a problem. If a GirderCoin holder actually tries to collect their girders, you haven’t got them. Fortunately, as previously mentioned, steel girders are fungible: Token ownership confers the right to claim “a” girder, but not any specific girder. And you’ve sensibly put a clause in GirderCoin’s terms and conditions saying that anyone who wants to collect their girders must give three days’ notice. So if anyone does try to claim their girders, you have three days to obtain them. Unless you are lucky enough to find a handy advert on Craigslist, you will have to buy them at full price from a steel supplier. It might be more convenient, though less honest, simply to disappear.      Recording changes of ownership of a real asset on a blockchain doesn’t eliminate fraud. If you buy a token backed by a real asset you don’t physically hold, how do you know that real asset exists? The blockchain will tell you who owns the real asset but it won’t tell you where it is. What is on the blockchain, and what is present in reality, could be very different.      Asset-backed token issuers typically try to instill confidence by promising periodic audits. You, GirderCoin issuer, might promise that your girder stock will be audited every six months. SardineCoin's issuer promises exactly this. But there’s still a trust problem, isn’t there? Who will conduct this audit and why should anyone believe their findings – especially as they are being paid to say everything is fine? Maintaining permanent open house for GirderCoin holders so they can inspect the girder stocks whenever they want might mitigate the trust problem, though only if they know the total number of girders, not just their own holding – and, of course, as the garage is full to the roof with girders, counting them might be a bit of a problem. So you get your friend who is an accountant to certify you have the right number of girders and you put the certificate on your website to convince punters you are honest. Seriously, this is what token issuers do.      There are other things you could do to reassure coin holders that you are not fractionally-reserving their girders. You could set up GirderCam – 24-hour surveillance of your girder store – and make it publicly available on the internet. People do this for kittens, after all. Or you could affix a GPS tracker to every girder, so that its movements can be tracked. Micro-chipping steel girders sounds a bit advanced, but with the Internet of Things, all things are possible ... at a price. Though microchipping sardines in their cans, or wine in its bottle, seems too complicated even for the Internet of Things. There is always the risk the custodian eats the sardines and drinks the wine, then disappears leaving a garage full of empty sardine cans and wine bottles, all reassuringly microchipped.      Convincing punters you are not out to rip them off is expensive. For a small retail girder seller, it’s all a bit much. After all, this was supposed to be an easy way of making money.      If you are honest, your exit strategy from all this expense is to look for a buyer. Economies of scale being what they are, large commercial outfits are much better able to bear these expenses than people selling stuff out of their garages. And they want to corner the market if they can. Closing down little cottage industries like yours is in their interests. So when a large commercial outfit offers to buy up all GirderCoins and absorb them into its GirderFund, you will accept with considerable relief. GirderFund will make GirderCoin holders an offer they can’t refuse, move the girders to their own storage and you will put your car in your garage for the first time in years – after dismantling all the surveillance gear, of course. After all, you don’t want the whole world looking at your car in its garage while you are enjoying a well-earned holiday in the sun.      The dream of tokenizing all assets, enabling people to issue their own coins and have them accepted as money, founders on the problem of trust. By definition, physical assets are not decentralized. Your girder stash is yours until you monetize it, but once you monetize it, you become custodian for other people’s girders. You need substantial infrastructure and a flawless reputation for them to trust you enough to accept your coin, even to hold as an investment. For tokens to be widely accepted as money requires even more trust. And if you don’t want to be responsible for looking after other people’s property, then we are back to “buyer collects.” Paradoxically, decentralizing physical assets destroys the whole point of asset-backed tokens.      The cost of reliably linking tokens to real assets inevitably drives the market towards consolidation, oligopoly and even monopoly. Of course, people could back their tokens with decentralized digital assets. But investing in digital assets so you can issue a digital asset of your own is a long way from simply monetizing whatever is lying around in your garage. Why would anyone bother to do this?      If everyone owned decentralized digital assets as a matter of course, the utopia of everyone issuing their own asset-backed tokens and transacting freely without government involvement could perhaps become reality. But until that happens, tokenization of assets seems likely to remain the province of professionals, and “be your own bank” merely a lovely dream.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/09/the-tokenization-delusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bad56763d7605ffe1619c120190f32de130510f-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Erh,1583720100,Exiled Bitmain Co-Founder Is Fighting Back With Second Lawsuit,"Micree Ketuan Zhan, the ousted co-founder of Bitmain, has filed another lawsuit in his fight to regain control of the bitcoin mining giant – this time in his home country.      A recent notice from the Changle District court in China’s Fujian province indicates Zhan has filed a lawsuit against Bitmain’s fully-owned subsidiary Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies, as well as Beijing Bitmain Technologies as a related third party.      A hearing of the case was scheduled on Feb. 11, according to the notice, although it's likely postponed due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. While it’s not clear what the exact allegations are, the court says the case relates to a “shareholder qualification confirmation dispute.”      The case adds to the ongoing litigation in the Cayman Islands Zhan has filed against the company he co-founded with Jihan Wu in 2013, casting further uncertainty on the outcome of the power struggle at the world’s largest miner maker as well as its planned initial public offering in the U.S.      Zhan filed a lawsuit in December in the Caymans, where Bitmain’s parent holding entity is registered, asking a court to void a decision allegedly passed at a shareholder meeting that significantly curtailed his voting power.      Lawyers representing Zhan in the Cayman Islands previously told CoinDesk that Zhan, as a major shareholder, was not aware of the meeting beforehand, and a hearing for the case might be scheduled after the Easter holiday.    Asset protection    The lawsuit in China also followed an asset-protection petition filed by Zhan and approved by the same court in December, but the court’s full judgment was not made public until last Thursday.      The court sided with Zhan to freeze 36 percent of Fujian Zhanhua’s 10 million yuan incorporated shares owned by Bitmain, worth 3.6 million yuan, or $500,000. Though the value of the frozen assets may be negligible for Bitmain, the percentage could be significant.      Fujian Zhanhua is 100 percent owned by Beijing Bitmain, whose parent company is Cayman-registered BitMain Technologies Holding, of which Zhan remains the largest shareholder – with 36 percent.      That means Zhan indirectly owns 36 percent of Fujian Zhanhua, suggesting the asset-protection move is intended to prevent his power over this subsidiary from being transferred or diluted.      Under the court’s asset-protection order, Beijing Bitmain will not be able to transfer or pledge these frozen assets as collateral, nor would it be able to increase the subsidiary’s total incorporated capital in order to dilute the percentage of the frozen ownership.    But why Fujian Zhanhua?      It may appear surprising that Zhan would file a case against one subsidiary out of a dozen entities under Bitmain’s holding firm, and in a court in Fujian instead of Bitmain’s home base in Beijing.      But the importance of Fujian Zhanhua could hint at Zhan’s strategy for fighting back since he was ousted in a coup in November 2019.      To be sure, Zhan, a Fujian native, is still the legal representative of Fujian Zhanhua, a firm that was ranked 58th by the Fujian provincial government in 2018 out of the top 100 taxpayer companies.      And Bitmain’s Hong Kong IPO filing in 2018 listed Fujian Zhanhua as one of the four principal subordinate entities that had made material contribution to the financial results of Bitmain’s holding group, alongside Beijing Bitmain, Bitmain Hong Kong and a Shenzhen manufacturing subsidiary.      The document specified the principal business activity of Fujian Zhanhua as Bitmain’s “sales center for cryptocurrency mining hardware” in China.      Bitmain booked over $2.5 billion in revenue in 2017 alone, of which about 95 percent came from sales of its mining hardware. And the mainland China market counted for nearly 50 percent of the total sales volume that year.      In fact, Bitmain’s two major sales channels – the AntMiner pre-sales and post-sales WeChat accounts – were previously owned and operated by Fujian Zhanhua. However, the ownership for both channels was migrated to another, lesser-known Bitmain subsidiary in December, whose legal representative is not Zhan.      Further, the IPO document revealed the Fujian subsidiary played a vital role in one of Bitmain’s financing activities in 2018.      In July 2018, Beijing Bitmain signed a series of purchase agreements worth $100 million to buy an office building in Beijing. To finance that transaction, it borrowed $49 million from a local bank with the acquired property pledged as collateral and with Fujian Zhanhua as a guarantor, underscoring the financial wherewithal of the Fujian subsidiary.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/09/exiled-bitmain-co-founder-is-fighting-back-with-second-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c63939f0772576e117fc29709aa51d266b5d90d-1400x932.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
