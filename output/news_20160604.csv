42399067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCTT,1465061991,Making Sense of Blockchain Smart Contracts,"Josh Stark is a lawyer and head of operations and legal at Ledger Labs, a blockchain consulting firm and development group.  In this op-ed, Ledger Labs head of operations Josh Stark takes a deep dive into the concept of smart contracts.  The term “smart contract” has no clear and settled definition.  The idea has long been hyped to the public as a central component of next-generation blockchain platforms, and as a key capability for any practical enterprise application.  They are defined variously as “autonomous machines”, “contracts between parties stored on a blockchain” or “any computation that takes place on a blockchain”. Many debates about the nature of smart contracts are really just contests between competing terminology.  The different definitions usually fall into one of two categories. Sometimes the term is used to identify a specific technology – code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain. Let’s call this type of definition “smart contract code”.  Other times, the term is used to refer to a specific application of that technology: as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts. Let’s name these “smart legal contracts”.  Using the same term to refer to distinct concepts makes answering even simple questions impossible. For instance, one question I’m often asked is simply: what are the capabilities of a smart contract?  If we are talking about smart contract code, then the answer depends on the capabilities of the language used to express the contract and the technical features of the blockchain on which it operates.  But if we are asking about using that technology to create a binding legal agreement, or an effective substitute for a binding legal agreement, the answer depends on far more than the technology. This answer depends on existing legal doctrine and how our legal, political and commercial institutions decide to treat the technology. If businesspeople don’t trust it, the legislature doesn’t recognize it and the courts can’t interpret it, then it won’t be a very practically useful “contract”.  It would be futile to try and change the way people use the term already. Practically speaking, we are probably stuck using – or at least reading – the term “smart contract” for now. This makes it essential for anyone interested in this space to understand the different ways the term is used and be able to distinguish clearly between them.  Smart contracts as smart contract code  Blockchains can run code. While the first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations – mainly, transactions of a currency-like token – techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations, defined in full-fledged programming languages.  Because these programs are run on a blockchain, they have unique characteristics compared to other types of software. First, the program itself is recorded on the blockchain, which gives it a blockchain’s characteristic permanence and censorship resistance. Second, the program can itself control blockchain assets – i.e., it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency. Third, the program is executed by the blockchain, meaning it will always execute as written and no one can interfere with its operation.  To developers and others working directly with blockchain technology, the term “smart contracts” is most often used to refer to this blockchain code. You’ll see this use of the term in the Ethereum documentation, on stackexchange and in technically minded articles. The term has been particularly associated with the Ethereum project, whose primary purpose is to be a platform for smart contract code. But today, the term is used generically across the community to refer to any complex program that is stored and executed on a blockchain.  Calling these programs contracts is helpful in that this code is governing something important or valuable. We only go to the trouble of creating a binding contract when it’s important that we be able to enforce the terms. Similarly, we only use smart contract code when the code controls something important, like money or identity.  That said, smart contract code need not resemble anything we would ordinarily think of as a “contract”. While the code could articulate a conditional financial transaction (“send 1 BTC from Alice to Bob on July 1, 2016”), it could also be a governance application that controls account permissions (“if Alice has voted yes, remove Bob’s voting rights over Application X and notify the following accounts…”).  In many cases, smart contract code is not used in isolation but as a small piece in a larger application. Every DApp, DAO, or other blockchain-based application is built using smart contract code to perform operations on their chosen blockchain. Any Ethereum application that you’ve read about – like Augur, Slock.it, or Boardroom – is made out of smart contract code.  Imperfect, misleading, and someday outdated  The term receives a lot of valid criticism. Relying on the metaphor of a “contract” is misleading because it emphasizes a single narrow use case. The term fails to capture one of the key capabilities of blockchain programs: that they have a kind of independent agency.  Smart contract programs can themselves hold balances of cryptocurrency, or even control other smart contract programs. Once they are created, they can act autonomously when called to perform an action. For this reason, many prefer the term “smart agent”, analogous to the more general concept of a software agent.  Eventually, this use of the term may simply fade from use as blockchain technology matures.  Developers will be more likely to refer to a specific language (“Let’s look at your Solidity code”) or platform (“Our application runs on Eris.db”) that they are working with, as opposed to a generic term that could describe any complex operation on a blockchain.  The capabilities and purpose of smart contract code as distinct from other code may simply become clear from context, without requiring the use of a clumsy analogy like “contract”. It might end up being more similar to how we speak of HTML and JavaScript today, without having to think about how the former is a “markup” language, playing a distinct role from JavaScript in the overall web application.  Smart contracts as smart legal contracts  Among those who work in finance or law, the term “smart contract” is often read quite differently than the definition above.  “Smart contract” here refers to a specific use case of smart-contract code – a way of using blockchain technology to complement, or replace, existing legal contracts. This is the definition of the term I considered in my last piece: the use of code to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties. A smart legal contract.  These smart legal contracts would most likely be a combination of smart contract code and more traditional legal language. For instance, imagine a supplier of goods enters into a smart legal contract with a retailer. The payment terms could be defined in code and executed automatically when delivery is made. But the retailer would likely insist the contract include an indemnity clause, whereby the supplier agrees to indemnify the retailer against claims flowing from a defective product. There would be no point representing this clause in code, since it is not something that can self-execute – it exists to be interpreted and enforced by a court in the case of litigation.  Commercial agreements are full of boilerplate clauses that protect parties from various edge-case liabilities, and these are not always suitable for representation and execution through code, meaning that smart legal contracts will require (at least for the foreseeable future) a blend between code and natural language.  This is the basic idea behind Eris Industries’ dual integration system, Primavera de Fillipi’s proposed Legal Framework for Crypto-Ledger Transactions, and R3’s Corda smart contracts system.  Could smart legal contracts ever be considered legally enforceable? Probably. Despite what many think, the conditions under which an agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract are flexible and attuned to the underlying relationship between the parties, rather than dependent on the form the contract takes. Anything from a verbal agreement to an email conversation can become a contract at law, if the basic elements of a contract can be found.  Many contracts, many use cases  The category of smart legal contracts is complicated by the fact that there are many different types of contracts in the world, only some of which are obvious candidates for use as “smart contracts”. A legal contract could be anything from a verbal agreement for someone to paint your house to a derivative traded electronically in financial markets.  Since early 2015, the use cases attracting the most attention are smart legal contracts as smart financial instruments like shares, bonds, or derivatives contracts. Articulating these contracts in code could allow financial markets to become more automated and simplify many process-intensive systems related to trading and servicing of financial instruments.  These “smart financial instruments” do not exist at scale today, although many people are working to build them. R3’s recently announced Corda platform is designed to facilitate this type of smart-contract. Digital Asset Holdings recently acqui-hired Elevance, a Swiss firm that has developed a way to model financial agreements in code. In April, Barclays’ revealed details of a scheme, in cooperation with R3, to represent ISDA agreements in smart contract code.  Financial instruments are just one type of contract that could benefit from blockchain code. As the technology matures, other assets – e.g. real estate, or intellectual property – may be stored and traded over blockchain systems. As new asset types go “on-chain”, the agreements used to govern those assets in the world today (like a mortgage or licensing agreement) may benefit from blockchain-based analogs.  Alternatives to traditional legal agreements  Many advocates for blockchain technology see larger possibilities. Rather than merely imitate or complement the legal contracts we use today, perhaps smart contract code could be used to facilitate new types of commercial arrangements.  We might even call this a third definition of the term: using smart contract code to create novel, alternative forms of agreements that are nonetheless commercially useful. Let's call these ""smart alternative contracts"".  This approach takes a broader view of the real-world problem solved by contracts. Commerce depends on individuals being able to form stable, predictable agreements with one another. Contracts, along with a strong legal system, are the primary mechanisms we use to shape each party’s incentives to the point where they have sufficient confidence in their relationship to engage in the risky business of trade.  But perhaps legal agreements are not the only solution to this general problem. Smart contract code offers a new set of tools to articulate and enforce terms, and they can be used to create systems of incentives that may be sufficient to make commercial relationships possible.  The most widely discussed opportunity of this type is machine-to-machine commerce. The growing ecosystem of smart devices – particularly those that are in some fashion autonomous – will eventually need a way to engage in basic commercial interactions with one another. For instance, a washer that buys its own detergent or a car that can pay to recharge itself.  These transactions still require a minimum level of trust to be commercially viable, but are ill-suited for legal contracts, which are comparatively expensive and require the involvement of legal persons like a corporation or human. Smart alternative contracts might enable an entirely new type of commerce carried out between our computers, cars, phones, and appliances.  There probably are – or will be – other types of commercial interaction that aren’t well suited to traditional legal contracts. New markets, suddenly made possible by technology, but which are underserved by legal tools that are slow to innovate and adapt.  Smart alternative contracts might let us stretch the web of trust out a little further, a little faster, beyond the reach of the legal system, where they can enable new forms of commerce not possible today.  Conclusion  The lack of clear terminology in this field is an unfortunate reality. Those of us who work in the blockchain space should be mindful of how the term is being used in different communities, and be prepared to ask a series of annoying, though necessary, clarifying questions when asked about the nature and potential of “smart contracts”.  The different uses of the term illustrate a broader challenge in our industry. The interdisciplinary nature of blockchain technology, and “smart contracts” in particular, lead people to see the technology as primarily belonging to their own discipline, at the expense of the others.  Lawyers often look at smart contracts and see marginally improved legal agreements, without appreciating the fuller potential of blockchain-code to extend beyond law’s reach.  Developers, on the other hand, consider smart contracts and see the limitless possibilities of software, without appreciating the subtleties and commercial realities reflected in traditional legal agreements.  As with any interdisciplinary field, both must learn from the other.

42399053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiCGg,1465058053,Will Bitcoin's Block Rewards Halving Bring Crisis or Consistency?,"As the block mining reward halving event approaches, many people in the bitcoin space are excited because of the potential for an increase in the digital currency's price.  One miner, though, has expressed serious concern that, when the drop in the block subsidy occurs, it could trigger a chain of events that could lead to an inevitable hard fork.  Chandler Guo is the co-founder of Bitbank, a China-based digital currency company that runs one of the largest mining operations in the world, BW. On average, BW.com accounts for approximately 10% of the total hashrate, an impressive feat considering it launched only two years ago.  Guo said he fears that if the price of bitcoin does not appreciate significantly before or immediately after halving, too much hashrate will drop off the network due to unprofitable mining, making transaction verification virtually impossible.  He said:  “If the price doesn’t go up very quickly, up two times, it means a lot of the older machines will be shut down. They must shut down.”  Bitcoin halving is a roughly once-every-four-year event whereby the consistent supply of bitcoin released is cut in half. When pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin in January 2009, each block generated a reward of 50 BTC. On 28th November, 2012, nearly four years after the bitcoin blockchain was first launched, the reward subsidy fell by half to 25 BTC.  Satoshi added halving so that the code could continue to provide fresh bitcoins as the network scaled, but would also phase out the production of new bitcoin as it approached the maximum cap of 21 million. However, that sudden drop can shock miners that operate with low profit margins.  Guo believes that miners using less efficient hardware will be forced to drop off the network when the subsidy falls.  “There will be 300 petahash of older machines that shut down immediately. They don’t need to work anymore; they just shut down,” he said.  He went on to explain:  “When halving come[s], for the Avalon A3, Bitminer S3, the cost of the electricity is the same, so it must shut down. For example, the S3 is working 24 hours, they cost $1, for example, and they can mine $1. So if mining equipment can only mine the electricity payment, they don’t need to work.”  Hardfork for difficulty  Miners make money by generating more income than they spend on electricity and the associated costs of running a network of machines that are always churning away. Maximizing profit in bitcoin mining is all about how much hardware someone can throw at trying to solve the next block.  The more hashing power, the more likely a miner is going to succeed on a regular basis.  To solve this problem, Nakamoto included a difficulty equation in the code so that every 2,016 blocks, the code analyzes how much hashing power is on the network and increases – or decreases – the difficulty. Over the past year, the difficulty has increased significantly as more hardware was added to the network.  The reason Guo is so concerned is because of the hard coded time by which difficulty is calculated. If more hashing power was added to the network tomorrow, blocks might be found sooner, increasing profitability for miners and speeding up the time at which difficulty is recalculated. However, if hashing power were to be removed, the opposite occurs.  Guo explained that if a large number of miners are taken offline, it will reduce a significant amount of the total hashing power which, in turn, will slow down when the next difficulty event occurs.  He told CoinDesk:  “When the difficulty doesn’t change, but the hashing power shuts down immediately, there will be no next block. If, after the halving, the price does not go up, but the prices goes down, [there] will be heartache. It means no next block, no blockchain, all of the blockchain will be shut down immediately.”  In other words, because the difficulty won’t change for 2,016 blocks, if 300 petahash were to drop off the network, that would slow down the time between each block.  That slowdown could translate into slower transaction times, creating major headaches for people looking to broadcast transactions. In one worst-case scenario, this situation would lead to a crisis of confidence in the digital currency, potentially resulting in a sell-off. Lower bitcoin prices could result in even more miners shutting down their hardware, sparking a vicious cycle.  To get around this, Guo believes that there will need to be a hard fork to essentially reset the difficulty.  “Some mining pool, together, will change to another chain, to change the difficulty to another chain. [A] hard fork is coming, it’s bad news and the price will crash down again,” he said.  Skepticism of severity  There are others in the community, however, who are not nearly as concerned about the halving as Guo. In their eyes, because a halving event has already occurred once without destroying the network, they feel comfortable heading into this next event.  Eric Lombrozo, a contributor to the open-source Bitcoin Core developer team and founder of Ciphrex, told CoinDesk:  “I do not believe the halving will have nearly as big an impact on the network as some have predicted. We’ve already had a halving in the past…and we’ve also seen significant sudden drops in bitcoin price – both of these situations imply lower short-term miner revenue. In neither case did we see a significant drop in hashrate.”  The idea is that miners have enough financial dry powder that they can stomach any drops in the block subsidy as the market tries to determine the new price of bitcoin with supply cut in half.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, which runs the third-largest bitcoin mining pool with approximately 16% of the hashrate, agrees that there will be a drop in hashrate. However, he doesn’t believe it will be as significant as Guo predicts.  ""After mining, for sure the hashrate will come down a bit, it will probably come down by 5-10%. It won’t come down by more than 30%,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We’ve seen it in other cryptocurrencies that at a block halving, the hashrate does come down. That’s expected.""  He went on to explain that he doesn’t see this as any sort of existential crisis for bitcoin and compared it to Donald Trump, the controversial American businessman who is currently seeking the US presidency.  “For people who dislike Trump, they think it’s a huge crisis. But after a few weeks, it calms down,” he explained.  BitFury, a mining company with approximately 10% of the hashrate, said that as a company, it's not concerned about the halving.  ""The important point is that the hashrate decline will not compromise the security of the network and will not make it susceptible to attack. We also firmly believe the upcoming halving event is good for the industry because it will motivate Bitcoin companies to innovate,"" said Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, referencing the Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, and sidechains as recent developments.  Others believe that hashrate will actually increase soon after halving, leading to a more difficult mining environment.  Terrence Thurber, co-founder and CEO of Oregon Mines, a bitcoin mine hosting provider, explained that he agrees that the hashrate could drop by 10% immediately after halving, with up to a 30% drop in the short-term. But in the long term, he said, newer equipment will make up for that lost capacity.  He said:  “New generation equipment, such as Bitmain’s model S9, has the ability to quickly add hashrate which, absent changing other factors, would increase difficulty to the point where older generation miners are no longer profitable at most electricity price points.”  No concerns – if the price rises  Obviously, none of this is a problem if the price were to rise heading into the subsidy halving, because more miners would maintain profitability even if the number of bitcoins generated by each block drops by half.  ""After halving, it will be difficulty if the price does not go up,"" said Guo. ""Today, it is still perfect. It’s an old story and when the price goes up, it will be the next story.”  Thurber told CoinDesk that, if bitcoin behaves like other commodities, the price should increase as the supply decreases. If this is the case, then the price would increase enough to offset the loss in supply and even out overall demand.  “Using traditional economic theory, the combination of bitcoin price and difficulty should balance out to basically return the market to the same position it was immediately prior to halving. Thus, if difficulty remained constant, the pre-halving price would double,” Thurber said.  At the same time, Thurber tempered that theory by saying that the final outcome might be entirely different, concluding:  “Of course, bitcoin is a new commodity and doesn’t fit traditional models well.”  Image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,Jacob Donnelly,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/04/will-bitcoins-block-rewards-halving-bring-crisis-or-consistency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e2c6c5b99b1995e89ee619eb7ac82ced53708a3-1500x917.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
