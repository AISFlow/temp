42414621,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCfdA,1674083732,Yuga Labs' Sewer Pass NFT Collection Nets Over $6M in Sales in Just Hours,"After announcing the release of a new non-fungible token (NFT) project within the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem, Yuga Labs released its Sewer Passes for minting on Wednesday, yielding over 4,000 ETH (over $6 million) in total sales volume within hours of release.  Holders of a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) or Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT were eligible to claim a free Sewer Pass on Wednesday, which acts as the key to playing a skill-based game called Dookey Dash. Those holding a Sewer Pass (whether minted or purchased on the secondary marketplace) can play Dookey Dash from Jan. 19 to Feb. 8. Scores accumulated from gameplay will be part of a broader narrative experience called ""Chapter 1"" at a later date.  The Sewer Passes were broken up into four tiers, based on whether the holder of a BAYC or MAYC NFT also hold a Bored Ape Kennel Club NFT in their wallet. At the time of writing, the floor price for a Tier 1 Sewer Pass on secondary NFT marketplace OpenSea stood at 1.3 ETH (about $1,970), while Tier 4 passes were listed for up to 420 ETH (about $640,000).  Bored Ape Yacht Club tweeted that the official Sewer Pass collection was listed for secondary resale on OpenSea. Notably, the Sewer Passes had certain conditions coded into its smart contract, including a blocklist of certain wallet addresses, which sparked conversation on Twitter around the move. Some of the addresses blocked belong to other major secondary marketplaces like LooksRare and NFTX.  This may be getting more notice than warranted, however, as it reflects Yuga Lab's decision to enforce a 5% creator royalty fee on OpenSea.  Read more: OpenSea Makes Waves: Says Creator Royalties Will Be Enforced  Per OpenSea's developer guide: ""OpenSea supports on-chain enforcement of creator fees if you want to enable them for your new project. The way this works is by adding a simple code snippet to NFT contracts that restricts NFT sales of your project to only marketplaces that enforce creator fees.""  LooksRare, one of the platforms apparently blocked by the move, opted to make royalties optional in October. Several other major platforms, including X2Y2, have also opted for this structure, as part of a larger movement by platforms to court sellers looking to get the best deal for their NFT purchase. Meanwhile, creators have pushed back against the shift, saying that it hurts their ability to make an ongoing profit from their artistic creations.  In a statement to CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Yuga Labs affirmed its belief in protecting creator royalties. ""We’ve always been a creative-first company, and we believe that creator royalties must be protected.""  ""The Sewer Pass free claim will only be traded on platforms respecting creator royalties,"" they added.  Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow, aka Gordon Goner, has been outspoken about protecting creator royalties, noting in November that the company was looking into using allowlists coded into smart contracts to determine which wallet addresses could transfer NFTs. He noted that externally owned accounts, or EOAs, are a type of crypto wallet not used by marketplaces, making it easier to differentiate trades between private users and marketplaces.  ""Coding something like this into your NFT smart contract will make it so that creators can make sure they collect their royalties,"" he wrote.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/18/yuga-labs-sewer-pass-nft-collection-nets-over-6m-in-sales-in-just-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9129518477e2c775302b792cdfcec140b3a8bc83-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the past seven days, the shiba inu token (SHIB) has been a favorite purchase among newly funded crypto wallets. SHIB was sent to over 12,000 fresh wallets, making it the most common non-stablecoin asset to appear in their balances, according to Nansen. Those wallets saw $56 million in SHIB inflows over that period.  These wallets aren’t necessarily controlled by first-time SHIB buyers; on the contrary, many may be pass-through wallets belonging to crypto-trading veterans. Regardless, SHIB showed up in far more of these new wallets than did other cryptos.  Meme coin SHIB is up more than 6% over the past 24 hours as traders digest this week’s news of a shiba inu-themed layer 2. Beyond that, there have been other signs of life in crypto over the past week. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which was below $17,000 as recently as Jan. 8, has roared back to around $21,000.  Most SHIB trades are executed in wETH-SHIB liquidity pools on Uniswap and ShibaSwap, the token’s native decentralized exchange. Wrapped ether remains the top trading pair for SHIB, comprising 65% of available liquidity. Nearly a quarter of liquidity comes via BONE, the Shiba Inu project’s governance token.  Week over week, a steady 22% of SHIB’s circulating supply is parked on crypto exchanges, with Binance, the world’s largest exchange, holding more SHIB than any other; Crypto.com is second highest. Notably, Binance’s total SHIB deposits have dropped by 1.6 trillion tokens in seven days, while smaller exchanges such as OKX have seen their deposits increase.",POSITIVE,SHIB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/18/shib-a-favorite-holding-among-new-crypto-wallets-nansen-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But a new paper from Circle Internet Financial and decentralized exchange Uniswap Labs finds that a distributed ledger could solve that problem with simultaneous settlement.  Several researchers from the two digital-finance companies – including Uniswap Chief Operating Officer Mary-Catherine Lader and Circle’s chief economist, Gordon Liao – contend that crypto’s innovations could be an answer to this major ongoing financial-stability concern for regulators. That’s one conclusion of their 20-page paper to be released in Davos for an event hosted by Circle on Thursday in conjunction with the World Economic Forum.  “On-chain FX can offer faster and more affordable transaction processes, as well as greater liquidity and stability,” the paper concludes.  The researchers also say remittances – money that people send across international borders – could see their costs cut by 80% through decentralized finance (DeFi). Sending money to people in other countries has always been one of the strongest arguments for crypto, and the paper said the lower costs could translate to $30 billion a year remaining in people’s pockets.  The paper arrives as blockchain and other crypto technology are suffering reputational damage from a heavy crypto winter compounded by the collapse of one of the biggest, most trusted companies, FTX. Regulators and the major companies in the traditional financial system have been reluctant – especially in recent months – to show enthusiasm for the new approaches.

However, while investor sentiment looks to have significantly recovered, not everyone is expecting BTC to continue to do well. The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature reveals that a large number of investors are expecting the price of the cryptocurrency to fall over the next two weeks. 12% Decline For Bitcoin The Coinmarketcap Price Estimates feature allows users to input their forecasts for the price of any digital asset and then produces an average price based on everyone’s predictions. This can help to give a good feel of the community and how they are looking for an asset. Related Reading: Liquidations Cross $200 Million Following Bitcoin’s Rise Above $19,000 For bitcoin, it seems not a lot of investors expect the pioneer cryptocurrency to continue on this recovery trend. With over 19,000 price estimates submitted, the median came out to an expected 12% decrease in bitcoin’s price in the coming two weeks. Such a decline would actually see the price of BTC fall as low as $18,634, losing more than $2,500 of its current value. This bearish sentiment does not stop at the end of the month of January but carries into the following months. The median estimated price for the month of February was $18,981, which is an over 10% decline from the current price, and the outlook for March was almost identical in this regard. The expected declines stretch out over the next six months with price medians getting progressively lower. Estimates came out to a between 14-18% decline for the month of April, June, and July, respectively. Bearish outlook for BTC in the next six months | Source: Coinmarketcap Will BTC Succumb To Bearish Pressure? Over the last week, the bitcoin price has been able to clear multiple important levels. These include the 50 and 100-day moving averages, solidifying the bullish trend in the short term. However, while the digital asset is still bullish for the short term, there could be more bad news over the long term. Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes One important technical level that BTC is yet to clear is the 200-day moving average. This is perhaps one of the most important indicators if the digital asset is to continue its upward rally into the next few months. It is currently sitting at $22,738, which means another 5% move upward from its current price could bring BTC toe to toe with this indicator. If bitcoin clears this, selling pressure will likely decline as more investors try to get into the asset. This would lead to a test of the $22,400 resistance level, one that would be easily beaten as long as there is no slowdown in decline. In the end, bitcoin’s performance over the long term will depend on its ability to move enough to beat the 200-day MA.

42411256,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVzg,1674082009,"World Leaders Warmed to Blockchain at Davos This Year, Despite Crypto Winter","Hey folks. I’m in Davos, Switzerland, through the rest of this week covering the World Economic Forum’s annual conference and the crypto panels held adjacent to the main event. Feel free to reach out on Telegram if you’re here.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Crypto winter  The narrative  The World Economic Forum is holding its latest annual meeting in snowy Davos, Switzerland, back in its normal time slot after a few years of coronavirus pandemic chaos. And just like last year, the 2023 conference features its share of crypto companies and mini conferences.  Why it matters  Crypto being here isn’t really a surprise. What is a surprise is just how the industry almost seems to be doubling down on its presence, holding as many panels and conferences as it did last year. While there are signs of the bear market – there aren’t nearly as many ads or crypto houses – those who are here are here in force.  Breaking it down  Crypto’s presence is less conspicuous in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2023 than it was in May 2022. That’s understandable. May 2022 was before the dark times. Before the bankruptcies and collapses and discovery that perhaps every company just lending the same pile of cryptos to each other may have been a bad thing.  Despite all that, the industry representatives are here in force. Multiple companies and groups are holding their own mini-conferences alongside the main WEF sessions. It’s at the point where, even though I’m here with my colleagues Sandali Handagama and Jack Schickler, there aren’t nearly enough of us to actually cover the different panels.  The groups that are here – the Global Blockchain Business Consortium, Casper Labs, Circle, the Filecoin Foundation, 1inch – are varying their offerings as well. United Nations representatives, Commodity Futures Trading Commission officials and lawmakers from different countries are all here for the crypto conferences.  It’s a far cry from your usual crypto leaders and startup founders (not that they’re not also present, just that it makes for a bit of a change).  I already wrote at length about how crypto has been represented at Davos in this CoinDesk article here, so I’m just going to refer you to that article.  However, to conclude today’s edition, I’m going to just throw down some thoughts and comments, which didn’t make it into the main article:This is apparently the first year a winter lake by Davos didn’t freeze over. It’s also surprisingly warm here so far, compared to what it should feel like. This isn’t a crypto comment, but given we live on this planet it seems worth noting.  There are some seriously interesting panels happening. What’s really surprised me is the fact that there are so many government and international agency officials speaking at the crypto-specific events.  Some 2,700 world leaders and their staffs are supposed to be in attendance, according to a WEF press release.  I’ve sat in on a number of discussions so far. FTX has obviously come up a number of times but panels are seemingly trying to move past it to address other aspects of the industry at present.  I moderated a panel for 1inch wherein we came close to the conclusion that the cryptocurrency industry is driving the growing dollarization of the world. I want to revisit this more in depth at a future date.  You can read Sandali and Jack’s day two wrap-up here.  One in three  That’s how many members of Congress received money from an FTX executive by way of direct donations. CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton, Cheyenne Ligon and Elizabeth Napolitano identified 196 sitting Senators and Representatives who received donations, reaching out to all 196. Just over 50 responded, explaining what they were doing with the funds.  The donations may be subject to clawbacks, even if the lawmakers who received the funds chose to donate them to charity or elsewhere.  This is an excellent investigation that is well worth your time.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) The Post notes that the crypto industry’s presence in Davos is focused – at least in part – on rehabilitating its image post-FTX.

In fact, bulls have the entire history of BTCUSD price action to prove that the Relative Strength Index reaching such highs have led to the greatest sustained gains in crypto. Bull markets are characterized by recurring phases of extreme RSI readings. Bull markets also end at such extremes, but typically only after at least a series of three waves. Bear market peaks, throughout the entire lifetime of BTCUSD price action, always fail to reach such highly elevated RSI. The Relative Strength Index was created by developed by J. Welles Wilder – who also developed the Parabolic SAR, Average Directional Index, and Average True. The technical tool measures the speed of the change of price movements.

Such fast and strong moves tend to appear more often in a bull market than a bear market. Cryptocurrencies can remain notoriously overbought during periods of FOMO. Is that exactly what we’ve seen in Bitcoin recently? And will the number one cryptocurrency by market cap rip higher, or ultimately see a rejection here due to such overbought conditions?

42414631,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCgk9,1674079565,Crypto Markets Today: Bitcoin Falls Below $21K; Genesis Nears Bankruptcy Filing; Bitzlato Founder Arrested,"Genesis Global Capital, the institutional crypto brokerage whose lending unit halted customer withdrawals in the aftermath of FTX's failure, is laying the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing, according to reports.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bloomberg reported Genesis is in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups, with the company warning it could seek bankruptcy protection if it fails to raise capital.  The Block reported Genesis was in talks with creditors about a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, which would mean the two sides coming to a restructuring agreement prior to any filing. The deal would then become final in bankruptcy court.  Since the collapse and bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX in November, Genesis had been scrambling to raise fresh capital or reach a deal with creditors.  The company's institutional lending unit had been forced to suspend redemptions and new originations as a result of the FTX implosion, and – along with parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) – had come under increasing pressure to make good on $900 million of locked deposits. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Genesis late last year retained investment bank Moelis & Company to assist with exploring options.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): Thelargest cryptocurrency by market value recently sank below $21,000, coinciding with a pending U.S. Justice Department announcement of a major international cryptocurrency enforcement action. Earlier Wednesday, BTC had reached its highest point since mid-September, trading as high as $21,602 before falling to the $20,700 level. It was down 2% for the day. Ether was recently trading down 3% to $1,532.  Equities closed down after the latest producer price index (PPI) – measured input costs from companies – suggested that inflation continued to slow in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 1.8%, while the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.  Optimism (OP): The native token of the Ethereum-based layer 2 network dropped from $1.80 to as low as $1.50 Wednesday. The token’s price recently settled back to around $1.79, down 5%. Despite the price decline, transactional activity on Optimism has steadily risen on the scaling upstart in recent weeks, crossing over rival Arbitrum’s activity, which has fallen nearly 50% since its November peak.  Shiba Inu (SHIB): SHIB surged as much as 20% earlier Wednesday, with Nansen reporting heavy trading on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. It had more recently fallen back to a 7% advance.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin’s Improving Health May Be Thanks to 'Dr. Copper'  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Bitcoin and copper are both displaying increased momentum technically. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for each are 75 and 77, respectively. Cautious technical traders will likely note that RSI readings above 70 can indicate that an asset is overpriced, and poised for a potential decline in prices.  Current readings on the Commitment of Traders (COT) report, however, offer one disconnect. The weekly COT report, showing the holdings of participants within futures markets, can provide clues about investor sentiment.  The most recent COT report shows commercial copper users are net short the asset, reflecting concerns about price declines ahead. By contrast, institutional BTC holders are net long the asset, per the most recent report.  If the correlations hold, a downturn in copper prices could be accompanied by a pause in BTC’s recent move higher.  Read the full technical take here.

Arbitrum And Optimism Win Big Per on-chain data shared on Twitter, Arbitrum, and Optimism, general-purpose Ethereum layer-2 platforms, made 2,906 ETH and 2,086ETH, respectively. In USD terms, it translates to around $4.6 million and $3.3 million for each protocol. L2s are amazing businesses Arbitrum made 2,906ETH ($4.6M) of profit in 2022 Optimism made 2,086ETH ($3.3M) of profit in 2022 pic.twitter.com/ViOkPA0Juv — Kofi (@0xKofi) January 17, 2023 Based on user activity and the number of dApps launched on Ethereum, solid statistics show that developers prefer the first smart contracting over competitors. Since launching, the network has become a hub of activity, spearheading exciting innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, metaverse, and gaming. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? Trackers in mid-January 2023 state that the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum stands at $26.88 billion, representing more than half of the assets locked across DeFi. The drop in TVL mirrors the fall in ETH prices in 2022. In essence, Ethereum dominates with DeFi activity over the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), trailing at less than a quarter of the TVL of the leading platform, at $4.65 billion. Despite this dominance, Ethereum’s scaling problem directly impacts Gas fees. As demand picks up, Gas fees fluctuate, leading to as much as $50 on this blockchain to post a simple transaction. Deploying smart contracts cost much more, sometimes upwards of $80, when the network is congested. As an illustration, the average transaction fees on Ethereum stood at $0.63 on January 17. However, on May 1, 2022, this figure stood at over $23. Related Reading: Ethereum Layer-2 Platform, ZKSync, Releases New SDK in Swift Ethereum layer-2 protocols are part of the scaling attempts made by developers to relieve the mainnet. By routing transactions off-chain, layer-2 solutions can help scale Ethereum but, most importantly, reduce Gas fees by several magnitudes. In Ethereum’s layer-2 realm, Arbitrum and Optimism dominate. According to L2Beat statistics, Arbitrum and Optimism had TVLs of $2.52 billion and $1.45 billion, with a market share of 52% and roughly 30%, respectively. Riding on Network Effects Although associated fees in Arbitrum, Optimism, and all other layer-2 networks are negligibly low, these protocols can profit based on activity. For every transfer or smart contract execution of Arbitrum and Optimism, there is an associated fee. Arbitrum and Optimism charge $0.11 and $0.23 for simple transfers, payable in ETH. If a smart contract is deployed, the fees rise to $0.30 and $0.35. They make more fees as more users deploy smart contracts or initiate transfers. Accumulating these amounts over months translate to a tidy profit for the protocol operator. In 2022, Ethereum layer-2 TVL fell roughly 40% from $7.45 billion to $3.3 billion in July 2022. Outflows were lower compared to layer-1 DeFi. As the market recovers, layer-2 operators may likely post higher revenue as users move assets to dApps launched on these scalable and low-fee protocols.

42411254,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVmS,1674078022,Crypto Technology’s Impact Goes Beyond Crypto Technology,"After the drama punctuated by doldrums (or is it the other way around?) of 2022, many of us glass-half-full types have been welcoming the opportunity to focus less on market moves and more on the impact that the continued development of crypto technology can have on the world. And it’s potentially a pretty big impact, nothing less than the spreading of economic opportunity and individual empowerment while rewiring finance and culture, so it certainly deserves more attention.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  When we talk about focusing on technology, we generally mean ways to store and distribute information on networks with varying degrees of decentralization, which in turn will power new forms of engagement and economic activity. What is still largely overlooked is the potential that crypto technology has to support innovation in other areas of development. That impact will be felt well beyond blockchains, finance and culture.  The root of this influence lies in crypto markets. This may sound surprising given the devastating losses, bad actors, painful exploits and regulatory clampdowns defining the markets of recent months. It may also appear incongruous given the “institutionalization” of market experimentation, with banks and official organizations testing familiar forms of issuance with new types of settlement – hardly the technology boost I’m referring to.  To pull on this thread a bit more, I need to take a step back in time.  Newcomers to the manic world of crypto markets may not be aware of their origin. The first peer-to-peer crypto trades were done on what were essentially online bulletin boards – low cost, easy to spin up, with a high degree of trust required. These evolved as demand grew, but early iterations were still rudimentary, uncoordinated and making it up as they went along. Then they started to get more sophisticated, especially as professional investors got interested, and today they are a complex amalgam of services, structures and best practices designed to support a considerable flow of funds throughout the system.  They are not nearly as complicated as traditional exchanges, however. In part it’s due to simplified settlement and storage. In part it’s because while tendrils now extend into traditional finance, crypto platforms still operate largely in a niche area that regulators have yet to fence off with volumes of rules. What’s more, they are easier to spin up in a variety of configurations, such as centralized order book, decentralized liquidity pool or an as-yet-untested new structure. That relative flexibility, not enjoyed by traditional exchanges, is one of the crypto ecosystem’s superpowers.  It does introduce risks: The often-lamentable lack of transparency of platform operators, the absence of regulatory protection, hacks as well as code errors are just some that come to mind. But as familiarity grows, technological solutions improve, interfaces evolve and regulators start paying more attention, many of these can be mitigated. Innovation is about focusing on potential while implementing safeguards – and here is where the flexible structure of crypto markets comes in.  The relative ease with which blockchain-based protocols and applications can raise funds by creating tokens and distributing them to users and/or investors is by now well-known. “Initial coin offerings” (ICO) drove the hype bubble of 2017, with harsh lessons learned in the subsequent shake-out. Since then, however, tokens have often worked in tandem with equity stakes to kick-start or boost economic activity on new layer 1 blockchains, decentralized applications and creative initiatives.  Blockchain-based fundraising for blockchain-based projects: we get that. What we are overlooking, though, is the potential crypto has to support fundraising and engagement for other, unrelated technologies, and what’s more, it can do so almost anywhere given crypto market structure flexibility.  Imagine this:  A regional bank in Luanda sets up a platform that tokenizes tranches of loans to startups aiming to bring digital efficiency to Angola’s ports, mitigating lender risk by adding liquidity and thus lowering the financing costs.  An incubator in Addis Ababa works with the Ethiopian Ministry for Innovation and Technology to develop an exchange for the trading of equity-like tokens issued by exiting startups with ideas ranging from vertical farms to satellite launch sites.  A venture fund in Accra collaborates with the Ghanaian stock exchange to launch a crypto platform that facilitates token-based fundraising, ICO-style but with official oversight and sufficient disclosure, helping projects from telehealth to e-learning get off the ground and find a market.  Politicians across the developing world can be heard touting the importance of technology on economic growth, but few actually implement policies that move the funding needle. Raises outside the usual hubs tend to be small as pools of capital are less abundant than in the developed world and as the target demographic is often more limited in size given geographical as well as network restrictions. But this doesn’t always need to be the case. More liquid, transparent and innovative markets could kickstart regional development, especially if cross-border investment is allowed, possibly leading to tech initiatives that are global in scale.  Obviously, digital ledger platforms are not essential for this type of fundraising. Startups have been closing rounds, banks have been lending and grants have been funneled without them so far. But the transparency and immutability of public blockchains could give additional assurances to lenders, investors and startups, eventually encouraging more interest from a greater range of participants. And they are easier to spin up than traditional exchanges, lowering time- and cost-to-market.  Now, I’m not a trading systems engineer or a blockchain developer, so there are parts of this framework I’ll probably get wrong, but the rails on which the assets move already exist, and on-ramps are not as hard to design now as they were a few years ago. Platforms have emerged that essentially offer a plug-and-play back-end for exchanges, and the ecosystem has evolved to allow a degree of modularity in constructing the necessary stack of services – wallets, custody, know-your-customer, staking, tax accounting and more. The complicated part, I imagine, would be connections to banks or payment services, but the growing use of stablecoins can provide a stopgap while the market adjusts.  What of the regulators? Obviously, they’re going to want to have some say as to user protection, fund flows, foreign influence, etc. And anything new means risk, which regulators don’t like. But improved funding channels for local technologies that could boost employment, tax revenues and regional status while offering transparency as to asset distribution shouldn’t be too tough a sell, especially as governments change and/or are increasingly influenced by younger voters eager for the opportunity to work on progress. There could also be pressure from local institutions eager for a broader variety of assets with which to construct portfolios, as well as well as excitement from retail investors who do not live in more developed financial systems with more stable currencies and more readily available savings vehicles.  This is possibly naïve, because change is hard. But change is happening anyway, not just in local demographics, economic priorities and political sentiment. We are witnessing the reshaping of spheres of dependence, at a time when new tools of independence are gaining in resilience and reach. Fundraising and engagement farming examples set in areas with sophisticated financial systems will no doubt be noticed in regions searching for a new status.  They will also be encouraged by bright minds outside the typical hubs who are pushing for progress on projects that could end up contributing to human development. Crypto’s market flexibility is about much more than the ease with which tokens can be spun up, purchased and transferred – it is about facilitating economic activity in all areas.

42414659,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCgUE,1674076592,"Davos Day 3 Shows Conflicting Visions for the Metaverse, CBDCs","DAVOS, Switzerland – Conversations about blockchain on day three of Davos show architects of the metaverse are still trying to figure out what exactly it is – and regulators hinting central bank digital currencies (CBDC) could potentially do more harm than good to the global economy.  The World Economic Forum (WEF) released two reports on the metaverse on Wednesday. In an effort to encompass the broad – and at times vague – concept of the metaverse, the reports set it up as “an immersive, interoperable and synchronous digital world that will change how we interact, work and play.”  Despite the hype around the metaverse, propelled by Facebook’s transformation into Meta Platforms back in 2021, the world has yet to witness or experience anything concrete.  “It's an evolving concept. One that doesn’t have a standard definition yet,” said Cathy Li, head of media, entertainment and sport at WEF, during a Wednesday press conference.  Open-ended questions about how the metaverse should be regulated also require extensive testing, said Huda Al Hashimi, deputy minister of cabinet affairs for strategic affairs in the United Arab Emirates, at the same event.  “We also see that regulators will be acting more like referees rather than gatekeepers. And that code of conduct will actually take precedence over formulating policies,” Al Hashimi said.  Later on Wednesday, a panel heard two very different visions for the metaverse.  One came from Meta, whose Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said he believes that “one day that platform will become as important as the smartphone.”  Cox likened the metaverse he’s building to Meta’s other social media asset, Instagram, which is “focused on giving tools to creators and builders.” It will include “spaces that are self-consistent, oftentimes offered by big companies,” as well as startups and shops, he said.  He said, however, that the difficulty would be jumping from one ecosystem to another, with the ease with which you can go from, say, Wikipedia to Google Maps online, without losing coherence or connectivity. “Part of what doesn’t exist yet for the metaverse is the hyperlink,” Cox said.  Read more: Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not Out  For fellow panelist Neal Stephenson, the influential sci-fi author, it’s clear what kind of model is needed.  “It doesn’t happen unless you create an open system analogous to the early internet, [where] anyone interested can latch on to a shared protocol,” said Stephenson, who coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992 novel ""Snow Crash."" “Right now the image one has about Facebook, it’s very much a centralized top-downish organization.”  (Keen to show no hard feelings, Cox invited his co-panelist to grab a coffee after the panel; Stephenson appeared to politely decline.)  QUOTE OF THE DAY: “It’s Davos with no legs. It’s very cool.” – Nicholas Thompson, chief executive officer of The Atlantic, plugs WEF Metaverse the Global Collaboration Village.  Pros and cons of virtual fiat  Making different digital ecosystems interact was, in a different way, also a topic for central bankers, who joined with financial infrastructure bosses inside the Congress Centre to discuss central bank digital currencies.  Interoperability, as it’s known in the jargon, comes with plenty of difficulties, the discussion noted – not least as central banks don’t always trust each other. The obstacles as they apply to CBDCsare often about conflicting governance and legal systems rather than technology, South African central bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago told the panel.  The panelists’ comments suggested there’s still a long way to go in getting benefits from virtual fiat – and plenty of ways in which it could actually end up damaging the world economy.  “It is crucial that when we come up with new innovations, these can scale and these can guard against the potential cost of having digital islands,” said Javier Perez Tasso, chief executive officer of SWIFT, the messaging service used for making interbank transfers. Instead of unifying payments systems, central bank digital currencies could lead to further fragmentation, Tasso said.  There have been some limited success stories in trying out CBDCs for settlements both for interbank and retail settlements – but they have their limits. Amir Yaron, an Israeli central bank governor, spoke glowingly of a trial he’s carrying out to enable cross-border retail payments with Sweden and Norway.  But he admitted it hasn’t yet cracked the problem of anti-money laundering checks, one of the main reasons why cross-border payments using correspondent bankingcan be so slow and expensive in practice. There’s also a question about who will build any international hub – and whether it will be a grouping of central banks, the International Monetary Fund or some private-sector company that wins the prize.  Lieve Mostrey of clearinghouse Euroclear, which is also taking part in a trial to tokenize government bonds with the French central bank, warned there were costs to such experiments involving instantaneous payments such as potential liquidity losses that could end up delaying trades, especially if the transition to any new system isn’t smooth. “It's about interoperability,” Mostrey said. “If we don't get that right, I think migration simply becomes impossible.”  Read more: Blockchain’s Non-Crypto Applications Take Center Stage on Davos Day 2",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Jack Schickler, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/18/davos-day-3-shows-conflicting-visions-for-the-metaverse-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9a23a78f4c71b5644f7ee71948b84d4e8cb8fe1-3835x2801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414623,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCg90,1674076104,MakerDAO Favors Holding GUSD Stablecoin as Part of Reserve in Early Voting,"Decentralized finance giant MakerDAO's community was heavily favoring keeping Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin as part of Maker’s reserve. The ongoing vote is testing confidence in Gemini, the Winklevoss-founded exchange that has been swept up in recent crypto contagion.  Voters are casting votes whether to keep the GUSD ceiling at the current $500 million, to decrease it to $100 million or to zero, which would boot GUSD from the reserve, according to Maker’s governance site.  At press time, 69% of the votes favored keeping the GUSD ceiling intact at $500 million, while 31% voted for dropping GUSD to zero. The final result may change; the voting ends Thursday (Jan. 19) at 16:15 UTC.  The Maker protocol is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in which holders of the protocol’s governance token, maker (MKR), can vote on proposals. Currently, MakerDAO holds $489 million in GUSD in its Peg Stability Module (PSM) facility, which acts as a reserve system with $7 billion of assets to back its DAI stableoin’s value and price peg to the dollar.  Starting in October, Gemini has been paying a 1.25% annual yield to Maker on GUSD holdings based on an earlier agreement.  The voting comes as Gemini, the issuer of GUSD, is under pressure after halting withdrawals from its yield-paying product, called Gemini Earn, and because of a lawsuit by the top U.S. securities regulator. Gemini is the brainchild of mega-crypto investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who still helm the company.  Crypto investors worry that Gemini’s woes may destabilize its GUSD stablecoin, roiling Maker’s $5 billion DAI.  “Recent MakerDAO governance discussions have raised concerns about GUSD’s heavy reliance on the PSM and Gemini holding GUSD reserves at Silvergate,” Riyad Carey, analyst of digital asset research firm Kaiko, wrote in a report earlier this month.  Currently, MakerDAO holds some 85% of all GUSD in circulation, making Gemini’s stablecoin overwhelmingly reliant on its relationship with MakerDAO.  Additionally, concerns loom about GUSD’s value being partly backed by cash held at Silvergate Capital (SI), the embattled crypto-friendly bank that has suffered in the fallout from last year’s various crypto debacles, most notably FTX’s demise. The bank’s shares lost 88% of their value in the past year on the New York Stock Exchange.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Gemini Trust and major crypto lender Genesis Global Capital sold unregistered securities to customers through the Gemini Earn program. (CoinDesk and Genesis are owned by the same parent company, DCG.)  Users’ assets in the Earn program are locked up at the moment, after Genesis’ lending arm, which powered Gemini Earn, suspended customer withdrawals in November as FTX collapsed. The withdrawal freeze has led to scuffling between the two firms. According to recent reports, Genesis is laying groundwork with its creditors for a bankruptcy filing.  GUSD was an integral part of Gemini’s Earn program, offering as high as 8% annual yield for investors depositing GUSD, according to Kaiko.  Read more: Crypto Exchange Gemini Suffers $485M Rush of Outflows Amid Contagion Fears  “Holding GUSD is akin to holding GUSD’s underlying assets with additional risk related to Gemini,” Carey said. “It seems possible that the community may opt to move on from GUSD in favor of new pilot projects,” he wrote at the time.  The “worst-case scenario” for GUSD would be Gemini’s troubles forcing a delay in GUSD redemptions and causing a temporary deviation from its dollar peg, according to Carey. However, “even a significant depegging would be unlikely to rattle DAI,” he added.",NEUTRAL,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MKR,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/18/makerdao-favors-holding-gusd-stablecoin-as-part-of-reserve-in-early-voting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/038c00a9bf1f3811372ebc93d996264ebec92f50-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Saw The Most Returns During Asian Trading Hours As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, Asian trading hours saw positive cumulative BTC returns of around 16% between November 27 and January 15. The report defines the three principal trading hours: between 0 to 8 Central European Time (CET) for Asian hours, 8-16 CET for European, and 16-24 for the US. Here is a chart that shows the cumulative returns that Bitcoin got during each of these trading hours since 27 November: The value of the metric seems to have been the lowest for Europe | Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 17 As shown above, Bitcoin has seen chiefly positive returns during Asian trading hours between 27 November and 15 January. This would suggest that traders in Asia have been participating in net buying throughout this period. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Outperform Bitcoin, Small Caps Lead Market The US trading hours mostly saw consolidation in this timespan, implying that activity might have been at a standstill. BTC’s returns were also negative at the end of the year during these hours, while they always remained positive during Asian hours. There was one exception. However, the market reacted strongly to the CPI news last week, and BTC observed gains. Bitcoin’s cumulative returns stand at 10% in the green during US hours, while they stand at 16% for Asian hours. European hours also mostly saw sideways movement, with BTC remaining at slight negative returns through most of the period, until the recent surge, which also saw buying during this time zone. Still, this uplift was enough to bring the crypto back to neutral returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Exchanges Drop By 44%, Could This Fuel More BTC Rally? This means that most of BTC’s recent profits came during the Asian hours, with US participants only pushing the price in last week’s CPI surge, while European traders were mainly irrelevant for the coin. An exciting trend appears in the correlation between Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures for each time zone. The “correlation” here refers to a measurement of how closely the price of BTC has been following changes in Nasdaq futures.

However, even so, it would appear that there is some relevant correlation during US trading hours still present. This means price action tends to follow Nasdaq futures in this time zone. In Asian and European trading hours, however, the indicator’s value has consistently remained low this month so far.

At the risk of offending their crypto employers, Goldsmith Romero said the experienced hands – also including the investment firms backing these companies – “need to step up, and call for compliance, controls and other governance, without allowing the promise of riches and the company’s marketing pitch to silence their objections to obvious deficiencies.”  “FTX operated in a manner that simply should not be possible in the presence of appropriate independent governance and gatekeepers, even in an unregulated environment,” she said in remarks prepared for delivery Wednesday at an event examining the FTX bankruptcy, hosted by the Wharton School and the University of Pennsylvania’s Law School. “Gatekeepers should have seriously questioned the operational environment at FTX in the lead up to its meltdown.”  Goldsmith Romero, a Democratic appointee who is the lead commissioner for the agency’s technology advisory committee, has previously warned about the potential risks from the largely unregulated industry.  “There is no shortage of lawyers working for unregulated crypto companies, including former federal government lawyers,” she said Wednesday. One of FTX’s most prominent names was Mark Wetjen, a former CFTC commissioner and acting agency chairman.  Her lengthy remarks also called for a total separation of customer funds from a company’s own assets. That should be part of any future congressional legislation, she said, in addition to better controls on conflicts of interest with companies’ insiders and affiliates, strong cybersecurity demands and wide application of the Bank Secrecy Act that guards against money laundering.  “The crypto industry should not wait for legislation,” she said.

42393861,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb0EH,1674074806,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin’s Improving Health May Be Thanks to 'Dr. Copper',"Bitcoin’s (BTC) correlation to copper has reached highs last seen in June.  The increased correlation implies that bitcoin (and ether as well) are aligning with rosier expectations for the U.S. economy, and that the current price surge may continue.  Copper is a widely watched measure of economic health because of its wide range of uses across numerous economic sectors. It is often called ""Dr. Copper"" for its professorial ability to forecast trends  The on-again, off-again relationship over the most recent 12 months pivoted on Jan. 6 from a correlation coefficient of 0.09 to its current coefficient of 0.90. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with the former implying an inverse price relationship and the latter implying the opposite.  Both assets traded higher at different points Wednesday, following better-than-expected economic data.  The producer price index (PPI) for December fell 0.5% versus expectations for a 0.1% decrease. The decline was the largest monthly drop since April 2020 and highlights a gradual slowing of inflationary pressures. Food prices declined 1.2%, the largest monthly decline in over a year.  Also of note is BTC’s 0.91 correlation to gold and its -0.83 correlation to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The confluence of all three implies that markets are anticipating a slowing of monetary tightening and that economic expansion will bring BTC along for the ride.  Bitcoin and copper are both displaying increased momentum technically. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for each are 75 and 77, respectively. Cautious technical traders will likely note that RSI readings above 70 can indicate that an asset is overpriced, and poised for a potential decline in prices.  Current readings on the Commitment of Traders (COT) report, however, offer one disconnect. The weekly COT report, showing the holdings of participants within futures markets, can provide clues about investor sentiment.  The most recent COT report shows commercial copper users are net short the asset, reflecting concerns about price declines ahead. By contrast, institutional BTC holders are net long the asset, per the most recent report.  If the correlations hold, a downturn in copper prices could be accompanied by a pause in BTC’s recent move higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/18/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoins-improving-health-may-be-thanks-to-dr-copper,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/633993944da2eaa4b4471a53c3bb9e6ee307426f-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414632,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCgpS,1674074283,"Lido’s Total Value Locked Spiked 33% In Past Month, Becoming Largest DeFi Protocol by TVL, Says DeFiLlama","The forerunner of the liquid staking derivatives market, Lido became the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) app by total value locked (TVL) earlier this month, surpassing MakerDAO.  Lido’s claim to the throne comes after a period of steady growth for the staking-as-a-service provider. In just the last month its TVL has spiked 33% at press time, according to data from DeFiLlama.  Users have locked $7.8 billion on Lido. The vast majority of that sum comes from Ethereum, with smaller amounts from other blockchains, including Solana.  Interest in liquid staking protocols has swelled in 2023 as governance tokens for these protocols have surged in price. For example, since Dec. 31 to now, the price of LDO has jumped 108% to $2.01, while its average 24-hour volume rose 802%, per CoinGecko. Holders of LDO have a say in how the protocol is managed, from setting fees to assigning node operators.  The present attention and popularity of liquid staking protocols has prompted a narrative in the crypto community marked by users’ excitement and elevated willingness to learn about these liquid staking protocols. Lido Finance Chief Marketing Officer Vladimir Belugin said to CoinDesk ""The attention being paid to liquid staking is a positive development, with more people coming to understand the benefits and access provided by liquid staking protocols.""  Lido has been able to gain momentum for its TVL, a popular indicator of the health and interest of the app.  Lido’s TVL dropped from $20.4 billion in April 2022 to as low as $4.2 billion two months later following the collapse of Terra, but its TVL has grown rapidly in 2023. Lido’s TVL increased in the past seven days and month by 20.02% and 33.13%, respectively, allowing Lido to claim the top rank in DeFi protocols by TVL for the first time.  Lido’s recent climb comes ahead of the Ethereum blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade, the first hard fork since the Merge in September. Set for March, Shanghai will notably allow ETH stakers to withdraw their tokens, which are currently locked on the Ethereum network.  Belugin added, ""The run-up to the Shanghai Upgrade has definitely brought with it increased interest in liquid staking. By allowing for withdrawals, the Beacon Chain de-risks liquid staking thereby opening it up to a wider set of stakers with lower-risk appetites. Lido has already seen an increase in interest, which is partially reflected in our increase in TVL.""  With 20 active developers per Token Terminal, Lido has become the most popular liquid staking protocol, commanding a 29% share of the total ETH staked on Ethereum, according to data from Etherscan.  Ethereum’s current proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism doesn’t rely on miners to write and authenticate transactions, but validators who stake ETH for a chance to validate transactions to Ethereum’s ledger. Lido, as a staking-as-a-service provider, allows users to deposit any number of ETH to earn staking rewards. Lido’s APR currently stands at 5.2% on Ethereum.  stETH Token  In return for staking ETH via Lido, Lido issues stETH, a derivative token that represents the combined value of the user’s initial deposit plus accrued interest. According to Nansen, more than 86,000 unique addresses hold stETH.  Currently, 90.12% of total stETH tokens have been sitting in wallets for at least 90 days.

Speaking to CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” from the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland, Scaramucci said long-term crypto investors need to keep a three- to five-year outlook and not dwell on day-to-day performance.  “I’m encouraging people to invest now,” Scaramucci said. “We’re closer to a bottom than we are to another top.”  Scaramucci’s firm, which has $2.2 billion in assets under management, had a $45 million tie to failed crypto exchange FTX when founder Sam Bankman-Fried bought an estimated 30% stake.According to Scaramucci, SkyBridge then bought $10 million worth of FTX’s native token, FTT, which it later sold at an estimated $9.6 million loss. He did not say when the FTT was sold.  Skybridge is now considering whether to buy back its shares from the failed FTX. Scaramucci said he hopes his company will hope to do that “by the middle of this year,” even though he said Bankman-Fried “never affected the way the [SkyBridge] business was run.”  While FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings continue, Scaramucci said his company is “not doing anything but moving forward.” Although Bankman-Fried turned “out to be a fraud,” Scaramucci said he isn't going to blame him for the “woes of SkyBridge or the cryptocurrency markets.”  History “may not repeat itself exactly, but you and I both know that it rhymes. And there are no new stories. They're just remixes of past stories,” he said.  Nonetheless, Scaramucci said he is “very optimistic about the cryptocurrency space.”  “We’re very bullish,” Scaramucci said. “I don’t think you can predict these markets [in the] short term.”  Read more: Scaramucci Says Investment Firm SkyBridge Is Exploring Buying Back Equity From FTX",POSITIVE,FTT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FTT,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/18/skybridge-capital-founder-the-time-to-invest-in-crypto-is-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fde3d740ca264ce0873ddfc64e8e00998c716aa2-2876x1540.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With institutional investors and whales engaged in trading activities, the crypto market is experiencing a revival. Chainlink has enjoyed a resurgence this week with an increase in its price and trading volume. The network has also recorded a massive increase in trading volume today at 30.64%. The coin is now ranked number 21 on the list of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity? What Is Behind The Rally? The Chainlink network has added some notable projects to its catalog. The total value of transactions, its oracle service, exceeded $6.9 trillion. Also, the network provided users with data feeds that extend across new blockchains and layer 2. Another innovation driving the price is the Chainlink proof of reserve. The collapse of FTX created distrust in the industry. This distrust prompted the increased demand for Proof of Reserves. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve has become popular among stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide their customers with transparency. The adoption has also aided the LINK price increase. Also, the launch of Web3 solution Chainlink Economics 2.0 has created a framework for the network’s core interests; Chainlink BUILD, SCALE, and Staking. Chainlink’s BUILD and SCALE enable users to build Web3 dApps. Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink’s co-founder, stated that the crisis in traditional finance creates opportunities for blockchain technology to fortify crypto as an alternative financial system. Chainlink Price Prediction Chainlink LINK has enjoyed a positive rally in the past week. The asset is currently trading at $6.50 as it approaches the $7 mark. The support levels are $6.27, $6.44, and $6.64, while the resistance levels are $7.01, $7.18, and $7.37. LINK is close to its first resistance level, but the uptrend might pull back as the bearish candles begin to form on the chart. The asset is currently above its 50-day Simple Moving average and approaching its 200-day SMA. This suggests bullish momentum for LINK in the short term. However, expect a pullback before it continues its surge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 65.73 is slightly into the buy zone but not in the overbought region. It reflects the current market condition as the bears struggle to push down the asset’s price. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is above its signal line and shows divergence, which is a bullish signal.

42411245,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVIh,1674071591,"In Davos, Blockchain Yields More Promises Than Problems","About half of the estimated 500 companies attending the 2023 annual World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, are technology companies and startups. You see them stretching out over the Promenade – the main street running through the city center where all the action happens. The showcases are demoing products and services in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), robotics, 3D printing and the Internet of Things (IoT), offering a taste of the latest and greatest to come.  One of the most notable topics being discussed – on panels, at events, over live broadcast – is the future of money. Of course, when talking about the future of money you must also mention crypto. The conversations I’ve overheard or been a part of, so far, have concerned the pragmatic (using blockchain for traceability), the political (using blockchain for anti-corruption), the futuristic (decentralized finance and the metaverse) and the hopeful (incentivizing climate action through Web3).  Advit Nath is the controller and director of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development and a regional ambassador for the Global Blockchain Business Council.  It shouldn't come as a surprise that people are talking about tech – the conversation was primed. The WEF’s recently released ""2023 Global Risk Report"" cited “technological disruption” as a top risk. With the high-profile busts of major crypto firms still fresh, there is pessimism among many in Davos about crypto.  See also: Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not Out  As well as being a tech enthusiast, my day job is working in finance and innovation for a United Nations specialized agency and international financial institution called the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which often gives me a first-hand look at how technological solutions are being applied. It’s clear, despite the recent negative headlines, that blockchain technology has more promises than problems.  It’s important to make the distinction between blockchain – the technology behind cryptocurrencies – and crypto itself. Decentralized digital currency as a concept is not going to disappear, but cryptocurrencies that are not backed by real assets in a significant way will likely not survive. We are going to see fewer industry players willing to take the financial and reputational risks of being exposed to crypto.  However, blockchain as a technology will continue to grow exponentially and its use cases expand. The real-world applications of blockchain, many already in use by organizations focused on international development, offer far greater utility and cost savings.  On a panel organized by the Global Blockchain Business Council covering the topic of “Blockchain for Public Institutions (Governments and International Organisations),” I spoke about the challenges of previous food crises across the world and how blockchain technology has and can be applied. Blockchain is already being used in development projects to increase traceability and auditability of funds from donors to farmers as well as the traceability of food, raw materials and energy in the agriculture supply chain – at a relatively low cost.  Take just one example of IFAD's Kenya cereal climate-smart agriculture (KCAP) project. Through this initiative we proved that we could trace every dollar of the $100 million project spanning 50 downstream actors by placing the information on a secure blockchain. (While we’re blockchain agnostic, the project is using a hybrid public-private, permissioned version of Ethereum, ensuring that personal data is kept secure off-chain.) This system offers near-real-time development impact results, directly from farmers.  Using blockchain in this way not only brings full transparency of the flow of funds from donors to farmers but ensures compliance through automated checks with our anti-money laundering software. Further, it enables the U.N. to automate a number of services. For instance, farmers can now speed up payments to their vendors with a click of a button on a mobile phone.  See also: This United Nations-Associated NFT Project Is Helping Fight Climate Change  Nowhere is the value and utility of crypto more apparent than in stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to keep its value pegged to a fiat currency. Stablecoins that are backed by reserves that are independently audited could be a means that cut through bureaucratic red tape and enable anyone to move money across borders in a matter of seconds.  Davos is where policy is made and world leaders meet. I like to think I’m helping to support the ongoing digital transformation by sharing stories about on-the-ground use cases of blockchain. Digital money is only becoming a more practical solution as the number of on- and off-ramps between crypto and fiat currencies increases – an easy lesson to remember when surrounded by the snow-capped Swiss mountains.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Advit Nath,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/18/in-davos-blockchain-yields-more-promises-than-problems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/061c8e873fe63c12c4b57e2a228b57773ee1e866-4624x2032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cryptocurrency losses due to hacks, exploits and scams in 2022 reached an all-time high of $3.7 billion – a 189% increase over 2021’s previous record of $1.3 billion.”  In this article we’ve rounded up the most common scams to explain what they are and how to identify them so you can protect your wealth.  1. Bitcoin scams  Bitcoin scams are nearly as old as bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency and the one with the highest market cap. Of all cryptos it is the one with the most name recognition and the broadest adoption – even traditional finance firms such as Fidelity have bitcoin as part of their offerings! Because of this, bitcoin feels “safe” to many new investors and is often the entry point to crypto.  One of the most common scams to target your bitcoin is a phishing scam. The hacker often impersonates a legitimate-sounding service, company or individual in an email or text message and tries to trick victims into revealing their private keys or fool them into sending their bitcoin to the con artist’s wallet.  Avoid getting tricked by checking any sender’s email address and making sure the sites they are linking to are legit. Often, phishing email addresses will slightly misspell a real site – i.e., Gogle.com instead of Google.com – or send you to a site that contains similar errors, such as coinbase.co instead of coinbase.com. A good habit to prevent going to malicious websites is to bookmark any legitimate sites you use for crypto and use only those bookmarks to visit those sites.  Find out more about common bitcoin scams.  2. NFT scams  Many people new to crypto are finding their way to the space through non-fungible tokens (NFT), whether through collectible sites such as NBA Top Shot, buying a colorful avatar for social media or via an NFT that also serves as a ticket for an event. Sometimes called ""digital collectibles"" by big brands including Starbucks and Instagram, there are plenty of scammers who target both newbies and old pros in the space.  One scam unique to the NFT space involves forgeries and fakes. When an NFT project, for example Bored Ape Yacht Club, begins to rise in value, scammers will target people looking to “ape” in by creating copycat collections, sometimes stealing the original art and cloning entire projects to mimic the real, valuable one. While occasionally a blue-chip project NFT gets listed (usually mistakenly) for a bargain-basement price, if you see an NFT from a project for sale at far below market rates (which you can easily check on a site like NFTpricefloor.com), chances are it’s a fake.  NFT marketplace OpenSea verifies that an artwork or collection is genuine with a blue checkmark on the listing page. You can also check past ownership and sales of an NFT. That’s the beauty of the blockchain – if an NFT seems to have appeared out of thin air long after the original mint, that’s highly suspicious because all past transactions are recorded. When in doubt, you can look for the original artist’s Twitter account and message them to ask if it is legit.  Go deeper on NFT scams.  3. Social media scams  Many crypto scams originate on social media, especially on Twitter and Instagram. According to a June 2022 report from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, “Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with an ad, post or message on a social media platform.”  From giveaway scams to fraudulent “verified” or blue-checked accounts, social media is rife with fraud. Since Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter you can no longer simply glance at a blue check after a name and be sure it’s a verified account because any Twitter Blue subscriber can pay for that mark for just $8. Before you trust any advice or ideas from what seems to be a verified account, look at their other posts, how long they’ve been active and how many followers they have. A brand-new account with few followers that seems to only be shilling crypto projects is unlikely to be trustworthy.  One scam unique to social media comes from YouTube, where people set up fake livestreams to bilk viewers out of their crypto. The scammer creates a legitimate-looking YouTube livestream, often using stolen content to boost their authority, and posts links to giveaways or other seemingly tempting content. These links can be malicious phishing attempts or simply direct you to send your crypto for the “expert” to invest. Check the history of the channel, including when it started and the other videos they’ve posted, to avoid being duped. New channel with no videos? Stay away.  Read on about five types of crypto social media scams.  4. Ponzi schemes  Many critics call crypto itself a “Ponzi scheme.” For instance, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, called crypto tokens ""decentralized Ponzi schemes” in 2022. The definition of a true Ponzi scheme, however, is a financial fraud that promises outstanding returns and does so not by actually investing the money it receives, but instead by distributing payouts to early investors with funds from more recent investors.  Crypto is a huge target for Ponzi schemes, which often rely on the “expert” having superior knowledge of a complex and new technology. The experts promise to do the hard work with your money and remove the headache of you having to learn how something like decentralized finance (DeFi) works. One of the biggest warning signs of a Ponzi scheme is “guaranteed” returns of double-digit percentages, a promise no legitimate investment can keep. All investments carry an element of risk and crypto is more volatile than traditional financial instruments. If someone is promising you huge guaranteed returns, the only thing you can guarantee about it is it’s a scam.  Read more on how to identify and avoid crypto Ponzi schemes  5. Rug pulls  Rug pulls are a type of exit scam to which DeFi and NFTs are particularly susceptible. Combine the fact that DeFi removes the intermediaries involved in financial transactions with the relative ease of creating a new token, and you’ve built an environment ripe for scammers to exploit. Fraudsters can easily create a crypto token and get it listed on a decentralized exchange (DEX) without going through any kind of code audit or another type of background check. From January to December in 2022, over 117,000 scam tokens were created, stealing billions of dollars from unsuspecting investors.  Newly listed currencies often soar in price, and eager investors may use filters like “recently added” or “top gainers” to filter for new, hot coins without doing research on the projects. Once the founders of the fraudulent crypto project feel the price has peaked, they’ll make off with investors’ money, leaving holders with a worthless coin.  In the NFT space, scammers will create entire collections that copy or knock off a well-known collection to entice susceptible buyers. Mutant Ape Planet, a fake play on the legitimate Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, defrauded buyers out of nearly $3 million, promising them rewards, access and other perks before making off with all their money.  The best way to prevent this is to do your research. Follow the steps to thoroughly evaluate any new cryptocurrency or NFT project, especially reading the white paper and looking into who are the founders. No white paper or previous record? Huge warning sign.  Keep reading about rug pulls.  6. Crypto romance scams  A scam that didn't start with crypto but has popped up as the space has grown is a long con known as a romance scam, which netted $185 million from victims, the FTC said in June 2022. The con artist sets up fake profiles on dating sites and/or social media sites to entice targets. They may “accidentally” DM you on WhatsApp or other messaging platforms as well, and then engage in conversation. Once the mark has gotten to know the victim, the fraudster will turn the conversation to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and convince the person to invest a little money in the token.  Often the sophisticated scam artist will create fake – but convincing-looking – websites as part of a pig butchering scam, fattening up the ""pig"" with small deposits and pretending the victim is netting huge returns until the person is convinced and makes a big deposit. At that point, the scammer cuts ties and makes off with the money after weeks or even months of stringing the target along.  You should be suspicious of any request from someone you haven’t met in real life, but a big, common warning sign that your cyber-sweetheart isn’t in it for love is they refuse to meet face to face or via Zoom or other video conferencing app.  Learn more about crypto romance scams.

7733642,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516582,1674068435,Solana Jumps By 23%: Will A Correction Impact The Recent Rise?,"Solana has been one of the top performers in the cryptocurrency market, with gains of over 89% in 30 days, 131% in 14 days, and 63% in 7 days. In the face of claims that the SOL network is failing, the token’s price needs a slight upward boost to gain back the support of investors. After dropping to a low of $8.01 in December, its price has increased dramatically in recent weeks and is now trading above the $20.00 level. Solana Surges After Months When Solana’s native token SOL hit a 52-week low of $8.14 on December 29, the cryptocurrency was on the edge of collapse before the end of 2022. However, the market has since turned around and is currently in its favor. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Continues To Shine With 43% Gains In Last Week The release of the first meme coin, BONK, on the blockchain in late December also contributed to the Solana price increase. The meme coin’s market cap skyrocketed to $200 million as word spread but faded to $55 million at press time. But SOL has not slowed down. SOL has to close higher than the 200-day simple moving average of $27.59 and exponential moving average of $30.25 to confirm this trend change. However, this close could signal continued positive momentum and set the stage for higher prices. Although the RSI has moved into the bullish momentum at 73, the MACD is still well above its optimum values. So, it lends credence to the idea that another surge is possible. The on-balance volume (OBV) has also increased dramatically since the January rally began, reaching a high not seen since July-August 2022. The OBV going up before a breakout is standard, but all other indicators must still hold steady. According to CoinMarketCap, the market valuation for SOL was $8.62 billion as of 18 January, when it was trading at $23.25 on a 24-hour volume of $902 million. The price of SOL has risen by more than 200% from its low point on December 18. Solana Catching The Positive Trend To establish this trend change, SOL has to close above the $27.59 and $30.25 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages. However, with such a close, positive momentum appears bullish, which might lead to more price appreciation. According to Coincodex’s technical analysis, the price of SOL will drop during the next few days, hitting $18.29 on February 1st. It would represent a 20% reduction from current levels.

42411040,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBDpU,1674067992,Top 10 Challenges for Web2 Developers Entering Web3,"Like many emerging technologies, there’s a growing need for developers to build out Web3. For traditional Web2 developers, this could be an exciting opportunity to learn a new skill and advance in your career.  Web3 developers have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the web, but the path to becoming one isn’t always easy. In this article, we’ll look at some of the top challenges for Web2 developers entering Web3 and how to overcome them.  1. Shifting to a Web3 mindset  Building Web3 requires a paradigm shift when it comes to how you think of the internet. Web3 is best understood as the “read/write/own” phase of the internet. In a user-owned version of the internet, data is retained by users, who can move their “profiles” interoperably across different platforms. Web3 developers build user-owned projects that favor community governance over corporate governance structures.  2. Understanding smart contracts  For Web2 developers, understanding and learning to work with smart contracts can be an initial hurdle to entering Web3. Smart contracts are tools that automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without requiring the help of an intermediary company or entity. Smart contracts are immutable, and data sent and stored on smart contracts can’t be erased.  3. Forgetting personal data  In Web2, personal data is often controlled by major tech companies and used to identify users, modify experiences and sell ads. In Web3, personal data is controlled by the user. Particularly in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 payment apps, developers can initially struggle with working in an environment that doesn’t utilize personal data. Instead, developers need to be accustomed to only using on-chain and wallet-based information to build solutions.  4. Learning Web3 coding languages  While front-end developers will likely find familiar programming languages in Web3, the nature of blockchains has resulted in the rise of Web3-specific languages for protocols and smart contracts. Languages such as Solidity and Rust are high-level, object-oriented programming languages that are Turing-complete and are compiled rather than interpreted. Although it may be initially difficult to pick up new languages, learning Solidity or Rust will open a wide range of opportunities for developers looking to work in Web3 development.  5. Building open source  If you’re developing for a Web3 project, you’re most likely building in an open-source environment. Web3 developers should have a strong understanding of working in Github and using communication tools for decentralized teams like Discord. Because open-source projects are designed to provide free access for everyone, it’s important to also follow best practices for commenting and documentation. Additionally, it’s important to consider that open-source code is also available to bad actors, so potential vulnerabilities should be monitored.  6. Keeping up with rapidly emerging technology  With Web3 innovation continuing to move at a rapid pace, keeping up with developments can help you stay ahead of the game. Staying up to date with crypto news, following online forum discussions and actively participating in governance can help you avoid being left behind as a Web3 developer.  7. Planning for interoperability  While you may design a Web2 app for mobile or desktop users the user’s access to the project will be the same, regardless of how it is formatted. In the current stage of Web3, however, projects need to decide which blockchain best works for a project and build from there. With a wide range of public, smart contract-enabled blockchains on the market today, Web3 developers should understand their differences and think about how to best bring a project to a wider audience. Whether it’s building for Ethereum, EVM-compatible, or non-EVM blockchains, understanding and planning for interoperability can help develop a Web3 mindset for a more open and connected internet.  8. Building in public  Building in public requires developers to become comfortable with sharing their code and ideas with the world. While many Web2 developers are more familiar with working alongside a small team, Web3 development is borderless and requires communicating your ideas potentially across the world. Web3 developers should be comfortable reaching out to mentors and working with a developer community to get feedback and support.  9. Ignoring volatility  All markets have their ups and downs, and the crypto market is no exception. Volatility is common in the crypto market and should be expected as you enter into this space. However, it’s important to remember that your work is not tied to the price of any particular asset. Working, even despite market downturns, can set you up for long-term success. Following daily market movements will only add unneeded stress to your life and make it difficult to remain focused on building.  10. Telling your coworkers you’re moving to Web3  Finally, many have found it challenging to explain to coworkers and colleagues that they have left their Web2 job to go work in Web3. Web3 hasn’t quite reached mainstream adoption, and those who aren’t familiar may be surprised to hear you're leaving a traditional development role for one in Web3. The best way to overcome this hurdle is through education. To help those who are skeptical about crypto and Web3, it’s important to be able to explain the benefits of this new technology as well as potential risks. Through your journey into Web3 you can use the knowledge you’ve accumulated to help better educate those around you, and hopefully inspire the next round of developers to make the switch into Web3.

Binance, which is the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has come under scrutiny after accounting firm Mazars retracted the company’s “proof-of-reserves” report, which sought to verify the exchange’s holdings.  Last week, Binance admitted that its stablecoin, BUSD, wasn’t always fully backed with reserves.  In the Davos' speech, Zhao reiterated his belief that the development of crypto as a new default payments system has to be gradual and that the concept behind the technology won’t be erased.  “We actually need to proceed slowly and carefully and steadily, so that we don't cause major disruptions,” he said. “It’s not about any single coin, blockchain or exchange, it’s the fundamental technology that’s being evolved and will continue to evolve.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/18/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-says-many-crypto-players-get-distracted-by-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f66179d48586a2c1251055c8ff13a008ffbd7104-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rick McCracken, the owner of the ADA staking pool, DIGI, and also a Cardano supporter, did not hesitate to make his findings and prediction known via his Twitter handle. Recall there was an announcement earlier on Djed’s official Twitter handle on January 14, affirming that the stablecoin’s launch this month remains on track. Furthermore, as per COTI Network’s announcement on January 5, the soon-to-launch stablecoin bagged a new partnership with Yepple Incorporated. Related Reading: Optimism Sees Spike In USDC And USDT Transactions Eclipsing $1 Billion The partnership aims to ensure optimal usage of Djed in the Cardano ecosystem. It would also promote the integration of the payment for NFT transactions using Djed. Djed To Go Live Along With New Stablecoin Payment App, DjedPay Djed is Cardano’s first ADA-backed stablecoin powered by COTI Network. It is an over-centralized stablecoin with a collateral rate between 400-800%, according to the description on adapulse.io. According to the CEO of the COTI Network, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, in addition to ADA backing, Djed will also have another token to protect it against exposure to ADA’s volatility. SHEN would act as the stablecoin’s reserve currency, maintaining its price stability to ensure the 400-800% collateral guarantee against price fluctuations. The stablecoin’s testnet version was initially launched in December 2022. Djed’s official website revealed that its value is currently 2.94 ADA, with a supply of 676,496 tokens. McCracken’s prediction of the mainnet launch goes in line with the developers’ initial announcement. According to them, Djed would go live on the mainnet later in January. McCracken also revealed the new Djed stablecoin is now worth $1.019 on the test network. In addition to the mainnet launch, a payment platform for Djed called DjedPay would launch at the same time. According to the official Twitter announcement, DjedPay is a platform that would offer Djed-powered payments by traders and organizations. However, COTI is still trying to secure more partnerships to scale the stablecoins algorithmic adoption. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains?

Cardano Releases New ADA Wallet Update In another development, the ADA community recently saw a new upgrade in Cardano’s Daedalus wallet, Daedalus 5.2.0. Input Output Global (IOG), the company behind Cardano, announced the launch of Daedalus 5.2.0 via a tweet on January 16. Daedalus wallet is the official desktop wallet for ADA developed by IOG. The new wallet version is compatible with Cardano node version 1.35.4 and wallet version 2022.12.14. The release of Daedalus 5.2.0 automatically updates the ProjectCatalyst API URL to a new URL. Also, the upgrade included Bryon Wallet tracking capability and aggregates of similar RAM sizes to allow for swift data analysis. Furthermore, Cardano’s Bryon era (the first phase on the Cardano Roadmap) received a delivery of the Daedalus wallet and Yoroi wallet.

Rarible co-founder Alexander Salnikov told CoinDesk that it made sense to expand its service to Polygon, which has branded itself as a ""funnel"" for Web2 brands looking to jump into Web3.  “We are bullish on Polygon,” said Salnikov. “We're bullish on creators that want to take ownership of their assets and ownership of the contract.”  In August 2022, Rarible launched its first marketplace builder tool for collections on Ethereum. Later in October, the platform introduced major upgrades to its marketplace, including a new aggregation tool that pulls NFT listings from across competitor marketplaces. It also established plans to airdrop RARI, the governance token behind the platform’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Bitzlato, a Hong Kong-based platform, has been effectively shut down, and founder Anatoly Legkodymov was taken into U.S. custody, moves that will stop Bitzlato from catering to criminals tied to Russia, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the press conference. She outlined the coordinated enforcement actions, which also included the Federal Bureau of Investigation, French authorities and the U.S. Treasury Department, saying they disrupted ""a busy corner of this criminal ecosystem.""  The Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) formally labeled the company a “primary money-laundering concern,” which is among the most serious sanctions in the government’s criminal-fighting arsenal because it usually cuts off a business off from the global financial system.  The label effectively declares the exchange ""an international pariah,"" Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said.  Legkodymov is a Russian citizen and majority owner of Bitzlato who was living in China. After his arrest, he was scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  The little-known cryptocurrency exchange offered peer-to-peer services and hosted wallets of criminals buying and selling illegal goods, according to Justice Department officials, involving $700 million in direct and indirect transfers in the last several years. FinCEN said the company played a key role in handling illicit transactions for ransomware actors in Russia, including those connected to the Russian government.  The crackdown against Bitzlato was the most significant U.S. action against a crypto criminal network to date, Monaco said.  The company, whose servers have been seized, was also tied to routine transactions with the Russian-based Hydra Market, a darknet market targeted by U.S. authorities last year. Monaco said the ""Hydra-Bitzlato crypto-crime axis"" is now shut down.  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.  UPDATE (Jan. 18, 2023, 17:44 UTC): Adds more details about the accusations and sanctions.

This has resulted in one of the sharpest drops in the percent of BTC supply left on centralized exchanges. Bitco In a new report by on-chain data aggregator Santiment, the bitcoin held on exchanges has witnessed one of the sharpest declines in history. In January 2022, the BTC held on exchanges accounted for around 11.85% of the total supply, but now, a year later, it has dropped to just 6.65% of the supply left on exchanges. Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes This is a result of the increasing distrust of centralized exchanges following the collapse of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges at the time. Self-custody gained more prominence when the exchange filed for bankruptcy, prompting more supply than normal to flow out of exchanges. Over time, some exchanges have been hit harder than others when it comes to withdrawals. A lot of this depends on the amount of distrust circulating around different exchanges, with some like Kraken seeing 59% of total BTC held on the exchange flowing out in a one-year period. Coinbase and Bitfinex emerged as some of the hardest-hit exchanges with outflows of 33% and 32%, respectively. Coinbase’s outflows came amid insolvency rumors which have since been debunked by the exchange. Other exchanges include KuCoin seeing 32% of BTC holdings flow out, as well as Binance which is currently holding 25% less BTC than it did a year ago. Bitstamp was the lowest among the large exchanges, holding about 23% less BTC than it did in early 2022. BTC on centalized exchanges falls to 6.65% of supply | Source: Santiment Will This Push Up the BTC Price? With so much bitcoin leaving centralized exchanges, it points to one phenomenon and that is the fact that investors are accumulating their coins. Furthermore, with more investors choosing to self-custody their BTC, it leaves much less supply active on exchanges that are ready to be sold. Related Reading: Liquidations Cross $200 Million Following Bitcoin’s Rise Above $19,000 This has worked out to reduce the selling pressure on the digital asset over the last couple of months.

The crypto has seen some losses but could recover during today’s trading session. Bitcoin Shorts Are Wipeout, Bear Market Over? Any “good” price rally must be a “hated” rally; Bitcoin follows this rule. As the cryptocurrency trended to the upside from its yearly lows, crypto traders began shorting it with overleverage positions. When Bitcoin was about to breach $17,500, the price action went sideways, allowing overleverage shorts to take positions; these traders were expecting BTC to fail the re-test of this resistance level. Their positions provided liquidity to the upside and the fuel to send Bitcoin to its current levels. According to a report from Bitfinex, $450 million were recorded in short liquidations as BTC began its ascend. This data represents the most significant short squeeze since July 2021 across the crypto market, as seen in the chart below. The BTC price action is displaying a similar behavior; it’s moving sideways as shorts pile in, expecting to profit from another crash. Their positions could still provide fuel for this rally, but the report warns about long traders going greedy, expecting further appreciation: It is typical for bear markets to have a complete wipeout of shorts (…). even with the leg up, the market remains highly illiquid, and with the sharp fall in Open Interest over the weekend, a pullback might be expected with a cautious approach from bulls.

42414650,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCsyy,1674059046,Digital Dollar Project Warns on US Cautious Approach to CBDCs,"The United States may have conceded a head start to other nations in ""setting global standards for the future of money"" regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDC), but in the future the country ""should lead the development of an international regulatory framework around digital currencies,"" the Digital Dollar Project (DDP) said on Wednesday.  In its updated white paper, the DDP, a nonprofit organization advocating for a U.S. CBDC, said the U.S. should set that regulatory framework ""independent of a decision to deploy a U.S. CBDC.""  More than 100 jurisdictions around the world are researching or developing a CBDC but the U.S. remains cautious on the merits of a CBDC.  ""In the coming CBDC future, the U.S. should actively lead global discussions on governance, interoperability, security, privacy and scalability standards rather than reacting to foreign CBDC decisions,"" the DDP wrote.  The DPP laid out a series of warnings about the United States' cautious approach, calling it ""a conspicuous absence"" and an ""unsustainable position.""  Such a ""defensive posture"" by the U.S. threatens to impact its domestic economy if foreign nations issue their own CBDCs that become widely adopted as the de facto standards for international wholesale and retail payments, the paper warned.  Additionally, the CBDCs of other nations could be used to avoid financial sanctions making it imperative that the U.S. find ways to maintain the dominant use of the dollar in the digital global payment systems.  If the United States-led global financial infrastructure is perceived as ""too slow and expensive in comparison to foreign alternatives,"" a potential threat as other countries rapidly explore their version of central bank digital currencies, it's possible other nations will begin or continue the process of ""de-dollarization,"" the DDP argued.  The Atlantic Council previously issued a similar warning.  The DDP's white paper referred to a 2022 study by the Hoover Institution that looked at global implications of China's CBDC, the e-CNY, including how China has established a first-mover advantage in not only the deployment but also the technical underpinnings of CBDCs.  China's CBDC enhances its ability to cement its international leadership in the space, the white paper noted. The e-CNY helps China's ability in setting ""economic norms and technical standards that align with its authoritarian governance system, and increase its ability to undercut the traditional dominance of the U.S. dollar as a source of geo-economic and strategic influence.""

7728892,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516567,1674058506,"This Australian Crypto Exchange Lists LUNC, SHIB, And APE Coin","Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE), and LUNC gained new support in January as Australian crypto exchange Cointree lists them on its platform. Cointree announced the news via Twitter recently. Cointree is among the oldest crypto exchanges in Australia, based in Melbourne. It began operation in 2013 and offers over 280 cryptocurrencies on its platform, including the latest additions (APE, LUNC, and SHIB). In 2017, the exchange launched a learning hub that teaches and guides crypto enthusiasts on basic cryptocurrency subjects. Related Reading: Optimism Sees Spike In USDC And USDT Transactions Eclipsing $1 Billion This development is not SHIB’s first Australian recognition. Earlier in December 2021, CoinJar, Australia’s oldest crypto exchange, announced the listing of Shiba Inu on its platform via Twitter. CoinJar also added six other cryptocurrencies, which include Cartesi (CTSI), Fetch.ai (FET), Origin Protocol (OGN), Audius (AUDIO), OXT, and Quant Network (QNT). Performance Outlook For SHIB, LUNC, And APE Coin Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price has significantly increased in the past 24 hours and is trading at $0.0001239. SHIB is among the coins to see massive rallies this month. The crypto asset has added 21.8% over the past seven days and 28% in the last 14 days. LUNC, a token that emerged after the rebranding of the original Terra chain to Terra Classic, is soaring after a decline on the 24-hour chart. LUNC’s price soared 3% on January 10 after announcing new integration on the network. The token has added 11.4% over the past 14 days and a 23.8% 30-day price gain. Apecoin finds its utility at the forefront of the Web3 ecosystem through arts and entertainment. The token has also surged in price since the beginning of January. It is currently maintaining a 24-hour price decline of 0.33%, a 14-day gain of 27.6%, and a 30-day spike of 41.6%. All newly listed tokens have seen favorable 30 days performance records. These coins’ performances might have partly influenced their listing on the Australian exchanges platform. Australian Crypto Market Expansion And Regulatory Enforcement Research has shown that Australians are very crypto-curious, with over 1 million citizens owning at least one cryptocurrency. According to Ray Morgan’s study, millions of Australians treat digital assets as investments. However, the highly volatile and relatively unregulated environment in the crypto market has hindered further expansion in the country. As per reports, crypto regulation has been part of the government’s agenda, but it has met obstacles because regulators struggle to understand the market. Moreover, crypto tax obligations are confusing and hard to understand for non-crypto experts. However, after the FTX implosion, the Australian government became earnest in its crypto regulatory pursuit. As the industry continues to grow, Australia vies to be a global leader in crypto certifications and regulatory and consumer protection measures. The government has put regulatory measures in place for crypto custodians and exchanges to protect its citizens who trade in digital assets. In December 2022, the Australian Treasury hinted at its plans to begin consultation on legislative reforms. It aimed to strengthen consumer protection standards for crypto custody arrangements and tighten its regulation over crypto exchanges. According to the report, the government will create a licensing framework for crypto exchanges in 2023. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains?

7727598,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516540,1674055845,"Ethereum-Based Frax Finance (FXS) Is Up 64%, Is There Still Opportunity?","In the last seven days, the Ethereum-based project Frax Finance is the second biggest winner within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. With a price increase of 64%, the FXS token is only behind Decentraland (MANA), which has surged 76% within the same period. With the massive pump, Frax Share Token (FXS) has moved up to the 63rd position in the ranking by market cap and has seen a bullish rally since January 2. While the price was $4.09 on that day, FXS was at $9.06 at press time. When the price briefly rose above $10 yesterday, the gain was over 140% since January 2. In the 1-day chart, FXS has broken the resistance zone established in May last year between $7.40 and $8.20 and is now facing resistance at $10.02. The first two attempts to break this resistance have failed for now, so a retest of the former resistance zone could be on the cards before the Frax token continues to rally. This would also be a much-needed correction, as the RSI on the daily chart is still at 83. The weekly chart confirms the extremely bullish picture for the FXS token. Once the price consolidates in the daily chart and subsequently breaks the $10.02 level, the way would be clear for a rise toward $13. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Outperform Bitcoin, Small Caps Lead Market The price level served as strong support in November and December 2021, before FXS rallied to an all-time high of $52.80 in January 2022. What Do The Fundamentals Of Frax (FXS) Suggest? As NewsBTC reported, Frax Finance is benefiting from the liquid staking (LSD) narrative that emerged earlier this year and has since caused all LSD tokens to skyrocket. However, it is questionable whether the hype can continue for a longer period of time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Jumps By 21%, Here’s Why As Jordi Alexander, CIO of Selini Capital explained, the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork could be in for a rude awakening: ETH staking is going to explode after the Shanghai fork allows withdrawals- esp. now as Metamask integration makes it easy for Dummies. But LSD tokens are overvalued in anticipation of this – revenue is not going to change much, bc reward yields will plunge as staking % goes up. But analyst Thor Hartvigsen doubts whether the same will be true for Frax Finance. The analyst shared five reasons via Twitter why Frax Finance will be a key player in DeFi this year. The first reason is that Frax offers the largest APR among liquid staking providers at 6-10%, while its nearest competitor is only around 5%. The main reason for this difference is that frxETH can be used in DeFi applications such as the ETH/frxETH Curve pool. The second reason Hartvigsen cites is that Frax Finance has made extensive improvements since its inception, in particular, it has improved its model (FRAXV2) and “has become a huge liquidity engine with a range of products.” These include algorithmic market operations (AMOs), FraxSwap, FraxLend, FraxFerry (native bridge design), ETH liquid staking, and FPI (US inflation rate linked stablecoin). ¤ Frax Finance has been crushing it lately🔮 And with their growing ecosystem of DeFi products, $FXS has a TON of upside in 2023. Here are 5 reasons why @fraxfinance will be a central player in DeFi this year and how you should be taking advantage of this 🧵 1/19 pic.twitter.com/epFMEgY4HF — Thor Hartvigsen (@ThorHartvigsen) January 17, 2023 Third, it’s the AMOs that make Frax special, as they don’t just let collateral sit dormant, but use it in various DeFi applications. It also offers some of the highest stablecoin yields, which significantly strengthens FXS by increasing liquidity on Curve. Last but not least, Hartvigsen points to Frax’s roadmap to reach a market cap in the trillions and become the risk-free underlying in DeFi. The analyst touts the Fed Master Account (FMA) as the biggest innovation: A FMA is dollars deposited directly into the FED treasury’s ledger and grants access to US Treasuries. The FED gives a status on the ledger once a day which essentially is the ultimate audit. This would make FRAX one of the closest things to a ‘risk free dollar’. It’s a very ambitious goal however and likely a few years away.

""Today we need to make the extremely difficult decision to streamline some of ConsenSys' teams to adjust to challenging and uncertain market conditions,"" wrote Lubin. ""This decision will impact a total of 97 employees, which represents 11% of ConsenSys' total workforce.""  Departing ConsenSys employees globally will receive generous severance packages based on tenure and an extended option exercise window from 12 months to 36 months, according to the blogpost. There will also be personalized support from an external placement agency and extension of healthcare benefits in relevant jurisdictions, it said.  The New York City-headquartered ConsenSys, which currently has about 900 employees, is just one of the many crypto companies forced to lay off staff in a grinding bear market that has claimed an estimated 27,000 jobs across the industry since April.  Lubin underscored the financial strength of ConsenSys, saying the difficult decision to streamline would focus the firm's strategy on its core products and exploring new opportunities in Web3 commerce as it evolves into the mainstream.  ""We're keeping the company strong; we didn't cut into muscle,"" Lubin said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We sort of right-sized support functions, some customer support, some internal team support, because there's just less activity in our ecosystem right now. I expect we'll get back to doing quite significant and surging business in the not too distant future.""  CeFi censure  As well as taking stock of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty, Lubin also took the opportunity to censure the behavior of crypto centralized finance (CeFi) companies.  ""If we hadn't had such ridiculous behavior and such a cataclysmic collapse in the CeFi part of our ecosystem, then my guess is those CeFi actors would have continued to play their games and continue to get away with it,"" he said.  Lubin said it was extremely unfortunate that such a lot of people have also been harmed in the process of CeFi actors self-identifying in 2022, but ultimately benefit will accrue to the crypto ecosystem and beyond.  ""It will highlight what's good in tech crypto: decentralized mechanisms, not exploiting consumers by providing easy access to that mechanism. And even more importantly, hopefully all of this is really good for the general world of finance, because it points out that decentralization: good.

42411268,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMa9a,1674054207,How Social Media Influencers Fed Bankman-Fried's Cult of Personality,"Did you know many of the biggest financial and money YouTubers who promoted FTX worked with the same talent agency?  As we witness the collateral damage caused by FTX unfold and the federal criminal charges against the crypto exchange’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried stack up, many are asking how so many people fell for this Ponzi-like scam. As with any ""successful"" financial scheme, FTX was a confidence game – and the game only works if the ""players"" are duped into thinking things are safe.  Enter FTX’s promoters and pumpers.  Chris Norlund is the creator of a daily news YouTube channel and host on Busan BeFM Radio.  Celebrities including centi-millionaire financier Kevin O'Leary, football star Tom Brady and basketball stars Steph Curry and Shaquille O'Neal all attached their images to FTX. Larry David played a crypto-skeptical curmudgeon in a much applauded FTX Super Bowl ad last year. Many of these well-known names are now facing a class-action lawsuit.  As actor Ben McKenzie has repeatedly said about his peers who used their fame to advertise for crypto projects, if you convince someone to buy into a Ponzi scheme, you’ve participated in a Ponzi scheme. Selling a cryptocurrency called “ethereumMAX” is not the same as posing for Pepsi Max photoshoots.  See also: Kim Kardashian Settles SEC Probe for $1.26M for Hyping EthereumMax  However, there is another group of people who need pointing out: social media influencers. In an age of bifurcated attention, where people are more likely to be watching YouTube than network television, micro-celebrities can have an outsized influence on their audience. That’s part of the reason FTX sponsored so many so-called creators, especially on YouTube.  Many of the most famous finance and money social media influencers were collaborating to push FTX, working under the same umbrella of the little-known social influencer company called Creators Agency. And yes, I do mean collaborating.  Creators Agency was founded by Apple Crider, Erika Kullberg and Eric Kullberg. Apple and Erika met at FinCon – a place where financial YouTubers congregate and learn how to recruit people to the products they hawk. Or as the event's tagline states, FinCon is ""where money and media meet."" According to Apple, Creators Agency are creators' ""partners in crime,"" helping them with whatever they need, Erika said. It offers talent management services and claims to help creators go viral.  Creators Agency clients were paid to push FTX, likely netting hundreds of thousands and possibly millions from signed contracts for the agency and its clients. Sam Bankman-Fried is known now for making deals seemingly on whim, based on the shaky math of “expected value.” The one-time billionaire was seen as a shrewd businessman with a heart of gold, who worked without rest to money to give away.  In addition to funding charitable efforts, Bankman-Fried saw a lot of value in inflating his public persona. Last year, FTX signed a $130 million deal to put its name and logo on the Miami-Dade County sports arena. What’s a couple million to pay dozens of YouTube creators, if they might also bring in millions of viewers to be converted into potential customers? That's expected value.  See also: BlockFi Creditors Battle to Keep Their Details Secret  Here are just a few Creators Agency-connected creators who advertised for FTX: Kevin – 1.85 million subscribers, Graham Stephan – 4.17 million subs, Minority Mindset – 1.46 million subs, Brian Jung – 1.21 million subs, Tom Nash – 283K subs, Jeremy Lefevbre Financial Education – 721K Subs. Andrei Jikh, who has 2.19 million subscribers, heavily promoted FTX-connected BlockFi and pushed FTX with Graham Stephan, Meet Kevin and Jeremy Financial Education as part of the Millennial Money channel, which has recently been deleted.  Though some may deny it, I personally catalogued these accounts as they promoted FTX. They were all also listed on the Creators Agency website at some point in time. As you go through the list of people who pushed FTX you realize how deep this confidence game goes. It should be noted that many of these creators have since deleted their FTX connected content and also that not all of Creators Agency's clients promoted SBF's products.  This is not an exhaustive list of everyone who promoted FTX – there are too many to name. Other popular crypto-focused influencers and channels – including Anthony Pompliano and Coin Bureau (with ~486K subs and 2.18 million subs, respectively) – also promoted FTX, though they may not be connected to Creators Agency. Pompliano was an investor in bankrupt lending platform BlockFi, which signed a deal to be acquired by FTX.US.  I started posting videos in the spring of 2022 tracking YouTubers pushing FTX. I knew something was up because suddenly all of these seemingly unconnected creators were talking about the same thing at the exact same time. That is: FTX is great and Sam Bankman-Fried is a genius (it’s rumored grandiose compliments of SBF were part of the contract).  Creators Agency deleted its founders’ names and photos from its website as well as its client names and photos shortly after the FTX scandal broke. It seemed like they were trying to hide any association with the PR nightmare. This is why it's important to not only call out what you think are scams when you see them, but also hold people to account after things go belly up. As of January 2023, some of the creators have been restored to the website, but Erika is still not listed as a founder, like before. She's an attorney and financial adviser who prides herself on “reading the fine print.”  See also: NFL Legend Tom Brady Caught in FTX Fallout, Risks Losing Complete Strategic Investment  Creators Agency assisted some of the most watched and influential channels in promoting what could turn out to be one of the largest financial crimes in history. And in so doing, it helped Bankman-Fried establish his reputation as a selfless billionaire and FTX’s as a safe cryptocurrency exchange.  Of course, neither FTX nor SBF were trustworthy. But financial schemes only work if people are confident in the hustle. This may explain why it was worth it for FTX to pay so many social media influencers to repeat the same talking points – it created an illusion of safety and promoted the very real fear of missing out. The psychological phenomenon of the ""mere exposure effect,"" where people are more likely to believe things are true if repeated, might be heightened by the para-social relationships that form on social media.  Contracts for YouTubers to push FTX ranged from $50K per month upwards to hundreds of thousand per month and/or around $2,500 a video. These prices were quite high for a 30-second mid-roll ad read. It’s likely Creators Agency was able to drive up the price, considering the number of influencers it worked with and collectively huge viewership. Erika Kullberg once said she started the agency because she thought creators were ""underpaid.""  Over the past year I made several videos calling out these FTX grifters, and warning people that assets on these exchanges were unsafe. All the while, Creators Agency clients pumped FTX and kept taking payments from SBF. Few disclosed their relationship to the agency. Though several made videos suggesting to their fans that FTX or its stateside subsidiary FTX.US would be fine – as they were going up in flames.  See also: Read 'em and Weep: 5 Crypto Influencers Who Dealt Their Followers a Bad Hand  When it was clear that FTX.US was not fine, many put out low-effort apology videos. Three creators – Minority Mindset, Graham Stephan and Tom Nash – made apology videos within hours of FTX’s bankruptcy announcement and all seemed to be reading from the same script. Not a good look.  These creators took money that was likely stolen from FTX customers to promote a Ponzi scheme to their audience. Many of their viewers will lose everything, or have to wait years to get pennies back on the dollar.  Some YouTubers have tried to deflect responsibility by saying they only promoted FTX.US, but that's a horrible defense. In every video, the FTX brand itself was being promoted and likely a large portion of a creator’s fan base was located outside of the U.S. (20%-40% of viewers of the average YouTube video come from outside of the U.S.) Bankman-Fried hardly treated either exchange as a distinct entity and apparently commingled funds – putting users at risk no matter what platform they signed up for.  Likewise, saying “everyone else was doing it"" or “I’m bad at business” is hardly a defense. Many of these people pose as financial gurus, yet they promoted what could be the largest Ponzi in history. Either they’re not the geniuses with money they claim to be or they were just plain greedy.  Let's face it, these aren't good people. Even when not pushing FTX, many Creator Agency clients sell their grifter classes a la Andrew Tate. As author Fred Schwed pointed out in his classic finance book “Where are the Customers' Yachts?,” if someone is selling you an idea that will make you rich, you’re the product.  Obviously, no one should look to YouTube as a bastion of morality. Tom Nash has admitted to using fake names and lying about his credentials, while Meet Kevin has gotten many DUI charges and drinks on camera when talking about investing, all while selling his courses through ""Hustler’s University."" Andrei Jikh sells his ""Zero to a Million"" course. Agency client Spencer Cornelia, who is a self-proclaimed internet detective, made videos defending other clients and his friends at the agency.  But a lot of good could be done if FTX’s advertisers apologize in a way that recognizes the harm they may have caused others. Forget clearly scripted and grossly insincere apology videos. If these people truly care they should take all the money they received from FTX and either return it to the bankruptcy estate or donate it all to charity.  YouTubers who pushed FTX completely failed their fans by choosing extreme greed over due diligence. People should not forgive or forget that the YouTubers at Creators Agency took their fans’ money to promote a Ponzi scheme on an unregulated exchange.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Chris Norlund,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/18/how-social-media-influencers-fed-bankman-frieds-cult-of-personality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/299ee9049905a041d02714637902a73f6c8095ad-3185x1864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414636,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCrc4,1674052758,Bitcoin Erases Entire FTX-Related Decline in Latest Surge,"Bitcoin (BTC) has risen to $21,550 early Wednesday, surpassing the level at which it stood on Nov. 5 just prior to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. According to CoinDesk data, the price of bitcoin is now at its highest since mid-September.  Behind today's advance were this morning's larger than expected decline in the producer price index (PPI) for December combined with a bigger than forecast drop in December retail sales.  The PPI fell 0.5% in December, bringing the year-over-year rate down to 6.2% versus 7.3% previously. Market expectations had been for just 0.1% dip in December and a year-over-pace of 6.8%. The core PPI for December fell 0.1%, in line with forecasts, but the year-over-year rate fell to 5.5% versus expectations for 5.7%.  December retail sales fell 1.1% versus forecasts for just a 0.8% decline. Combined with a drop of 1% in November, this marks the first back-to-back 1%+ declines in monthly retail sales since the pandemic panic.  A check of traditional markets finds the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down a whopping 16 basis points to 3.39%, its lowest since mid-September, and well below the current Fed Funds rate target of 4.25%-4.5%. This sort of ""inversion"" has typically been an excellent forecaster of a recession, or at least a sizable economic slowdown. Should that come to pass, it would surely mean easier monetary policy than currently forecast, a possible boon to risk assets, including bitcoin.  Trading in the low-$21,000 area in early November 2022, bitcoin had plunged nearly all the way down to $15,000 later that month in wake of the FTX bankruptcy. The crypto then remained stuck close to $16,500 for several weeks before embarking on this current rally in early 2023.

42414643,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCsIW,1674052590,NFT Collection NimTeens Explores Just How Fast the NFT Space Moves,"At first glance, NimTeens, a new non-fungible token (NFT) collection by generative artist Bryan Brinkman, looks like a tribute to adolescence. A followup to his January 2021 project NimBuds, the new 400-edition project shows his signature cloud characters aging up in awkward fashion to take their school photos.  But the collection represents more than that, Brinkman told CoinDesk, and offers a larger commentary on how fast the NFT ecosystem that has grown – sometimes clumsily – over the past two years.  ""The common joke in the Web3 space is time moves at a rapid speed and often a week can feel like a month,” said Brinkman.  In continuing his nephologic storyline, his cloud “babies” have now matured into “awkward teenagers,” with new traits like peach fuzz, acne and oversized glasses.  “Just like in real life, some kids have bigger spurts than others, some have acne and pimples, but each is unique and grows in an endearing way,” he explained.  Brinkman was one of the first 10 artists on the generative art platform Art Blocks, which has seen explosive growth in recent months. Artists like Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs and Art Blocks founder Snowfro have helped to revive the artform and popularize generative art in the NFT space.  NimBuds, which features mischievous cloud faces attached to rainbow strings, has racked up 1,155 ETH, or about $1.8 million in secondary sales. At the time of writing, its floor price is 3.2 ETH, or just over $5,000. The playful NFTs have been sold by auction houses such as Christies and Sotheby’s and were even featured in a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit parodying NFT projects in March 2021.  Brinkman wanted to honor the original NimBuds token holders in his new drop as he built out the next part of his chronological storyline. Similar to Art Blocks’ Friendship Bracelet collection that topped charts on OpenSea last week, Brinkman offered a free mint to NimBuds owners before offering them at a Dutch Auction on Friday for about 0.3 ETH, or about $470 per token.  NimTeens opened up its mint on Jan. 13, pledging 10% of sales to suicide-prevention nonprofit The Trevor Project. According to data from OpenSea, the project has already raked in 138 ETH trading volume, or roughly $220,000 in sales. Its floor price is currently 0.44 ETH, or about $700 at the time of writing.  Brinkman attributed the success of his projects to a growing interest in generative art and the creative freedom that NFTs present to artists.  ""The Web3 and NFT space has changed dramatically in the two years since we released NimBuds,” said Brinkman. “Art Blocks has grown into one of the most respected and profitable projects in the ecosystem, generative characters took off and became the most notable style of the space, and generative art has become appreciated in auction houses and museums.""",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/18/nft-collection-nimteens-explores-just-how-fast-the-nft-space-moves,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aad04ce9f0953004bee60114a40fca69d1cbc8c3-2194x1450.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7725860,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516549,1674052203,Aave Price Surges As V3 Cloud Upgrade Draws Near,"Amid the ongoing rally in DeFi TVL, we’ve seen positive news and innovation popping up from the ecosystem. As the Aave protocol V3 cloud upgrade draws near, its native token, Aave, has skyrocketed since the beginning of this year, reaching higher highs for the first time in the last few months. Aave is an open-source liquidity protocol and its upcoming V3 cloud launch is just one of the protocols pending plans yet to be initiated. An Aave supporter with the Twitter handle @0x4Graham disclosed the upcoming upgrade launch. According to crypto reporter Collins Wu, the V3 upgrade will introduce cross-chain asset functions, community contribution tools, and a gas optimization model on the Aave protocol. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Flasko (FLSK): Which Is The Best Pick? Aave Price Surges Nearly 37% In 7 Days As the v3 cloud upgrade draws near, Aave’s native token has spiked in price by 36.5% in the past 7 days, following suit with other crypto and DeFi tokens surging in the market. Besides that, the past few weeks have seen Aave printing a bullish trend, in which the chart indicates anticipation before a significant move. Aave began the year with a ranging price of $50, and so far, the token has spiked to above $80 following the disclosure of the v3 cloud upgrade. Moreover, not only is the Aave token surging, but the protocol’s TVL has also done some significant rallies to the upside over the past weeks. Currently, Aave protocol has a cumulative TVL of $4.5 billion, up by 21% in one month. The protocol has always been one of the leading contributors to the whole DeFi ecosystem TVL, with Lido Finance at the top then MakerDAO as the second. Though Aave has been climbing since the beginning of the year, it is still far from its all-time high of $661, seen in 2021. With the ongoing disbelief in the crypto market among investors, it is still uncertain whether the v3 cloud upgrade will be a good enough catalyst to drive its value beyond or closer to its peak. Related Reading: Rocket Pool (RPL) Surged 55% after Listing on Binance Summary On Aave V3 Cloud Upgrade The V3 upgrade is said to introduce community contribution tools, cross-chain asset functions, and a gas optimization model on the Aave blockchain. The optimization model is supposed to cut down transaction costs on the blockchain by up to 25% and make the Aave protocol more efficient and ready for other upgrades. This information comes along with the V3 upgrade details released by the Aave team towards the end of Q1 2022. The initial V3 upgrade was introduced in March of last year and was described to be a groundbreaking protocol. According to the developers at Aave, the V3 upgrade provides various new features that include Portals, High-efficiency mode, Isolation mode, Gas optimization, L2 designs, Community, and Risk management.

42414646,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCsdk,1674050400,"Fintech Firm Arch Starts Crypto Lending Product, Raises $2.75M","Arch, a financial technology company targeting alternative asset investors, announced its first product on Wednesday.  The firm added it closed a $2.75 million funding round in the second half of last year. The capital will help expand the team and financial partnerships. Arch will also lend out some of the funds, co-founder and CEO Dhruv Patel told CoinDesk during an interview.  Founded in February 2022, New York-based Arch’s platform allows users to take out a single loan collateralized across combined alternative assets – starting with cryptocurrencies. The loans are custodied by BitGo and denominated in either U.S. dollars or USD coin (USDC) stablecoins (and can be repaid in any combination of the two).  ""Arch doesn’t touch or reloan customer funds for any reason, ""said Patel – an important distinction after liquidity issues took down crypto lenders BlockFi, Celsius Network and CoinDesk's sister company Genesis Global Trading.  The target customers for Arch are higher income or asset individuals who invest heavily in alternative assets who might feel discouraged by traditional lenders and financial institutions, explained Patel.  “Today, nearly 50% of young investors hold cryptocurrency, and over 80% have stated they are interested in investing in alternative assets,” said Patel. “With Arch, individuals can use crypto assets as collateral for loans, granting the ability to access capital to make other investments or make other large purchases to accelerate their financial journeys.”  Arch will also use the funding to continue adding regulatory approvals, which come with steep legal costs. The startup is currently legal to operate in 31 states, said co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Himanshu Sahay. Investors in Arch included Tribe Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Picus Capital and Global Founders Capital, among others.  Arch is starting with crypto but plans to eventually expand to use public stocks, equity investments in pre-initial public offering (IPO) companies and real estate so that borrowers can use a diverse portfolio of assets as collateral.

Rocket Pool is Rallying after Binance Listing The surge coincides with RPL’s listing on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. The token is paired against USDT, the stablecoin issued by Tether Holdings, which is also the most liquid in crypto circles, and BUSD. Related Reading: Optimism Sees Spike In USDC And USDT Transactions Eclipsing $1 Billion However, the surge registered earlier today has since been reversed. Data showed that the project’s market cap is $675.1 million, and RPL is up 9% versus the USDT. At the same time, it outperforms bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), adding roughly 10% versus the top most liquid cryptocurrencies. Listing on Binance opens the token to more liquidity, allowing traders and investors who might not be familiar with the intricacies of DeFi trading to purchase the token. Before being availed on Binance, RPL was available for trading in most decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap, Bancor, and Balancer. However, RPL had been listed in exchanges within the United States, including Huobi, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC Global. Hard work of the @Rocket_Pool team paying off with a @binance listing today. A project we have remained bullish on for many years with $RPL up 100x since first covering. The next market cycle is now about decentralising all layers of the $ETH stack. 🚀🌐🖥️ — Alex Saunders 🇦🇺👨‍🔬 (@AlexSaundersAU) January 18, 2023 By springing to spot levels and clearing immediate liquidation zones, printing new monthly highs, it can be interpreted that the community received the listing positively, expecting more developments in the next few months. This can be especially the case considering the market’s state and Rocket Pool’s role in Ethereum. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? After the slumps of 2022, RPL, like most crypto and DeFi tokens, fell from record highs. As an illustration, RPL tanked 76% from April highs, bottoming up in mid-June before rallying to spot levels. Despite the blips of early November, triggered by market-wide fears of FTX and Alameda’s collapse, RPL is back to April’s territory. Improving Macroeconomic Factors and Shanghai Upgrade The sharp reversal and change in fortunes for RPL can be attributed to various fundamental factors. At the top of the list, possibly explaining the rise across the financial markets is shifting macroeconomic factors. Statistics indicate that inflation is falling from multi-year highs, influencing central banks’ decisions on implementing their monetary policies. The confidence amongst investors and traders spilled over the crypto, helping pump BTC and altcoins, including RPL. Rocket Pool has more tailwinds because of the upcoming Shanghai Upgrade in Ethereum and what the protocol inherently solves. Rocket Pool allows ETH holders to stake, slashing capital and hardware requirements, which can be otherwise prohibitive. ETH holders can stake as low as 0.01ETH to a node operator and earn annual rewards. In Rocket Pool, a node operator must hold 16 ETH. Once Ethereum permits users who had locked their coins in the Beacon Chain to withdraw, some may delegate coins via Rocket Pool. This expectation supports RPL and other staking service providers, including Lido DAO. As NewsBTC reported, Lido DAO’s native token, LDO, has been rising in recent weeks, spearheading the broader market recovery.

As such, we have made the decision to suspend DCG's quarterly dividend distribution until further notice,” the firm wrote in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday.  Coinbase (COIN) said it is halting its operations in Japan, citing ""market conditions."" Customers have until Feb. 16 to withdraw their fiat and crypto holdings from the exchange, Coinbase announced on Wednesday. Fiat deposits will be halted on Friday. Coinbase entered the Japanese market after completing its registration with the country's Financial Services Agency in June 2021. The exchange is following in the footsteps of rival exchange Kraken, which ended its operations in Japan at the end of last year. Coinbase’s stock was down 1.6% at $53.27 in premarket trading, amid a rally in the shares, which are up 56% since the start of the year.

""Self-custodied BTC is for holders, and could represent more of the bitcoin supply disappearing into cold storage long term,"" the analysts added.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  Crypto Observers Maintain Risk On Bias as US Debt Ceiling Nears  Ethereum Layer 2 Network Optimism Sees Bump in Transactional Activity.

42414642,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCsNp,1674046800,EY and Polygon Ready Privacy-Focused Ethereum for Enterprise Release,"EY’s Nightfall, a five-years-in-the-making system allowing businesses to shield the content of transactions on the public Ethereum blockchain, has entered its final phase of production readiness for deployment using the Polygon network.  The latest updates to Nightfall have made its code fully decentralized, meaning it can run anywhere with no single entity being in charge, as well as adding industry standard X.509 identification certificates. These final updates herald the product going live in May of this year, said EY Global Blockchain Leader Paul Brody.  “It’s one thing to show that the math works, it’s another thing to have a security audited, tested out, hardened system,” Brody said in an interview. “We currently have a beta client for the supply chain work that is ongoing now, and we expect to show the first production ready product that uses this network layer at our Global Summit in May.”  The goal for EY and Nightfall, which teamed up with scaling specialist Polygon in September 2022, has always been to harness the power of the public Ethereum network for big business. In order to make Ethereum palatable from a data privacy standpoint, Nightfall uses a math-heavy secret sharing technology called zero-knowledge proofs that can hide the content of transactions appearing on the blockchain.  These days, zero-knowledge (ZK) tools have become a popular way to help scale up Ethereum by summarizing transactions using mathematical proofs and enabling data to be moved off chain – known as “roll-ups,” in blockchain parlance.  Nightfall takes advantage of certain efficiency trade-offs, creating a “zero-knowledge optimistic rollup.” It’s an approach that leverages ZK tech for its privacy benefits, while avoiding an overbearing computational load, achieved by allowing batches of transactions to process quickly and be checked afterwards.  This approach is a better fit for certain enterprise use cases, versus things like crypto trading or decentralized finance (DeFi), said EY’s Brody.  “The optimistic part allows us to have a very low cost for transactions,” he said. “Enterprises aren’t really doing trading. Most of the time, what they’re doing is moving 100,000 widgets in inventory and the transaction costs have to be driven as low as possible.”  As far as the use of identification certificates goes, Brody said it’s not the same as imposing know-your-customer (KYC) on an open system.  “We convened with a bunch of banks and other industrial companies last year and it turns out almost nobody can agree on KYC and what it should look like,” Brody said. “So we decided we can’t go that far. But we can make every company responsible for whom they transact with, and make it fundamentally unattractive for bad actors to use our ecosystem.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MATIC | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/18/ey-and-polygon-ready-privacy-focused-ethereum-for-enterprise-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19f6edbc958b46ef6e5377749009605af889a94f-1648x1024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7722697,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516525,1674045793,"Altcoin Indexes Outperform Bitcoin, Small Caps Lead Market","Data shows all the altcoin indexes have outperformed Bitcoin during the past month, with the small caps becoming the market leaders. The Past 30 Days Were Green For Both Bitcoin And Altcoins According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, all indexes record positive returns in the 27-31% range during the past month. The “altcoin indexes” here refer to groups of alts divided based on their market caps. The benefit of creating indexes of cryptos is that it makes it easy to assess the performances of the different segments of the market against each other this way. There are three main altcoin indexes: the “small caps,” the “mid caps,” and the “large caps.” As is already apparent from their names, each of these covers coins of different sizes. Now, here is a chart that shows how these three indexes have performed against each other, as well as versus Bitcoin, over the past month: Looks like all these indexes have seen sharp rise in recent days | Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 17 As shown in the above graph, both the altcoins and Bitcoin observed very little price action in the final third of December, as their returns were close to 0%. This trend started to change around a couple of weeks ago, however, as some bullish price action finally returned to the market after what was a full year of mostly bearish movement in 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin aSOPR Again Retests Bull-Bear Junction Level, Will Resistance Break This Time? In the period since then, the entire market has seen a significant uplift, as all the market segments are in some major profits now. The winner during the past 30 days has been the small caps, who are currently sitting at 31% in the green. An interesting thing to notice is that the small caps suffered the most at the end of 2022 as they capped the year being noticeably more underwater than the other indexes (as can be seen in the chart). This makes them turning it around and outperforming the rest of the market all the more impressive. Related Reading: Here’s Why $22,400 Could Be The Next Major Level To Break For Bitcoin Investors of both the large caps and mid caps are in profits of 28% each right now, not too far from the small caps’ performance. Bitcoin has also seen very close positive returns of 27% over the past month, but clearly, the altcoins have managed to outdo the pioneer crypto during this period. As for Ethereum’s performance in this same period, the asset with the second largest market cap in the sector has observed gains of more than 32% in the past month, meaning that on its own, it has performed better than the indexes. The report notes that the main reason behind the outperformance by the alts is due to these indexes observing a deeper decline than Bitcoin during the period following the FTX debacle back in November of last year.

42414644,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCsYR,1674045232,DeFi-Focused Startup Blue Comes Out of Stealth With $3.2M Raise,"Blue, which offers know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) identity verification products for traders on decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols, has come out of stealth with $3.2 million in funding.  The funds were raised in a seed round co-led by Blockchange Ventures and Fenbushi Capital, with participation from DoraHacks, Knollwood Investment Advisory, Gate.io and Wave Financial, according to a company blog post Tuesday.  The announcement comes as interest in DeFi, a term used to refer to lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional middlemen, has reached new heights in the wake of centralized cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse late last year and a series of crypto exchange bankruptcies earlier in 2022.  Blue will use the funding to complete security audits from Halborn and Verilog Solutions. The rest of the money will go into expanding Blue’s core team and bringing the company’s permissioned DeFi product to market in the first quarter.  The company has already begun working on several proof-of-concept projects with major DeFi protocols, which it will announce in the coming months, Blue co-founder and CEO Casper Yonel said.  “We have basically a really wide array of customers that are interested in the product. We have institutions, banks, on-off ramps, liquid staking solutions, Reg S issuers,” Yonel told CoinDesk. “There’s a lot of different use cases across different types of customers.”  Reg S refers to a Regulation S offering that allows a company to issue equity or debt and to use an online method to raise capital from U.S. investors  Blue has built out its permissioned DeFi offering, which assigns “Blue IDs” to users who are then verified by a team of credential issuers.  The company was the finalist at the ETHDenver ‘22 Hackathon last March. Since then, the firm has also participated in other programs such as Outlier Venture’s DeFi Base Camp Accelerator, crypto exchange Binance’s Most Valuable Builder program and Startup with Chainlink’s incubator.

Zoom out on that price chart and the picture becomes clearer: Things aren’t looking so hot.  A year ago, every crypto reporter’s inbox was filled with fundraising announcements from upstart decentralized finance (DeFi) firms and non-fungible (NFT) projects.

In Ethereum-land, here are a few of the biggest areas for tech investment. .  Zero-knowledge and scaling  Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology continues to be among the frothiest sectors for investors. The technology is complicated, but the concept isn’t: ZK proofs use fancy cryptography to allow users to “prove” something is true without showing how.  ZK proofs are used widely in blockchain privacy, security and scaling but they also have applications beyond just crypto. Some of the teams building ZK tech for Ethereum include Scroll, Matter Labs and Polygon – each of which is building a rollup to scale Ethereum using ZK proofs. It is expected that ZK rollups will eventually become the main way people access Ethereum.

EigenLayer is one of the buzzier staking-focused companies that’s continued to earn attention as the wider crypto market has soured. Pitching itself as a “general-purpose marketplace for decentralized trust,” EigenLayer allows people to “restake” tokens that they’ve locked up to validate Ethereum – re-using those tokens to help secure other Ethereum middleware.  On another end of Ethereum staking land is Obol Labs, which announced this week that it just raised $12.5 million in series A funding to build out its approach to distributed validator technology (DVT). Obol Labs says the tech will help validators operate more securely and in closer alignment with crypto’s decentralized ethos.  Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  MEV: Maximal Extractable Value  Maximal extractable value (MEV) is a kind of profit that one can earn by analyzing Ethereum’s pending transaction pool (the “mempool”) to find profitable trades. Initially viewed as a scourge for the entire ecosystem, since MEV-optimizers frequently use strategies that eat into the profits of other traders, firms like Flashbots have long been at work spreading out the riches of MEV across more stakeholders.  As MEV extraction has grown more equitable, it’s continued to grow into a lucrative cottage industry, with MEV-focused firms still earning attention and funding despite wider market conditions.  Flashbots, for its part, has grown in prominence since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake in September. Today, 94% of the blocks (bundles of transactions) written to the Ethereum ledger come from MEV-Boost, a piece of Flashbots middleware that delivers pre-made, maximum extractable value-optimized blocks to the validators that add them to the blockchain. Flashbots also made waves two months ago with the announcement that it was building SUAVE – a new blockchain that will run in parallel with other networks to provide a kind of decentralized MEV market.

42414651,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCt4H,1674042972,"DeFi Service Frax Finance Gains Momentum Amid Ether Staking Narrative, FXS in Focus","Decentralized-finance (DeFi) application Frax Finance is briskly gaining favor among investors because of its strong product lineup as liquid staking derivatives (LSD) heat up ahead of the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade.  The Frax protocol is a two-token system comprising the FRAX stablecoin and a governance token called frax shares (FXS). FRAX maintains a peg to the U.S. dollar by being partly collateralized by USD coin (USDC) alongside periodic buying and selling of FXS to maintain its market capitalization.  Frax's staked ether product, which was launched in October, is attracting capital. Users deposit ether (ETH) and receive the Frax ether token (frxETH), which is backed 1:1 with ether. The frxETH token can be freely traded or staked on other DeFi applications or on Curve’s liquidity pools – where stakers are earning up to 10% annualized.  At writing time Tuesday, FrxETH holds just above $100 million, data from DefiLlama shows. That is a nearly $50 million increase since the start of January and four times the amount since November.  Frax is offering annualized returns of over 6% to 10% to users who stake ether on the platform. Those rewards are paid out in CRV, FRAX and FXS, depending on which liquidity pool a user stakes his tokens.  In contrast, Lido, the biggest DeFi application by total value locked, offers 5.2% yields to users.  The draw of capital into Frax’s ether pools has resulted in greater demand for FRAX and FXS tokens, with the price of FXS rising over 62% in the past week according to CoinGecko. And because some liquidity pools pay out in FXS, the price increase theoretically means higher rewards for stakers – which, in turn, could drive more ether toward Frax and even more demand for Frax’s tokens.  According to some observers, Frax’s treasury holdings of curve and convex tokens are resulting in outsized returns for some stakers.  “FRAX has an advantage over other LSD platforms at the moment due to their outsized CRV/CVX treasury holdings,” Hal Press, a partner at crypto fund North Rock Digital, said in a tweet this week. “This allows them to stimulate higher ETH staking yield on their staked ETH derivative product than the rest of the market.  “Sentiment among traders increased amid increased utility for FXS tokens. These tokens accrue value from the newly minted FRAX stablecoins and fees from Frax Finance,” Press added.  Understanding Curve  It’s helpful to know how Curve works to fully understand the reason behind the high yields on Frax.  Curve offers an efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to Curve Finance. Pools deployed on Curve are backed by centralized or decentralized stablecoins, wrapped tokens – such as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) – or a basket of various assets.  Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform.  High trading volumes on liquidity pools on Curve that involve Frax contributes toward the FRAX token holding its intended dollar peg. Additionally, Curve allocates CRV tokens as rewards for liquidity providers to select pools, called gauge rewards, which results in more returns for liquidity providers.  “The long-term effect of the Curve AMO is that Frax could become a large governance participant in Curve itself,” Frax’s technical documents state. Curve held over $6 billion in tokens as of Tuesday and is among the few “blue-chip” DeFi protocols.",POSITIVE,CRV | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/18/defi-service-frax-finance-gains-momentum-amid-ether-staking-narrative-fxs-in-focus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f69e03917a8643bccdc208c35602ecae5534d385-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ZKSync Releases SDK in Swift In a tweet on January 17, ZKSync said the goal is to make their features more accessible to developers and dApps. With a Swift SDK, ZKSync would support more platforms and use cases, especially for teams building iOS and macOS applications on ZKSync 2.0. We want to make zkSync 2.0’s features accessible to more developers and applications, so we’ve released a new SDK in Swift. #scalingthemission 1/4 pic.twitter.com/GdH8naXxHI — zkSync (@zksync) January 17, 2023 Swift is the programming language behind iOS and Mac devices. However, Swift cloud storage software for iOS and macOS enables users to retrieve data through an API. Cloud storage is scalable and designed to store unstructured data that can limitlessly grow. SDKs in Popular Programming Languages Besides Swift, ZKSync also supports Python, Java, Android, Rust, and Dart programming languages. Dart, the layer-2 platform explains, is the “unofficial” open-sourced SDK in Alpha. However, the layer-2 portal plans to support more SDKs in various programming languages to cater to their expanding developer community, allowing them to build more solutions addressing multiple problems. SDKs are critical for developers since they allow the building to be simpler, faster, and standardized. For creators to integrate into existing services, they require kits, which often include necessary documentation, code samples, libraries, APIs, and more, providing guidance when developing blockchain solutions. However, within any developer kit, APIs are critical because they act as an interface for dApps to relay information and coordinate. Scaling Ethereum Using ZKSync v2 ZKSync layer-2 is building a solution for users to quickly transfer ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens without paying the relatively high fees in the mainnet. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Jumps By 21%, Here’s Why Ethereum gas fees often fluctuate depending on on-chain activities.

Following the launch of the ZKSync 2.0 mainnet, there is a scaling and privacy engine using ZK proofs. Earlier, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, relayed his confidence in ZK Rollups that dApps on ZKSync leverages.

Developers are free to experiment and add more features. For instance, ZKSync supports account abstraction for users to pay fees in other tokens apart from ETH and build smart contracts in Vyper or Solidity. The layer-2 solution also supports Atomic Swaps. It is a feature that ZKSync creators say can benefit cryptocurrency exchanges.

42414653,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCtEt,1674036096,Crypto Observers Maintain Risk-On Bias as US Debt Ceiling Nears,"Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the federal government would reach its statutory debt limit of $31.4 trillion on Jan. 19.  Understandably, that's scary and might force crypto investors to reconsider the sustainability of bitcoin's (BTC) recent rally. After all, we are talking about the government of the world's largest economy with the deepest financial markets and one that controls the supply of the global reserve currency, the greenback, reaching the limit on how much it can borrow to fund its operations.  Still, it's no time to panic because any government shutdown won't happen immediately. Yellen has promised to implement ""extraordinary measures"" to help the government meet its obligations for at least five months, buying a few months for Congress to end the deadlock and increase the so-called debt ceiling to avoid a shutdown.  These measures could bode well for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, according to analysts.  Debt ceiling and crypto  ""Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that her institution would implement 'extraordinary measures' to extend the time available to reach an agreement before a shutdown is necessary. This will obviously include a limit to the new debt that can be issued, which will reduce the supply of U.S. Treasurys and – all else being equal – push up the prices and lower the [bond] yields. Lower yields imply an easier monetary environment, which is good for risk assets,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the ""Crypto Is Macro Now"" newsletter, told CoinDesk.  Bond yields represent borrowing costs in the economy and investors' risk appetite is closely tied to the availability of cheap credit. The lower the yields, the stronger the risk appetite and vice versa.  Since early 2020, stocks, cryptocurrencies and other risky assets have moved largely in the opposite direction of yields on the U.S. Treasurys (government bonds). Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell over 60% last year as Federal Reserve's rapid rate hikes lifted the 10-year Treasury bond yield by 153 basis points to 3.88%.  Phillip Gillespie, ex-CEO of crypto liquidity provider B2C2 and partner at AWR, a multi-asset high-frequency trader based in London, said, ""The Treasury General Account (TGA) has $400 billion still in it, so Treasury could use that cash to offset the deadlock in the debt ceiling. Some view this as countering Fed's efforts to tighten financial conditions.""  The Treasury General Account is the government's operating account maintained at the Fed to collect tax revenue, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, public debt receipts and meet government payments.  The TGA is a liability on the Fed's balance sheet and must be matched by assets. When the Treasury Department makes payments, the cash is withdrawn from the TGA and sent to bank accounts of individuals and businesses. That, in turn, increases the reserves available with commercial banks, potentially boosting lending and leading to monetary easing in the wider markets/economy.  ""We live in a two-tiered monetary system where entities (mostly commercial banks) that have accounts at the Fed pay each other in special money called central bank reserves, and everyone else transacts in bank deposits. When the TGA decreases, those reserves go into the commercial banking system, and increase the banking system’s reserve assets and bank deposit liabilities,"" Fed watcher Joseph Wang said in an explainer.  Assuming the Treasury Dept. runs down the TGA as expected, it could inject liquidity into the system and compensate, at least to some extent, for the Fed's ongoing quantitive tightening (QT), a balance sheet normalization process and a way of sucking out liquidity from the system, QT has roiled risk assets since June 2022.  ""The resulting injection in liquidity in the system, all else being equal, could go some way toward [damping] the liquidity draining impact of quantitive easing,"" analysts at ING said in a report dated Jan. 11. ""This, in turn, would be another supportive development for Treasurys [and suppress yields].""  Contentious negotiations  The U.S. debt ceiling issue is not new. According to the U.S. Treasury Dept., ""Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit – 49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.""  This time, however, the consensus is that the looming debt battle might be the most intense since 2011, which spooked investors and prompted Standard and Poor's to downgrade the U.S. sovereign rating from AAA (outstanding) to AA+ (excellent).  ""The debt ceiling never used to be an issue and was always raised without much fight. But then, in 2011, it became a huge issue and the economy took a hit that lasted for a few months, and the federal credit rating was downgraded. While most politicians should remember that time, or at least understand their recent history, this time might also be different because this group of House [of Representative] Republicans is clearly looking to shake things up,"" Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at crypto fund Arca, said in an email.  Per CNN, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recently told President Joe Biden that Republicans are interested in imposing a spending cap in exchange for temporarily raising the debt ceiling. Biden, however, ruled out negotiations, saying, ""It's not and should not be a political football. This is not political gamesmanship.""  There are signs of stress in some lesser-tracked corners of traditional markets. ""The price of five-year U.S. credit default swaps is currently at their highest monthly average since the tail end of the 2011 debt limit crisis ,which led to an S&P downgrade of the U.S. rating,"" Acheson said. ""Markets are more nervous this time than in previous stalemates.""  The nervousness may spread to other corners of the market should the deadlock persist for long, resulting in outflows from cryptocurrencies.  ""If we get to the point that the U.S. might default, or the world believes there is a chance we might default, it will be bad. The traditional markets will throw a fit at some point in the next couple of weeks if a deal isn't done. If risk assets really sell off, that will certainly affect digital assets,"" Hansen said.  Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, voiced a similar opinion, adding that ""the probability that sanity does not eventually prevail and the U.S. defaults still stands near zero.""  Therefore, the risk aversion could be short-lived. Moreover, the market instability could pull forward the much-anticipated Fed easing, as Bank of America's rates research team said in a note to clients on Jan. 13.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/18/as-us-debt-ceiling-nears-crypto-observers-maintain-risk-on-bias,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a5d902e8ded71f22299fb49abc189b232449908-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7717074,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516457,1674034245,"Shiba Inu Price Jumps By 21%, Here’s Why","While the broader crypto market has been trending sideways in the past 24 hours following its stellar rally over the past two weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is bucking the trend, posting a whopping 21% price. The trading volume of the meme coin has exploded by 150% to $810 million within the last 24 hours. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that the Shiba Inu price approached the lower end of the key resistance zone at $0.000013, but was rejected initially. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001254, reaching the early November highs. To trigger a sustained bullish breakout on the daily chart, SHIB needs to break above the $0.000014 level. For now, however, a corrective move – either by time or price – seems more likely as the RSI is in overbought territory at 86.7. The 1-week chart shows that SHIB managed to break out of a one-year downtrend when the price broke the falling trendline to the upside last week. With the setup in the daily chart, a retest of this trendline might be possible to build further bullish momentum afterward. Reasons For The Shiba Inu Price Rally The jump in the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) comes after Korean crypto exchange UpBit announced that it has listed the popular meme token. According to the announcement, South Koreans can now buy Shiba Inu directly with the Korean won. Upbit was the 22nd largest crypto exchange by spot trading volume within the last 24 hours. Also yesterday, SHIB was also listed on Cointree, an exchange that is even smaller by trading volume. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Devs Set To Unveil Shibarium L2 Network Beta Therefore, a more likely reason for the pump could rather be the launch of the layer 2 scaling solution Shibarium. As recently as Monday, the developers published a new blog post promising an approaching launch in a couple of weeks. Shibarium could be a massive bullish catalyst for Shiba Inu. With a market cap of $6.8 billion, it will be the second largest layer 2 solution, while bringing a lot of value to the ecosystem with its own DEXs, NFTs, metaverse, and stablecoin. Recently, the BONE token already caused a buzz with massive volatility. BONE is the governance token for ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that launched in July 2021. It is also interesting to note that BONE will be used to pay for gas, while SHIB will be burned with the basic gas fee. Related Reading: Whale Moves Huge Amount Of Shiba Inu Tokens As SHIB Unveils To Metaverse In addition, Shiba Inu will introduce a new reward token – TREAT. Many details are not yet known, however, it will probably be used in ShibaSwap, Shiba metaverse, the Collectible Card Game, and as a reward for validators. Finally, the Shiba Inu metaverse is scheduled for release in 2023. Here, the tokens of the Shib ecosystem will meet and 100,595 land plots will be for sale (similar to The Sandbox multiverse).

7714786,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516422,1674029734,Bitcoin Rally Pushes Crypto Mining Stocks Up – What’s Ahead?,"After a year-long winter accompanied by massive losses in the mining sector, the recent Bitcoin recovery is a relief to miners. Moreover, the Bitcoin price rally has rubbed off on crypto mining stocks as they witness the highest performance in the past year. In the 2022 bear market, public crypto miners recorded up to $4 billion in liabilities due to low profitability and stock prices. As a result, many miners who struggled to stay afloat resorted to selling their coin reserves to boost liquidity. Related Reading: Algorand TVL Hits $177 Million As Altcoin Rally Continues – Can ALGO Sustain This Push? Bitfarm And Others Record Year-Long Highs In Mining Stocks The first two weeks of 2023 have brought relief to miners with the BTC price rebound. Among the top gainers is Bitfarms, which recorded a 140% rise in the first 14 days of January. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. followed Bitfarms with a 120% surge in mining stocks. Hive Blockchain Technologies Limited also experienced a rise in its stocks to nearly double the original value in the first two weeks of the year. MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining index rose by 64% in January, while the Luxor Hashprice Index saw a 21% increase. The Luxor Hashprice Index quantifies possible miners’ profit based on the processing power consumption in the Bitcoin network. The significant increase in these indices partly reflects an increase in mining rewards due to the Bitcoin price rally. The 2021 crypto bull run led many private mining companies to declare their stock shares publicly. Many Bitcoin mining firms borrowed huge sums for expansion during the 2021 bull market, hoping to break even as profits come. Some invested heavily in equipment purchases and expanding their mining infrastructure. However, the long crypto winter in 2022 made these firms vulnerable, leading some into a financial crunch. The liabilities impacted their financial standings negatively during the 2022 bear market. The report shows that public Bitcoin miners have over $4 billion in liability, whereas the highest BTC mining debtors collectively owe close to $2.5 billion. These huge liabilities plus high energy impacted the operations of these firms in the winter when profit was low. Most of them struggled to maintain minimum operational standards, while some couldn’t keep up with production costs. As a result, leading Bitcoin mining firms like Core Scientific had no option but to declare bankruptcy. Spike In Bitcoin Mining Stocks Raises BTC ETFs Performance The rebound in BTC price in January is a breath of fresh air to miners. The once-declining crypto mining stocks have just reached new all-time highs. These recent performances also rubbed off on BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data shows that BTC ETFs have outperformed most equity ETFs. After a year-long turmoil, the ETFs reclaimed top positions on the performance charts in January 2023. Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) outperformed the equity ETF market with a 40% increase year to date. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, stated that the Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF is highly dense, with investments in only 20 firms, including Intel, Bitfarm, and Argo Blockchain. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears $1,600 Level – Is The $2K Mark Hittable This Week? The WGMI ETF was listed on the Nasdaq market in February 2022 but didn’t include direct BTC investment. Instead, most of its net assets (at least 80%) offer exposure to Bitcoin through securities whose 50% profit comes from BTC mining. Valkyrie invested the remaining 20% in companies whose large portion of held assets is Bitcoin. Generally, crypto ETFs performed low in 2022 due to the prolonged bear market. But things appear to be returning to normal as Bitcoin reclaims lost grounds. BTC is currently trading at $21,248 in a 24-hour price change.

Positive news brewed up in the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit that started back in December 2020. Just last month, Ripple was handed a small win as the SEC was ordered by a judge to hand over the Hinman documents which details the speech of the previous SEC director saying that Ethereum was not a security.

With the bears retesting the support, XRP might be in some short term pain as bulls try their best to reach the $1 mark. The token’s price would also be determined if the company wins the lawsuit. If Ripple wins, XRP would react positively and would do the opposite if it loses the lawsuit. But with Ripple having a good chance winning, the positive market sentiment would make the token shoot up in price. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears $1,600 Level – Is The $2K Mark Hittable This Week?

Compared to the top gainers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, XRP’s gains are significantly lower in the same timeframe.

42414652,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCt9a,1674024728,Ethereum Layer 2 Network Optimism Sees Bump in Transactional Activity. Here's Why it Matters,"Crypto traders and investors are increasingly seeing the Optimism ecosystem as a likely spot for capturing returns along the lines of the 100-times-plus multiples sometimes witnessed in prior bull-market cycles.  Transactional activity has steadily bumped on the scaling upstart in the past weeks, crossing over rival Arbitrum’s activity, which has fallen nearly 50% since its November peak.  Such activity can serve as a predictive indicator of forthcoming investor interest in any blockchain ecosystem, as it suggests buyers of underlying tokens and users of decentralized applications (dapps) built on that network, in this case, Optimism.  The Ethereum-based scaling product, which allows traders to transact on the blockchain network for under a few cents in fees and transacting times of a few seconds, is among a flurry of blockchain networks that launched in the past year, each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one.  But on-chain data shows Optimism is not all hype. Last week the ecosystem logged over 800,000 transactions in a single day, a figure that marked nearly two times the network activity seen in November, and over 10 times since June.  The total value locked (TVL) on Optimism holds just under $600 million, with popular trading protocol Synthetix accounting for 18% of all this TVL. Synthetix allows traders to bet on financial derivatives without relying on third-party trading and clearing systems – giving it a niche user market looking to invest in global assets – such as equities – at low fees.  Several yield platforms on Optimism offer annualized rewards of even 100% on some liquidity pools, data from DeFiLlama shows, which further attracts investor capital.  Optimism’s native OP tokens were down 3.5% in the past 24 hours, retreating after a 40% run in the past week, CoinGecko data shows.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/18/ethereum-layer-2-network-optimism-sees-bump-in-transactional-activity-heres-why-it-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03ee6b17c947154063f06de99badb8294a85a1b0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If this vision is turned into a reality, the ecosystem of Ethereum would become the most decentralized in the world of DeFi. This would also solidify Ethereum’s position as a major player in DeFi. With L2 blockchains extending ETH’s reach into the DeFi market, Ethereum’s price is guaranteed to follow Bitcoin’s rally. Solid macros are also a contributor to ETH’s current price movement. The recent release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US made the equity market bump in price collectively. Is $2k A Sketchy Goal? At its current price, ETH momentarily regained lost ground when the market collapsed back in November. But it might be entering a correction phase as the bullish momentum slows down.

Technological innovations will become the main narrative in the latter part of 2023 when the industry enters the recovery phase. Sector-wise, we believe 6 areas worth paying attention to, including Layer2, decentralized stablecoins, Ethereum liquid staking derivatives, NFTs, GameFi, and Web3 identity. The tightened monetary environment as a result of a strong US dollar has been destructive to the valuation of major crypto assets such as BTC (BTC-USD). Whether cryptocurrency regains liquidity in 2023 will determine the degree of recovery in the overall valuation. We believe the premise for institutional re-embracing of crypto assets should be a weakening of the US dollar combined with sustained softening of US bond yields. As sustained high-interest rates weigh down consumer confidence, even US Treasuries, considered a risk-free return, may be sold off. Investors will be forced to sell off treasuries in order to obtain cash due to the panic of an incoming economic recession. This is the opportunity for cryptocurrencies. The narrative of digital cash will be re-activated. Over time, global liquidity tightening may retard economic recovery and trigger a debt crisis. With the advent of 2023, the capitulation of cryptocurrency in a recession may be coming to an end. As institutional liquidity is drained, cryptocurrency will be back at the ancient whales’ gambling table. Technological innovations in the cryptocurrency space will become the main narrative driving the recovery in the latter part of 2023. The following are potential opportunities we believe can re-establish industry confidence in 2023. Layer2 will extend the Ethereum application ecosystem Layer2, as the mainstream expansion scheme for Ethereum, has two major advantages. Firstly, it can improve Ethereum's processing capability and solve the congestion problem on the mainnet. Secondly, it can reduce transaction fees and make it easier for a lot of applications to become practical in the real world. Now the number of Layer2 solutions is on the rise, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. They can interact with the Ethereum mainnet to meet different application scenarios and solve different needs. For one thing, the current processing capacity of Ethereum is extremely limited, which means a lot of Layer2 solutions are needed to scale it by executing transactions on Layer2. For another, with the rapid increase of new use cases on-chain, there will emerge more diversified needs for the execution layer. Therefore, we believe, as one of the major trends for crypto in 2023, there will be a large number of distinctive Layer2 solutions to interact with the Ethereum mainnet. Dune According to Dune data, as of January 5, 2023, the total value bridged on Ethereum Layer2 scaling solution Abitrum reached 2,091,981 ETH, and the number of users participating in bridging transactions was 511,711. In terms of other L2 cross-chain bridges, the total value bridged on Optimism, zkSync, and StarkNet is 457,648 ETH, 198,389 ETH, and 9,462 ETH respectively. Nevertheless, there are still many important problems to be solved in Layer2, such as block speed, security, reliability, etc. Through continuous technical improvement and innovation in 2023, Layer2 is expected to play a bigger role. Decentralized stablecoins will grow quickly in value Decentralized stablecoins not only have the characteristics of ""non-sovereign currency"", but also have use cases that can be connected with various activities in real life. In an increasingly turbulent world economy like today's, decentralized stablecoins with superior collateral, pegging mechanisms, and ability to capture value capture will become a choice of users apart from Fiat-backed stablecoins and stablecoins backed by other overcollateralized digital currencies. Historically, decentralized stablecoins have had two highs. The first was the wealth myth of algorithmic stablecoins led by Empty Set Dollar and Basis Cash from the end of 2020 to the beginning of 2021, and the second was the fever about public chain stablecoins driven by Terra and UST in a double-wheeled model. These two rounds of enthusiasm directly ignited the DeFi craze. The Block We expect that, with the continuous advancement of regulation and technology, decentralized stablecoins will be able to continue to play the role of catalysts for a bull market. In 2023, the decentralized stablecoins launched by leading DeFi ecosystems, such as AAVE and Curve, will support more real use cases. And it is expected that more and more decentralized exchanges (DEXs) will join the competition of decentralized stablecoins to provide users with convenient, reliable, and secure financial services. This part of the market gap will continue to be taken over by DeFi protocols with solid business volume. Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives will be prosperous With the Ethereum consensus shifting from the PoW to the PoS mechanism, the ETH supply mechanism has shifted to net shrinkage. We strongly believe that the future of Ethereum is worth looking forward to, and that Ether (ETH-USD) staking will provide the best risk-return opportunities. In particular, with the increase of liquid staking activities and the advent of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, ETH staking withdrawals will be enabled. This means that the Ethereum's liquid staking derivatives ecosystem will further prosper. At present, only about 14% of ETH supply is staked. In contrast, most other Layer1 public chains have staking rates exceeding 40%. If more people choose to stake ETH after the Shanghai Upgrade, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) services and product forms will become more diversified. Under the premise of maintaining staking yields, LSDs are expected to be deployed in more DeFi protocols and generate more income. Dune Although Lido Finance currently holds the dominant position in ETH liquid staking, with the innovation of other protocols and increased composability of DeFi, potential competitors such as Rocket Pool, Stakewise, Frax Finance, and Stader Labs still have the opportunity to capture more market share. Without a doubt, Ethereum still far exceeds other Layer1s in terms of block space demand and fee revenue growth, so this will be one of the most certain opportunities in 2023. NFTs will have more use cases Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) come with brand value and fashionable genes. These characteristics also make companies and celebrities willing to combine intellectual properties (IPs) with NFTs, and NFTs have gradually become a publicity method for companies and celebrities to upgrade their brands and manage their fan base. Gucci, LV, Adidas, Nike, Starbucks, Messi, C Ronaldo, and Trump, to name a few, have all tried NFT marketing. It can be foreseen that NFTs will become more popular among the newer generations of consumers in 2023. NFTs are also receiving more and more attention in some emerging technological fields. Take artificial intelligence as an example. NFTs have the potential to bring a series of new opportunities. In the future, we can use NFTs and AI to accelerate the speed of art generation, and at the same time reduce the threshold for ordinary users to create art. In addition, with the advancement of the NFT technology, there may be more new use cases in the future. For example, in the field of virtual reality, NFTs can be used for data storage and asset transfer across different virtual realities, which will greatly improve their security and transaction efficiency. The Block Therefore, from 2023 and onward, the NFT technology can be expected to play a greater role in more and more fields. We predict that NFTFi will be the next growth point, especially with the support of Layer2 solutions. Also, the NFTFi concept will become a source of inspiration for the next generation of crypto derivatives. Secondly, high-performance special-purpose public chains and DAOs with high community stickiness will further erode Opensea's market share. Music, AI, and other new NFT forms will appear in unexpected ways and attract more attention. And NFT projects that tap into untapped subcultures will be worthy of attention. GameFi will scale up and be more professional From the P2E model sparked by Axie to the M2E model set on fire by StepN and then to the follow-up innovations of various X2E models, GameFi has been driven to grow, making it the most favored Web3 track among capitals in the past two years. The continuous emergence of GameFi projects and various game incubators are also driving the professionalization and scaling-up of Web3 games. Footprint Analytics In 2023, GameFi models will continue to evolve. We expect more variations to emerge from x-to-earn (X2E) model innovation. More projects will get incubated. More game developers will join in, further expanding and developing the Web3 game industry. As technology progresses and the content of games becomes more diversified, more consumers will join in and the game industry will become more mature. In addition, new game experiences are worth looking forward to, such as augmented and virtual reality, which will make games more realistic and interesting. Also, it can be expected that blockchain games will integrate GameFi models and NFTs into more game genres in Web2 including MMORPG, FPS, and MOBA. New identity systems built with DIDs, SBTs, or the like will appear At present, a lot of projects are working on building digital identities for Web3. Such work will also be one of the cornerstones for rebuilding user trust in the next cycle. There is already a range of technologies such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and soulbound tokens (SBTs) that can be used to describe in image, reputation, and social relations of individuals in a decentralized way. They can be utilized to build Web3 identity and credit systems and facilitate the creation of a decentralized society. Web3 credit systems will form the basis of a new financial system, where various financial services from payments and loans, to wealth management and insurance, etc. can be carried out without relying on traditional financial institutions. We believe the below segments are worth keeping an eye on. Identity Management Tools: Wallets and domain name projects should be given priority. Both control important onramps for extensive users. Social Networks: Open and transparent play-to-invest social platforms, interest-based social networks and games in the Metaverse, and dating applications focusing on providing immersive experience and privacy are some types of Web3 social networking that have unique selling positions. Credential Issuance Tools/Platforms: Credential projects with high added value are worthy of attention, especially digital states and membership gated DAOs. vitalik.eth While 2023 will not be short of changes, it will also be the year that lays the foundation for the next bull cycle. We expect the market to bottom up in Q1 2023 and begin to show upward trends starting from the middle of the year. The liquidity situation may change significantly, and the US dollar may weaken. With improved liquidity, the crypto market will usher in a benign stage and start laying the foundation for a bigger bull market in 2024. In conclusion, despite being in the current bearish cycle, the Web3 industry boasts great potential for the future. Be sure to pay attention to related cryptos and tokens to get exposure to the space's burgeoning innovations.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570474-six-narratives-to-keep-an-eye-on-in-2023-while-crypto-recovers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7706934.jpeg

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin traded above $21,000 for a fourth consecutive day.  Insights: Why are tokens for metaverse majors rallying when the platforms are struggling to keep users engaged?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,017.20 +8.4 ▲ 0.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $21,215 +250.5 ▲ 1.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,573 +23.8 ▲ 1.5% S&P 500 daily close  3,990.97 −8.1 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $1,910 −2.7 ▼ 0.1% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.54% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin, Other Cryptos Trade Sideways  By James Rubin  For a fourth consecutive day, bitcoin liked the air above $21,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $21,215, up 1.2% over the past 24 hours but a marked improvement from its levels little more than a week ago. BTC's roughly 25% surge over the past seven days has come amid rising investor confidence that inflation is waning and the economy will land softly.  Ether was recently changing hands at 1,573, a 1.5% gain from Monday, the same time. ETH is up 20% during the past seven days. Other major cryptos were largely in the green with popular meme coin shiba inu recently jumping more than 12% and DOT, the token of the smart contract platform Polkadot, rising more than 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently increased 0.97%.  ""The fact that we are now flirting with $21,500 is amazing,"" JJ Kinahan, CEO of trading provider IG North America, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""It correlates a little bit to the equity markets now, in that we're starting to see people put out a little more risk. Volatility has come off there.""  Kinahan added: ""We're going to get up to about the $22,500 level, before you really start to see resistance.""  A day after the long, U.S. holiday weekend, equity markets were mixed with the tech heavy Nasdaq up ever so slightly, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 sinking, as investors weighed fourth-quarter declines in profits at financial service giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are among the first companies to report earnings.  And Silvergate Capital (SI) offered a harsh reminder that digital asset markets remain buried in a severe bear market. The crypto bank reported a net loss of $1 billion for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, compared to a net income of $40.6 million for the third quarter and net income of $18 million for the same period a year earlier.  In a note, Arcane Research, which provides crypto research and analysis, called cryptos' last week ""remarkably strong and lively,"" but added warily that ""short-term, the momentum seems overextended.""  Arcane noted: ""Last week saw seven consistent days of green returns for the first time since March 2022, and the RSI momentum indicator has pushed toward extreme highs. The recent surge has predominantly been fueled by a short squeeze led by consistent aggressive shorting. BTC’s push above $20,000 has been followed by a stabilizing open interest, suggesting that short traders have grown cautious, which may lead prices to stabilize in the short term.""  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB +12.5% Currency Gala GALA +10.8% Entertainment Polkadot DOT +4.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC −0.8% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −0.5% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  The Unlikely Rally of Metaverse Majors  By Sam Reynolds  Among the highlights of the latest crypto rally, in which bitcoin has topped $21,000, has been the performance of the metaverse majors: Decentraland’s MANA, Sandbox’s SAND and Axie Infinity’s AXS.  During the last month, Decentraland’s MANA has gained over 100%, Sandbox’s SAND over 50% and Axie’s AXS around 35%.  These three tokens have all outperformed bitcoin, which has only experienced a roughly 26% gain in the last month, according to CoinGecko.  But have there been any underlying changes to the user base of these metaverse platforms, specifically, the number of active unique wallets – engaged users that would be generating value – on each of these?  The answer is, not really.  DappRadar’s figures show that the number of unique active wallets has fallen 3% during the last 30 days. The number of transactions has risen, however, 6%.  To be sure, DappRadar’s Decentraland numbers are controversial. While it's debatable whether DappRadar’s measurement of unique active wallets (UAW) can accurately capture the number of users within Decentraland, it does, by virtue of tracking wallets, capture those that are transacting. These transacting users would be the ones generating value and having a material impact on the token price.  The overall number of Decentraland users would be larger, as CoinDesk recently documented, but this includes those that don’t transact and interact with the blockchain, like someone that passively watched a concert on Decentraland.  What’s causing the Sandbox (SAND) rally?  For The Sandbox, DappRadar is reporting an even steeper decline: UAWs are down 22% and transactions are down 54%.  On OpenSea, sales of the Sandbox’s NFTs are down 17% during the last month.  Meanwhile, SAND is up over 50%.  The correlation between the platform’s ability to monetize its active user base and the token value has become totally disconnected.  Axie Infinity (AXS) wild swings  Just like the other platforms, Axie Infinity’s user count doesn’t reflect the rocketship-like value in its token price.  Despite AXS gaining nearly 35% during the last month, DappRadar reports that its count of unique active wallets is down almost 6%.  The fiat equivalent balance in AXS smart contracts is up, like it is in all of the metaverse majors, simply because of a general uptick in token prices.  What about the derivatives market?  As CoinDesk has previously reported, traders are beginning to be skeptical about this price rally that’s seemingly disconnected from the fundamentals of the platforms.  Funding rates are a measure of the cost of holding positions, either bearish or bullish, in the perpetual futures market. A negative rate indicates shorts are paying longs to keep their positions open.  AXS’ open interest funding rates have flipped negative, implying that traders are shorting the rally.  Coinglass data shows similar trends occurring for Decentraland’s MANA, with funding rates hitting negative on some of the major exchanges. Sandbox’s SAND seems to be the exception, with rates remaining positive for now.

42421082,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRkz,1674003086,Crypto Speculation Has Had Its 'Comeuppance': Raghuram Rajan,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Crypto as a speculative asset class has had its “comeuppance,” said economist and the former governor of India’s central bank, Raghuram Rajan.  But that doesn’t mean the technology that underlies crypto deserves punishment as well – and regulators should be wary of innovation-stunting bans, he told CoinDesk at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday.  “I don't think you want to rule out this technology and say it has failed as a speculative asset. I think it's had its comeuppance. But I think as a technology, I don't think we've seen the limits of it,” Rajan said.  The industry made a splash in Davos last May following a historic bull market that quickly turned into the worst crypto winter on record. But in the aftermath of a series of high-profile collapses culminating in the infamous fall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, crypto advocates and companies in the Swiss town this year are already working to shift the focus towards building on blockchain technology.  Rajan agreed that’s where the focus should be. The crypto industry spent too much time chasing after the idea of creating an inflation-resistant “alternative to fiat money” that countered central banks “flooding the world with fake money.”  “I think that was a weak rationale,” Rajan said.  The problem, as Rajan sees it, also arose from advocates of decentralization who argued that every ledger of transactions needed to be decentralized and it could be done without “trust” placed in currency issued and backed by a central bank.  “Turns out you can't really do it, and you always depend on some central party,” Rajan said, adding the industry should focus more on use cases like improving cross-border transactions, “especially as countries start to get at loggerheads with each other.”  Read more: New Global CBDC Platform Could Cut Payment Costs, IMF Says  As Rajan views it, crypto’s future could depend on its ability to move away from the narrative of distrust toward central banks and finding ways to coexist.  That means regulators have to play nice as well.  Central banks, for instance, should not aim to “displace the private sector” by issuing digital iterations of sovereign currencies, Rajan said. He added that central bank digital currencies should, rather than try to compete with the private sector, offer a public platform on which the private sector can operate.  “I think, ultimately, that's a win-win,” he said.  Rajan added that, although policymakers should set up ways to “filter” out bad actors in the space banning crypto altogether – something that the Reserve Bank of India has wondered aloud on more than one occasion in the last few years – may not be the answer.  “I really think you have to be very, very careful about bans because then you arrest development,” Rajan said.  In India’s case, the central bank may be under the impression that most retail investors crowding into the crypto space may not fully understand the risks involved, he said.  On Tuesday, discussions around crypto in Davos indicated the industry felt regulators may also need to consider a shift in their focus and move away from obsessing over crypto’s threat to financial stability – which turned out to be a moot point as the contagion from the many crypto bankruptcies last year failed to harm broader economies – to make concerted efforts to improve consumer protection.  Innovation always begets some bad decisions and losses, according to Rajan, but that doesn’t mean new developments must be thwarted.  “Allowing some freedom within constraints that might be aimed at getting the excess speculation as well as fraud out – that seems to me a better way to go than to just ban any technology,” he said.

42414664,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD5uF,1674001718,Blockchain’s Non-Crypto Applications Take Center Stage on Davos Day 2,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Blockchain, not crypto.  From propping up climate solutions and delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine to moving on from the stunning collapse of FTX, the second day of the World Economic Forum's 2023 annual conference saw discussions very much focused on the promise of the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, rather than the often-speculative financial assets themselves.  The day began with a panel from traditional finance players attempting to draw a line under the FTX scandal – to note that, even if it’s a crisis for the cryptocurrency industry, it’s not a crisis for other tools built on distributed ledger technology.  “It’s important not to conflate cryptocurrencies and CBDCs, stablecoins and DLT …. they’re very different,” said PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman, referring to distributed ledger technology.  Despite the crypto crash, “the underlying tech has performed perfectly,” Schulman said. “The promise of a distributed ledger is that it can be faster and cheaper, to settle transactions simultaneously with no middlemen. That’s an important thing.”  Importantly, unlike previous waves of “blockchain, not bitcoin,” which mostly referred to permissioned blockchains, Tuesday’s conversations were OK with public ledgers such as Ethereum and the Stellar network.  Lynn Martin, president of the New York Stock Exchange, appeared to take a similar line, citing the potential benefits blockchain could bring to make equity issuance more efficient or allow settlement of financial trades to take place instantly rather than days later.  “There is a way now that some of the technologies have been adopted and used to really make processes much more efficient,” Martin said.  That promise of wider blockchain applications was later echoed by former Indian central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan. But ultimately traditional finance’s commitment to the sector may have its limits: When asked, Schulman, Martin and State Street’s Ronald O'Hanley all said the tech they were most excited about was artificial intelligence, not blockchain.  Just across the street from the forum’s main congress center, in a historic church transformed into a neon hub for hosting discussions about the future, Carmen Hett, treasurer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detailed such an application – a recently launched blockchain payment product for distributing humanitarian aid in Ukraine.  The pilot project, which was rolled out in December with blockchain platform the Stellar Development Foundation, is at a far more advanced stage than one would expect, Hett explained during a panel discussion moderated by CoinDesk chief content officer Michael Casey. Putting donations on the blockchain promises “transparency and visibility,” and the Commission has a platform ready to deploy aid instantly, Hett said.  “That's an amazing proposition. ... If we were to get 500 million (dollars) to deploy, we can actually do that today. So this is not a process that will take weeks and months,” Hett said. (Later that day, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister lauded virtual currency’s contribution to the war effort.)  Further down the famed promenade, big industry names from Solana and Ripple to the Global Blockchain Business Council banded together to launch a climate initiative that channels blockchain’s transparent record-keeping to help improve carbon emissions and credit tracking.  Consumer protection  Although regulators have so far largely focused on the threat of crypto contagion to financial stability, the trail of bankruptcies last year that wiped out billions of dollars in retail investments – most notably that of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX – may have highlighted a need for a shift in their focus.  For the traditional finance panel’s lone banker, the events of 2022 must make regulators stop obsessing about lenders bringing down the entire financial system, and more toward the risk of individual consumers getting ripped off by crypto scams.  “It’s not that the regulators have ignored [financial innovations]. They’ve said if it’s not going to create systemic risk then I’m not going to focus on it,” said Ronald O'Hanley, chairman and chief executive officer of State Street.  “FTX happened, somewhere between 2 and 3 trillion [dollars] of value was destroyed … a million investors or participants that were harmed,” he said. “There needs to be a change in regulatory mindset.”  That idea that regulators – including in the U.K., which is currently considering how to regulate crypto under its Financial Services and Markets Bill – might swerve in their focus was picked up at a separate panel hosted by stablecoin company Circle.  “There's a real real emphasis on consumer protection this year,” said Isabella Chase, senior policy adviser at TRM Labs. “Unfortunately, the U.K. is a real hub for frauds and scams, and governments are really aware of this because it's a real human cost for them.”  Ministers at the Treasury in London are due to issue a consultation on crypto laws imminently. The U.K. regulator has already said investors need clear, prominent warnings when they buy crypto. Lawmakers, worried about the impact on customers that may include their voters, may now be swayed by the collapse of FTX into being even stronger.  Other panelists worried that regulators might start to take too much of a broad brush approach to regulating the sector – unlike that taken by the European Union, which distinguishes among financial instruments, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and others using similar tech.  “Frankly, the Europeans are doing the best of anybody right now,” said Lee Schneider, general counsel for Ava Labs, saying that in contrast jurisdictions such as Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong were “just sort of saying all crypto assets are one homogeneous asset class.”  “Everybody knows that's not true, but everybody's ignoring it at their peril,” said Schneider.
