42398688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMTL,1443211034,Russian Ministry Proposes Correctional Labor Penalty for Bitcoin Crimes,"Russia's Ministry of Finance has developed a new version of its proposed law that would seek to both outlaw and apply criminal penalties for activities involving digital currencies, according to a report by Russian news source Interfax.  Citing sources from within the Russian government, Interfax reports that acquiring, selling and distributing cryptocurrencies would be punishable with fines of 300,000 rubles ($4,574) or through up to 360 hours of correctional labor under the new bill.  Should such infractions be committed by an agency or group, the fines for such activities would increase to 500,000 rubles ($7,623).  The federal executive body responsible for government policy and regulation, the Ministry of Finance has been seeking to ban cryptocurrencies domestically since it introduced a draft bill in August of 2014. The measure was followed by a series of proposed fines in October, and comes amid a broader push to fight against capital flight.  Interfax reported earlier this week that the Ministry of Finance had once again started talks on the subject matter of regulating the use of ""money substitutes"", a definition under which bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could fall.  At the meeting, the news source suggested it was proposed the government also be given the authority to block websites involved in digital currency activities without first proving that they took place via trial.  The talks coincide with a larger debate within the Russian government regarding which agency has the ultimate authority over digital currency activities, as the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank, is also studying the technology.  Of note is that groups such as the Russian Ministry of Interior have previously voiced willingness to defer to the Bank of Russia for ultimate decision-making.  The report suggested another meeting is set to take place on 5th October, at which point the Ministry of Finance would decide how to move forward on the measure and whether a draft bill would be submitted to the government.

42398700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMXH,1443202917,Bitcoin in the Headlines: 21 Shocks With Bitcoin Computer Debut,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  Following months of silence, one of bitcoin's best-funded startups sparked a frenzy of reporting after it revealed its first consumer product, to debut in November.  21 Inc, which has raised $121m to date across multiple, undisclosed funding rounds, revealed in an exclusive with The Wall Street Journal on Monday that it would be launching its bitcoin computer for developers.  Elsewhere, the topic of regulation weaved itself into coverage again this week after Circle Internet Financial said it had been granted the industry's first BitLicense.  Less positive news came from Australia, where bitcoin companies and traders complained of the bank's perceived crackdown on firms or individuals involved in activities with the digital currency.  '21 grams'  FT Alphaville's Izabella Kaminska, notoriously skeptical about the inherent economics of the bitcoin network and industry practices, was among the highest-profile writers to comment on 21 Inc's bitcoin computer.  Kaminska's latest piece, entitled ""21 grams of digital coke"", began:  ""In movie parlance, 21 grammes is said to be the weight of the soul ... Keep this in mind as we explore 21 Inc's big product reveal this week – a $399.99 Raspberry Pi that’s also a ""bitcoin computer"" – which, according to endorsements from Larry Summers (he of secular stagnation fame), Marc Andreessen and others, could be as big as the internet if not a solution to world peace.""  21's device, Kaminska added, allegedly lets users mine bitcoin in the background, while they engage in regular computing practices.  ""Yet the sum of bitcoins earned is so small that 21 doesn't even pretend that you can cover the original upfront cost of the device, let alone make a profit. You're paying for the right to waste electricity servicing the bitcoin network in return for a bitcoin shaving that earns you some sort of 'node' stake in the system,"" added the journalist.  Kaminska then cited Vitalik Buterin, inventor of the blockchain-based decentralized application platform Ethereum, who she said had analyzed the product's capabilities, noting:  ""So you're paying $399 upfront and getting $0.105 per day or $38.3 per year, and this is before taking into account network difficulty increases, the upcoming block halving (yay, your profit goes down to $0.03 per day!) and, of course, the near-100% likelihood that you won’t be able to keep that device on absolutely all of the time. I seriously hope they have multiple mining chips inside of their device and forgot to mention it; otherwise you can outcompete this offering pretty easily by just preloading a raspberry pi with $200 of your favourite cryptotokens.""  The journalist the adds that readers can find out more about ""how the 21 device is fundamentally loss making on 21.co (yes, a Colombian domain)"".  A killer app  Writing for the The Wall Street Journal, Paul Vigna cited Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz in his coverage, which focused on presenting the views of both the company and its investors on the announcement.  The piece noted how the product seeks to enable machine-to-machine payments, which at scale could potentially make it easier for consumers to interface with bitcoin products while also serving an important role in connecting more devices to the Internet of Things.  Horowitz, Vigna said, reflected on the company's potential revenue strategies and how the devices could transform how Netflix or media companies monetize, adding:  ""If I could read stuff on the web for a small amount of money, and didn't have to open myself up for repeated charging or subscriptions I didn't want? That's a relatively straightforward application if you have machine-to-machine payments.""  Vigna then continued to note that although bitcoin had risen to fame as an alternative currency, it's underlying distributed ledger technology has been gaining attention ""for its potential to modernise the financial system.""  Bitcoin crackdown  Australian banks' alleged run-in with bitcoin businesses and traders dominated much of the news flow this week outside of the US.  The news was first reported on by The Australian Financial Review, with Paul Smith writing:  ""Australia's biggest banks are threatening to hobble the hopes of emerging local bitcoin companies, by suddenly withdrawing banking services from their potential future rivals. Banks have sent letters to founders of Australian bitcoin exchanges, including Bit Trade and Buyabitcoin, informing them their accounts will be closed, without further explanation.""  CoinDesk reached out to Ronald Tucker, chairman at the Australian Digital Currency & Commerce Association (ADCCA) and managing director at Bit Trade, and although he declined to divulge specifics he said: ""To the best of our knowledge all, or nearly all digital currency business have received letters from their bank, or in many cases banks, advising of the closure of their accounts. This includes at least 17, with 13 of these closed permanently.""  Tucker added: ""Our members have been unable to obtain any formal clarification on the reasons for closure, except for references to policy or risk. Just what policies or risks these are have not been specified.""  Smith's initial report about bank closures was followed by a subsequent piece in which the journalist reported on the possibility that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was looking to investigate the banks' behaviour.  ""The competition watchdog is considering an inquiry into the actions of Australian banks for shutting down accounts of local operators, after being contacted by Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan,"" began Smith.  CoinDesk reached out to a spokesperson from the ACCC, who said they had no further comment at this stage.  The first BitLicense  Writing for American Banker, Tanaya Macheel, started off by noting that Circle Internet Financial had become the first company in the crypto space to receive a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Macheel continued  :  ""The announcement Tuesday comes amid an outbreak of worry from virtual currency startups in the young industry that has led many of them to pull their services from customers in the Empire State.""  Indeed, the looming BitLicense application deadline saw various companies in the space decide to stop serving New York-based customers, with many citing application costs as the decisive factor behind their decision.  The New York Business Journal also covered the news, with reporter Michael del Castillo reflecting on the BitLicense's origins:  ""Two years after New York initiated its research into bitcoin, the state on Wednesday awarded the first 'BitLicense' officially allowing the recipient participate in the business of crypto-money-transmission.""  The very same day, del Castillo added, Circle announced it also began accepting US dollars, thus marking a second milestone.  ""It's the first company to have both a traditional state money-transmission license and a cryptocurrency BitLicense,"" he noted.

42398690,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMUK,1443184288,Fraud Allegations Haunt Former CEO of HashingSpace,"HashingSpace, a US-based bitcoin mining firm, is facing an uncertain future following the resignation of key executives amid allegations of fraud tied to a past business venture.  The company was previously led by Timothy Roberts, a serial entrepreneur whose history dates back to the late 1990s. His first company, Savvis, was an early entrant in the managed hosting market and counted Apple among its early customers. In 2011, Savvis was sold to telecom giant CenturyLink for a reported $2.5bn.  Subsequent ventures would prove to be more troubled, eliciting federal scrutiny on two separate occasions.  Among those early businesses was Intira, a web services business launched in 1998 that drew attention for the hundreds of millions of dollars it raised from investors over a three-year period. The firm filed for bankruptcy in July 2001.  This was followed by Broadband Investment Group, a venture capital firm founded in 1999. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001, according to the St. Louis Business Journal.  In 2002, Roberts founded Infinium Labs, a video game hardware and software venture that became infamous in gaming circles for its failure to deliver its promised Phantom console and content streaming service. The firm later released a line of wireless keyboards.  In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Roberts, who served as Infinium's CEO, over alleged stock promotion fraud and unreported stock sales by Roberts.  The SEC said at the time that Roberts ordered the issuance of faxes that misrepresented the development of the Phantom console and predicted a 3,000% increase in the price of the firm's stock.  Roberts settled with the agency in 2008 without admitting any wrongdoing. He was ordered to pay $30,000 and was barred from serving as the head of a public company for five years.  Roberts’ last major venture was Savtira, a company that attracted significant attention in Florida business and media circles with its plans to launch an online e-commerce platform for merchants. The firm was founded in 2010.  In April 2012 Savtira filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, only to be forced into Chapter 7 in July of that year. The firm declared bankruptcy amid an investigation by the Labor Department into unpaid wages and lawsuits filed by some of its vendors. At the time, Roberts blamed ""greedy investors and some ex-employees"" for the company's problems, according to the Tampa Bay Times.  Now, Savtira – and Roberts, who served as HashingSpace's CEO and chairman of the board – are at the center of twin legal efforts being pursued by the Justice Department and the SEC.  Federal prosecutors unsealed a six-count indictment against Roberts and HashingSpace’s former CFO, Terrance Taylor, on 9th September. The same day, the SEC filed a suit against Roberts, Taylor and Craig Constantinou, a Savtira investor, alleging that the three defrauded the now-defunct firm's investors by misrepresenting its health and valuation.  Roberts and Taylor resigned from HashingSpace on 8th September, according to a recent SEC filing.  Blockchain hosting play  In an interview conducted on 2nd September, Roberts said HashingSpace planned to use its bitcoin mining activities as a means to capitalize on the rising interest in blockchain applications, which he argued would require reliable hosting services.  “We’re going to use our bitcoin mining as a catalyst to generate revenues and profits so we can build out our blockchain enterprise hosting,” he said.  The company, in a public relations push beginning in mid-July, announced the launch of its own P2Pool mining pool and its plans to build new data center space in the state of Washington and launch a bitcoin wallet service.  Further, HashingSpace rebranded the cloud mining system of Genesis Mining, connecting customers to that firm’s mining service. It also bought a bitcoin ATM from Lamassu, under the HashingSpace banner.  HashingSpace registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on 25th August, according to the agency’s registration database.  Roberts said that despite early stumbles – he acknowledged he and his team had run into pitfalls while building out their mining capacity – HashingSpace was on track to begin expanding its current capabilities. Roberts said at the time that the company had 100 S4 units running in three different facilities.  Once built, he said, the data center space will be used for hosting bitcoin miners, offering cloud-based contracts, as well as offering transaction verification for companies using using non-bitcoin blockchains.  Amid the company’s public relations push, the firm’s publicly traded stock – ticker name HSHS – saw a massive price swing from less than $0.25 on 5th June to more than $6 on 29th July. By 5th August, the price had fallen to its June lows, and at press time, a single share of HSHS is trading for around $0.03, according to data from Google.  When asked about the price moves, Roberts said in the interview:  “It’s a new stock and it lacks support. Having a stock is no different than selling a consumer product. You've got to get new shareholders to know about the company and support it.”  On the subject of past controversies, Roberts suggested that media reports were not entirely accurate, stating that ""if you knew the story behind it, you’d have a different perspective than what you read on the Internet"".  ""I go to bed every day with a clean head and no guilty conscience,"" Roberts said. ""Every business I have started has been with good intentions and unfortunately, as an entrepreneur, the odds are against you.""  Fraud allegations  The resignations of Roberts and Taylor from HashingSpace were prompted by the unsealing of the charges – one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five charges of wire fraud – and the restrictions, he said in an email, that the indictment would result in.  “The resignation from HashingSpace was part of this due to knowing we would be forced into pre-trial restrictions that would hamper our ability to run the company,” he said.  According to the Justice Department, Roberts and Taylor – who served as Savtira's EVP of finance – allegedly misled investors by lying about the viabiliy of its e-commerce development and the overall health of the firm.  The Justice Department said on 10th September:  “The indictment alleges that Roberts and Taylor made false claims in their marketing of Savtira to potential investors. They maintained that the company was profitable; the company had entered into executed agreements with nationally recognized legitimate technology firms; the company owned patents; and/or that the company was valued between $450 million and $540 million.”  Roberts, who according to court records was arrested and later released on $25,000 bond, said he was “blindsided” by the suit.  “We have a very defensible case and look forward to having to the opportunity to respond to these frivolous and exaggerated allegations,"" he said. The law firm representing Taylor, The Suarez Law Firm of Tampa, Florida, was not immediately available for comment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleged that Roberts and Taylor sold unregistered shares of Savtira and used a flawed investment bank valuation to pitch the company to investors. The agency also said that Roberts failed to disclose his earlier run-in with the SEC when selling the securities.  “Roberts and Taylor described Savtira, in both marketing materials and presentations to investors, as a highly-valued enterprise with patented technology and hundreds of millions of dollars in projected revenues. In reality, however, Savtira was insolvent and had minimal revenues,” the agency said in a press release earlier this month.  The SEC is seeking to bar Roberts and Taylor from serving as officers of a public company in the future, as well as federal penalties and disgorgement of any illicit gains.  The US government has also sought to prevent Roberts from selling or transfering shares in companies he has a stake in, including HashingSpace. The court previously said that Roberts was not allowed to solicit funds from investors as part of the conditions of his release.  In a 16th September court filing, defense attorney David T. Weisbrod asked that Roberts be allowed to sell or transfer shares of HashingSpace stock as well as shares in another venture, StationDigital. Roberts served as CEO of the music streaming service before resigning in June of last year. Taylor served as StationDigital's CFO before resigning last September, according to court documents.  In the request, Weisbrod said that the sale of HashingSpace shares would enable the firm ""to attempt to bring in a new majority shareholder by selling the shares which Mr Roberts currently owns"".  ""This could be done without any input from Mr Roberts,"" Weisbrod wrote. He said the StationDigital shares would be gifted to family members, who may then potentially sell those shares in order to provide financial support to Roberts or loan them to him.  US Attorney A. Lee Bentley responded in an 18th September filing by asking the court to deny this request ""because [Roberts'] statements about his ventures have consistently been inaccurate and the government would maintain intentionally misleading"".  ""No investor can safely rely on Mr Roberts to accurately represent the value of any stock for which he is involved in fundraising, which is or until recently was the case with HashingSpace and Station Digital,"" the filing read.  A hearing on the request will be held on 2nd October.  HashingSpace’s future  Where does this leave HashingSpace? Roberts said he couldn’t comment on how the charges against him will impact HashingSpace’s future.  “I hope for the best since a lot of hard work was put in by many,"" he said.  A recent SEC filing suggests the company is still moving ahead despite the resignations. According to a 17th September filing, HashingSpace has tapped a new chairman of the board.  Multiple phone calls to HashingSpace’s listed office in Los Angeles were not returned by press time, nor was an online representative available. An automated message stated that the company’s office was closed when reached over the course of this week.  The website for CloudHash.net, HashingSpace’s cloud mining service, was also not accessible at press time.  Amid the US government's action against Roberts and Taylor, Genesis Mining has put its relationship with HashingSpace on hold.  “Until the situation with HashingSpace is fully resolved and obligations fulfilled we have put our services for them on hold. We are all waiting for more clarity in the current situation,"" Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng told CoinDesk.  When asked whether customers who had purchased contracts through HashingSpace would still have access to that hashing power, Streng said this is ""entirely up to HashingSpace”.  In early August, HashingSpace announced it was working with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP attorney Marco Santori. Santori declined to comment when asked whether this relationship was still active.  Representatives for architectural firm Ross & Baruzzini, contractor C. Rallo Contracting Co. Inc., law firm Kane Kessler and real estate service Newmark Cornish and Carey – firms identified through press releases as involved in HashingSpace's plans to build and operate data center space – were not available for comment when reached.

The ex-heavyweight champion of the world spoke with CoinDesk prior to the launch of his first branded bitcoin ATM in Las Vegas yesterday morning.  Positioned inside the Off The Strip restaurant, the Lamassu machine has been billed as Tyson's ""George Foreman grill"" – and bitcoin's bridge into popular culture.  Many have accused the digital currency of having a branding problem, with Silk Road and Mt Gox still raw, but Tyson disagrees. The issue isn't so much about branding, he says, as education.  ""People don't really understand a currency based on numerical equations. I personally still don't ... but I'm grateful to be a part of the revolution and hoping that my participation in this space will lead to more conversations and help increase knowledge and awareness.""    ""In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting and I'm intrigued with the possibilities,"" he added.    Getting change  The machine, which promises cash-to-bitcoin faster than the controversial boxer's knockout record, joins six others in Sin City.  100 more machines are reportedly being planned. Profits will be an ""even split"" between Tyson and Bitcoin Direct, according to the company's CEO, Peter Klamka. He told the launch crowd:  ""Mike is a universally known boxer and celebrity whose fan base extends across a broad demographic. People around the world of all ages recognise him.""  Bitcoin Direct came under fire when the partnership was first announced in July. Pundits speculated the announcement could be a scam at Tyson's expense, noting the patchy Internet trail of Klamka's other firm, OTC stock Bitcoin Brands Inc.  Clearly, Tyson hasn't been put off. He says he already knew about the currency prior to meeting Klamka, drawn in by the idea of having options beyond the banking system. ""Options are a principle of democracy.""    This also applies to those excluded from the banking system, or those that don't necessarily want or feel as though they have need to a bank account, he said. Though he's not swapping all his dollars for crypto just yet:      ""Just because I'm intrigued by bitcoin doesn't mean that I have vowed off banks, nor am I encouraging anyone else to do so either.""

42398672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMEa,1443146775,Bitcoin Processor BitPay Reduces Staff in Cost-Cutting Effort,"UPDATE (25th September 14:5o BST): This article has been updated with comment from BitPay CEO Stephen Pair.        BitPay has reduced the size of its staff in an effort to ""reduce costs"" and ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry, according to an email sent by CEO Stephen Pair to the firm's employees earlier today.  The confirmation of staff reductions at the troubled bitcoin payments processor follows speculation, rumors and a report by bitcoin news source Qntra that BitPay employees were seen leaving its Atlanta office following layoffs.  Pair's email, entitled ""Important Company Announcement"" and sent to the entire company, suggests the move may have been taken with little prior notice to employees, as he indicated his belief the day would be ""emotional"" for those involved. The email was provided to CoinDesk by a source close to the firm.  Sources close to the company suggest upwards of 20 full-time employees and contractors may have been laid off.  The email reads:  ""I urge everyone to be professional and considerate and not allow the emotion of the day to get the better of you. It saddens me to have to deliver this news as it has been an honor to get to know each and every one of you and my privilege to work with you. And I know [executive chairman] Tony [Gallippi] feels the same way.""  Pair continued the email by suggesting employees affected by the staff reduction would be provided support during their job search, and that they would receive references from the company. Sources suggest some are already meeting with other industry employers.  In statements, Pair sought to emphasize that the company has recently set ""new all-time high monthly transaction volumes"", a development he suggests positions it for long-term success.  Pair said:  ""The road to building a successful company is full of challenges. The global market opportunity for bitcoin payments has billions of dollars in potential, but it won’t happen overnight.""  The layoffs come one day after BitPay announced it would shelve its ""free and unlimited"" introductory offer for new merchants.  As part of the plan, new merchants on its Starter Plan will now pay a 1% fee after the first 30 transactions they process each month. The pricing structure contrasts with rival Coinbase, which charges 0% processing fees on the first $1m its merchant clients transact.  BitPay has so far raised $32.5m through three funding rounds and boasts investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures and angel investors including Ashton Kutcher, Ben Davenport and Roger Ver.
