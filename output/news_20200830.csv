42422088,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSzy,1598821255,Crypto Long & Short: What Changes at the Fed and the SEC Mean for Crypto,"There has been no shortage of epoch-changing twists so far this year. I mean, seriously, take your pick: Even aside from the pandemic, we have riots on the streets of American cities, an alarming trade war, negative oil prices and gold briefly above $2,000/oz. These are just some of the loud, headline-grabbing changes that were once unthinkable but now form part of our new normal.      A much quieter shift, but equally transformative, started to make its presence more felt on Thursday, when the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, outlined a new focus for the institution: inflation will be allowed to run higher than the original 2% target “for some time” to make up for undershoots. In other words, inflation might rise in the short term, but don’t worry, we won’t raise rates.      You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.      At first, the announcement seemed totally “meh” – the only surprise was that his remarks were not more remarkable. Given the colossal government debt, no one expected rates to be raised in the near future, no matter what inflation does.      But, zooming out, Powell’s comments cement a radical shift in the role of arguably the most powerful central bank in the world. This is likely to influence more than just yield expectations: it could trigger a greater transformation of the Fed’s role.      This will, directly and indirectly, support the work going on in crypto markets. But more on that in a minute.    Origins    First, let’s look at a bit of history.      The founding Federal Reserve Act of 1913 did not specify any macroeconomic goals – the institution’s original mandate was to provide liquidity in order to avoid financial panics. The 1946 Employment Act shifted the focus to “maximum employment,” and in 1978 a new Act added a parallel goal of “reasonable price stability.” After a decades-long drift towards focusing on that at the expense of everything else, the financial crisis of 2008 jolted the Federal Reserve into again prioritizing financial stability.      That role gave it plenty of leeway as the current crisis started to unfold, and let it move into new areas that highlight its false independence. This could become increasingly significant given what Chairman Powell himself has recognized as a weakening faith in large institutions.      With the buying of corporate debt, the Fed is no longer just limiting itself to the printing of money – it is now deciding where the money goes. This is political. And with initiatives such as the Main Street Lending program, it is opening itself up to an almost inevitable wave of defaults that the taxpayer will have to fund.  And that's even before you consider the pain that a higher inflation rate will unleash on a public reeling from unemployment and foreclosures. The “average” target of 2% may not sound like much, but anyone who has been grocery shopping recently knows that the reported headline increases are meaningless to daily life in a pandemic. The Fed is effectively telling them that the whopping 10% reported annual CPI increase in July for meat, the over 8% increase in the price of eggs and the over 4% increase for vegetables (to choose just some examples) aren’t important.      We’re taught the Fed is independent from the government, which gives it the power to focus on the economy without political interference. But its increasingly embedded relationship with the Treasury is turning the central bank into more of a political arm. Its head is a political appointee. And its powers come from Congress, which responds to voters, who could conceivably convince Congress to make some adjustments.      Let’s not forget the U.S. Federal Reserve was created just over 100 years ago – the institution is not that old, in the grand arc of history. And its influence is not written in stone. For now, its role is significant and even essential as the global economy recalibrates debt and affiliations. But things change.    In place    Where do crypto markets come into this?      Crypto markets were born in a storm of change. In 2009, the year of the first bitcoin transaction, the role of the central bank was going through another profound transformation. The roiling markets were handing out unwelcome lessons in the hubris of assuming trends were constant and systemic institutions were immutable.      Just over 10 years later, we’re in a similar situation. What we knew to be true about finance and markets is now riddled with doubt. What we assumed just couldn’t be, now is. And the central banks that we understood to be the gatekeepers to the global economy, are struggling to define their place in a rapidly evolving chaos and rebirth.      Those of us working in this industry watch indicators of a new reality pop up almost weekly. Over the past few days, we saw a blockchain-based security token initiate an IPO with SEC approval, a long-standing and well-respected financial institution get involved in the launch of a crypto fund, and a state-owned energy giant partner to reduce flaring from operations through bitcoin mining.      These big steps forward take their place in the march towards the profound change that everyone working in crypto has been preparing for. Whatever our role, we are working on what we think comes next in the cogs of progress. Chairman Powell’s remarks this week reminded us that so are central bankers.      Progress is not just the realm of new technologies and business models, and change is not just about replacing traditional institutions with new ones. Everything evolves.      If 2020 teaches us one thing, it has to be that assumptions don’t last, and that we all need to be flexible. In a world where everything is undergoing a transformation, barriers come down faster. And, as uncomfortable as it may be, change is always an opportunity, especially when it comes from unexpected areas. In our industry, it’s what we’ve been hoping for.    The SEC is changing, too    Central banks aren’t the only venerable institution implementing profound policy changes that will impact crypto markets.      Earlier this week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the plan for the New York Stock Exchange to allow companies to list newly issued shares directly, rather than via an initial public offering. Previously, direct listings were allowed for shares already held by insiders. This new ruling will enable companies to raise capital on public markets without the expense of an IPO, while still meeting certain compliance rules.      This is potentially a big deal for crypto markets, since a handful of well-known companies in our industry have been rumored to be contemplating a public listing. Going the direct route will make this a lighter lift for blockchain startups, give investors a regulated exposure to the crypto markets, raise the profile of the industry as a whole and give us analysts insight into the inner workings of previously opaque businesses.  The SEC also broadened its definition of “accredited investor,” for the first time in 40 years, to include those that had passed the Series 7, 65 and 82 exams, regardless of their personal wealth. As a CFA, I am miffed that CFAs aren’t included (what, are we not smart enough?), but I’m taking the glass-half-full approach of focusing on the fact that change is happening, albeit slowly on some fronts.      A much more significant move is the launch of the first SEC-approved security token listing. INX, a Gibraltar-based company building a crypto exchange, is issuing 130 million tokens that allow holders to receive a share in the company’s net cash flow, as well as trading discounts. The offering price is $0.90, which could net the company $117 million, making it the largest IPO in the industry to date.  That in itself is pretty cool, but let’s not forget that it’s a security token. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain. And it’s been approved for public trading – even for retail investors – by the SEC.      Whether the business fundamentals hold up to scrutiny or not, the issue is a phenomenal innovation, and not just because the token itself will blur traditional understanding of tradable assets. As it stands, it’s similar to equity in that holders can share in the business’ success, but without ownership rights. And it could confer operational privileges such as discounts, and possibly other features down the road, because it’s a programmable asset. What’s more, it can only be held by investors that have passed through the know-your-customer (KYC) process.      It’s also a big step forward for a regulator traditionally wary of blockchain-based offerings, one better known for its punitive decisions and high access barriers than its support for new assets and business models.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    Although bond yields edged up in response to the Fed’s new inflation stance, the dollar hardly reacted, and even bitcoin’s and gold’s wobbles left them pretty much where they were before Powell’s remarks.      The S&P 500 hit a record high this week, having bounced back over 50% from its 2020 low in March. While gold has not managed to break its all-time high of $2,061 from earlier this month, it is still over 30% up from its March lows. For comparison, bitcoin’s price is nowhere near its all-time high, but it is almost three times its intraday low on March 12.      The correlation between gold and bitcoin continues to increase, as both are yet again acting as hedges against the dollar.      Speaking of which, the correlation between bitcoin and the dollar continues to head downwards.      Preview(opens in a new tab)      Just through pure math, a declining dollar will boost the bitcoin price denominated in dollars. But what about bitcoin in other currencies? Understandably, the performance is not as high, but it is still strong.    CHAIN LINKS    A filing with the SEC this week revealed that Peter Jubber, head of strategy and planning for Fidelity Investments, is the president of FD Funds GP, which is the general partner of Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund I, LP. TAKEAWAY: While Fidelity has not confirmed this, signs point to the fund being a Fidelity initiative, which would mean that one of the largest asset managers in the world, with almost 75 years of history, is launching a crypto fund. Let that sink in.      Blockchain investment firm Digital Currency Group (parent of CoinDesk) has expanded into the bitcoin mining industry with a subsidiary called Foundry which provides cryptocurrency miners and equipment makers with financing and market intelligence. TAKEAWAY: This is yet another sign that the cryptocurrency mining industry is rapidly maturing, which should bring new investment, greater geographical diversification and innovative market products that should add liquidity and resilience to an integral part of the ecosystem.      And speaking of a changing crypto mining industry, listed multinational petroleum giant Equinor (formerly Statoil, 67% owned by the Norwegian government) is moving to significantly reduce natural gas flaring by mining cryptocurrency, according to screenshots from Equinor’s intranet received by Arcane Research Friday. TAKEAWAY: The firm will apparently do this via a partnership with Colorado-based Crusoe Energy Systems, which uses digital flare mitigation technology to convert waste natural gas that would be otherwise released into the atmosphere into electricity at the well site that can mine cryptocurrency at low cost.      Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining company Marathon Patent Group has signed a letter of intent to acquire the mining-as-a-service company Fastblock Mining in an all-stock deal. After deploying Fastblock’s 3,304 ASIC miners, Marathon’s mining power will increase by 208 petahash per second, and its overall cost to mine bitcoin will drop from $7,400 per BTC to $3,600 per BTC due to Fastblock’s low electricity cost. TAKEAWAY: Lower mining costs not only give the operation a good cushion should the bitcoin price fall, but they also afford it considerable upside if the bitcoin price rallies. While listed companies generally have company risk on top of market risk, they can provide an alternative way to gain exposure to crypto prices for investors that don’t want to bother with crypto exchanges and custody.      The average daily volume of physically settled bitcoin derivatives on Bakkt, a U.S.-based crypto derivatives exchange backed by the parent of the NYSE, has reached record levels this month, signaling growing institutional interest in spot bitcoin transactions. TAKEAWAY: Bakkt’s futures with physical delivery allow investors to take ownership of bitcoin via a regulated exchange. Spot exchanges may be licensed, but they are not regulated since spot crypto does not yet have a regulator. Derivatives do. And many institutions are limited to transacting on regulated venues.      Nic Carter looks at the protocol architecture of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the role of fees in each. TAKEAWAY: This is especially relevant given the soaring fees on Ethereum, which throws into question its goal to be a widespread, high-throughput application platform (although the upcoming shift to Eth 2.0 aims to support this). Bitcoin’s relatively high fees also have a role in shaping its narrative (more store-of-value than decentralized payment system) and technological development (sidechains and lighter data structures).      Antigua and Barbuda-based crypto exchange FTX has launched a futures index for the top 100 liquidity pools on Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by traded volume. And Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, plans to offer fully synthetic derivatives based on a decentralized finance index. TAKEAWAY: You’ve heard me say this before: the innovation in terms of new types of assets in crypto markets is phenomenal. Here you have products that allows traders to use centralized crypto exchanges to access the performance of markets native to decentralized platforms, with leverage.      Ribbit Capital, an investor with a $2.6 billion portfolio of fintech startups including cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures (and a founding member of the Libra Association), filed a prospectus with the SEC for a $350 million IPO for a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Ribbit LEAP. TAKEAWAY: Ribbit LEAP does not yet have a business, but it intends to find one with which to merge, and could end up being an efficient public listing route for a crypto business looking to raise capital. As Nathaniel Whittemore explains in this great podcast episode, SPACs are not cheaper than IPOs, but they are more agile, which could become important if indeed we are heading into a bull market. In other words, with a SPAC, crypto businesses can raise funds faster, taking advantage of rising hype.

42422086,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSn3,1598804514,"Maria Bustillos on Tokenizing Journalism, the Death of Civil and Rise of Brick House","Maria Bustillos, founding editor of the digital magazine Popula, is also one of the founding members of Brick House, an umbrella of independent publishers operating under a collectivist business model.      An earlier supporter, and benefactor, of the now-defunct media startup Civil, Bustillos said she never lost sight of the possibility of a journalist-owned media company.      See also: Civil-Backed News Site Stores Full Article on Ethereum Blockchain      Brick House will launch in October with nine sister publications, each of which owns a single share in the larger company. It will have “no owners, no executives, and no investors,” nor advertisers.      The collective will support itself through $75 yearly subscriptions, which offers access to each of the founding publications: including the investigative journal Sludge, podcast FAQ NYC, and a blog devoted to “peripheral places in the world at the margins” called No Man Is an Island.      Bustillos dialed into a Zoom call under the alias Bluestocking, an old insult to describe a “well-read” woman. We discussed the fallout from Civil’s closure, Brick House’s non-tokeneconomic business model and how immutable record-keeping will prevent tyrants from chilling speech.      Is Brick House a reference to The Commodores song?      It has a lot of appealing associations, doesn’t it? I mean really. Tom Scocca and I were talking about the idea of a cooperative and how to protect press freedom, and I had mentioned we have to have a structure that can’t be blown down. That’s where it started, and we realized later the name works on a number of levels.      Part of the structure of Brick House is that you have no owners, investors or executives. Could you tell me what a journalist-owned media cooperative actually looks like?      Well, most entrepreneurial activity is based in growing equity. Companies are essentially equity that is distributed between those that claim ownership, with the idea being that eventually it grows in value and can be sold. Because of the nature of journalism – as a public trust, rather than an entrepreneurial activity – the idea of saleable equity and an investor/owner structure is at odds with informing the public. It’s been really damaging for the profession.      Brick House’s equity is not saleable or transferable. We invented a business structure that’s held in trust for the benefit of all the publishers that work in the Brick House. There’s an operating agreement for sharing revenues and expenses, but the actual equity – the company – is not saleable. Each publisher has a share, none can own more than one [share], and you cannot sell it outside the company – you can only sell it back to the company for one dollar.      We created this structure to prevent anyone that may want to come in and take control, or buy publishers. At its worst, this happens to shut down, censor, guide or shape publishers.      When there’s a hostile takeover, there’s an attempt to gather up voting shares. This has been the case with Sheldon Adelson with the Las Vegas Tribune Journal, the case with Peter Thiel and Gawker, the case with Joe Ricketts – those people had control of the business entity that operated the publishing.      If we can insulate the publishing entity – the company – from that kind of takeover, that will provide a level of protection for press freedom.      This sounds like the ownership structure of Civil, in that it wanted to create an oasis of media apart from corporate-run companies. Why do you think Civil failed?      Most people never understood the crypto-economic ideas behind Civil, and why tokenizing journalism was a good idea. It’s actually quite similar to what we’re doing at Brick House. The idea was that the token would be the vehicle by which journalists could strengthen each other's efforts. That happened through staking stories, giving tips, whatever. Using a token that was denominated in journalistic activity, Civil members could strengthen one another’s work in a way that was not equity-based.      After the demise of Civil, [I realized] the reason [initial coin offerings] were fought so hard by the banking industry was that it was challenging these structures. If you could raise money outside traditional VC or investment banking circles, you would cut them out, so they fought it ferociously. That’s my theory.      See also: Donna Redel & Olta Andoni – DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      I never lost the vision of creating a business model whereby journalists can strengthen one another’s work without relying on outside entities that have agendas that will eventually conflict with our work.      That’s the story of Gawker. There was private wealth that could be seized. The actual publisher was a means by which you could get at those journalists.      There’s been some press about how The New York Times has become more of a tech company than a media company. What’s the viability of just running a media company as a media company?      What keeps The New York Times alive is it has a lot of great journalists writing about things people want to learn about. I don’t believe that’s at an end. This is not the first time this conversation has happened. Radio was supposed to destroy the newspapers, so was television, now we see ‘the demise’ of local news because of the internet. But we also see a lot of people working to revive and who want local news.      The great success of Civil to me was Block Club Chicago, which has grown and grown. They were super smart and started off as a nonprofit. They’ve done everything right, and have become a fixture in Chicago that a lot of people rely on. It’s a model that can grow. We haven’t seen the end of blockchain in journalism. We tried one way, and one day it will become viable.      We’ve spoken privately about how one of Civil’s fatal flaws was its token-economic governance structure.      I was never a supporter of putting token governance as the first big project at Civil. I think token curated registries have a future, but they're not ready for prime time. I participated in the original token registry, even though I never fully joined Civil as a publisher.    Most people never understood the crypto-economic ideas behind Civil.    It just requires a huge investment in time to manage all the publishers. There were rules to follow and you were relying on the members to vet those that came in the door. And a lot of people came in the door.      There were a number of issues with how Civil tried to run itself. I’m so grateful for Civil, they gave us [Popula] its start. Everyone had their hearts in the right place.      But they faced a lot of regulatory headwinds, on top of all the normal problems a startup would face, on top of trying to start a publishing platform with many, many different entities trying to pursue different aims. It was a noble experiment, but it bit off more than it could chew.      The token curated system is no exception. It’s an incredibly complicated thing to devise and run, and you need people that have a lot of bandwidth to oversee it. The number of people that participated – and you see this in case after case of token registries – was so small, that they immediately took control over the project. There wasn’t this great body of government like imagined.      It’s kinda like Nick Denton’s Kinja.      I don’t know what that is.      Kinja was an attempt to surface citizen journalism alongside regular editorial content, by blending media and social media. It just wasn’t the case that you had a million geniuses out there waiting to publish on Kinja. So they spun their wheels trying to tap into the ‘crowd mind.’      Extraordinary things can happen by opening a platform up. But I think you have to grow it from a very small seed. You can’t just open the door and hope it will curate itself. There’s a million examples of this, where people think the wisdom of the crowd is available instantly. You have to work slowly to grow it like a plant.      That’s what we’re doing with Brick House. We chose a few publishers that are known to me and responsible and think in the same way to help structure this thing, so when we do open the doors to more publishers, we know what we’re doing.      Speaking of the wisdom of crowds. I noticed that a number of the projects in Brick House have come over from Civil. Including David Moore’s Sludge and Popula. Many of these projects set up micro-tipping features before Civil collapsed, is this a crowdfunding mechanism Brick House may be looking at deploying?      Well, we accept ETH micropayments at Popula now. We have an ETH-based micro tipping and commenting system. These are experiments that I really love. It’s not the time for them at Brick House, at all. Brick House has no crypto component.      But Popula is experimenting at a small scale with blockchain archiving and cryptoeconomics. We’re still committed to that. Anyone who is interested in doing it at Brick House is welcome to. We’ll show them what we’ve got, it’s very primitive. Remember, all these projects were bootstrapped, none of them started off with huge amounts of money. Civil was very, very generous. But a lot of money went down the tubes in the crypto winter.      See also: Crypto Startup Wala Is Reaching Africans with Ethereum Micropayments      Brick House seems similarly bootstrapped. The Kickstarter campaign is only seeking $75,000. Where will those funds be deployed?      All of this is being decided in advance in our operating agreement. All we’re going to do with that money is launch the sites. We’re trying to start from a shoestring without investors to develop a proof of concept that we can sell to readers.      At the moment, we really can’t sell anything to the readers. But we’re not going to say, we won’t start until we raise $2 million, or enough to pay all these salaries for a year. We decided we’re just going to try to build a simple version of what we’re talking about – an umbrella of publications – and present it to the market.      You mentioned earlier your belief in blockchain archiving. This seems at odds with a cultural climate where speech is chilled either through corporate takeovers and increasingly the crowd. Does your belief in the technology reflect a belief in free speech absolution – that dangerous or unsavory ideas need to be protected.      When people talk about the First Amendment they often forget it’s a guarantee by the government against jailing its opponents. The earlier method was to just jail the opposition. You could just shut them up, like what’s happening in China now, by taking the dissidents and putting them in jail.      The idea of press freedom as a governmental right is separate from maintaining the public commons – where people share ideas in a condition and atmosphere of mutual respect and open-mindedness. We see a million complications with that.      A lot of the nonsense we see, like with the Harper’s letter, where people are complaining about being ‘censored’ when really they’re being repudiated or condemned. It’s also free speech to express contempt for stupid opinions. I don’t think we should lose sight of that.      There’s a fantastic line in your CJR column announcing Brick House: I think you said ‘there’s a sacred right for people to express contempt.’ Is there a tension between the right to get things wrong and the immutability blockchain provides?      Look at it this way, if you lost a libel suit in the days before the internet, it was not possible to go into every library and remove every newspaper. There’s a balance between what is reasonable and unreasonable. The internet has given people like [entrepreneur] Peter Thiel an outsized ability, potentially, to expunge writing and ideas from public memory. Permanently.      I feel blockchain publishing is a pushback against that. Not a lot of people talk about it, but it should be spoken of, when someone like Peter Thiel wants to shut down Gawker, if the offending story had already been archived on the Ethereum blockchain and impossible to expunge, would it then have dampened the zeal of someone to go after a journalist, knowing the truth is already out there.      See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare      To some degree, archives in libraries, universities and cities are a bulwark against that impulse. The truth is not going to go away. Historians will find it. Posterity will find it.      Is there anything else you want to add?      We’re seeing the encroachment of entrenched interests in the blockchain space. More and more banks are getting involved, there’s an attempt by Facebook to launch libra, there are all these attempts to use blockchain technology to recreate systems of surveillance. I don’t think people should just sit by and let those things develop, or lose sight of the promise of blockchain technology to liberate rather than enslave people.      It’s possible to use these technologies – just like it’s possible to use the internet – to protect freedoms rather than threaten them. It’s a powerful tool in both directions.      I want everyone to support the Brick House. Like, a lot. Come donate money, send all the rich people over. I am not getting rich off this – I have one share like everyone else. But I want everyone to see that another business model for journalism is possible.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/30/maria-bustillos-on-tokenizing-journalism-the-death-of-civil-and-rise-of-brick-house,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5fc6c656b1e941ac62995b4b564d027af03f5cd-1740x1159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
