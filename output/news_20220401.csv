This is an expected development for a digital asset that has grown so much in such a short time. However, while some in the market lament this downtrend, it is important to look at what a correction like this might mean for the digital asset. Because it may do more good than harm in times like these. Is This Correction Bad? For any upward recovery, there is bound to be a correction. This can be either good or bad depending on the circumstances surrounding the market movements. This time around, bitcoin has begun a recovery trend after making significant gains earlier this week. Now, for the present market, this looks to be more of a good thing for the digital asset given where the price has landed.

Related Reading | Ethereum Bullish Signal: 1.2 Million ETH Exited Exchanges Recently At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,400 with a 5% profit in the last 24 hours. As NewsBTC reported, Hayes believes the current financial system began a new phase as a consequence of the war between Russia and Ukraine. The international community imposed sanctions on the former country as a response. Russia has been cut off from the international financial system, its social elite has been punished, and its gold reserves seized. The Vladimir Putin-led country and other superpowers, Hayes argued in his thesis, will push to dethrone the U.S. dollars as a global reserve currency. This will lead to higher Gold and Bitcoin prices as people will flee to stores of value, and neutral monetary systems.

According to a press release, the upgrade is code-named Ithaca 2 and replaces the current consensus algorithm, known as Emmy, with Tenderbake, which enables lower block times, producing faster transactions and smoother-running applications.  In addition to Tenderbake, Ithaca 2 prepares the Tezos blockchain for scalability efforts, such as rollups for WebAssembly and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, with pre-checking, a validation scheme that increases throughput.  The Ithaca 2 upgrade will also reduce the requirement to become a network validator by 25% from 8,000 tez (the Tezos digital token) to 6,000 tez, adding to the network’s decentralization, according to the press release.

Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) were also higher, especially AAVE, which posted a 20% gain over the past 24 hours (up 60% over the past week) because of the platform's version 3 (v3) upgrade earlier this month. Ether (ETH) was up 4% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 9% rise in Solana's SOL token and a 1% rise in BTC over the same period.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  Meanwhile, stocks traded lower for most of the New York trading day as investors positioned themselves for aggressive monetary policy tightening because of strong U.S. employment data. Low interest rates and central bank stimulus contributed to rising asset prices. When inflation rises and the economy overheats, however, central banks reverse accommodative policies, which typically leads to higher market volatility.  In the bitcoin futures market, an uptick in short liquidations occurred over the past 24 hours because of the cryptocurrency's price jump. Liquidations happen when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin.  Still, the ratio of buy/sell volume was slightly negative on Friday, indicating low conviction among crypto traders despite BTC's price rise.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volume spike coming?  Bitcoin's trading volume across major exchanges remains relatively low, according to CoinDesk data, despite trading activity tending to increase around the first and last weeks of the month.  The chart below shows large volume spikes, which typically occur during price drops. Some analysts noticed that BTC tends to decline around the beginning of the month before a recovery unfolds, similar to what occurred in February and March.  Neutral sentiment  The chart below shows a decline in the bitcoin put/call ratio, which suggests less bearish sentiment among option traders. The ratio has stabilized over the past two weeks, which could precede higher volatility, especially if BTC breaks above or below its short-term trading range.  The options market is placing a 55% probability that BTC will trade above $44,000 in May, according to data provided by Skew. And calls outweigh puts at strike prices above $45,000.

How It started: Apecoin? The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a 10,000 NFT collection that debuted in April of last year. Each item in the collection depicts a bored ape, and it was minted for 0.08 ETH (about $200 at the time), selling out in a week. What is the going rate for an ape these days? At the time of writing, slightly more than 10 ETH, or roughly $300,000 at today&apos;s exchange rates. BayC has become the closest thing to a well-known NFT anomaly, with big-name proprietors and consistent open befuddlement whenever someone chooses to investigate what those monkey pictures are, sees the sticker price, and needs to do a double-take to see what else is remembered for the case. What else is remembered is the club&apos;s enrollment, but exclusivity sells, and membership in clubs frequently comes with incredible honors. The Apecoin Token Drop! The ApeCoin DAO released its own token, ApeCoin, last week. In fact, the DAO is independent of Yuga Labs, the organization behind BAYC, but there is some overlap. On March 17th, a portion of ApeCoin was airdropped to BAYC owners, with Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) members also recei...",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | APE,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/the-story-behind-yuga-labs-and-apecoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
42394257,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvahDJ,1648843956,NFTs Take Hollywood: My Week at NFT LA,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) and their biggest fans headed west this week for NFT LA, the latest gathering of JPEG enthusiasts during the technology’s extended coming-out party, now in its ninth month.  The week began with warm Los Angeles rainfall, dampening the conference’s patrons as they made their way to the inescapable beginning of all great NFT conferences: a badge pickup line winding around a city block.  The NFT show is no longer a stranger to the road. Believers in this newly popular form of digital asset have flocked en masse to various NFT-focused events in the past half-year, beginning with NFT.NYC in November and passing through Miami for NFT Basel. Even this year’s edition of South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, had a major NFT presence. (I was fortunate enough to attend all three.)  From the moment I arrived in downtown LA, NFTs were in the air. Bored Ape Yacht Club holders flew around town in packs, hoodies blowing in the wind, their ape chariots (electric Bird scooters) fast as ever.  Uber drivers shilled projects on rides to and from satellite events, handing out QR codes for collections with names like Bored Punk Weed DAO. Outside the conference center, a woman performed an acoustic rendition of Randi Zuckerberg’s “#WAGMI.”  The Crypto.com branding on the Staples-adjacent convention center was a monied reminder that crypto’s influence would be sticking around beyond the week’s festivities.  It was new and yet it wasn’t. Compared with its predecessors, NFT LA didn’t offer that much that was distinct; but for the first time, there seemed to be an expectation that distinct was needed.  The space has found itself in a moment worth unpacking, lightyears ahead of where it was just months ago.  From Yuga Labs’ recent acquisition of CryptoPunks and its potentially unsettling bid for centralization to growing regulatory concerns on the legality of NFT road maps to the recent explosion of music NFTs, many are left with the lingering feeling that the space’s next moves will be important ones.  Enter Hollywood  The week started with an opening panel headlined by entrepreneur Mark Cuban. After Cuban’s typical takes on virtual land and a bit of shilling for his own projects, the celebrity investor brought out a series of surprise guests to the stage, which included the cast of “Entourage” and actor Charlie Sheen.  “I’m going to be honest, I don’t know practically anything about NFTs,” Sheen said to the crowd. “Or at least not as much as most of you.”  The joke, while well-received in the moment, underscored some of the frustrations attendees would have with the conference, an event marketed to NFT experts as much as newbies.  There were other moments during the week that left people with more questions than answers. Why is Waka Flocka Flame rapping about NFTs? Is that Ja Rule? What has gone wrong in the careers of these people that they now stand before us, presented as ambassadors to a movement they seem to care little about?  Maybe that’s a cynical way to look at it, or maybe that’s just LA. Nonetheless, these questions would go unanswered.  The backdrop of Hollywood, too, did bring out a certain side of NFTs that has been unsettling to even the crypto native. The promotional, commercialized aspects of the tech, with the conference at times feeling more like the Jimmy Fallon Bored Ape segment than the vision of a Web 3 purist.  That’s not to say there wasn’t a sufficient display of innovation during the week. A metaverse installation that combined virtual reality with sensory feedback was a fan favorite.  Hacksie Infinity  The major news to break during the conference’s first day was a $625 million exploit of the Ronin Network, home to the popular NFT game Axie Infinity.  The game’s founder, Jeff Zirlin (aka The Jiho), was able to speak of the historically large hack on stage, with details of the aftermath finding their way into people’s conversations for the rest of the week.  Members of the Axie community who made the trip remained in great spirits. At a satellite meetup at a local bar attended by Zirlin, over a hundred Axie players could be seen socializing and taking pictures with one another, the hack seemingly far from their minds.  “You would really have no idea that this horrible news just happened if you didn’t already know,” one Axie user told me at the event. “I’m just happy we can all be together and hang out. That’s what this week is all about for me. We love the game and the community it’s created.”  Sky Mavis, the company behind the game, pledged to reimburse all affected users on March 30.  #WAGMI?  There was another sentiment that’s been slowly building in some corners of the space since NFT mania began last summer, and it’s that maybe not all of us should make it.  I had this realization during the performance of an ApeCoin rap song in between talks on the main stage, giving me the feeling of being trapped in a promotional email for the next hot mint. There has always been a strong link between people who say WAGMI (“we’re all gonna make it”) and those who, without irony, don’t make it, and there’s no place that phenomenon is more public facing than at NFT conferences.  Nonetheless, the conference had its thrills, like a performance from Nelly, free pizza from PizzaDAO and afterparties in the Hollywood Hills.  NFT conferences more than anything capture moments in time. NFTs have been said to be in their “moment” for much of the past year, but this conference, more than others before it, reflected just how widespread that moment has become.  This is no longer a movement happening within the confines of Crypto Twitter and Discord – its ideas have spread to talent agencies, celebrities and musicians on the largest stages. Where it’s headed no one knows, but its momentum – especially in LA – has become hard to ignore.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/01/nfts-take-hollywood-my-week-at-nft-la,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90a95eeb9b54d8de14e0244c265789548b929428-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The underwriters are Cantor Fitzgerald, B. Riley Securities, BTIG, Roth Capital Partners, D.A. Davidson, Macquarie Capital (USA) and Northland Securities.  The company currently has about 116.7 shares outstanding, according to the filing, and if the entire $500 million was offered at the current stock price, the share count would increase by about 20% to almost 140 million.  That being said, the prospectus is a “shelf” registration, meaning there is no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered.  Riot mainly hodls, or holds, the bitcoins it mines, meaning the company issues equity for occasional capital raises to fund its operations and expansion.  In a recent presentation, Riot said it held 5,783 bitcoins on its balance sheet as of March 1. That would be worth more than $267 million at the current bitcoin price of $46,200.  Riot is underperforming most of its crypto mining peers on Friday afternoon, down 2% as the stocks of Marathon Digital (MARA) and Hut 8 (HUT) are posting moderate gains.

Ethereum Exchange Reserve Has Observed Significant Decline In The Last Couple Of Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ETH exchange reserve has lost over 5% in value in just the last fourteen days. The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum present in wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes down, it means investors are withdrawing a net amount of coins right now. Such a trend can be bullish for the price of ETH as holders usually take their crypto off exchanges for accumulating them. On the other hand, an increase in the reserve implies investors are depositing Ethereum at the moment. Since holders usually transfer their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, this kind of trend may prove to be bearish for the crypto&apos;s price.

Ever since El Salvador announced the launch of its own volcano bond, the cryptocurrency market has gone crazy. Infusing a billion-dollar self-governing bond into the cryptography recording system would be the first of its kind. After launching such a new-fangled and highly regarded element, is it prudent to disregard and overstep all traditional ways to conduct cryptocurrency business? Does the presence of Volcano Bond mean that existing financial institutions will no longer need to lend and support crypto exchanges? Well, that answer might not thrill the crypto enthusiasts. In order to understand this story, it is necessary to realize that El Salvador announced the concept of Volcano Bond a long time ago, and people have been waiting for its sale ever since then. However, the sale had to be postponed due to the war in Ukraine and Russia, which affected the cryptocurrency market.

42395709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyc0P,1648835892,Monetized Memes: Dank Bank Raises $4.2M,"The latest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace has raised $4,206,900 to tokenize and fractionalize the internet’s most famous memes.  Dank Bank, as it’s known, raised the pre-seed sum from lead backers Mechanism Capital, Samsung Next and former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan, the company said.  The marketplace sells fractionalized NFTs of iconic moments to compensate creators while building community through shared ownership, according to a press release.  Dank Bank co-founder and CEO Harry Jones, the former head of markets at blockchain-based information markets platform Polymarket, told CoinDesk that Dank Bank wants to dismantle the “collective of elites” who own rare assets by distributing the ownership among fans through fractionalization.  “You know, most people are going to recognize, like, Pepe the Frog and form a more personal relationship with it then will, like, a Rembrandt. A lot of the art that we think is the most valuable in today's society is a lot less culturally significant than the biggest memes,” co-founder Prez Thomas told CoinDesk.  One big meme can spawn 10,000 Pepes.  “The meme economy is the greatest use for fractional NFTs,” Jones said. “We can finally unlock the ability to invest in content as a collectible.”  Fractional NFTs allow for shared ownership of one digital asset. After creators mint an NFT, they section it into smaller tokens for purchase by multiple owners, instead of just one.  The market for fractionalized memes is not unique to Dank Bank. September’s record DOGE NFT sale for 11,000 ether showed demand for shared ownership of culturally iconic content. This “meme economy” was kick-started by the 300 ETH sale of the Nyan Cat in February 2021.  Dank Bank will spend its funds snapping up the intellectual property of various “culturally iconic” and exceptionally viral memes with which to stock its marketplace, said Jones. It will encourage creators to list the NFTs themselves, for which they will receive 100% of the profits.  Dank Bank will cross-check creators against their real-world identities, as well as their “copyright documentation” to make sure they actually own the rights to the memes, according to Jones.  Dank Bank operates on Ethereum, and will soon add Polygon, too.  “Dank Bank plans to subsidize the gas costs for traders” on Polygon, said Jones.

42394252,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagsn,1648834360,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Praises 'Bitcoin Maximalism' (Maybe),"Ethereum mastermind and co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post Friday that, with compelling logic and detail, defended “Bitcoin maximalism.” The post seems largely serious, though its publication on April Fools’ Day introduces all sorts of questions about his real intentions.  The maximalist ethos broadly resists change to Bitcoin itself, while also arguing that more complex blockchain systems have inherent and inevitably fatal flaws. Buterin’s praise for maximalists is shocking because Ethereum itself is the most consistent and high-profile target of maximalist criticism, substantially because of the fragility introduced by the complexity of its smart contract features.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In his post, Buterin frequently seems to echo these critiques of the system he conceived, including taking shots at Ethereum proposals to print money for developers. He even rhetorically badmouths his own habit of meeting with business and political leaders with questionable morals.  “Some of these people … are actively involved in serious human rights abuses that Vitalik certainly does not support,” writes … Vitalik. “Does Vitalik not realize just how much some of these people are geopolitically at each other's throats?”  While that’s easy to interpret as some sort of ironic troll, what Buterin really seems to be doing here is leveraging the inherent ambiguity of an April Fools’ publication date to highlight the nuance and complexity of the debate over maximalism.  His apparent “attacks” on Ethereum are best interpreted as making the case that the crypto ecosystem encompasses many different approaches, even when he ramps up the rhetoric for April Fools’ trolling purposes. He describes “team ‘blockchain’” – implicitly including many Ethereum folks – as “privileged people in wealthy countries who love to virtue-signal about ‘moving beyond money and capitalism’ and [who] can't help being excited about ‘decentralized governance experimentation’ as a hobby.” By contrast, he describes “Team ‘Bitcoin’” as “a highly diverse group of both rich and poor people … who are actually using the capitalist tool of free self-sovereign money to provide real value to human beings today.”  That seems somewhat tongue-in-cheek, since Buterin himself has endorsed decentralized governance as a useful innovation. But it’s always worth remembering that the creator of Ethereum spent years enthralled with Bitcoin before hitting on a possible improvement.  And he seems entirely sincere about the meat of his argument. Amidst the huge diversity of blockchain ideas, he writes, the Bitcoin community’s commitment to caution and willingness to defend Bitcoin with real ferocity are particularly valuable. As he details with examples like Ethereum miners frontrunning users and development-funding tax proposals, the feature-richness of systems like Ethereum comes with inherent risks to predictability and durability. Ultimately, the big risk is that some complex feature will threaten or undermine the decentralization of a system and make it vulnerable to hostile attack. Maximalism is also a valuable defense, he argues, as more money comes into the space, incentivizing short-term returns based on “innovations” that can undermine cryptocurrency’s core premise.  “Systemic effects are real,” Buterin writes, “And it's just not possible for a currency to ‘enable’ an ecosystem of highly complex and risky decentralized applications without that complexity biting it back somehow. Bitcoin makes the safe choice.”  That “safe choice,” as Buterin spells it out, is to focus on “just being money,” instead of introducing secondary functions that could undermine Bitcoin’s monetary proposition. “Bitcoin just being money reduces pressure for core developers to keep adding features to ‘keep up with the competition’ and ‘serve developers' needs,’” he writes. He credits the “toxicity” of maximalists with pushing back on the continuing pressure to “innovate” and introduce new risks.  See also: Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum's 'Roads Not Taken' | Opinion  Though Buterin doesn’t explore the idea, that “just money” ethos also benefits the rest of the crypto ecosystem by providing a financial backstop for the more radical experiments in the space. Sometimes this is very direct, with bitcoin serving as collateral for other tokens such as terra – though recent uncertainty about the security of cross-chain “bridges” could be a threat to that role.  I’ll admit I’m projecting a bit, applying my own frame to clarify a beau geste best appreciated in all its ambiguous playfulness. But squinting just slightly, you may see Buterin’s bigger point too: that when Bitcoin wins, everyone benefits.

42421192,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIaT,1648833534,Does the Metaverse Need a Free Trade Agreement?,"A centerpiece of Web 3 is the metaverse – an immersive online space that recreates and augments reality, as envisioned by developers, businesses and even jokes from the U.S. government.  Its most prominent champion may be web mogul Mark Zuckerberg – but Zuckerberg should beware: If his vision is a success, it could prompt a massive regulatory backlash from governments who normally seek to control the services that enter their territory, warns Sam Lowe, a trade policy consultant at Flint Global, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Zuckerberg’s vision of a metaverse where people from across the world can share and exchange may be nothing new, argues Lowe, previously a researcher at think tank the Centre for European Reform. Facebook’s existing social media site, and many online games that allow for buying and selling in a virtual world, already share its main features. But the ambitions of Meta, as the company is now known, may reach much further, creating an online space where people spend the bulk of their work and leisure time.  Countries already restrict trade for a number of reasons – they want to protect domestic jobs, or their citizens’ privacy, or what they perceive to be national security – and, Lowe argues, the metaverse could be next.  Worse still, regulators often come to new technologies after they’ve already bedded in – the backlash against crypto sites like Binance being just an example – by which time finding a workable solution can prove impossible. In the financial sector, for example, securities regulators are just now examining the role social media advice on sites like Reddit play in influencing investment decisions, and are looking for ideas about what to do about it. The EU and U.S. have also been caught in a long struggle about how to share personal data across borders, and Lowe fears that recent news of a breakthrough may prove short lived.  Anyone attempting to build a career in the metaverse could find that hastily thought through regulations could render their business model unviable after it’s too late, he warns.  The following interview, conducted via Zoom, has been edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: I’m going to start from the basics. When we talk about trade policy, I think of selling wood or beef to another country, and customs and tariffs. What else is there to understand?  Lowe: It’s all rules and regulations that impede or facilitate the movement of goods, services, data and, on occasion, people, across borders.  As you said, sometimes the barrier that we talked about is a tariff or tax, but more often than not, it's actually a regulation and regulatory requirements. So, you might be prevented from selling a certain service into another jurisdiction remotely because your qualification is not recognized. If we’re thinking about financial services, there is a requirement for you to have a local presence within that territory to sell to retail consumers.  So say I’m an E.R. doctor, or an architect, I’m based in Belgium: I can’t just go to the U.S. and say, ""I’m going to practice architecture now and design your house for you.""  Lowe: You can’t just show up and instantly start designing … you might need to re-qualify, you might need to go through a whole process. What most people think about is tariffs and taxes. But in terms of what academics, researchers and people operating in businesses think about is a much more expansive regulatory environment that either allows or inhibits the cross-border movement.  And lots of this is about visas as well. Even before someone checked my qualifications, they check if I’m allowed to physically come to the U.S. in order to work.  Lowe: Countries require work visas for foreigners to come and deliver even for temporary contracts within their territory – largely because they're worried about their own citizens losing out on work. It’s a sort of protectionist motivation. At the moment, for non-regulated services – advertising, lots of consulting and the like – there may be restrictions on your ability to physically go to a country to deliver a contract; there are very few restrictions on your ability to deliver that remotely.  If you get to a point where most service delivery is done virtually, do you then have an instance where regulators start to try and restrict that, so as to ensure that people physically based in their regulatory jurisdiction are not being outcompeted by people operating elsewhere? You wonder if, for someone to sell to Belgian citizens, they have to have obtained some sort of virtual work permit, despite the fact that they might be operating out of their living room in London.  So if I go into the metaverse and say, ""I want to sell you something here in this world created by Mark Zuckerberg,"" – I might try and design your house, I might try and fix your medical problems, I might try and give you financial advice – you’re saying that someone could come along and say, ""Hang on, you’re not allowed to do that.""  Lowe: Yeah. Let’s envision a global metaverse, so a virtual reality accessible to all. And we’ll pretend there’s just one, rather than multiple different ones. Underpinning all of that you still have individual countries and individual regulators and individual regulatory environments. In this metaverse, you could interact with people from all over the world, and just walk around by yourself. That’s not what’s going to happen. Underneath all of that, you will have restrictions on recognition of qualifications in the financial services space, you will have restrictions on the ability to sell cross border, absent physical presence within individual territories. If you then start to think about restrictions on data transfers, and the requirement for personal data in many jurisdictions to be held onshore, you might have instances where certain bits of this virtual reality of this metaverse are shut out to people from elsewhere. These are all problems that inhibit services trade right now. I think the reason the metaverse is interesting is it’s the most maximalist vision of the internet. It’s a new reality transposed on top of our real existing one. All these problems just become magnified.  This isn’t a new problem, right? There are lots of online games already where you can go into this virtual world, Minecraft or whatever, and buy or sell stuff.  Lowe: At the moment, virtual reality, and even the sorts of conversation we’re having across regulatory trade jurisdictions – it’s a niche pursuit. Lots of people are doing it, but it’s not actually the bulk of the economy; you don’t have people in countries worried about losing their jobs yet to people selling services. But if you move to an existence where the majority of economic interaction happens in the virtual space, then the pressure to regulate that space and introduce constraints that are more akin to those operating in the real world, movements of people and the like, will increase. That’s the direction of travel.  Of course, you have two forces. You have the forces in play, which say, ""Well, this is great. This will unlock whole new opportunities and people will embrace it."" But then you will have people in other jurisdictions who will say, ""Well, we’re scared of this. We’re threatened by it."" Add in the national security type concerns, the sorts of concerns you have, say, in China around information flows, and who knows.  You think the ideal is this global, interconnected metaverse where everyone can interact and be free to be whoever they want to act in certain ways. But in reality, what you end up with are territories very similar to what we have now: countries, or regions or zones. But then moving outside of that [zone] into, say, India is going to remain just as difficult as it is now, when it comes to adding goods and services to India in the real world.  And there are lots of drivers for this, right? You mentioned classic protectionism of jobs, but also there are data protection worries, and there’s the issue of censorship – making sure people can’t read newspapers in the metaverse that maybe they wouldn’t be allowed to read in Beijing.  Lowe: Exactly. And also, in the financial services space, you know, there are legitimate concerns about regulatory access to information and abuse of consumers. There’s always a reason these things are regulated, and quite often they’re not nefarious. We had a financial meltdown; financial regulators are a bit concerned about lots of different things, and they want to make sure that if there is a problem, they're able to adequately intervene.  There are currently restrictions all over the world on your ability to sell cross-border to consumers. If I’m in London, I can’t go up just marketing my financial product to retail consumers in Germany. I might have to set up a subsidiary or branch so that I'm under the purview of the German regulator.  You can do so-called ""reverse solicitation,"" which is where the German consumer just comes to me. I didn't advertise to them. But how does that actually operate in the metaverse whereby you could have a virtual reality where you can just walk into a bank? You have no idea where that bank is actually physically located. But you made the decision to go in and to purchase the product. So in the sense that’s reverse solicitation.  So a lot of these rules are about companies not allowed to market in a jurisdiction, but there’s really no way to know if they’re ""marketing"" on the internet, right? If you hear about it on social media and think, ""Oh, this looks like a good exchange, I’d like to see if they can do some brokerage for me.""  Lowe: Someone did actually respond to the piece I wrote, someone who works in financial services on the regulatory side, and they said, ""Well, I suppose the model here is something similar to the crypto exchanges."" Whereby people just follow them and start doing stuff, like Binance or something like that. But what's happening, they're getting regulated, and you having some countries where they just say, ""Well, you’re not allowed to operate here anymore.""  That seems to me to be what could happen in the context of this grand virtual reality, and it's a little bit frustrating, because I find all of this stuff quite fascinating. I spent a lot of my youth playing games online and had a great time. But then you think, all of these old-world problems that inhibit trade now, in a sense will just become magnified. Because if you are in a space where everyone's online, everyone’s operating virtually, and a huge amount of economic activity exists there then it’s going to get far more attention from regulators and politicians.  That’s my next question, whose job is it to fix this? Because you’ve got this institution, the World Trade Organization, whose job is to come up with treaties for when things change in trade policy. Do you think we’ll see something like a ""Trade in the Metaverse Treaty?""  Lowe: That’s the other thing we haven’t actually discussed. How do you govern? If you have a global metaverse, you also then have to govern trade within it. So the exchange of digital property – tokens, or you could have your own house – who do you buy it from, how do you get a legal guarantee to it?  We’ve got a pretty good treaty in place, when it comes to trading goods under the auspices of the WTO. There are provisions relating to services, but they’re very undeveloped. No one’s really managed to make any multilateral progress on anything new or modern. You do get some in bilateral contexts – say, the U.K. and Singapore, most recently, reaching a digital economy agreement that has sorts of commitments to refrain from data localization, placing duties on data flows and the like, but it’s very piecemeal.  My view is that in terms of how this will develop, individual countries, and particularly the larger ones – the U.S., European Union, India, China – will introduce their own piecemeal approach to all of this and it won't be a collective vision. It won’t be, ""We will think about how we regulate the metaverse,"" it will just be, ""Well, we’ll think about how we regulate the fact that we’ve got all of these people providing consulting services from the other side of the world and displacing our local consultants."" And the regulation you introduced to deal with that has an impact on what you can do in the metaverse.  So if the WTO hasn’t even caught up with the internet yet, or with the digital economy, which is already getting a bit old, then there's little hope of catching up in the metaverse.  Lowe: Exactly. The issue here is, when you talk to people at the cutting edge of technology, quite often they operate in a regulatory gray area. The thing that does need to be at the front of your mind is: What happens when the regulatory environment catches up with you? Is your product still viable?  It’s the Uber model, if I can call it that: You’re not quite sure whether the taxi licenses apply. So you just go in, and wait until you become such a big part of people’s lives that they’re not going to do anything about it.  Lowe: Yeah, and it can work. But I think we’re also seeing it in the crypto space. It’s taken a little while, but it looks to me as if some of the bigger financial regulators are moving into that space, and some business models will work, and some won’t as a result. It’s the same here. If you’re going into this, assuming you’re just going to have some sort of globally interlinked metaverse, where everything is doable and available, it probably won’t operate like that.  So there’ll be bumps along the road, and they’re all looking like they’re unpredictable.  Lowe: I think a few of them are actually quite predictable, but maybe not fully thought through.  Right. I just want to come back to a point you’ve raised a couple of times about data. It seems like, whatever the metaverse is, it’s going to be based on data, and probably data about people. This has been an area of quite a lot of barriers in the past. How important was this agreement between the U.S. and the EU last week, the ""Privacy Shield?""  Lowe: So that was a really good step forward. It’s not been impossible to transfer personal data between the EU and the U.S. in the absence of agreement, it’s just required contracts – standard contractual clauses and the like, and it’s created impediments.  If the EU and U.S. have an adequacy agreement again, the movement of that data just becomes much easier, and requires less legal involvement. If I were a company, I would not be relying on that for a little while because it will be subject to legal challenge. It could easily fall away again.  In the context of a metaverse, the sort of approach most conducive to its operation would be for people themselves to have much greater individual ownership over their data and what they can choose to do with it and how they choose to share it. But again, I’m not necessarily sure that’s the direction of travel.  So that’s just two jurisdictions, and even then they are having difficulties, and it’s not quite clear they’ve resolved their differences, once you take the courts into account. So who knows what the other 192 countries in the world will throw in.  Lowe: In many countries, the trend is towards greater data localization. Some of that is under the auspices of privacy and personal data, but you also have it under the auspice of national security concerns. The fear is that, if data isn’t stored and processed locally, countries will not be able to secure their own security.  That’s actually quite a difficult discussion to have because, for a country’s perception of what's necessary to guarantee its own security and survival, one person's idea of that might be very different from another’s.  As we’re seeing in global politics at the moment. So, if you’re Mark Zuckerberg, and you’ve staked your extremely large company on this vision of a metaverse, how big of a worry is this?  Lowe: It’s not necessarily something to be worried about. Facebook itself is the nascent metaverse to a degree. You don’t have the virtual reality, but you have lots of people interacting and sharing personal data. So you’ve already got proof of concept.  If it succeeds, if it brings in the numbers of people desired, if you have people living large quantities of their personal and working lives on it, it will come under greater regulatory scrutiny. And there are already a number of existing trends when it comes to trade in services, when it comes to restrictions on movement of people, of data, that suggests that it will come to a head at some point, and some governments will go in different directions. It's not like everyone's going to be a problem here. But it certainly could. Managing that and educating people will be quite important to ensuring success.  It’s a bit more speculative than ""Can we eat U.S. beef in the EU?""  Lowe: But it’s speculative in a nice way: You can be pretty confident that issues are going to emerge, then it’s just trying to work out what they are and how they could be managed.  Indeed. One to keep a close eye on.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin sees exchange inflows. The U.S. economy added fewer jobs in March amid recession fears.  Featured Story: Bitcoin's recent rally is characterized by persistent flat-to-negative perpetuals funding rates, a sign of low risk appetite in the market.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Jason Guthrie, head of digital assets, Europe, WisdomTree  Rep. Stephen Lynch, Massachusetts (D)  Jim Jones, rapper and entrepreneur  Rob Richardson, CEO, Disrupt Art  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Cryptocurrencies traded under pressure after the European Union Parliament approved a bill targeting ""unhosted wallets"" – software/hardware facilitating holding, storage and transfer of crypto, which is not hosted by a third party, such as a financial institution or a credit service provider.  Under the new regulation, exchanges would have to do a know-your-customer (KYC) of owners of unhosted wallets. The committees will vote on the ""Transfer of Funds Regulation"" on Friday.  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to $44,300 before recovering to $45,000, tracking the uptick in U.S. stock futures.  Blockchain data tracked by IntoTheBlock showed that $200 million worth of bitcoin was deposited into centralized exchanges in seven days. Investors usually transfer coins to exchanges when intending to liquidate their holdings.  However, institutional activity was bullish, with exchange-traded funds registering an inflow of 4,469 BTC last week, pushing the total holdings to a new lifetime high, according to ByteTree Asset Management.  Data released at 12:30 UTC showed the U.S. economy added slightly fewer jobs than expected in March amid soaring inflation and recession fears. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 431,000 for the month, missing the forecast of 490,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Average hourly earnings, a closely watched inflation metric, increased 0.4% on the month and 5.6% on the year.  ""A strong labor market could cause a short-term drawdown in bitcoin due to a potential rise in the dollar and pressure on equity markets. However, rising U.S. incomes are a positive signal for cryptocurrency in the longer term,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  ""It increases demand for it when we see an increasing pull to hedge our savings against inflation. Still, bonds and equities remain overvalued for current conditions,"" Kuptsikevich added.

The average perpetual funding rate or the cost associated with holding long or short perpetual futures on prominent crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit remains under zero, signaling a neutral-to-bearish bias.  ""Funding rates on Binance and Bybit have now been neutral to below neutral for 118 consecutive days,"" Vetle Lunde, market analyst at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. ""This illustrates the long-lasting poor sentiment in the market, and accompanied by the low futures basis [single-digit premium], it's pretty clear that the demand to add long exposure is, and has been, low for a prolonged duration.""  A positive and rising funding rate means leverage traders are making bullish bets, a sign of risk-on sentiment. Meanwhile, a negative funding rates means leverage is skewed bearish.  The low participation from derivative traders is perhaps a good sign as it means the cryptocurrency is less vulnerable to sudden and sharp price drops, called leverage washouts.  Bull run in early stages  The spread between the front month and the next month futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) remains locked in the $0 to $205 range, which has historically been the case during the early stages of the rally.  Parabolic runs that kicked off in early October 2021 and December 2021 coincided with the spread moving well above $205. On the contrary, tightening of the spread to zero has marked significant bottoms in the past.

42394269,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvap9h,1648828891,NFT Punks With the FU Money,"“You know what’s really punk? One billion dollars.”  That line, from Wave Financial co-founder Les Borsai, a music manager-turned-NFT investor, stuck with me this week throughout NFT.LA, the latest in a series of non-fungible token events that have sprung up around the U.S., this one in the storytelling capital of the world.  The spirit of punk, of rebellion, of anti-establishment expression has always run deep in the crypto community, taking its strongest expression in the blockchain principle of “permissionless innovation.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The “permissionlessness” concept stems from the technology’s open-source protocols and decentralized validation networks, which enable direct, peer-to-peer value exchange. Developers are free to build applications without having to ask the permission of say, a Web 2 internet platform, or a bank, or even a government. The degree to which different blockchains are truly “censorship resistant” is a matter of constant debate, but the idea is that decentralized architecture enables innovation.  My conversations this week with numerous Los Angeles-based digital artists opened up a different perspective. As they eagerly opened their iPhones to show me their latest NFT drop or other creative venture, it occurred to me there’s an even more powerful source of permissionlessness being unleashed in this space: money.  NFTs are generating a giant pool of dosh. And, proportionally, more of it is now flowing into the hands of creators than traditionally in LA, where the arts and entertainment economy’s terms have historically been set by music labels, film studios, talent agents and other interlopers.  A great deal of that money is staying inside the ether ecosystem in which it is generated, rather than being returned to dollars. It’s now being redeployed into new investments in the space, sometimes leveraged for maximum impact with decentralized finance (DeFi) bets or fed into decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that allow creators to pool resources and underwrite ever more new creative projects.  Money matters  For now at least, this virtuous circle of money and creativity seems unstoppable. But, of course, the NFT boom and the energy it seeds at conferences like this one – including the NFT.NYC conference, which stirred similar thoughts last year – could all be just hot air, the output of an unsustainable bubble.  For one, the legal framework for intellectual property in NFTs remains highly uncertain. Also, there’s a fear that content-management power is being centralized with giant marketplaces like OpenSea or with creator projects like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club – in other words, that new intermediaries are forming to replace the old ones.  Moreover, the underlying blockchain architecture is not yet able to scale in a sufficiently decentralized manner to accommodate all the NFT projects underway. As a Polygon developer once put it to me, “These guys are launching Formula One race cars before we’ve built the track.”  But perhaps such concerns are moot. Even if the legal and technological framework underpinning NFTs isn’t yet fully supportive of a truly decentralized, creator-centric content economy, many artists are creating direct-to-customer products that generate, in many cases, real “FU money.” They can tell the Hollywood intermediaries to take a hike.  The possibility of financial liberation is the most powerful force at work in the NFT economy. It’s why we’re seeing digital creativity and collaboration like we’ve never seen before – not only in these art and music projects, but in new models for derivative works, cross-creator collaboration, fan engagement and community building.  Creatives unleashed  Take filmmaker Matteo Santoro. He shared with me this scene, part of a “100 Tombstones” NFT drop to fund a film set in a future world called SIFT. The quality of production might suggest the work of a big-budget team at Universal Studios or Pixar. But it’s mostly just Santoro. Using CGI, some scrappy set creation in his garage and a great deal of imagination, Santoro is the solo director, animator, actor and producer of the entire project.  This stuff must be terrifying for the big Hollywood studios – and I don’t mean the dystopian imagery.  Or consider David Bianchi, a Hollywood actor who has simultaneously created a new art form and a new business model: poetry-based short films funded with the spoken-word NFTs. His first project, “I Can’t Breathe,” a haunting meditation on the death of George Floyd, won an award and delivered 100% of the proceeds from its sale as an NFT to the George Floyd Foundation.  Bianchi is now doing live performances, videoing them and layering high-tech effects to create unique digital artifacts that attendees and outsiders can buy there and then.  It’s an approach that’s now challenging the old “starving poet” trope. Peace Uche, a medical doctor who performs under the stage name Doc Peace, has released spoken word NFTs aimed at inspiring female empowerment. “David Bianchi lit the fire and I'm here as a female spoken word artist to carry the torch,” she said.  This new model isn’t just for existing, established creators to find new avenues for their craft, either. Younger crypto natives are generating money that up-and-coming artists could rarely have imagined previously. Example: Diana Sinclair, a celebrated 18-year-old visual artist and curator, who will be appearing at CoinDesk’s Consensus Festival in June.  The instant success does not appear to have gone to Sinclair’s head. At an event at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, earlier this month, she staged an art project in which people lined up to sit and talk before taking a selfie with her. All the participants I spoke to said they were blown away by the vision, empathy and sense of leadership exuded by this young woman.  It’s hard for progressive-minded people to avoid a negative knee-jerk reaction to the billions of dollars sloshing around the NFT economy, which seems to have created, in some quarters, an ethos of excess and exclusivity. I mean, how, exactly, is the world being changed for the better by a club of crypto bros touting their cartoon ape avatars? (I do have potential answers to that question, but that’s for a different column.)  What I’m getting at here is that it’s really hard to separate the excesses fostered by this river of money from the independent creativity it also enables.

42395708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASybzQ,1648820297,SEC Rejects Spot Bitcoin ETF Application From Ark 21Shares,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected an application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Ark 21Shares, according to a filing, citing a lack of investor protections. Ark is run by star investor Cathie Wood.  The application was filed on behalf of the Cboe BZX Exchange to change the rules and allow for the listing of the Ark 21Shares offering.  “The Commission concludes that BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), and in particular, the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest,’” the SEC wrote in its decision.  Ark Investment Management and investment-product firm 21Shares had teamed up to launch the product last July. The initial application from Ark 21Shares was delayed multiple times, the last time in January.  The move comes after multiple rejections and delays for spot bitcoin ETFs, with SEC chair Gary Gensler stating a clear preference for bitcoin (BTC) ETF's that trade bitcoin futures. In early March, the SEC delayed decisions on applications for spot bitcoin ETFs from both WisdomTree and One River Asset Management. Prior to that, the commission rejected NYDIG and Global X’s spot bitcoin ETF proposals, as well as applications from Fidelity, First Trust, Kryptoin and VanEck.  Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence said in March that spot bitcoin ETFs could start to garner some approvals by mid-2023 given a proposed SEC rule change that redefines exchanges.

42395710,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyc3M,1648818362,Bitcoin Drops to $45K Support as Analysts Point Out Seasonally Bullish April Month Ahead,"Bitcoin briefly dropped under support at $45,000 before recovering as it heads toward a seasonally bullish April, a month that has chalked up gains for the asset in seven out of the past 10 years, data shows.  “No one knows for sure what's the explanation for the usual 'April's Bull,'” shared Asaf Naim, CEO of bitcoin development company Kirobo, in a Telegram message. “Some speculate that it's a psychological phenomenon tied to the beginning of spring.”  “After the bullish trend of mid-January until the end of February (that includes the aftermath of Christmas and the Chinese New Year) comes to a downturn, which later changes to a bull run in early April,” he added.  Bitcoin traded as low as $44,200 on Thursday night after a two-month-high of $48,000 on Wednesday. Traders, however, bid up bitcoin to support at $45,000. Losing current levels over the weekend could see bitcoin drop to $43,400.  The drop came amid recession fears as 5-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yield curves inverted for the first time since 2006 on Monday. Observers say yield curve inversions – selling short-dated treasury bonds to purchase long-dated bonds – occur prior to periods of recessions as traders bet on concerns about the health of the economy.  Still, some analysts point out a seasonally bullish April could see bitcoin recovering and moving upward in the coming months, alongside positive growth in broader markets.  “It should be mentioned that April is also a strong month for stock markets,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. “The new month begins with optimism and the mood to look for a moment to buy on a decline, especially given the dense influence of institutional sentiment on the dynamics of bitcoin.”  Big bitcoin targets are back  Some traders have called for a short-term target of $53,000 for bitcoin in the coming months. Long-term targets are even grander: Strategists at institutional fund VanEck said in a recent note that each bitcoin could be worth as much as $4.8 million if it becomes the global reserve asset. The theory is based on the idea that central banks may diversify their reserves and begin allocating towards cryptocurrencies.  Meanwhile, Kirobo’s Naim said that bitcoin was likely propped up by demand from Russian traders earlier in March 2022.  “We can't ignore the connection between the price of bitcoin and the price of the ruble,"" said Naim. ""Many Russians turned to bitcoin to seek some hedge against their assets and bought bitcoin (and other tokens) in droves.”  However, there could be some reason for caution in the coming days. “But now when the ruble seems to be recovering, this has a negative correlation with the price of bitcoin,” Naim said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/01/bitcoin-drops-to-45k-support-as-analysts-point-out-seasonally-bullish-april-month-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bbbb1eee7a11c0d11844f4dabe2bc00e8f7f09e-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

II (VCXA), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), for an estimated enterprise value of $1.25 billion.  Last year, the value of the deal was said to be around $1.5 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. The SPAC was seeking to raise at least $150 million through private investment in public equity (PIPE) for the deal, the report added.  PrimeBlock has secured a $300 million committed equity financing facility from CF Principal Investments LLC, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, the company said in a statement on Friday.  PrimeBlock generated $24.4 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 and has over 110 megawatts of installed data center capacity across its 12 facilities in North America.  Former Goldman Sachs investment banking veteran Gaurav Budhrani will be CEO of the combined company.  The miner said it currently sources about 60% of its power from non-carbon emitting sources and plans to offset the remainder. The power source is just above the 58.5% sustainable energy mix that miners globally are now utilizing, according to the Bitcoin Mining Council’s estimate.  The merger is expected to be closed in the second half of 2022 and the merged company will trade on the Nasdaq.

42395711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyc1O,1648817414,"US Adds 431K Jobs in March, as Unemployment Rate Nears Pre-Pandemic Level","Job growth continued in March as the U.S. unemployment rate dropped toward pre-pandemic levels, further tightening the labor market at a time when inflation is already running at its hottest pace in four decades.  The unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point to 3.6% in March, and the number of unemployed decreased by 318,000 to 6 million.  The widely watched nonfarm payrolls report, released Friday by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that employers added 431,000 jobs in March, missing economists' estimates for a gain of 490,000. The economy added 678,000 jobs in February.  The jobs report is a widely watched indicator for both traditional and crypto traders because a tighter-than-expected labor market could push the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively in raising interest rates.  ""Notable job gains continued in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, and manufacturing,"" the report stated.  The U.S. economy is still scrambling with a labor shortage as a result of the pandemic, which left 10.9 million jobs vacant at the end of 2021. But the employment situation summary signals a strong recovery from pandemic levels as the labor market continues to add jobs. Just before COVID-19 hit, the unemployment rate stood at 3.5%, only slightly lower than the March rate.  Some traders hold bitcoin as a protection against inflation, while others say that the cryptocurrency hasn't yet shown that there is a linkage between the two.  The jobs report ""shouldn't have much bearing on the crypto market,"" Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy, said. “The correlation between inflation and crypto values has still not been proven in my opinion.”  Bitcoin rose 1% in the minutes following the report to about $45,400, but was still down 4.7% over the past 24 hours.

Cardano’s ADA and Avalanche’s AVAX dipped 5% each while Polkadot’s DOT, Shiba Inu’s SHIB and Dogecoin’s DOGE dropped more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Solana’s SOL continues to outperform, remaining flat on Friday after leading gains on Thursday; BNB Chain's BNB modestly outperformed as well losing 3%.  Crypto-tracked futures saw over $400 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. Liquidations refer to an exchange forcefully closing a trader’s leveraged crypto trading position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin.  Topping futures losses at over $120 million was bitcoin, followed by ether (ETH) futures at $63 million. However, volatile trading action led to some less popular futures posting losses in excess of other major cryptos on Friday.  Futures on Zilliqa’s ZIL tokens saw $13 million in liquidations, while losses on Stepn’s GMT tokens amounted to over $11 million. ZIL was a top gainer over the past week with a 315% surge since March 26, rising to as much as $0.23 on Friday from last week’s $0.04 level.  ZIL previously saw similar prices in May 2021. Price charts suggest ZIL could see volatility between the $0.19 and $0.22 levels, although some support seems to exist at the $0.16 mark.  Growth on ZIL came ahead of the launch of Metapolis, a Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform powered by the Zilliqa blockchain that’s scheduled to launch with a VIP event on Saturday in Miami. It would allow users to build their own virtual universes as metaverses gain in popularity as a sector in the broader market.  What is GMT?  Meanwhile, the 3-week-old GMT rose 52% in the past 24 hours to highs of $3.11. GMT is the governance token of Stepn, a fitness app that allows users to access in-game features, such as mint virtual sneakers, upgrade “gems” and participate in governance voting.  Built on Solana, Stepn is self-styled as one of the first lifestyle applications in the Web 3 world, reaching a market capitalization of over $1.5 billion just weeks after launch.  Some attributed GMT's rise to its strong underlying fundamentals.  ""The growth in GMT is notably a function of the value the StepN application offers, which has to a very large extent continued to intrigue investors,"" explained Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of digital bank MinePlex, in an email to CoinDesk. ""The demand for the GMT token is on the rise as users of the app need to burn these tokens in order to gain access to mint high-quality merchandise like Virtual NFT Sneakers which are used to walk, jog, or run in a bid to earn GST tokens.""  ""We can expect more leaps in the price of the token in the near future. At the moment, a sustained buy up will see the token touch new all-time highs of $4,"" Mamasidikov added.  Elsewhere, Bored Ape Yacht Club's native ApeCoin (APE) tokens slid 8.3% amid reports of an exploit on its official channel on messaging service Discord. A rogue tool notified community members about a new non-fungible token (NFT) mint collection.

42395702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASybsX,1648813503,Citi Sees Metaverse Economy as Large as $13T by 2030,"The total addressable market (TAM) for the metaverse economy could be between $8 trillion and $13 trillion by 2030, with up to five billion users, but getting to that market level is going to require sizable infrastructure investment, Citi said in a report on Thursday.  The metaverse is an immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet.  The content streaming environment of the metaverse will likely need a “computational efficiency improvement over 1,000 times today’s levels,'' the bank said, and investment will be required in areas such as storage, network infrastructure, consumer hardware and game development platforms.  The metaverse concept isn't new, the bank’s analysts noted. However, interest in the metaverse really began to snowball at the end of 2021 because of the rise in sales of non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) and big technology companies announcing their interest in the sector.  NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items, and can be sold or traded.  Currently the most popular way to experience the metaverse is by playing a video game on a virtual reality (VR) headset, Citi said, but it is possible that the “metaverse is moving towards becoming the next generation of the internet or Web 3.”  “This ‘open metaverse’ would be community-owned, community-governed and a freely interoperable version that ensures privacy by design,” the report said. Its use cases include commerce, art, media, advertising, healthcare and social collaboration, it added.  What counts as money in this open metaverse is expected to differ from the real world, with different forms of crypto currency expected to dominate, alongside fiat currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins, the report said.  If the metaverse is the new iteration of the internet, it is likely to attract greater scrutiny from regulators, policymakers and governments, and issues such as anti-money laundering rules, the use of decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto assets and property rights will all have to be addressed, the note added.

The AIFC, which was launched in 2018, was designed to develop Kazakhstan's nonbanking financial sector and become a financial hub for Central Asia. According to its website, there are 1,046 companies registered there.  The pilot will see crypto exchanges operate in the AIFC in cooperation with local banks and government agencies.  The Kazakhstan government announced on Friday that amendments were being made to existing legislation that would prevent banking services from being used to facilitate cryptocurrency activities.  The amendments will allow such activity to take place subject to the necessary due diligence on the origin of funds, the nature of the AIFC participants' activities, cooperation with the relevant financial authorities and so on.  Kazakhstan became a country of some significance for the crypto industry last year as many miners relocated operations there following the crackdown in China.  However, the relationship between mining firms and their new home became frosty later in 2021 as severe electricity shortages prompted the government to clamp down on the new arrivals.

It has its roots dating back to 6000 BC when Mesopotamian tribes first made exchanges with other groups. Those methods of exchange worked well before things like the Internet or decentralized technology existed. Trading was necessary not because commodities have financial value or even industrial utility, but because they were necessary for survival. Back then, societies weren&apos;t as worried about gold or silver as they were about grains, milk, and beans. Today, even though society is living in a time where artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain technology and decentralization are going to make means of exchange far more democratic, and private than ever before, commodities still derive their value from the same things. Agricultural goods provide us with a means to nourish ourselves and survive. Energy in the form of oil, natural gas etc. allows us to keep the lights on and keep the economy moving, and precious metals provide us with industrial utility and the ability to hedge against inflation. Here&apos;s the thing. The above commodities are non-fungible. They are not so easy to trade. That means no matter how valuable they are, some of that value is sucked away by old-world value chains. Thus, it remains out of the hands of the everyday individual.

42374954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dj5,1648810420,Bitcoin's 'Guppy' Indicator Flashes Green for Bulls,"Bitcoin's two-month rally may have legs, with a historically reliable indicator flashing a green signal to trend-following traders.  The guppy multiple moving averages (GMMA) indicator, which combines two groups of moving averages (MAs) with different periods to analyze market behavior on multiple time frames, has produced a bullish crossover on the daily chart for the first time this year.  Developed by Australian trader Daryl Guppy, the indicator is used to identify reversals and trend strength by analyzing an asset's momentum in a particular direction. A bullish cross occurs when the green band representing short-term moving averages crosses above the red band of long-term moving averages and indicates the upward momentum is gathering pace.  ""In the last 7 days, the GMMA has finally confirmed a full bullish crossover,"" research boutique Delphi Digital analysts said in a market insight published early Friday. ""The previous occurrences of crossover signal triggered were the 2021 summer lows, and the April 2021 market high, with both leading to multi-month trend reversals.""  Bitcoin's recovery rally from the July 20 low near $30,000 gathered pace after the indicator, known as the Guppy, flipped bullish later that month. The cryptocurrency rallied nearly 15% last August, hitting highs above $50,000. Guppy flipped bearish just before the mid-May crash and the early December crash.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, seasonality analysis supports the case for the latest bullish signal paving the way for more substantial gains in the coming weeks.  The 200-day moving average defines the immediate resistance seen at $48,300. Early this week, the bulls failed to force a breakout above that widely tracked technical line. Since then, the price has pulled back to $45,000, perhaps tracking weakness in equity markets. The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, fell 1.5% on Thursday.  On the downside, Guppy's red band of long-term moving averages could offer support. ""If BTC begins to lose momentum after this rally, look for the long-term MA grouping (red) to act as support should price retest this area,"" Delphi's analysts said.  That support may come into play if the U.S. non-farm payrolls figure for March, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC, beats the estimated job growth of 490,000.  ""A big beat on expectations would contribute to higher inflation and could see asset prices decline,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.  According to economic theory, the relationship between inflation rates and unemployment rates is inverse. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose 6.4% in February, the highest since 1982, meaning the central bank will probably continue to tighten the money supply and raise rates.  A greater-than-expected payrolls figure would strengthen the case for faster liquidity withdrawal by the Fed. ""The idea of an inter-meeting rate hike isn't necessarily off the cards,"" Belle said. The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points last month while signaling a continued fight against inflation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/01/bitcoins-guppy-indicator-flashes-green-for-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79c5d3c85f1bf547a319111c63cece2f6e107892-1440x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The LUNA price can not master the range of $106. However, buyers do not make special efforts to implement such a plan. Since 14 March, the trading volumes in the LUNA market have significantly fallen. This does not prevent the price to continue passive growth. However, this uncertainty each week increases the chance of a market crash to $60. Given the volatility of the LUNA cryptocurrency, such a scenario is likely. But, the longer the stalemate in the market and low price volatility - the greater the chance of a sharp reversal of the market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/kJjJHqP4/ Though, if you look closely at the LUNA trading period from August to December 2021, you can see that the movement of the LUNA price was identically uncertain.

Sellers have managed to move the FTM price beyond the global growth trend that buyers have held since March 2020. So far, this has not caused panic in the market and aggressive price declines. Now, the FTM price is moving peacefully within the consolidation of $1.1-$3.2. It is wide enough range for profitable and efficient trade. However, what are the chances of buyers to break the mark of $3.2 and start to form a new growth wave? https://www.tradingview.com/x/MFm7U3Ms/ In the weekly timeframe, we see that it is becoming increasingly difficult for buyers to update their highs. If you compare the growth wave from January 2021 and compare it with the wave from July 2021 - you can see a significant difference in dynamics. Therefore, a probable new growth wave does not yet imply wild success and aggressive dynamics. Another proof of this is the trading volumes at historical highs. That is, the FTM price began to grow poorly not because of fierce resistance from sellers, but because of lack of demand from buyers. Therefore, a positive scenario for the FTM cryptocurrency is the continuation of price growth to $7. Until the situation with the dynamics and trading volumes changes, this will be the main scenario. In case of weakness of buyers in the range of $1.1, the FTM price will fall to $0.45 without any problems.

These programs run when predetermined conditions are met to help automate workflows, execute agreements, and carry out other essential tasks that can be governed with &apos;if/when…then…&apos; statements. Programmed by developers, smart contracts are trustless, autonomous, decentralized, operate transparently, and are unable to be reversed or modified. These attributes make smart contracts a useful tool in reducing or even eliminating the need for intermediaries or third parties. The code arbitrates the terms of an agreement or contract. Legacy Industries Remain Interested In Harnessing Smart Contracts Unsurprisingly, the benefits of smart contracts mean many traditional companies are looking towards the technology to optimize operations. Research published in December 2021 projects the global smart contract market size is expected to jump to $770.52 million by 2028 up from about $145 million in 2020. Smart contracts have already made notable waves within the supply chain industry as businesses aim to better track products.

Bitcoin closed the quarter down 2%, tightening the correlation with the S&P to nearly 0.9 (1 is perfect correlation, -1 is perfectly inverted).  While bitcoin touched $48,000 earlier in the week, it has since dropped below $45,000.  The correlation between the index and bitcoin appears to be cyclical; bitcoin’s losses will outpace the stock market’s given the 24/7 nature of the asset.  Likewise, its fast rebound will also outpace the S&P.  Traders are concerned about the prolonged nature of the Russia-Ukraine war, and threats from the Kremlin to cut off Europe’s supply of natural gas unless the contracts are denominated in rubles.  As CoinDesk previously reported, although bitcoin had one of its worst-ever starts to a year, it ended up gaining around 9% throughout March occasionally outperforming U.S. stocks.

42374942,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dZ1,1648799074,Ola Finance Says Attackers Stole $4.7M in 'Re-Entrancy' Exploit,"Lending network Voltage Finance, powered by Ola Finance, was exploited for over $4.67 million in a “re-entrancy” attack on Thursday, according to a post-mortem report released by the developers.  Ola can be used to build and deploy decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms across several blockchains, and Thursday’s attack targeted its deployment on the Fuse network. DeFi refers to the use of smart contracts instead of third parties for financial services such as lending and borrowing.  Ola allows projects to create and own their own lending networks in a permissionless manner, while Voltage is the user interface that provides access to Fuse.  The Fuse network was exploited for 216,964.18 USDC, 507,216.68 BUSD, 200,000.00 fUSD, 550.45 wrapped ether, 26.25 wrapped bitcoin, and 1,240,000.00 FUSE. All of that is worth over $4.67 million at current prices.  The attack occurred via a re-entrancy vulnerability in the ERC677 token standard. Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to trick a smart contract by making repeated calls to a protocol in order to steal assets. A call is an authorization for the smart contract address to interact with a user’s wallet address.  In the first heist transaction, the attacker took a 515 WETH flash loan from the WETH-WBTC pair on Voltage Finance to fund the attack. In later transactions, the attacker avoided a flash loan by using the funds that had already been stolen, the post-mortem report confirmed. Voltage is a decentralized trading protocol that allows for the automated trading of DeFi tokens on the Fuse network.  Attackers were able to trick Voltage’s smart contracts by transferring wrapped assets – generating using flash loans, a form of uncollateralized lending – and calling the smart contract into transferring funds from Voltage to the hacker’s addresses.  Ola Finance said the attack couldn't be replicated on other lending networks that it supports. “We will investigate each token’s 'transfer' logic to make sure no problematic token standards are in use,” the developers said.  Meanwhile, Voltage said it was speaking with external parties to trace the attacker and create a plan to compensate affected users.

With upbeat traders, FTM bulls may edge past $1.50, springing back to March 2022 highs in a bullish continuation pattern. Past Performance Fantom prices are relatively stable at spot rates, moving inside a tight range despite buyers being in control from a top-down perspective. Overall, FTM appears to be inside a rising BB squeeze with support at the 20-day moving average as buyers attempt to diffuse selling pressure. FTM traders may search for entries on dips above $1.30, angling for a recovery towards $2.1 in the medium to long term at spot rates.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) says it's time for the U.S. to create its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Warren spoke with NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press Reports,"" scheduled to air at 10:30 p.m. ET on Thursday. NBCUniversal shared a partial transcript of the conversation with CoinDesk.  ""So a lot that banks do wrong, if you think, 'We could improve that in a digital world,' the answer is, 'Sure you could.' But in that case, let's do a central bank digital currency,"" Warren told Todd. ""Yes, I think it's time for us to move in that direction.""  Responding to Todd's question on whether bitcoin (BTC) will face at minimum being regulated like a commodity, Warren responded, ""I think it's going to end up getting regulated,"" using the subprime mortgage financial crisis that started in 2007 as an example of why it's needed. She didn't say what form such regulations might take.  In March Warren announced a new bill to block cryptocurrency companies from conducting business with sanctioned companies. The Digital Assets Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act, introduced with senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and others, would allow the U.S. president to add non-U.S.-based crypto companies to sanctions list if they support sanctions evasion.  On whether the senator saw cryptocurrency as ""this decade's real estate bubble,"" Warren replied, ""The whole digital world has worked very much like a bubble works. What is it moved up on? It's moved up on the fact that people all tell each other that it's going to be great, just again like it was on that real estate market. How many times did people say, 'Real Estate always goes up. It never goes down?' They said it decades ago before the last real estate bubble. They said it in the 2000s, before the crash in 2008.""
