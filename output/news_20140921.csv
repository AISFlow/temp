42377638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gRJ,1411335011,Bitcoin APIs Address Shortcomings that Should Not Exist,"Development of comprehensive and free bitcoin APIs is one of the latest trends to emerge in the cryptocurrency industry and, like all new trends, it has its pros and cons.  API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a software component that defines a set of functions and allows developers to standardise various aspects of software design. This enables developers to use off-the-shelf APIs and API libraries rather than code everything on their own.  The companies behind these new APIs claim they are making development easier, reducing app lead time and costs associated with creating cryptocurrency apps. Critics claim bitcoin APIs are simply not necessary, as they address issues that could be solved by bitcoin core developers and are, therefore, not the best way to move forward.  Bitcoin-related APIs are nothing new – they've been employed for years – but they're usually proprietary designs developed by bitcoin service providers such as cryptocurrency exchanges and payment processors. However, a new breed of all-in-one bitcoin APIs is on the way offering something different.  Next generation bitcoin APIs  A number of bitcoin APIs are currently in development, including the Chain API, BlockCypher API, Gem API as well as APIs developed by industry heavyweights such as Toshi and PlugChain, developed by Coinbase and CEX.io respectively.  For the time being, it is impossible to say which one will come to dominate bitcoin app development and it is too early to talk about the finer points of each API, as they are all in beta. However, the basic idea behind all of them is straightforward – comprehensive bitcoin APIs are supposed to reduce the level of expertise needed for app development and save developers a lot of time and money in the process.  Bitcoin APIs could, in theory, take the ‘cypherpunk element’ out of crypto app development and allow bitcoin integration in countless apps with very little overhead for the developer. Some bitcoin advocates tend to compare block chain technology to the TCP/IP protocol, as it could be used by regular consumers without even knowing it, the same way we use TCP/IP while browsing the Internet without giving it a second thought.  Bitcoin APIs are somewhat different, but they could be likened to popular APIs such as DirectX or Java APIs. People use them when they play games or browse the net, although they are not entirely sure what they do, but they help developers and publishers save money and develop products much faster.  However, the nature of bitcoin is somewhat different. For example, DirectX was developed by Microsoft for gaming on Windows and although it is developed with a lot of input from game developers and hardware makers, it is still Microsoft’s API for Windows.  Bitcoin APIs can be developed by anyone, their feature set and quality can vary and depend on a number of factors. Adoption is another concern, as developers will be able to choose from a range of different bitcoin APIs or no API at all, which is usually not the case with APIs such as DirectX.  Positive and negative impact  The idea of speeding up development and making bitcoin services more accessible to app developers offers a range of benefits.  With easy to use bitcoin APIs doing all the heavy lifting, bitcoin developers would have more time to deal with actual app functionality rather than coding for bitcoin. It could also bring bitcoin to mainstream apps whose developers would never integrate bitcoin support otherwise, as it would entail too much effort.  The downside is that apps built on bitcoin APIs would have to rely on a centralised infrastructure working in unison with the decentralised bitcoin network.  Bitcoin developer and creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk that growth in API services is necessary in some cases, but that to some extent it is also a “sad and unfortunate” development.  Buterin explained:  “Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized system and people really should be running a proper bitcoin client on their own server and getting information and pushing transactions through it. The reliance on centralized infrastructure makes it so that bitcoin-based services end up having no higher reliability than their centralized counterparts (often worse since our industry is newer and thus lower-quality).”  Buterin highlighted the lack of features in bitcoind/bitcoin core as being the main driving factor behind bitcoin development. One of the most important features missing is headers-first validation, which would allow clients to grab the block headers and act as SPV nodes until they can validate the full chain.  With headers-first implementation, a new bitcoind node would become useful in a matter of minutes, but at the moment it takes about three days, said Buterin.  Do the benefits outweigh the concerns?  Bitcoin APIs could be used for other operations, to provide price feeds, provide Merkle tree proofs of specific transactions and Buterin argues these use cases are justified.  The biggest argument in favour of free all-in-one bitcoin APIs is more down to earth. Money is flowing into bitcoin APIs because they have the potential to fuel more mainstream adoption by allowing people to develop bitcoin apps or add bitcoin functionality to existing applications with relative ease. Google's Play Store and the Apple App Store now carry more than a million apps each, only a negligible fraction of them have cryptocurrency functionality. This huge market is virtually untapped.  Bitcoin APIs are supposed to reduce the threshold for crypto app development and allow more developers to integrate bitcoin functionality into their apps, at next to no cost. This is what bitcoin API developers are trying to do; this is why they expect their APIs will eventually fuel more mainstream adoption. The biggest problem is that bitcoin APIs are being designed to tackle shortcomings that shouldn't exist in the first place.  Many concerns will persist, but until the new APIs come out of beta and start making an impact on app development, it is simply too early to pass judgement.

42377654,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72giv,1411306555,BitOcean Releases Two-Way Bitcoin ATM to Compete with Market Leaders,"BitOcean Technology Development Co Ltd has released China-developed and made bitcoin ATMs with a feature list designed to compete with popular existing products.  The new machines – the second generation developed by the Beijing-based company – are two-way kiosks, meaning they enable users to buy and sell bitcoins, with multi-currency support and compliance capabilities to comply with regulations in various jurisdictions.  BitOcean  founder and CEO Xiaoning Nan told CoinDesk the company is involved in discussions with several buyer-operators:  ""Our major market is Asia now, because in this region we can provide the best tech support for all our customers and partners. But we would like to sell the BitOcean ATM all over the world.""  Comparing popular models  BitOcean installed its first machine in the landmark Wangjing Soho office and retail complex in Beijing. In the next few weeks, the company will organize an event that invites customers to use its ATM alongside those by Robocoin and Lamassu, and compare experiences.  The customer screen interface is available in several languages, including Chinese, English and Japanese. A video demonstration of the Chinese version is below.  Nan said the new ATMs offer more enhanced safety and functionality over the first generation, which BitOcean showcased at the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing in May.  The machines, which the company tested for two months prior to release, offer operators a ""bank-level experience"" in both hardware and software, he added. Improvements include faster processing times – 30 seconds for a withdrawal – and a new multi-function online dashboard for operators.  Nan said:  ""We updated the core part of the bill acceptor and cash box to be the best class of security that can avoid any error in [its] operation, and our manufacturer is a professional supplier of ATMs for banks.""  The machines allow for transaction confirmations via email, SMS or telephone, and paper wallet printing. Operators can connect to major exchanges via APIs.  On the hardware side, the second generation also includes know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) features powered by Jumio, as well as extensible cash boxes holding up to 3,600 bills total. BitOcean will produce customized designs to suit individual customers' needs.  Physical characteristics and price  BitOcean has priced its machine at $10,000 per unit, placing it mid-way between the popular Lamassu ($5,000) and Robocoin ($15,000) offerings. There are extra fees for local or international delivery.  The free-standing upright machines resemble those of 'regular' bank ATMs in shopping malls and bitcoin ATMs by Robocoin and genesiscoin. They stand 176cm tall and weigh 45kg. Each standard cash box holds 1,200 bills, and one machine can hold three boxes.  There is a printer for paper wallets and BitOcean indicated all internal parts are easily accessible for service.  Update: The table below, from BitOcean's website, claims to compare features of different bitcoin ATMs available in China. A Lamassu representative noted, however, that the company itself does not charge a license fee in any region.

42377661,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gkB,1411293912,What Real-World Problems Can Bitcoin Actually Solve Right Now?,"Though it is increasingly acknowledged by major business, investors and governments that bitcoin has the power to enable potentially world-changing financial innovations, fundamental issues are still holding back adoption.  One of the most prominent, around the world, is the lack of consumer understanding of the subject. For all its development, it remains difficult to explain to the average person just how bitcoin technology can impact their lives – today.  This begs the question: in its current form, is bitcoin, both the technology and the wider industry, evolved enough yet to solve real problems for the mass market?  The answer, according to experts in the industry, is not yet, though scores of entrepreneurs and startups are working toward this goal, use case by use. Vinny Lingham, CEO of mobile gift card provider Gyft, for example, enables bitcoin to be spent on gift cards – a mainstream use for the bitcoin currency.  Even so, Lingham believes many of the strongest use cases for bitcoin have yet to be developed:  “I think there are a multitude of use cases for bitcoin that are going to be very regionally specific. The beauty of this technology is that it's not a one-size-fits-all technology.”  Bitcoin in the US  Bitcoin awareness in the US is growing, with the latest polls showing that more than 50% of consumers have heard about bitcoin. Still, the majority – 65% – said they are unlikely to buy the currency.  This statistic doesn't bode well for US startups, most of which are focused on making buying and using bitcoin easier, not applying the technology to more specific use cases. This problem is further compounded by the competition the industry faces in the broader mobile payments space.  For example, Apple recently launched Apple Pay as part of its unveiling of the long-awaited iPhone 6. Though many industry observers are confident in bitcoin's open community in the long run, in the short term, enabling mobile payments through more familiar credit card accounts could challenge bitcoin.  Lingham said:  “I'm not sold on bitcoin as a currency per se in the US just yet, but it may become easier for consumers to use over time with some cost benefits.""  With Apple Pay, there's some compelling benefits, as well. For instance, banks, and not merchants, are being charged fees for using the platform, though it remains to be seen whether this will reduce overall costs like bitcoin conceivably could.  Competitive mobile payment platforms are a good thing, and hopefully bitcoin stands to benefit from this in the US market. For one, it could mean the recently announced partnership between Coinbase and PayPal subsidiary Braintree will need to produce an even stronger end product that makes the case that consumers can use bitcoin everyday.  “I'm not seeing mass market adoption, but perhaps [things like the] PayPal integration will change that,” Lingham added.  Paul Puey, founder of bitcoin wallet Airbitz, was critical of Apple Pay because it, like many of Apple's other products, is built on a closed platform.  In the long term, he argued, this could give bitcoin an edge, as its open platform could appeal to innovators who will build more compelling use cases for the technology.  Bitcoin around the world  People in more established financial hubs like the US or the UK see the long-term promise of bitcoin and have, to date, treated it more like an investment or a tool capable of cutting costs associated with payment.  Outside of these nations, however, many in the bitcoin and wider payments industry believe there is opportunity for the technology to empower financial independence with new products that tackle problems in ways the industry hasn't yet conceived.  The two most often cited reasons that support this assertion are the power and ubiquity of mobile phone technology and the inflation problems of many countries worldwide.  Still, while bitcoin could ultimately solve real problems in this area, there are more immediate use cases for bitcoin in emerging markets.  Brian Gamido, whose company Palarin is focused squarely on the Philippines-based bitcoin market, believes that payments and remittance could be bitcoin's most compelling use cases.  Gamido argues:  “One of the major global use cases for bitcoin is the ability to send low-cost, near real-time cross-border remittances. According to the World Bank, it costs 5–8% to send money from the US to the Philippines.""  In the end  If there’s steadfast belief in the community that the problems bitcoin can solve will be refined by the industry itself, it isn’t for a lack of bravado.  This has been fueled by tens of millions of dollars of investment in many different sectors of the bitcoin economy – many of which are working to figure out this issue of converting traditional money into a spendable digital format.  But, today, bitcoin arguably has few compelling arguments for consumers who aren't early adopters.  Andy Beal, an attorney with Crowley Strategy and advisor for several bitcoin startups, said the burgeoning bitcoin industry should focus on slowly evolving its platform toward expanding this audience:  “First, it can continue to innovate and evolve at a rapid pace, particularly the consumer facing layers; keep pushing the ball down the hill. Second, it can continue to refine the narrative – mainstream adoption is as much about marketing as it is about functionality.”  The takeaway for entrepreneurs is that having that mindset, and focusing on a particular problem that bitcoin can solve, may be the best way to get a bitcoin company off the ground.  Still, Lingham, like many in the industry, believe these use cases are forthcoming.  He concluded:  “Some people will make it a currency, others will create the financial internet and even more will use it in yet to be thought of ways.”  Puzzle image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/21/what-real-world-problems-can-bitcoin-actually-solve-right-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94bfb7e66a0dbf5c49617759f7976af709d84690-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377643,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72gXb,1411266613,Bitcoin in the Philippines: A Perfect Cryptocurrency Storm,"Many of those at Geeks on a Beach, a recent tech event in the Philippines, agreed that, two years ago, there was nothing here in terms of a startup ecosystem.  Today, it’s pretty clear there are several scenes: Cebu and Manila, to name the two biggest, as well as a comprehensive and very well connected tech scene.  Why are the Philippines suddenly appearing on the global map of innovation? It’s a mix of the country being a melting pot of Asian, US and Latin cultures; a fast-growing economy (second only to China in terms of growth in Asia); and a few American entrepreneurs who decided to set up in this overlooked 100 million population country.  If the emerging markets are often arguably 'catching up' with technology, starting by launching copycats to fill the gaps of real estate, cab sharing or e-commerce apps, they also set trends.  As for the Philippines, many agreed it was an increasingly hot scene for bitcoin, as we listened to two panels on this topic at Geeks on a Beach and met with entrepreneurs in Manila after the event.  Remittances and social interactions  So how is it that the Philippines – a developing country with its share of geographical and economical problems – manages to be leaping to the front of the pack when it comes to bitcoin? Some western entrepreneurs now regularly visit the country to check out the cryptocurrency scene's progress, including Nick Sullivan from Silicon Valley-based ChangeTip.  There are two main ingredients that have brought about this state of affairs.  The first is remittances. The Philippines is the third largest recipient of money from its workers overseas, after China and India, with $22bn received in 2013.  Ron Hose  , founder of bitcoin exchange Coins.ph, adds that “internal remittance, people in the Philippines sending money to family and friends in the country, probably adds $50bn to $70bn on top of that”.  Both flows of money can earn the legacy money-transmitting companies up to a 10% cut on average remittances of $200 – an industry that bitcoin companies could do very well in disrupting, lowering fees and still making good profit in the process.  The second ingredient is the incredible level of social interactions of the Filipinos. It’s not a myth to say that people are over-friendly and connecting the dots, making it both the selfie capital of the world and one of the most active social media nations.  Mobile penetration is already beyond the 100% milestone and, combined with the youngest population of South-East Asia and rapid growth, you have what some call the 'perfect digital storm'.  Addressing the unbanked  Even the supposed negative assets of the country can turn it in a field of opportunities. Some 75% of the population in the Philippines are unbanked, “and they won’t be banked”, said Hose, adding:  “It’s too expensive for a bank with high fixed costs to enroll customers earning a few thousands pesos a month [equivalent to a few hundred dollars], with little to no saving capability.”  Sam Kaddoura, co-founder of bitcoin exchange, BuyBitcoin.ph, said: “Those who do not want to go through the hassle of opening bank accounts or pass the requirements for credit cards will embrace bitcoins.”  Most of this segment of the population do consume financial products, they add. Lending is often done face to face, with rates going up to 20%. This high price tag can be explained by the 'convenience' offered: the loan is in cash, and is given on the spot.  To understand this, one really has to take the point of view of a Filipino with no savings at all, facing an unexpected new cost, such as a treatment for a medical condition.  You would first ask friends and families, who can send some money through GCash, the mobile money system from telco Globe (which levies fees of about 10%). Then, you would borrow money at 20%.  Bitcoin can bring a faster, cheaper solution, even for micro-payments, which are not penalised by miners for their size. Companies such as PayPal, however, charge a minimum fee that makes small payments uneconomical.  E-commerce opportunities  Besides providing a financial vehicle for the unbanked, there are a lots of opportunities in e-commerce and retail too.  With less than 5% credit card penetration today, the typical purchase goes like this. First, research and initiate purchase online. Take the provided payment slip to the nearest bank or accredited receiver to pay in cash. With the payment confirmation code, go back to the website and finish the purchase, the deadline of which will hopefully still be valid. Then, await delivery.  This is an incredibly messy process and demands a lot of steps from the potential customer. That's not to mention all the running around, which, in a city like Manila, known for its floods and terrible traffic jams, could take hours to complete.  Today, it is possible to pay in bitcoin via CashCashPinoy and MetroDeal, two Philippine e-commerce platforms, as well as with Bench, a clothing brand somewhat equivalent to Gap in the Philippines.  As more merchants are enrolled by the business development teams of the four local bitcoin exchanges, things will only improve for consumers.  Creating new services  So what would be the next steps for the bitcoin community, if it is to enroll more users and merchants in what still looks like a highly technical phenomenon?  “For bitcoins to take off”, said ChangeTip's Nick Sullivan, “ATMs, bitcoin-backed credit cards, and bitcoin payrolls would help a lot. I bet that in less than 10 years, a government will choose to go with a digital currency. Iceland or Greece would be interesting candidates”.  More new services are also starting to appear that make the most of bitcoin's support for micropayments.  Sullivan is currently working with the customer department services of big brands, and said that a bitcoin-accepting tip jar could be a great use of the technology, adding:  “The space of online advertising could change a lot. We all accepted that ugly ads take a third of our screens to access for free a content. Why if micropayments can help content creators offer another business model?”  Antony Lewis, of itBIT, a Singapore-based Bitcoin exchange, said that “financial innovation will come from countries like the Philippines”. “We need a common roadmap for that. Today, bitcoin is still terrible to use, when Western Union is everywhere,” he concluded.
