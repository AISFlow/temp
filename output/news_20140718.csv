42397784,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAL8,1405721725,Trend Micro Report Finds Criminals Unlikely to Abuse Namecoin,"Namecoin's domain-name system is an attractive environment for malicious users, but is not likely to gain widespread use among criminals, according to a research report from digital security firm Trend Micro.  The report, published last September and written by members of Trend Micro's Forward-Looking Threat Research Team David Sancho and Robert McArdle, outlines the properties of the namecoin top-level domain system that leave it open to abuse by malicious users.  These include cheap and anonymous domain-name creations and a system that places domain-names out of the reach of central authorities seeking to shut down or commandeer a malicious site.  ""You have anonymity, privacy and sturdiness, so you cannot take [these sites] down,"" Sancho said.  The vast majority of top-level domains, such as .com or .org, are governed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Top-level domains outside the ICANN system are known as alternative DNS roots or ADRs. These include .geek and .micro suffixes, the Trend Micro paper noted.  Namecoin  allows its users to create a type of domain that lies beyond ICANN's purview. Namecoin transactions include DNS data, allowing users to create a new domain name with each transaction. These domain names are denoted by the .bit suffix and transactions are recorded in a public block chain.  Traces of a seized Polish botnet  The authors also investigated an instance of a botnet that exploited .bit domains. The authors analysed malware that made repeated connections to four .bit domains, including megashara.bit and opusattheend.bit. The malware is part of a grouping of malicious software known as the NECURS family. This malware typically enters user systems by being attached to malicious spam email. It then disables a system's security services to prevent other pieces of malicious software from being detected.  According to Sancho, the malware that he investigated bears strong similarities to an earlier botnet that was operated from Poland, and that had been shut down by Polish authorities last January. That botnet was used for a ""very pedestrian"" form of financial fraud, Sancho said.  ""We think this is the successor to the Polish botnet. It looks very much alike, although we have not 100% validated this claim. It looks like version two of this Polish botnet.""  When Polish authorities shut down the botnet last January, they were unable to apprehend its operator. But they successfully 'sinkholed' the offending domains, redirecting traffic to a site controlled by the polish cybersecurity agency, the NASK. But if Sancho's theory is correct, then the new botnet run on .bit domains is now even more robust, because it is out of reach of state agencies.  ""There's no way that any government or any authority can take down a .bit,"" Sancho said. ""They won't be able to do anything, and that's the smart thing about it.""  Blockchain traceability paradox  Even as namecoin domains provide a high degree of anonymity to their owners, they also rely on the namecoin blockchain, which renders all transactions public. This feature allows security researchers unprecedented access to a domain name's history. The Trend Micro paper notes that this high transparency makes it possible to assemble information about malicious websites that would not have been possible with an ICANN-administered top-level domain. Researchers are able to see when a domain name is created and the IP addresses to which it points.  ""That's information you normally don't have with a normal domain name. I don't get the history of every single IP [associated with a domain], that history doesn't exist,"" Sancho said.  In the case of the .bit botnet that the Trend Micro researchers investigated, the namecoin block chain yielded a network analysis graph of four affected domain names, showing that they were linked in the past by a number of IP addresses. These IP addresses were also associated with centrally administered domains in the past. As a result, the researchers say, the malicious .bit domains can be tied to the individual or group that registered those centrally administered domains. The paper states:  ""Checking the Whois details on the non-.bit domains would uncover the criminal behind them. This is exactly the sort of mistake caused by simple human nature that can often be the undoing of an otherwise careful cybercriminal gang.""  Several other factors prevent namecoin domains from being easily exploited for nefarious uses. Because .bit domains can only be accessed with reconfigured network settings, malware-infected users should be able to detect traffic irregularities easily. Namecoin servers are also relatively few, and are maintained on a voluntary basis by enthusiasts. As a result, they are less reliable and may sometimes be offline. Trend Micro says about 106,000 .bit domains are in existence, and traffic to these domains remains relatively low.  As a result, Sancho and McArdle conclude that .bit domains are unlikely to become popular among malicious actors, although they possess some attractive features.  Anti-censorship domains  While the Trend Micro paper focuses on the use of namecoin domain anonymity by criminals, it acknowledges that a decentralised domain name system can also have legitimate uses. This is a point that Eli Dourado, a research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Centre, underlines.  ""Alternative DNS roots are important because they provide a check on ICANN, which would otherwise have a monopoly on DNS policy,"" he said.  One example of an alternative top-level domain system used for political expression is the .ti suffix, which is used to denote a Tibetan website. A group called New Nations administers these top-level domains, along with a clutch of others, such as .te, .uu and .ke, for Tamils, Uyghurs and Kurds, respectively. New Nation's rationale is that it wants to challenge the existing ""power structure"" governing the Internet by making these top-level domains available.  Another group, called OpenNIC, seeks to do something similar, by offering top-level domains like .fur, .free and .indy. Its mission, according to its charter, is to provide new domain hierarchies outside the ICANN system to promote ""freedom of access"" to the Internet. Anyone can join OpenNIC and decisions are made when proposals win a simple majority of votes cast by email.  Dourado said decentralised, anonymous domain names are particularly needed in situations where users have to bypass censorship by a state agency, or if a states possess sweeping powers to block certain websites, as in the case of the proposed SOPA legislation in the United States.  ""It is important to remember that activities that are considered criminal in some countries are considered protected by human rights in other countries. While censorship resistance can make it harder to enforce good criminal laws as well as bad ones, on balance it is a net benefit for humanity.""

42397788,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAQ3,1405714510,What New York's Proposed Regulations Mean for Bitcoin Businesses,"Love them or hate them, real regulations are now upon us. Federal agencies like the IRS and FinCEN have provided guidance on how they believe the Bank Secrecy Act applies to bitcoin companies, and some states like Texas and Kansas even joined in the action, publishing their own guidance on how bitcoin businesses ought to be regulated under state law.  On 17th July, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) published its long-awaited proposal for a “BitLicense”. The 40-page document lays out a comprehensive framework for how bitcoin businesses ought to be regulated in New York. Keep in mind that until a final version is developed, this document is merely a proposal, and does not yet carry the force of law.  Before that can happen, the NYDFS will “officially” publish the article on 23rd July, at which point members of the public will have 45 days to send official commentary to the NYDFS to be considered in its final rule. Once that happens, the US will have its first-ever digital currency-specific law on the books. This is a Very Big Deal.  In this article, I will discuss the most important aspects of the proposed BitLicense as it applies to bitcoin businesses. Let’s start with the 'who'.  Who Requires a License?  In short: pretty much everyone. Businesses that:  Convert digital currency to government currency or another digital currency  Receive digital currency for transmission  Transmit digital currency  Secure digital currency  Store, hold or take control of digital currency.  ...all need a BitLicense.  This is true for any business that “involves” New York or any person:  Residing in New York,  Temporarily located in New York, or  Working in New York.  ...regardless of where the business is physically located, whether in New York, Texas, Guatemala or nowhere at all, in the case of distributed hacker collectives.  As you might have guessed, this probably means that direct purchasers and sellers of digital currency, basic hosted wallet providers, multi-signature wallet providers, merchant payment processors, custodial exchanges and even local wallet software developers probably need a license.  The proposed language is just that broad. In fact, the only exceptions are merchants accepting digital currency in exchange for goods and services, and banks who have sought “approval” from NYDFS.  What is “virtual currency”?  “Virtual currency” includes bitcoin and other convertible currencies, but specifically excludes customer affinity programs like airline miles. As many of us fretted, there is no carve-out for coins used to track digital assets; even if a business uses a mere Satoshi to tag and trade the asset.  How big of a bond is required?  Yes, the BitLicense makes bonding mandatory for all license holders. There is no upper or lower limit to the bond required. NYDFS has broad authority to fashion whatever requirements it deems reasonable.  What customer information must be collected?  A BitLicense holder must collect, for each transaction, the:  Amount  Amount of any fees charged  Any payment instructions  Name of all parties to the transaction, and  Physical address of all parties to the transaction  Time of the transaction.  ...and retain that information for 10 years. There is no minimum dollar threshold for these requirements, and no carve-out for tipping bots, blind exchanges or any other circumstance in which this information would be unavailable to the business.  It goes without saying that some would be problematic – particularly the last two.  What kind of reserve system is required?  Full reserve. A BitLicense holder may not lend or spend any crypto that it holds on its customers’ behalf. As such, the many bitcoin “banks” that accept “deposits” and offer “loans” will be illegal in New York under the BitLicense regime.  Thus, bitcoin banking is prohibited; only bitcoin “vaulting” is allowed.  In What Assets can Earnings be Invested?  A BitLicense holder can only invest its earnings in: government securities, money market funds and insured Certificates of Deposit. A business that transmits bitcoins may not invest in the very currency it transmits.  What financial reporting is required?  A BitLicense holder must report its financial statements to the NYDFS quarterly, and audited financial statements yearly.  What AML/KYC is required: The BitLicense’s most novel characteristic is that it creates the first state-level anti-money laundering reporting program. FinCEN – the federal regulator – already requires reporting cash and coin transactions over $10,000. Now, New York requires that BitLicense holders report to the NYDFS any crypto transaction over $10,000.  BitLicense holders must also file state suspicious activity reports (SARs) with the NYDFS, not just the ones required to file with FinCEN.  What you can do  You may be shocked by the breadth of these proposed rules, but this is actually fairly common. It is rare that a regulator proposes rules and then, in response, the industry to be regulated cries out for more rules. Regulators anticipate the industry’s demand for trimming and paring, so their initial effort tends to be over-inclusive.  If you disagree with any of these proposals, there will be a 45-day comment period beginning on 23rd July, and it is critical that you make your voices heard within this period. I will certainly be drafting comments on behalf of my clients. These comments can demand narrower tailoring, greater clarity, and very often, exemptions for your business.  Based on my experience, New York is genuinely interested in getting these regulations right. The NYDFS could have quietly published guidance without engaging in dialogue with the community.  Instead, it has welcomed discussion and dialogue with the public. I, for one, will be taking advantage of it.

42397783,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAM7,1405712714,SecondMarket Hosts Bitcoin Talk for Professional Women's Network,"Last night about 80 New York women of varied experience with the bitcoin industry met at SecondMarket's headquarters for what was effectively the largest women’s bitcoin meetup, at least in the US city.  Most of them work in the banking and financial services industries, and a fair few were executives and compliance directors quietly representing industry heavyweights. However, they were all assembled there by Ellevate, the members-only global women’s network dedicated to investing in women’s success and led by Sallie Krawcheck.  Krawcheck, often called one of the most powerful women on Wall Street, is the former head of banking giants Citigroup and Bank of America and one of the most influential industry voices. She moderated a panel, called ‘Bitcoin: The Future of Money’.  The discussion included host, SecondMarket founder and Bitcoin Investment Trust creator Barry Silbert; BitPay vice president of sales and co-founder of Women in Bitcoin Paige Freeman; founder of public policy consulting firm dcIQ and former VP of public policy at Silicon Valley Bank Mary Dent; and Deloitte strategy and operations senior consultant Tiffany Wan.  The attendees came to learn about the basics of the digital currency. “What the heck is a bitcoin and why should I care?” as Krawcheck began the conversation. But the panelists, it seemed, tried to inspire them to forget bitcoin’s price, volatility and bad press for an hour and think instead about its fundamental attributes and what the global economy could do with it beyond today.  ""There are lots of reasons for governments to be very fearful about bitcoin […] what I don't think we’ve unlocked yet is a vision for why this could be transformative,"" Dent said.  “What could a global financial services platform do for the world economy, particularly for the developing economies? What could it do for the consumers that are locked out of the existing financial services system?”  Learning initiative  While the panelists were bitcoin believers across, more outstanding were the audience members – not merely because they were all women, but because so many of them represented an industry whose attitude toward bitcoin has been largely sardonic if not hostile.  It’s true that involvement in bitcoin and technology is male dominated – which also remains true for the banking and finance sectors despite gender gap improvements over the last decade.  But, while the guests who had previously attended New York bitcoin meetups, or do regularly, were delighted to be in a room filled with women curious about bitcoin, more impressive was watching and speaking with the bankers, financiers and their advisors – and even an employee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York – who realized the importance of the subject in general and in their careers and decidedly motivated each other to take the first step in educating themselves about it.  Bitcoin can be for everyone  By a show of hands the room seemed split evenly into bitcoin 'skeptics' and bitcoin 'believers'.  Silbert told them that it took him six or seven months of being a skeptic before he became a believer. Though its value is different for each user, he told the audience that it doesn’t have to take over the financial system; it can live alongside the existing currencies.  ""I’m not a big believer in bitcoin becoming the global currency,"" he said. ""But I do believe it can live in everyone’s wallets, in everyone’s portfolio.""  Silbert's portfolio includes roughly 30 bitcoin-related companies and many of the most well performing ones in the ecosystem. For all his success and bitcoin’s potential to ""radically transform our entire financial system"", he stressed for the room’s investors that it’s still early in the game.  ""We’re talking trillions of dollar type industries that if bitcoin is really successful will probably be one of the most successful investments you ever make. But, the outcome is likely binary. You are either going to lose all your money – in fact you will probably lose all of your money, it’s still very early. But if you don't, and if it is successful…""  Value is subjective  At the outset, Krawcheck asked the panel: what is a bitcoin, and why should we care? And “what’s wrong with the dollar”, the euro or the yen? Why do we have to have this?  Silbert spoke about the subjective value that money holds for people across the world. He commented that for people living outside the US, the eurozone and Japan in countries with massive inflation like Argentina, Venezuela and Thailand, access to the US dollar isn’t as easy.  He remarked:  “We have a very US-centric view of money, currency. The dollar is great, we all like it, we all want a lot of them. The reality is in the course of history […] a fiat currency will disappear in 27 years on average. So, if you live outside the US […] the currency you use in your daily life will likely go away in 27 years.”  Responding to the same question, Dent spoke about the Internet of value, observing that no one needs to understand cryptography and the inner workings of mining bitcoin in order to use it and appreciate it.  ""How many people understand the protocol that lets you email or lets you surf the web,"" she asked. ""You don’t, but you do all those things and I think that this is what an Internet of value is.""  She continued:  “Today we have the Internet of communications and commerce, there’s a lot of talk about the Internet of things, and I think this could be a third Internet: the Internet of value – how you move value as frictionlessly today as we move communications in a way that is as unimaginable to us today as the Internet itself was 20 or 30 years ago.”  Image courtesy of SecondMarket",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/18/secondmarket-hosts-bitcoin-talk-for-professional-womens-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea36e22450af87ca888db237d420afb744304901-1249x499.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAT0,1405701684,Computer Giant Dell Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Multinational computer technology specialist Dell has announced it is now accepting bitcoin through a partnership with Coinbase.  With annual revenue approaching $57bn, Dell is roughly four times the size of DISH Network – the previous biggest bitcoin-accepting business.  Following today's announcement, consumers and small business owners are able to purchase all items on Dell.com using bitcoin. To promote the news, the company is offering a 10% discount on all Alienware-brand products to bitcoin buyers. Dell also sells personal computers, servers, data storage devices, cameras and printers.  In a blog post on the announcement, Coinbase indicated that Dell is seeking to provide customers with greater payment flexibility. Once the decision to accept bitcoin was reached, the company moved quickly – implementing payments on the site in just two weeks. Dell Commerce Services CIO Paul Walsh said:  ""It is always our goal to respond quickly to our customers and ensure their needs are met. Partnering with Coinbase to implement this solution in 14 days is a prime example of the new, more agile Dell.""  The official announcement was released on Twitter by Dell's CEO and board of directors chairman Michael Dell.  Dell founded the company at 19 and quickly grew the business into a Fortune 500 company, becoming one of the youngest CEOs to make the list at the time. Dell is now the third largest private company in America.  Dell is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept #bitcoin http://t.co/xC41rKTYXi http://t.co/0YqPK7MfVG — Michael Dell (@MichaelDell) July 18, 2014  As of today, Dell representatives confirmed the offer is only available to US customers.  Buying with Dell.com  Notably, the decision coincided with the launch of Dell.com/bitcoin, a dedicated portion of the company's website for bitcoin users.  The page features answers to frequently asked questions such as 'What is Bitcoin?', 'Why is Dell accepting bitcoin' and 'How do I obtain bitcoins?'  Additional questions centered on the security of bitcoin, with the company noting:  ""There are thousands of computers ('miners') constantly running software to ensure the safety of the bitcoin network, which has never once been compromised.""  Dell further released a 'Terms and Conditions' page detailing its policies for bitcoin buyers. The company noted that should a purchase qualify for a refund, ""any refund due will be remitted to the purchaser via check in US Dollars for the full amount of the purchase price paid at the time of the original transaction, less any applicable restocking fee"".  Refunds for mispayments will be sent to user Coinbase accounts. Those who aren't able to access a Coinbase account will not be able to receive a refund for missed payment, the company said.  Coinbase continues hot streak  Dell's announcement comes amid a boom in the number of major businesses that have opted to accept bitcoin through Coinbase. Notably, Dell is now the largest merchant in the bitcoin space by annual revenue.  Coinbase added the previous largest merchant to the bitcoin ecosystem in late May, when it announced that Colorado-based satellite TV provider DISH Network would add bitcoin payments. DISH has an annual revenue approaching $14bn per year.  The California-based company followed up this announcement by revealing that online travel booking giant Expedia and gift e-tailer 1-800-Flowers.com would accept bitcoin in June and July, respectively.  Publicity boost  Given the company's sizable annual revenue, word that Dell had joined the bitcoin ecosystem reverberated throughout the media, with notably publications such as PCWorld, the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times issuing stories on the company's announcement.  Reaction on reddit was similarly strong on reddit with a number of users reacting quickly to post the news to the popular bitcoin community forum r/bitcoin.  Enthusiasm was similarly high internationally with the move garnering coverage from The Netherland's De Telegraaf, among others.

42395323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLZV,1405700331,7 Charts That Show a Year of Growth for Bitcoin ATMs,"Our last State of Bitcoin report contained two tantalising slides on data from our Bitcoin ATM Map. To quench the thirst for more, we've dug through our Fusion Table and come up with several more charts to illustrate what's going on with bitcoin ATMs around the world.  Our Bitcoin ATM Map has 121 'active' machines on it, which means machines that are live and operational, as far as we can tell.  We do rely on a combination of press reports, press releases from manufacturers and operators, and crowdsourcing for our information, so it's not going to be completely accurate all of the time. With that out of the way, lets check out the data.  Which country has the most bitcoin ATMs? No surprise here, it's the Great White North – Canada – with 30 machines.  Lagging some way behind is the United States with about two-thirds that number. And lagging way back are a clutch of countries from disparate continents: Singapore, Australia and the UK.  The chart quickly becomes a long tail, with the rest of the 27 countries on our map containing just a handful of machines and quickly thinning down to just one or two.  The distribution of ATMs appears slightly more equitable when viewed by continent.  North America leads with 40% of the share, but Europe is just 10 percentage points behind. The same gap, roughly, exists between Europe and Asia. Oceania is well represented, with a 7% slice, but Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa are seriously underrepresented when it comes to bitcoin ATMs.  As a side note, we used the United Nations Statistics Division's rules on the naming and composition of continents.  Where exactly are all these bitcoin ATMs located, then?  We created a number of location categories for the ATM, ranging from airports and train stations to newsagents and shopping malls. The number of categories is quite large, which reflects the diversity of spaces bitcoin ATMs can be found in.  Bitcoin ATMs are basically found in spots with high foot-traffic. The machines are pretty evenly spread among coffee shops, restaurants and retailers, if you look at the share of location types.  But a breakdown of locations by absolute numbers reveals some of the other venues that host bitcoin ATMs. Supermarkets, hotels and shopping malls are all represented on the list of places where you can find a cryptocurrency machine.  It's perhaps worth noting that the sorts of places you'll find a conventional cash ATM are not well represented here. Newsagents, money services kiosks and transport hubs like airports and train stations, for example, are at the tail-end of the chart.  Now we come to the stats on ATM makers.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, ATM pioneer Lamassu leads the way, but the extent to which it is leading is remarkable. It dominates the share of installed ATMs with 40% of the pie. Its rival Robocoin, which launched the first installed bitcoin ATM, at Waves coffee house in Vancouver, has only about half the install base.  Meanwhile, relative newcomers BitAccess and Skyhook are gaining ground. The former, currently being put through its paces at the top Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, already has about half of Robocoin's install base.  The picture is even more revealing when ATM installs by maker are graphed over time. Lamassu's install rate has been consistently higher than Robocoin's, its closest competitor. But even as Lamassu's install-rate continues to climb, Robocoin's appears to be tapering off. Lamassu is opening up a gap between itself and its old competitor that appears to be widening.  Trying to close the gap are BitAccess and Skyhook. Both makers are starting to see sharply rising install rates, although their shares of the market are still relatively small.  Some caveats are necessary here. Our map shows only 49 installed Lamassu units, up to 10th July. The firm has made public statements about the number of units it's sold to date. The last figure was 220 units, as reported by CoinDesk in April. Of that figure, 100 machines have been shipped, while the rest are still in production.  Skyhook said it had shipped 150 units at the end of June.  The other makers don't announce their sales figures. So while our map shows the installations known to us, there appear to be a large number of machines that are either waiting to be installed, or have been installed but are not captured on our map.  The ATM makers are already tweaking their business strategies.  Robocoin has repositioned itself as a sort of bitcoin bank, calling its machines 'branches' instead of ATMs. Its new software platform, Robocoin 2.0, pushed out more features, like secure storage and instant, off-blockchain transactions.  Lamassu, meanwhile, is talking up its machines as 'bitcoin portals' now, with the ability to pay bills and perform remittances. This is undergirded by a new focus on a developer ecosystem around its newly open-source operating system, Rakia.  The bitcoin ATM business is rapidly evolving. Cryptocurrency exchange machines are not quite the novelty they once were, attracting headlines and crowds just for being operational.  Machine manufacturers are already evolving their businesses and products. It should be interesting to watch how operators, exchanges, venue owners and, ultimately, consumers adapt to this changing landscape.

42397781,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAIB,1405695637,Chain’s iOS API Provides Fingerprint Authorisation for Bitcoin Apps,"Chain has released a demo iOS app with a new feature it says is the future of bitcoin on mobile devices – the ability to send bitcoin using fingerprint recognition technology.  The team says that by using Apple's built-in Touch ID feature, users can now authenticate a transaction with the dab of a digit, and describes the technology as a “simple solution for mobile bitcoin apps that need to sign transactions and store private keys”.  The best news, perhaps, is that the new API can be freely used by others. Chain told CoinDesk that the solution is “totally open source” and that developers can take it, fork it and use it as a base for their own apps.  All developers interested in the project can find all the necessary code and documentation on GitHubhttps://github.com/chain-engineering/chain-ios-wallet-demo.  How it works  The demo wallet has been built using Chain's API, and utilises Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner to ensure no one other than the device's owner can use the private bitcoin key.  The key itself is stored in the iCloud Keychain – a feature that stores and shares account IDs, passwords and other sensitive information across a user's Apple devices – but is used only by the app using the API.  A person wanting to send bitcoin simply opens the Chain app, and clicks 'send'. At this point they are prompted to touch the fingerprint sensor on the phone to authenticate the transaction. Once approved, the user can scan a QR code or paste in the receiver's wallet address and complete the transaction (see the video below).  Caveats apply  The new API will not be available for a great number of devices for a while however. The demo wallet uses the iOS 8 Touch ID API, meaning it cannot be used on earlier releases of Apple’s mobile operating system.  Apple opened its fingerprint scanner to third-party developers in iOS 8, so this functionality is only available for devices running Apple’s forthcoming iOS 8 update. For the time being, Apple only offers Touch ID on the iPhone 5S.  Furthermore, because Chain uses iCloud to store bitcoin keys, the solution is only as safe as Apple’s security. To make this clear, the team offers the following security disclaimer:  ""You have to 1) trust Apple’s security and 2) use Apple’s security (i.e., do not use on jailbroken phones).

42397780,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAJA,1405686003,New Bitcoin Poll Shows Bubble Fears Among Investors,"A new poll from Bloomberg has shed more light on the perception of bitcoin among professionals in the world of traditional finance.  Bloomberg’s poll  revealed that the fledgling currency is having trouble shaking its bubble image and that many financial professionals remain sceptical.  The majority of participants said bitcoin is currently trading at ""unsustainable"" levels.  Bloomberg’s professionals are unimpressed  Bloomberg’s poll did not involve the general public, instead focussing on 562 investors, analysts and traders that use its services.  Awareness was not an issue, but 55% percent of those surveyed said bitcoin is trading at unsustainable, ""bubble-like"" prices. On top of this, 14% said the currency was on the verge of a bubble, while 6% said a bubble is not forming. One quarter said they didn't know.  Bloomberg’s Olga Kharif argues that the results show scepticism even as “technology entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and hedge funds ploy money and effort into building [bitcoin] into a global payment system.”  A January poll by the organisation showcased further doubts from these players, with almost half of respondents bearish on the topic, saying they would sell rather than buy bitcoin. It is worth noting that bitcoin's price was significantly higher in January.  Just one month before, Bloomberg had released another poll which examined the perception of bitcoin among the average US consumer. The results indicated that 42% of Americans could correctly identify bitcoin as a digital currency, but also revealed that many people who knew bitcoin harboured reservations about its legitimacy.  Surprisingly, 6% of those who took part thought bitcoin was an Xbox game, while another 6% were convinced it was an iPhone app.  By contrast, a poll of 847 tech professionals by events company Tech in Motion revealed that over half of participants (51.1%) responded “yes, absolutely” when asked if they would like to be paid in the digital currency. Only 1.18% of those who took part said they had no idea what bitcoin was.

42397790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEAR2,1405677141,Report: Mobile Industry Should Embrace Bitcoin or Get Left Behind,"Mobile operators need to prepare for the shift to digital currencies if they want to remain competitive. That is the takeaway from a report published by European consultancy firm Reply, which also urges the mobile industry to avoid past mistakes.  The report, titled ‘Embracing Bitcoin: Why Mobile Operators Should Prepare for the Digital Currency Shift’, examines the benefits and pitfalls associated with digital currencies, and makes the case that this rapidly advancing technology is already hitting the mainstream in some respects:  ""It is now benefiting from a surge of interest, investment and acceptance, with CA$300m being invested in Bitcoin-related start-ups and high-profile names such as Richard Branson and the Winklevoss twins championing the digital currency movement, and more and more online and physical stores accepting the currency via services such as Bitpay, a service analogous to Paypal.˝  Reply  is a large company specialised in consulting, systems integration and digital services. It currently has more than 4,200 employees and annual revenue north of €500m.  Ideally positioned for digital currencies  The report notes that mobile operators are in “an ideal position” to embrace digital currencies due to a number of factors:  Smartphone penetration is high and smartphones can be used as mobile bitcoin wallets  Smartphones are already connected to the Internet, easing deployment  Customers have a certain level of trust with their mobile operators, which could be used to encourage greater acceptance  Mobile operators have already successfully deployed mobile banking systems in Africa, namely in Kenya and Tanzania, with Paym cited as an example.  Reply said that, as a result, numerous products and services could be offered with relative ease.  These include mobile wallets and currency conversion services. Mobile operators already deal with monthly contracts and tend to hold customers’ bank account details, which means they have a large user base and the necessary infrastructure to deploy digital currency services. Mobile operators could also use block-chain technology for contract signing or for proof of ownership.  Innovative third-person signing and parental services could be introduced as an offshoot. Many jurisdictions, including Britain, do not allow person under the age of 18 to own a credit card. Using mobile wallets, controlled or co-signed by the minors’ legal guardian, could bring practical and time-saving services to young people worldwide.  Mobile operators are uniquely positioned to offer offline payment systems based on bitcoin too, says the report.  This could be achieved in a number of ways, by effecting the transaction phone-to-phone, even when there is no Internet connection available. Connectivity could be accomplished through NFC, Bluetooth or personal Wi-Fi hotspots. The phones would sync back to the block chain once connectivity is restored. However, Reply says this scenario requires further research and testing before it could become a reality.  The report does not mention emerging mobile technologies, including wearable devices and Bluetooth-based beaconssuch as iBeacon and Gimbal, which are widely considered to have long-term implications for the payments industry.  Choice of revenue models  Reply says mobile operators could benefit from three different revenue models should they choose to embrace digital currencies.  Operators could use a commission-based approach, taking a small cut from some transactions. Monthly fees are another possibility, as they would offer a flat rate with no nasty surprises. Or operators could use the 'one-off approach', charging for features and transactions on a case-to-case basis.  Mobile operators already have decades of experience in offering a wide variety of mobile plans, meaning each one of these options is well within their reach. The fact that they already send out monthly bills to post-paid subscribers is another obvious advantage.  Reply explains why telecom firms could have the upper hand:  ""Competitors to the mobile operators will include third-party app developers and web-based bitcoin services, and a number of wallets already exist. However mobile operators potentially have the ability to provide services over and above what can be done on a single app via their network infrastructure and datacentre facilities already accessed by the mobile phone, and they already have a close relationship with their customers (in terms of bank account details for monthly contract customers, etc.) which could provide another differentiator.""  Reply also sees banks and services like Paym as potential competitors to its target audience.  First-mover advantage  In its conclusion, the report gives an ominous warning not to lag too far behind the curve:  “However as with many examples in the past (as has been seen with technologies such as WhatsApp/Skype/BBM/iMessage which left the operators flat-footed), if the mobile operators do not take advantage of this shift now, then third parties will do so, and the opportunity for the operators will be reduced by losing the ‘first mover’ advantage.”  The overall conclusion is positive, however, pointing out that the digital currency industry is still in its infancy, and that there is a lot of potential for companies in the telecoms space to capitalise.  “Mobile operators are in a strong position to benefit from this shift, with a large customer base owning smartphones capable of using digital currencies, the network and datacentre infrastructure to implement scalable services, and a trusted brand to encourage the slower adopters,” Reply says.  While, some mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) like Mobile Vikings have already embraced bitcoin, the majority seem happy to take a wait-and-see approach. If Reply is correct in its conclusions, though, that could be mean the mobile industry losing out in the long term to early adopters in other sectors.

42377460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX719vF,1405660319,"South Africa's PayFast Enables Bitcoin for 30,000 Merchants","There is more good news from South Africa as major payment gateway PayFast enables bitcoin access to over 30,000 online merchants, adding it as a payment option to its platform.  The company has partnered with bitcoin exchange BitX to process the payments, allowing sellers to receive South African local currency (rand, or ZAR) and avoid bitcoin price volatility.  Jonathan Smit, Managing Director and founder of PayFast, said:  ""We are not really sure what will happen with bitcoin going forward as it is still early days for the 'currency', but we’re interested in contributing to the ecosystem and seeing where it goes.""  He told CoinDesk that PayFast had been asked in the past about accepting bitcoin, but didn't want to be involved in the volatility. The partnership with BitX drove his decision and it was the synergy between the two companies that allowed the process to happen, and swiftly.  ""Being a techie, the concept of a cryptocurrency and how it works fascinates me, and while I have been following bitcoin for a while, I'm not really an early adopter, so only very recently have I actually acquired and used bitcoin myself.""  ""At this stage we view bitcoin as a payment mechanism rather than a currency,"" he added.  Listings, payments in fiat  Merchants' actual interaction with bitcoin will be minimal. Prices on a seller's website will still be listed in rand and users will be charged that amount, whatever the current exchange rate. According to the company's bloghttps://www.payfast.co.za/blog/2014/07/17/accept-bitcoin-payments-payfast/, merchants will still need to manually enable bitcoin in their account settings, as they do with other existing payment options.  They will still, however, enjoy bitcoin's advantages like low processing fees, no chargebacks or reversals, speed, and international availability.  Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX, said he was excited about the deal, which brought the benefits of digital currency to a much broader market and represented a major leap in potential volume for his company.  He said:  ""At BitX we continuously aim to make it easier for individuals and businesses to buy, sell, spend and receive their bitcoin, and this partnership is a testimony of our commitment to this promise.""  Regulation and tax issues  Smit said there were no clear guidelines for bitcoin use in South Africa yet, but both PayFast and BitX were ""committed to complying with any applicable regulation and have been proactively engaging with the South African regulators regarding it"".  In any case, PayFast was still dealing exclusively in ZAR, and didn't expect to face any new regulatory hurdles. BitX, an established bitcoin company with extensive experience dealing with regulators around the world, would take care of bitcoin issues.  BitX and PayFast background  BitX began as a South Africa-based exchange, but aims to take its technology to the world and emerging markets in particular.  It operates an internationally-available wallet and has been in discussions with local authorities to set up exchanges and local customer support centers in 12 key emerging markets.  PayFast, which started in 2007, is a turnkey online payment processor for businesses, charities and individuals. It doesn't charge any fixed monthly costs, and integrates with over 50 e-commerce systems and accepts credit cards, Instant EFT and voucher payment methods.

42377468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71A5J,1405646104,"Australian Lawyers, Bitcoin Groups Call for Clarity on Regulation","Lawyers and bitcoin groups in Australia are joining those in other countries in calling for greater clarity on bitcoin regulation, allowing clearer direction for both businesses and consumers on how to conduct their affairs in a digital currency economy.  Bitcoin now backs a business ecosystem into which hundreds of millions of investment dollars are pouring. No longer just a hobby for programmers and political activists, the fledgling industry is in need of more established structures to support those investments.  There is a growing argument for such structures: lawyers in Poland this week called for more consumer protection surrounding bitcoin, saying a lack of regulation denied users the rights available to those using more traditional payment methods. Furthermore, the industry is currently debating the pros and cons of New York's just-released 'BitLicenses' structure for compliance.  Then there's the continuing problem of existing banks and others in the finance industry refusing to work with bitcoin-accepting businesses, unilaterally closing accounts or publicly denying agreements.  Advocacy group meets with officials  Ronald Tucker, chairman delegate of the new business-oriented Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) and CEO of exchange Bit Trade Australia, last week held an awareness-raising seminar in the capital Canberra with bitcoin business representatives and government stakeholders.  These included officials from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, plus a number of other government departments and law enforcement bodies.  Tucker told CoinDesk:  ""We believe an effective regulatory framework promotes innovation and protects consumers.""  He said the meeting was well received, despite some obvious concerns, that officials knew what was at stake with the new technology and were taking it quite seriously, adding:  ""This is a truly accessible global marketplace that's developing here. The best thing to do is to work with other industry bodies around the world to help inform and educate and make sure we're doing things in everybody's best interests.""  The proposal ADCCA pitched was that the industry self-regulate, with government providing a liaison to assist it in doing so. That would help create a robust financial services framework around the digital economy.  Australia already had a world leading financial services legislative framework in place, he added, and could really establish itself as a leader in the digital space.  Tucker said ADCCA was watching developments in Japan, where the government has been instrumental in forming the self-regulatory body Japan Association of Digital Asset (JADA). There also have been positive moves in the UK, US and Singapore.  Call for clear, sensible policy  Amor Sexton of Adroit Lawyers in Sydney is Australia’s first 'digital currency lawyer'. In addition to providing advice to bitcoin businesses, she has been actively involved in liaising with the government and the regulators on behalf of the industry.  Together with fellow lawyer Reuben Bramanathan of McCullough Robertson, she researched and authored a white paper in June on bitcoin taxation recommendations for the Bitcoin Association of Australia (BAA).  Sexton said a level of regulation is necessary to foster trust from consumers and other market players, to increase adoption of bitcoin. Warnings from organizations like the European Banking Authority mainly concerned consumer protections and preventing money laundering – risks Sexton said could be largely mitigated by regulating businesses that interact with consumers.  She told CoinDesk:  ""There is a definite need for the various sections of government to provide guidance on the regulatory framework that applies to digital currencies in Australia. However, what is more important is that the guidance they provide is appropriate and well considered.""  Not too fast  Balance is the key, Sexton said. Regulation needs to mitigate risks without creating a compliance burden that stifles innovation, and the government must consider the benefits of a robust digital currency industry.  The benefits to places like Australia would be increased innovation, competition, and efficiency in the financial services sector. For an isolated country like Australia, bitcoin's lower fees would also open new world markets to small and medium sized businesses.  She added that even though there was a need for more clarity on the issue, governments should still take the time to familiarize themselves with the technology first, understand its uses and consider wider policy implications.  ""The more consideration that goes into these issues, the more thought goes into achieving that important balance between regulation and innovation.""  Sexton is one lawyer leading the way in providing advice to companies regarding digital currency use and assisting the government in formulating policy. She has also organized a 'Bitcoin for Accountants' seminar in Sydney to familiarize accountants with bitcoin transactions and some of the surrounding accounting issues.  Need for bank support  Bramanathan also stressed the need for patience, urging a ""sensible approach"". This would allow banks and financial institutions to support bitcoin, he said, which would be a ""huge step for bitcoin businesses and users"".  He also told CoinDesk there should be an opportunity for self-regulation, agreeing with ADCCA's Tucker.  Australia's two key bitcoin organizations are the BAA (affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation) and ADCCA, which is also open to non-bitcoin businesses in the existing financial sector. Like ADCCA, the Association is in ongoing consultation with government departments and regulatory bodies.  Bramanathan is an expert on digital currency and tax. He has also published an article about Australian superannuation (private retirement funds) and bitcoin, and other articles arguing why bitcoin should be legally defined as money under tax law.
