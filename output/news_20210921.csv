With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts have become even more important to the entire industry. This is because they are required to build the protocols on which these decentralized applications (DApps) run on. As they have grown in popularity, smart contracts platforms like Ethereum and Solana have recorded great success with them. Cardano has been working on bringing smart contracts to its network for a while and on September 12th, that dream became a reality with the final launch of the Alonzo Hard Fork Combinator (HFC). The arrival of smart contracts capability on the network was widely celebrated in the industry. But now, Founder Charles Hoskinson does not believe the term does justice to what Cardano actually does. Related Reading | Why The Hydra Layer 2 Solution Is Important To The Cardano Network The disagreement with the term smart contracts comes after a user pointed out that what Cardano does is actually very different from smart contracts.

Invesco and Galaxy jointly filed a registration statement for a physically backed bitcoin ETF. A physical ETF tracks the target index by holding all, or some, of the underlying assets of the index. Meanwhile, Amplify has set its sights more broadly in filing for a decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto ETF, according to a pair of regulatory filings.  The Amplify ETF application would allow the fund to invest in bitcoin futures, Canadian bitcoin funds and companies that hold more than 50% of their net assets in bitcoin, ether or another “liquid” cryptocurrency.  “Initially, the Fund expects to directly invest up to 15% of its total assets in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Canadian bitcoin ETFs investing in bitcoin,” the filing said. (Grayscale and CoinDesk share a parent company, Digital Currency Group.)  The prospectus is still subject to completion and key back-end roles are yet to be filled. For example, the pair still need to appoint a bitcoin custodian.  Invesco already has an application for a futures-linked bitcoin ETF before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A ruling on that filing is expected in October.  Long road  The SEC, which oversees ETFs within the U.S., is already reviewing over a dozen applications for various crypto-related funds, including bitcoin and ether ETFs that are based both on the actual digital asset (physically-backed) and the respective cryptocurrencies’ futures markets.  The agency has yet to approve any crypto ETFs, though SEC Chair Gary Gensler has recently suggested that a futures-based ETF filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940 might have a better chance of being approved than a physically backed ETF.  VanEck, which filed for an ETF at the end of 2020, will be the first of the recent applicants to learn how the SEC views its filing in November.

42411996,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXQ4d,1632256343,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes as Risk Appetite Weakens,"Bitcoin continued to struggle after Monday’s sell-off, although the cryptocurrency appears to be stabilizing at just above the $40,000 support level at press time. BTC is down 3% over the past 24 hours, and analysts expect the pullback to come close to an end later this week.  “Before the flash crash earlier this month, funding rates were pretty high, which tends to imply an influx of longs levering up,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm, wrote in a Tuesday report. “However, this time around, the market was not positioned as aggressively, leading to a slightly brighter outcome.”  The funding rate is the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets.  For now, technical charts show strong overhead resistance at above $45,000, which could limit short-term buying. Volatility could remain elevated this week with the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting concluding on Wednesday and the quarter-end bitcoin options expiry on Friday.  Over the long term, however, bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact. “The long-term uptrend still has a hold on bitcoin, with our monthly indicators pointing higher, putting short-term volatility into a bullish context,” Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a Monday report.  Stockton added that a broader pause in assets deemed to be risky such as equities, commodities and cryptocurrencies has prohibited alternative coins from regaining leadership for now.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $42,109, -4.5%  Ether (ETH), $2,894, -6.3%  S&P 500: -0.1%  Gold: $1,774, +0.6%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.321%  Relative returns  Despite the recent sell-off, bitcoin continues to outperform traditional assets such as equities and gold year to date. Still, BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 has risen over the past few months, leaving the cryptocurrency vulnerable to general shifts in investors’ appetite for risk.  “Truth be told, the market rout we’re seeing is reflecting a wider set of risks than just Chinese property, and comes after increasing questions have been asked about whether current valuations could still be justified, with talk of a potential correction picking up,” Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a Tuesday note.  Some 68% of investors surveyed by Deutsche Bank last week expect at least a 5% correction in equity markets before year end.  Bitcoin relative drawdown  The chart below shows bitcoin’s drawdown, or percentage decline from its peak of about $63,000 in April, is around 32%, compared with a 3% drawdown in the S&P 500. Clearly, bitcoin is more volatile than traditional assets, although bitcoin’s drawdowns tend to occur simultaneously with the S&P 500′s.  Bitcoin’s recovery over the past two months was short-lived given the recent sell-off, and its pullback could precede greater volatility in equity markets, similar to the previous two years.  Gold, however, experienced a prolonged drawdown this year; it is now near 14%, as the precious metal’s uptrend weakened because of macroeconomic reasons.  Realized losses deepen  As of Tuesday, the BTC realized net loss is at $650 million, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode. The chart below shows the bitcoin net realized profit/loss of all moved BTC over time. The current loss amount is the largest since June 25 when bitcoin was trading at about $31,600.  Further, futures data show BTC traders liquidated long positions at a greater pace than the sell-off earlier this month. That suggests that “many leveraged traders tried to catch the falling knife,” Glassnode tweeted, referring to traders who attempt to buy on the dip. It’s still too early to tell if more traders have liquidated short positions versus long positions, which could signal capitulation.  Altcoin roundup  SEC’s Gary Gensler says “most” cryptocurrencies similar to securities: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman doubled down on his position that his agency has “robust” authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, telling the Washington Post on Tuesday that “most” cryptocurrencies have attributes of securities. Gensler added that the SEC is putting together a report about stablecoins under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reported CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon. He also said the SEC is working with banking regulators in order to get expanded authority from Congress to regulate stablecoins.

The exchange plans to publicly roll out this proposal in the coming days, according to sources familiar with the regulatory discussions. Details of the proposal were not available at press time, but among other matters the company intends to argue what should and should not be defined as a security within the U.S.  When reached by CoinDesk, a Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment.  The news comes after Coinbase announced it was ceasing plans to offer a crypto lending product, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said would violate securities laws.  Earlier this month, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that the SEC had sent a Wells Notice to the exchange, which said the regulator would sue Coinbase should its “Lend” product launch.  Read more: Coinbase Drops Planned ‘Lend’ Program After SEC Warning  The SEC cited two U.S. Supreme Court precedents – the Howey and Reves cases – in arguing that Lend appeared to violate securities laws.  While Coinbase did not publish the Wells Notice, legal experts told CoinDesk the regulator might be comparing Lend to stocks or certificates of interest, which are securities under the SEC’s purview.  Setting precedent  Coinbase has a long history of trying to create frameworks and tools to standardize how exchanges approach crypto listings and products, at least within the U.S.  The exchange was a founding member of the Crypto Rating Council, a 2019 effort that sought to create a common understanding of how closely any given cryptocurrency resembled a security.  The group rated a cryptocurrency from between 1 and 5, with a 1 referring to something that is definitely not a security (such as bitcoin), and a 5 referring to something that did appear to be a security (the CRC has not announced any cryptocurrencies that fit that description).  The CRC published its approach and a scorecard that projects could use for self-evaluation last year.  Coinbase also published an open-source technical framework last year for crypto developers. Projects that adopted the framework could ensure their cryptocurrencies would be compatible with Coinbase’s listing and trading technical back end, should the exchange approve these cryptocurrencies for its platform.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/21/coinbase-to-propose-crypto-regulations-to-us-officials-sources,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6539c2b3a7048137d00c3f9a021eebb4be5e372-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411991,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otXPWh,1632252926,"No, Airdropped NFTs Cannot Empty Your Crypto Wallet","It’s scammer season in NFT-land, but amid the valid concerns about hacks and exploits, misinformation is spreading fast.  As non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to become more popular, the user demographics for many cryptocurrency platforms are fundamentally changing as a new, perhaps less tech-centric population learns how smart contracts work.  The proliferation of relatively green users and new money in the market has led to a similar boom in Discord scams, phishing attempts and “clippers” – all attack vectors that more experienced crypto users may be familiar with but that NFT collectors are often hearing about for the first time.  The prevalence of real threats has also led to a boom in misinformation about what is and isn’t a risk.  Read more: Lessons From the Nifty Gateway NFT Heist: Not Your Keys, Not Your Art  NFT misinformation  In a viral tweet on Monday, NFT collector “AJ” claimed to have lost an NFT collection worth more than $50,000 in a hack.  AJ wrote that he had not entered his seed phrase anywhere, had not interacted with fake front ends or otherwise fallen for common scam tactics, and that the only way he could have lost his collection was from malicious permissions associated with NFTs “airdropped” to his address, or NFTs sent to his address for free. AJ didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.  The incident led to a rumor that accepting bids on airdropped NFTs or listing them for sale, both of which require a contract approval, could lead to wallets being emptied.  In interviews with CoinDesk, however, a pair of developers say that AJ’s depiction of the events is highly unlikely, if not impossible, and that standard operational security – such as double-checking that emails are from the proper sources and using a hardware wallet – is the best way forward.  Contract disapproval  Key to AJ’s theory for how his wallet was drained is a feat of smart-contract wizardry that may well be impossible.  “Many NFTs you have traded on OpenSea have the ‘setApprovalForAll’ function set to ‘true’ for the OpenSea trading contracts unless you have gone out of your way to clear that approval,” NFT developer and analyst Nate Alex told CoinDesk on Twitter, adding:  “It’s a global approval for a given collection, so if you have 100 Art Block Factory NFTs and trade one of them, the other 99 are still approved for trade and thus only require you to sign a message to list more (not submit a [transaction]).”  Taking advantage of such an attack vector would still require special permissions, however.  “In order to take advantage of OpenSea’s open approval across everyone’s collections, you’d either need access to their marketplace contract via ownership controls of said contract, or access to manipulate their front end into getting users to sign fake messages,” Alex added.  Indeed, on-chain sleuths found that AJ’s own Ethereum address accepted a low bid for his Damien Hirst NFT, and as pseudonymous Solidity developer Foobar tweeted, there was no elaborate contract responsible for transferring out his holdings; his own address was the instigator.  “Looks like he probably entered his private key into a phishing site or had malware on his computer,” Foobar told CoinDesk.  While there have been conceptually similar attacks in the past with fungible token contracts, such as RUNE, which relied on a transaction origin check as opposed to a message sender check, Foobar said it’s an edge case that shouldn’t apply to NFTs.  Read more: Thorchain’s RUNE Token Tumbles After 2nd Exploit in 2 Weeks  “Any ERC-721s that check ‘tx.origin’ for approvals could be vulnerable. But I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of those,” Foobar added.

According to the motion, Ripple met with the SEC four separate times, beginning on July 8, to request records of the agency’s employees’ crypto transactions “without progress.”  Ripple attorneys requested “anonymized documents reflecting trading preclearance decisions with regard to XRP, bitcoin and ether, or alternatively, for that information to be produced in aggregate form.”  Netburn wrote that “because the preclearance process does not consider whether an asset is a security, [Ripple has] not shown that such individual trading decisions bear on the issues in this case.”  The SEC requires its employees to get approval before trading any securities but did not provide internal guidance on crypto trading until January 2018.  On March 9, 2019, the SEC issued a formal order of investigation into Ripple.

42394448,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdE95,1632247854,Can Crypto Go From Movement to Campaign?,"Cops like pulp fiction, too. Yesterday, choosing one of the most high-profile crypto conferences of the year, an agent for the U.S. Securities and Enforcement Commission (SEC) reportedly subpoenaed a crypto founder as he was preparing to take the stage.  The plot point would certainly fit the narrative: Crypto, a movement fighting for freedom and equal access in finance, was being curtailed by the state. The latest chapter of this familiar story allegedly played out at the top of an elevator shaft at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  No reporter has yet to verify the details of the incident. But Ryan Selkis, founder of the Messari media company that organized the Mainnet 2021 conference, gave credence to it when announcing his run for U.S. Senate.  “If you’re wondering when I actually decided to run for Senate, it was when these [redacted] came to my event, didn’t buy a ticket and served one of the speakers a subpoena,” Selkis tweeted yesterday.  How’s that for hard-boiled?  No one is sure if Selkis is serious. Asked about his run, Selkis told CoinDesk, “no comment.” It’s all very fitting for the novelization of crypto. Yet, in announcing his bid for office, Selkis is bringing crypto into a new era of political action – distilling a movement into a campaign.  That is a significant turn for an industry that reads like fiction and a chance for crypto to get clear about its goals. Selkis is a vocal proponent for crypto to start lobbying and electing individuals favorable to the industry. Although there are “hodlers” in office, or those who would like to be, it isn’t clear yet what it means to be a “bitcoin candidate” beyond saying vague approving things about the industry.  Read more: ‘Cautiously Optimistic’: Crypto Brings Lobbying Muscle to Infrastructure Debate  In his 1995 essay “Movements and Campaigns,” philosopher Richard Rorty outlined how the 20th century’s great political dramas might be better understood as a smaller history of discrete events, individuals working toward specific goals, rather than systemic processes.  Campaigns, Rorty writes, are finite things, “something that can be recognized to have succeeded or to have, so far, failed.” In contrast, movements – like Marxism or Christianity – are “too big and too amorphous to do anything that simple.”  Crypto is a movement. Bitcoin is at the center of a generational conflict looking to re-architect everything from money to the internet to people’s diets. It has millions of invested players and an infinite number of contradictory ambitions. It’s a brand. It’s a way of life. It’s a story that we’re telling.  It’s like what Irving Howe said of modernism, calling it “one of the major turnings in the cultural history of the West.” Howe was the lens Rorty used to make his point. In his younger years, Rorty wrote, Howe was embroiled in the world-historical attempt to establish socialism in the United States. He was a believer in the modern human spirit and founded a magazine, Dissent, to tell its story through literature and criticism.  Like others of his ilk, Howe grew disillusioned with grand political machinations. But he never lost sight of the achievable goals of socialism: using Dissent to campaign for workers’ rights, for free speech and for egalitarianism. Howe was a “warrior saint,” but he didn’t win all of his battles.  That’s for the better, Rorty thinks. “Movements can go rancid,” he wrote. They can, and are often, replaced (modernism lost to high modernism which lost to postmodernism). These grand narratives set up good versus evil but are never clear about what it means to succeed.  Specific campaigns can be won or lost, but it’s about conscious attempts at transformation.  One of the major conflicts in crypto right now is the lack of regulatory clarity. Rarely are people clear about what they want from the government. People are content to build in the shadows and occasionally bask in the spotlight of a conference stage. Up until the moment a process server comes by.  Read more: Crypto Gets Political | Opinion  Selkis’ run for Senate could offer crypto a new platform to stand on and get straight about the actual political ends it’s striving for. The SEC is pursuing concrete goals: It is targeting founders and protocols, filing lawsuits and speaking regularly about the industry.  There’s a question about whether crypto will ever go out and vote, but it’s worth it for Selkis to run. The industry cannot keep telling itself the same story, it has to get real. As Rorty said of Dissent (in a perfect world):  “It would never occur to such a person to ask whether Dissent was central or marginal to the cultural or political life of its day. She would only ask whether Dissent did some good, whether it contributed to the success of some of the campaigns in which it took part.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/21/can-crypto-go-from-movement-to-campaign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a61405816166316f1ea3a2f592595892f050fc61-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394416,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDjR,1632246572,Fear Is Good (For Your Wallet),"U.S. stocks are bouncing back today after a 1.8% dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday – the worst drop in two months. Crypto assets are stabilizing, as well, after overall crypto market caps dropped by 10% yesterday, according to CoinGecko data.  Despite the size of the drop, what many investors probably experienced yesterday was more of a correction than a crash. We’ve been in a remarkably calm, damn near up-only market in equities for more than 18 months now, and even crypto has defied historical patterns to recover from a blow-off top that peaked in April. So as long as you’ve stayed the course, you’re probably not too stressed right now.  But maybe you should be.  The dip, after all, was seemingly the result of real concerns about the looming impact of specific fundamentals and negative forces, which could go a few different ways in coming months. Evergrande Group’s debt didn’t suddenly disappear, and neither did the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Both will continue, at best, nagging markets over coming months.  That makes now as good a time as any to talk about fear and the role it plays in investing. In American culture, fear is denigrated as an unworthy emotion, a sign of weakness, a failure of character. In crypto in particular, fear is even more aggressively disparaged, as encapsulated in the epithet “FUD.”  FUD stands for “Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt,” and it seems mostly used, to be frank, by people who would rather not reckon with uncomfortable questions, or even uncomfortable facts. A simple report of indisputable negative news, such as an U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against an alleged fraud, or consideration of a truly worrying unknown, like tether’s reserves, will often be dismissed by denizens of the crypto-sphere as mere “FUD” and therefore unworthy of attention.  Read More: Bitcoin Won’t Save the Afghan People | David Z. Morris  That attitude is a great way to get utterly rekt. Imagine, for example, that an investor in Evergrande began hearing worries about its debt load a year ago and dismissed those concerns as “FUD.” Evergrande is huge, and so there probably were plenty of investors who did exactly that, perhaps without the precise terminology.  Evergrande’s stock is now down 83% from 12 months ago.  Fear, uncertainty and doubt are starting points for critical thinking and building stronger theses. They are feelings that evolved in humans to prevent us from taking stupid risks and getting eaten by saber-tooth tigers. They imply questions that need to be answered (“Is there a tiger in that bush?”), not merely numinous negativity (“There are tigers everywhere”). In short, if you care about risk and remember that markets really do sometimes go down, you must be open to fear.  To be clear, there are bad kinds of fear – particularly, panic. A key takeaway for individual investors from today’s recovery bounce: NEVER panic sell. In theory, you might think you’ll save some of your capital and then rotate back into assets at some point as they bottom out or recover, but trying to time that move is a real gamble.  That seems especially true right now. With cash spilling out of people’s pockets, pullbacks are almost instantly answered by someone willing to “buy the dip.” About half of those buyers, at least in the U.S. stock market, are math-genius robots connected directly to the New York Stock Exchange by fiber-optic cables, and buddy, you’re not going to beat them through your Fidelity account. That is one reason individual active traders, on average, lose money.  One way to think about the difference between fear and panic is how they manifest in a mildly risky situation, such as a day hike in the woods. A reasonable amount of fear will lead you to bring plenty of water, rain protection, insect repellent and a compass, so that you’re prepared for the worst.  Panic, on the other hand, will lead you to fall off the side of a mountain when a bee flies into your face.  Part of the point here is that informed fear actually prevents reactive panic. If you were already attuned to the market’s worries about Evergrande, maybe you were on board with the professionals and high-frequency traders who were able to sell off first thing Monday and then successfully bought the dip (again, don’t try that at home).  But if you were simply blocking out negative signals, you were among those who started seeing headlines about some Chinese real estate developer at 11 a.m. Eastern, then sold the local bottom like a city kid afraid of a bee.  So go forth, and be fearful. In the long run, you’ll come out ahead.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,David Z.

42376156,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwG01F,1632245106,Want to Build a Bitcoin Mining Rig? Compass Mining Now Sells Single ASICs.,"Bitcoin mining began as a cottage industry with individual miners able to mine Bitcoin on a laptop. Over the years, the technology became more specialized and sophisticated, with large facilities taking over the industry.  But with the launch of its at-home mining program, Compass Mining is betting that individual bitcoiners will want to mine bitcoin once again.  Bitcoin miners play a key role in securing the Bitcoin blockchain. They compete for the right to compile transactions in new blocks and add them to the chain. In return, successful miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoin (6.25 BTC) as well as the fees included with each transaction in that block. That’s a lucrative payout – if you’re lucky enough to find a block. But the cost of setting up and operating a bitcoin mining rig can certainly cut into your profits. And typically the price has been prohibitively high for the average at-home miner.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Compass’ new retail program will allow individuals to buy a single application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bitcoin mining rig that they can set up at home, rather than having to buy them in bulk from the manufacturers. Brands include the WhatsMiner series from MicroBT and the Antminer series from Bitmain, offering 78 to 95 terahashes per second and ranging in price from $8,100 to $10,400.  “Bitmain and MicroBT make top-of-the-line ASIC mining hardware with the most powerful hashrate and best energy efficiency,” said Thomas Heller, Compass Mining’s chief business officer, adding:  “Bitcoin was started by home miners and now we are seeing a renaissance of home mining.”  Support for at-home bitcoin miners  Just because you are running your own machine, it doesn’t mean that you’re totally on your own. All rigs can still be plugged into a mining pool, meaning that any rewards found by your pool will be shared with you in proportion to the hashrate you contribute. Joining a pool can improve your return on investment (ROI).  Profitability calculators, such as the one found on Braiins, can help you estimate your potential ROI, once you factor in the cost of the equipment and electricity it takes to run your rig.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Bitfury Plans to Go Public With Value in ‘Billions of Pounds:’ Report  Compass will offer its concierge support, already in place for its hosted rigs, to its at-home mining customers. There is also an active Discord community of mining enthusiasts who can help with troubleshooting and offer advice.  According to Compass Mining CEO Whit Gibbs, Compass offers “a large archive of education materials for miners looking to learn more about mining conceptually and the basics of how to start mining at home.”  Pros and cons of mining bitcoin at home  Mining bitcoin has the potential to be lucrative, plus there is the fact that, as an at-home miner, you are contributing to the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.  Practically speaking, however, if you are considering mining bitcoin at home, you will want to keep in mind that rigs are loud and hot. About the size of a desktop computer tower, they can emit between 50 and 75 decibels of noise, which is roughly the same level as a vacuum cleaner or a hairdryer.  As for the heat, some bitcoin miners have been able to use that excess to their advantage, especially in colder climates. But condo-dwellers in the southern U.S. may want to consider the effect running a miner could have on their comfort.  Mining on the rise in North America  The demand for mining hosting sites in North America has been outstripping supply. Encouraging bitcoin enthusiasts to set up their own operations at home is one way to relieve the pressure on existing hosting infrastructures.  Bitcoin miners in the U.S. and Canada have enjoyed a windfall since the State Council of China called for local authorities to crack down on crypto mining in May. The crackdown nearly halved the mining difficulty for the entire Bitcoin network. Miners outside China have been able to mine more bitcoin given the record low mining difficulty, raking in high revenue.  Read more: China’s Bitcoin Mining Crackdown Is a Boon for Miners Elsewhere  However, large self-mining companies, such as Marathon and Riot, as well as third-party hosting sites, are facing a shortage in infrastructure to support more mining operations. In the meantime, bitcoin’s recent bull run and relatively low rigs prices are pushing the profit margins for bitcoin mining higher.  Against that backdrop, some individual bitcoin miners are buying mining machines either from Chinese miners or from mining machine manufacturers through e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and eBay and setting up the machines in their houses.  Individual mining rigs from Compass are expected to deliver within two to three weeks. Online ordering is available to U.S. customers via the company website; international orders can be placed by contacting a sales rep through the website and requesting a manual invoice.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,"Christie Harkin, David Pan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/want-to-mine-bitcoin-at-home-compass-mining-now-sells-single-asics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79eff14bcf4c9941df510c167521b592018e87d9-3330x2223.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was led by North Island Ventures with participation from Polychain Capital, Reciprocal Ventures, Leminscap, CMT Digital, Free Company, Alameda Ventures, Infinite Capital, Flow Ventures and Drops Foundation, the company announced on Tuesday.  These days, investors in crypto don’t speak to a broker or some Wall Street type; they talk to their friends on social media, or just strangers on the internet. Of course, disruption of the traditional investment advisory model is not new, but “social investing 1.0” isn’t really up to snuff, according to .  The real network effects of social investing have been hampered until now by inconsistent, siloed and centralized platforms, Scaria said in an interview. Moreover, the next generation of financial value creators will want to truly own their audience and have more direct links to monetization. More like a Substack than an eToro, in other words.  “Web 3 enables an entirely new stab at social investing,” Scaria told CoinDesk. “DeFi, for instance, is this connective financial fabric that unlocks new network effects. NFTs let creators build closer relationships with their fans. All this allows creators to own their resumes and their audience, and I think social investing will evolve into a new online economy.”  Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to Prysm, create a profile and stipulate what sort of investments interest them, be that NFTs, swing trading or “gem hunting” (finding low-cap coins on platforms like Uniswap). Thereafter relevant investors matching the user’s profile are suggested for them to follow.  The platform also offers a degree of transparency and verification, as Prysm ensures investors have their money where their mouth is, Scaria said. There are also interesting ways that investors are incentivized to leak alpha to their fans.  “We made this ‘idea creator’ where some investor can suggest ideas for his fans to copy,” Scaria said. “They can mint these ideas as one-off NFTs and have scarce access to their superfans. So they might mint just five of these and price them at $500 apiece and only holders of those NFTs have access to this trade idea.”  A slew of angel investors also joined the funding round, including Zane Tackett, Tony Sheng, Imran Khan, Qiao Wang, Clay Robbins, Regan Bozman, Sergei Chan and Marc Weinstein.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/get-ready-for-investor-fan-tokens-polychain-backs-prysms-approach-to-social-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c195be29a24c5a5dcafd6ddc4f14f6e53f498283-1500x1129.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(The Defiant reported Monday that Kwon said he had not been served by U.S. regulators. Neither he nor his lawyer have returned CoinDesk’s inquiries.)  “This is not acceptable behavior … to indiscriminately crack down on an entire industry, blow off invitations to attend a leading U.S. industry conference this year in this space and ultimately make a good-faith effort to engage and try to educate themselves on what’s actually going on,” Selkis said about the alleged subpoena.  It’s not just the events that happened at this year’s Mainnet conference that make Selkis frustrated with regulators.  “The reality is that the regulatory state in the U.S. has a hammer and everything in crypto looks like a nail right now,” he said.

The GFMA said that such a weighting was unnecessary.  “We find the proposals in the consultation to be so overly conservative and simplistic that they, in effect, would preclude bank involvement in crypto asset markets,” the GFMA wrote in the letter to the Committee.

42376162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwG0CZ,1632234603,US Sanctions Enforcer Blacklists a Crypto Exchange for First Time,"The U.S. government has sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time as part of its ongoing fight against ransomware attacks.  The Treasury Department announced Tuesday it is adding Russia-based Suex.io to its list of specially designated nationals (SDNs) for its alleged role in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions for ransomware attackers.  As a result of the designation, which puts Suex in a category with suspected terrorists and drug traffickers, U.S. residents and citizens are forbidden to do business with the exchange, on penalty of fines or prison.  Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo said in a press call ahead of the announcement that Suex facilitated transactions from at least eight ransomware variants, and as much as 40% of Suex’s transaction volume was associated with addresses linked to known malicious actors.  “Exchanges like Suex are critical to attackers’ ability to extract profits from ransomware attacks. Today’s action is a signal of our intention to expose and disrupt the illicit infrastructure used in these attacks,” Adeyemo said.  The Wall Street Journal reported Friday the Treasury Department intends to impose sanctions to take on ransomware.  The Treasury Department said in a press release the U.S. would block any Suex property within its borders.  Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the division in charge of the SDN list, has sanctioned individual middlemen who process crypto transactions since 2018, when it added two people charged with facilitating transactions from victims of the SamSam ransomware.  At the time, OFAC added bitcoin addresses to its SDN list as well. It added another 14 XBT addresses, four ETH addresses and seven USDT addresses to the blacklist on Tuesday.  The Treasury did not sanction any individuals working for the exchange at press time. Spokespeople for the department did not respond to a question about whether any employees would be added.  The Treasury Department also updated its 2020 guidance on ransomware payments, which states that “facilitating ransomware payments on behalf of a victim may violate OFAC regulations.”  ‘Nested exchange’  Suex is nominally based in the Czech Republic but operates out of Russia, according to a blog post by TRM Labs.  The post, which summarizes a TRM investigation, says Suex began operations “under the corporate ownership” of Izibits OU, an Estonian-licensed virtual asset service provider. TRM claims the exchange’s executives are Vasilii Zhabykin, who the blog says may be affiliated with a major Russian telecom, and Tibor Bokor, a Czech venture capitalist.  While the Treasury Department did not identify any specific attacks Suex abetted, Chainalysis said in a blog post that cryptocurrencies paid by victims of the Ryuk, Conti and Maze ransomware attacks sent payments that ultimately went through the exchange.  Chainalysis identified some $13 million in bitcoin transactions sent through Suex directly tied to ransomware attacks. Scammers sent another $24 million in bitcoin, while another $20 million in bitcoin were tied to Hydra and other darknet markets.  Read more: State of Crypto: Ransomware Is a Crypto Problem  Overall, Chainalysis said, the exchange has received over $480 million in bitcoin transactions since February 2018. The analytics firm was able to tie at least $160 million worth of that to illicit activities.  Both TRM and Chainalysis said Suex is a “nested service,” meaning it borrows custody and address services from a larger, better-established service.  In other words, the exchange did not directly provide custody services. TRM said the exchange required customers to transact in person at its offices, and only accepted customers through referrals.  Neither TRM nor Chainalysis identified the exchange or exchanges with which Suex worked, but TRM said the company had “access to cash from unknown sources.”  Chainalysis also identified more than $50 million in cryptocurrency transactions sent from addresses tied to BTC-e to Suex, a crypto exchange U.S. authorities seized in 2017 on allegations it facilitated money laundering.  Many of these transactions occurred after BTC-e was officially shut down, Chainalysis said.  Next steps  Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser to the Biden administration, reiterated Treasury’s approach to ransomware attacks in the press call, laying out a four-pronged strategy that includes disrupting ransomware actors and infrastructure, shoring up possible target entities, limiting cryptocurrency payments and building international cooperation to mitigate future attacks.  “This effort builds on our international efforts, often led by Treasury, to ensure proper regulation and know-your-customer controls overseas to virtual currency exchanges and we’re also building our industry partnerships and analytic capabilities to support interdiction events,” she said.  Neuberger, who oversees cybersecurity and emerging technologies for the White House, announced the federal government was creating a dedicated group to examine ransomware earlier this summer.  The group was formed in the wake of several high-profile ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure, including interstate gas provider Colonial Pipeline, meat processor JBS and software provider Kaseya.  Adeyemo said the Treasury Department is focused on other types of crypto transaction facilitators, including mixers and what role they might play in illegal transactions.  “We’re going to continue to look at [exchanges] within this ecosystem and also look at mixers and see whether and to look for other actions we can take for payments given the importance to protecting our national security,” he said.  Neither federal official said whether any specific mixer-related actions are forthcoming, but the U.S. Department of Justice has already warned that using mixers may in and of itself be a crime.  Adeyemo closed the press call with an acknowledgement that cryptocurrencies are not only being used for illegal activities.  “We recognize that the vast majority of activity that’s happening in the virtual currencies is legitimate activity, but we also do know that these criminals are using some of these exchanges and mixers and peer-to-peer services to conduct illicit activity that is not in our national interests,” he said.

42394435,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdF3V,1632233100,Witness the Rise of the Crypto Nominee,"This week, I consider the increasing number of regulatory nominees who bring some familiarity with digital assets to the table, even if their prospective jobs don’t require it; the U.S. Treasury Department’s imminent, and highly consequential, moves to regulate the industry; and the clampdown on crypto lending at the state and federal levels.  More than ever, the old saying of “you may not be interested in politics but politics is interested in you” is ringing true for a field that until recently Washington considered too small to matter and too weird to comprehend. Neither description applies much anymore.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Rise of the crypto nominee  The narrative  An increasing number of nominees to state and federal regulatory posts have some sort of cryptocurrency background, whether as a researcher, participant or academic studying the sector. For those clamoring for regulatory clarity, this is likely a good sign. Moreover, this trend will likely continue.  Why it matters  Financial regulators will be responsible for how the U.S. government approaches stablecoins, decentralized finance, central bank digital currencies and a host of other crypto-related issues. Having regulators who understand crypto will increase the likelihood of more informed proposals (note: this doesn’t mean friendlier-to-crypto proposals).  Breaking it down  Something a little odd is happening.  Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he intended to nominate Kristin Johnson, a professor of law at Emory University, and Christy Goldsmith Romero, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and an adjunct professor at both Georgetown University and the University of Virginia, to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a key federal regulator.  Before that, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced she intended to nominate Adrienne Harris, a professor at the University of Michigan and adviser to the Digital Dollar Project to be the new Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  Biden’s pending Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director is Rohit Chopra, who has also served as a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission.  And the next Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve is rumored to be Lael Brainard, who is already on the U.S. central bank’s board as a Governor.  Each and every one of these candidates has experience – in some way or another – in crypto.  This probably was a coincidence. I don’t think Biden was explicitly looking for financial product experts who have dedicated time and research into crypto. But the fact that we’re now seeing so many potential regulators who have crypto in their background is interesting at the least.  We were discussing this in the State of Crypto Telegram group the other day and it does seem like this is going to be an emerging trend. Candidates for regulatory agencies may well have more and more crypto experience in the near term.  John Collins, a partner at FS Vector, told me to expect more crypto-native or crypto-savvy political appointees after Biden won the 2020 election in November.  Part of this is because as crypto becomes increasingly popular or mainstream, the chances of any given individual knowing about it also rise. But cryptocurrencies are also presenting possible new methods for solving existing financial issues, or new options for providing services like lending. Johnson, one of the CFTC commissioner nominee-designates, was described as being an expert in “complex financial products regulation,” including transactions and settlement. This type of knowledge will be invaluable to regulating new crypto derivatives products.  As in the case of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who taught a course on cryptocurrencies and blockchain while at MIT, I suspect this isn’t a signal of whether we’ll see favorable or unfavorable regulations for crypto, but whatever regulations we do see will demonstrate a greater understanding of this sector and related technologies than in years past.  However, we are seeing a lot more regulatory scrutiny of crypto now than we did a year ago, from multiple departments and branches of government. This scrutiny is only going to intensify, whether that’s through state regulator crackdowns on crypto lending firms (see below), federal crackdowns on stablecoins or actual guidance from agencies on how to approach digital asset products.  Better “tough but savvy” than “tough and clueless.”  Treasury gets busy  The U.S. Treasury Department plans to produce at least two different types of crypto-related actions in the near future.  The government wing will soon unveil sanctions and guidance to take on ransomware attacks. The goal is to mitigate future attacks that would require crypto payments.  While details are scarce (so far), The Wall Street Journal reported that these actions will be specific to companies, rather than a broadside against crypto in general. What we do know is Treasury will announce its actions within the next few days.  The Treasury Department also plans to publish a report on stablecoins for the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets.  The working group is composed of the heads of most federal financial regulators, including the SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department. The group has been looking at stablecoins since at least last year during the Trump administration.  The group is considering what sort of risks stablecoins present to financial stability and investors, as well as what sort of regulations make sense.  SEC Chair Gensler hinted that some of these stablecoins might be securities, if they are backed by stuff other than U.S. dollars (like, say, money market funds or commercial paper).  I haven’t heard yet whether this report will be made public, and it’s even less clear how quickly the working group might act on the recommendations. Still, how the Treasury views stablecoins will be pivotal for a segment of the crypto industry worth over $100 billion.  Everybody hates crypto lending  Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Regulators in the U.S. states of Texas, New Jersey and Alabama have all alleged that a crypto lender is violating securities laws with its core lending products.  Anyways, New Jersey issued a cease-and-desist, Texas scheduled a hearing for next year and Alabama published a show-cause order against Celsius, in an episode pretty reminiscent of how state regulators viewed BlockFi Interest Accounts just weeks before.  The allegations against Celsius are pretty straightforward: The regulators all say Celsius’ “Earn Rewards” product resembles notes or investment contracts, which are subject to registration as a security in the respective states where Celsius operates.  “Respondents are, in part, illegally funding their lending operations, proprietary trading and other revenue-generating activities through the sale of unregistered securities in the form of cryptocurrency interest-earning accounts,” according to the Texas order.  A Celsius spokesperson told CoinDesk the company disagrees with the allegations.  Separately, Coinbase revealed it has scrapped its plans to introduce a lending product after the Securities and Exchange Commission sent a conditional Wells Notice to the company.  Interestingly, Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev seemed to imply he hadn’t received any messages from state regulators. He told my colleague Nate DiCamillo his company is preparing for when regulators reach out, saying every company operating in the U.S. will have to “cross the same bridge” eventually.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  After all the news of the other week, not a whole lot this week on whether we’ll see any confirmation hearings or votes for the heads of these federal agencies.  Elsewhere:  $3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers: Here’s a rundown of this bizarre story from CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman.  Digital Euro Isn’t Guaranteed After Experiment, ECB Advisor Says: An adviser to the European Central Bank, Jürgen Schaaf, said the ECB’s two-year experiment with a central bank digital currency won’t signify whether it will actually launch a CBDC.  US Officials Add Insider Trading Claims to Binance Investigation: Report: Add this to the list of investigations Binance is facing.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Financial News London) Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao apparently told FN London he plans to restructure his exchange into a more centralized entity in order to ease regulatory concerns.  (New York Times) The New York Times, the so-called Paper of Record, published a fairly comprehensive stablecoin explainer.

Read more here.  The former head of ConsenSys Ventures, Kavita Gupta, has launched the Delta Blockchain Fund, with a target size of $50 million to $100 million.  Gupta previously managed a number of $50 million-plus funds for ConsenSys Ventures in 2018. She left the firm in 2019 to teach at Stanford University and is now back in the venture capital world with her own fund.  The new Delta Blockchain Fund is oversubscribed for the first close, at more than $30 million, and it has attracted investment from founders of Quantstamp, Polygon, Viraj Mehta from Rosy Blue, Klaus Hommels from Lakestar and others.  Gupta told CoinDesk she started building the fund around six weeks ago. It will invest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), scalability and multi-chain interoperability with a focus on decentralized identity. Another focus is storage and computation from both a hardware and software perspective, which she says is important in supporting institutional adoption.  “I wanted to start my own fund to be able to build the portfolio and support the founders completely and purely based on my vision and belief, and with my lessons learned from over a decade of investing,” Gupta told CoinDesk.  Daniel Novy, another ex-ConsenSys employee who has been in the crypto industry since 2010, will support Gupta as a venture partner. Vince Molinari, former CEO of Templum Markets, will support Gupta and Novy on regulatory issues, “bridging the gap of regulatory understanding at a very early stage, which is unique to pre-seed or seed stage funds,” Gupta said.  Tackling the gender gap  The crypto and venture capital industries have suffered from a lack of female leaders, and Gupta said that although some progress has been made, more is needed.  “I didn’t see women of color running their own funds when I started in this space, which has changed a lot but not yet that much in the blockchain industry, and it is time for that,” said Gupta.  According to Gupta, the new fund will channel investment to projects and developers “building products to scale and support a decentralized world irrespective of their chain solution.”  “We truly believe that the future will be on multi-chain, and we want to support various cross-bridging, scalable, multi-chain solutions and dapps on them,” she said.  So far the fund has invested in Nahmii, a layer 2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum blockchain; Swap Kiwi, which allows users to swap NFTs with each other by connecting to a wallet; and Metaverse AI, which builds the Open Metaverse with full-stack infrastructure and dapps; Fodl, which enables traders to use leverage without paying a funding rate; and Taker, the first protocol to provide liquidity to the NFT market through a DAO.  UPDATE (Sept. 21 13:21 UTC): This article has been modified to show that the fund targets a size of $50 million to $100 million.

42376147,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwFzpv,1632224775,Nader Al-Naji (Formerly Known as ‘Diamondhands’) Unveils Long-Term Plan for BitClout Blockchain,"The pseudonymous founder of the controversial social media site BitClout has confirmed his identity and revealed some of the thinking behind the platform’s chaotic rollout. He’s also announced DeSo – a blockchain that’s already raised $200 million in financing from Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, Sequoia and others.  The founder, hitherto known as “Diamondhands,” is Nader Al-Naji, a 29-year-old Princeton graduate who raised (and subsequently returned) $133 million for a crypto startup called Basis.  BitClout is a site that’s trying to put social media on the blockchain. Each user is tied to their own “creator coin,” which other users can buy into. The logic is that the more people value your content, the more people will want your coin. There’s also a native cryptocurrency, $CLOUT, which powers the blockchain behind the platform.  Read more: What Is BitClout? The Social Media Experiment Sparking Controversy on Twitter  Now, Al-Naji is giving that blockchain a name – DeSo, short for “decentralized social” – and introducing a new ticker symbol to match. It’s a network that’s custom-built for social applications: in the way that Ethereum offers tools to build crypto-backed computer programs, DeSo purports to offer a framework that’s specifically geared toward social networks.  In a Zoom interview, Al-Naji explained that BitClout was really a proof of concept for DeSo. “We wanted to essentially launch a demo app that showcases the features of the DeSo blockchain,” he said. “But what happened, which is kind of weird, is the BitClout app kind of exploded. A lot of mainstream celebrities joined – Tyga, Antonio Brown, Diplo, Blau all have profiles on the DeSo blockchain through the BitClout app.”  But it wasn’t just the rapper Tyga and the DJ Diplo – BitClout also created zombie accounts for users who hadn’t yet signed up for the platform. Social tokens for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and singer Ariana Grande are among the highest-valued coins on BitClout, even though neither celebrity has actually agreed to promote the site.  People with smaller Twitter accounts, too, discovered their personal information on BitClout. One thread called BitClout an “influencer-pandering tirefire [sic].” A Decrypt article described it as “dystopian.”  “To the credit of the critics, I think when we launched BitClout, we were not expecting it to grow to the level that it was,” Al-Naji said. “And their concerns were actually valid.”  It didn’t help that Al-Naji was keeping his identity under wraps at the time, giving interviews under his BitClout account name, “Diamondhands.”  “I was anonymous because I believed that it would inspire the community to decentralize the ecosystem faster,” he said. “The less people rely on a centralized entity to call the shots, the more they feel empowered to improve and build on top of the ecosystem.”  That strategy appears to have worked: “Over 100 developers just started building on the DeSo blockchain without even talking to us first,” Al-Naji said.  Read more: BitClout’s Alleged Leader Hit With Cease-and-Desist by Prominent Crypto Law Firm  Over the six months DeSo has been in beta, those developers have already created a cottage industry of BitClout-adjacent social apps. Pulse, formerly known as BitClout Pulse, is a dedicated trading platform for BitClout social tokens. Flick is a mobile client for BitClout, and BitHunt is a site for keeping track of other DeSo sites.  The DeSo blockchain was engineered with Al-Naji’s grand designs in mind. Each block on DeSoto holds 32 megabytes of information. By comparison, each block on the Bitcoin blockchain holds 1 MB. Al-Naji said he hopes that the platform will “scale decentralized social applications to 1 billion users.”  DeSo also relies on a a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which means the standard environmental concerns apply, though Al-Naji says he plans to switch over to the less ecologically impactful proof-of-stake system “by the end of the year.”  $DESO is already trading on the Blockchain.com and AscendEX exchanges.  “I don’t know that people are really going to see the vision for what it is initially,” Al-Naji said. “But I’m very confident in what I’ve been working on for over two years, and I’m just gonna keep telling people the facts as I see them.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/nader-al-naji-fka-diamondhands-unveils-new-blockchain-long-term-plan-for-bitclout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7959eb7104c46243a25093829e9722ade4ffbce-648x432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round values TrueLayer at more than $1 billion, thus giving it “unicorn” status.  Open banking, for which TrueLayer provides infrastructure, enables customers to transact with businesses more seamlessly via bank-to-bank payments, circumventing the need for debit and credit cards to make purchases and register with platforms.  “People find themselves endlessly typing in the 16 digits of their debit cards, trusting unknown websites to store their card details, deferring to credit cards for bigger purchases, and getting stuck in clumsy authentication loops,” CEO Francesco Simoneschi said in a statement Monday.  Removing this requirement has the potential to negate some of the onboarding frictions for crypto businesses. TrueLayer aims to allow instant deposits and withdrawals through a single integration between the user’s bank account and the crypto platform.

42376151,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwFzxT,1632218164,"Bitcoin Bounces Off 6-Week Low, Tracking Recovery in Stocks","Bitcoin continues to take cues from equity markets amid macro uncertainty, seeming to contradict the popular narrative of the cryptocurrency being a safe haven like gold.  The cryptocurrency has bounced to $43,000 from the six-week low of $40,200 reached early today, with futures tied to the S&P 500 signaling a risk reset with a 1% gain. Major European stock indices are also trading higher alongside weakness in the safe-haven U.S. dollar despite lingering concerns about China’s property market and its contagion risk for the global economy.  Fears that cash-strapped Chinese property giant Evergrande would default on its interest payments rocked global markets on Monday, sending bitcoin, the S&P 500 and growth-sensitive risk assets lower. Evergrande Chairman Xu Jiayin sent a letter to 125,000 employees on Monday, saying the company would soon “walk out of the darkness.” The company’s real test lies ahead as $83.5 million interest payment is due on Thursday, and another $47.5 million payment is due on Sept. 29. A default could bring another round of panic selling in risk assets.  Some experts are worried that an impending drawdown in fiscal spending would lead to an economic slowdown in the coming quarters and weigh on risk assets. According to The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government could run out of cash and hit the debt ceiling between mid-October and mid-November. On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen renewed a call for raising the debt ceiling, warning that a failure to do so may trigger a historic financial crisis.  However, for now, the market focus seems to have shifted to the two-day Federal Reserve meeting scheduled to begin later today.  According to some observers, the central bank may refrain from announcing the withdrawal of asset purchases or early rate hikes, given the possibility of a messy spillover of China’s property market woes into the global economy.  Bitcoin and risk assets in general will likely pick up a strong bid if the central bank pushes out its tapering plans to 2022. Per Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst at TrendSpider, $50,000 is the major resistance level to beat for the bulls.  “After a large move up over the summer months, bitcoin has started to trade within a range between $43,000 and $49,000-$50,000,” Wujastyk said in an email. “Until one of these levels breaks up or down, market participants should expect continued range-bound trading between these two support and resistance zones.”  According to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, the path of least resistance remains on the higher side. “The long-term uptrend still has a hold on bitcoin, with our monthly indicators pointing higher, putting short-term volatility into a bullish context,” Stockton said in a weekly research note published late Monday.  “When the pullback matures, we will turn our attention back to the recent peak near $52,900 as a minor hurdle to all-time highs,” Stockton added.  The 200-day moving average at $45,813 may offer resistance ahead of the Sept. 18 high of $48,825.  According to TrendSpider’s Wujastyk, $42,600 is the volume-weighted average price from April highs and represents key support.

Please connect us via email or other contact you prefer,” it said.  Vee had announced Saturday that total value locked on its platform had surpassed $300 million.  In the wake of the exploit, the value of native token VEE tanked from over $0.25 to $0.085, according to CoinGecko. At the time of writing, its price had recovered somewhat to nearly $0.11.  The exploit follows a $3.2 million hack of Avalanche-based DeFi protocol Zabu Finance earlier this month, thought by analytics provider DeFiprime to be the “first big exploit” on the Avalanche blockchain.

There&apos;s even more venture capital investment in blockchain companies than ever before. The digital real estate sector is also being redrawn by new applications of blockchain technology. The first use case for blockchain was to decentralize finance. The second is to decentralize ownership of virtual land, which is being pioneered by Next Earth, the NFT-based replica of Earth, where users can buy one-of-a-kind metaverse property.

The European fantasy soccer and digital collectible platform announced a $680 million Series B raise on Tuesday, the largest ever in the non-fungible token (NFT) space.  The round’s lead investors include SoftBank Vision Fund, LionTree, Bessemer Ventures, IVP, Hillhouse and Atomico. The funding round values the company at $4.3 billion.  Sorare says it has traded over $150 million worth of digital cards on its platform since January and currently has over 600,000 registered users.  From Q2 2020 to Q2 2021, the company said its sales increased 54 times from the previous year. The Paris-based company says it will use the new funds to accelerate growth and venture outside the touch lines of soccer collectibles.  CEO Nicolas Julia said in a press release he sees an opportunity to “introduce the same proven model to other sports and sports fans worldwide” and will be opening a U.S. office in the near future.  The company is eyeing basketball, American football and baseball as the next targets for its current model, a representative told CoinDesk in an interview.  As the global sports NFT market continues to mature, U.S. companies will look to take market share of the lucrative European soccer NFT space, and vice versa. Thibaut Predhomme, head of operations at Sorare, is not worried about having to compete on the company’s own turf.  “We are the only ones that have bridged the gap between the game, collectibility and utility over the lifetime of sports NFTs,” Thibaut told CoinDesk in an interview. “U.S. companies are more about collectibility so, no, I’m not worried about them competing in the European market.”  Sorare raised a $50 million Series A in February, led by venture capital firm Benchmark.

After Dec. 23, users will no longer be able to manually reduce their positions and all remaining open positions will be closed, the exchange said Tuesday.  “We proactively review our product offerings and activities on an ongoing basis, against user demand, evolving regulatory requirements and future opportunities, to determine changes and improvements,” a spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk via Telegram on Tuesday.  The move follows last month’s restrictions on options, margin products and leveraged tokens where new accounts were barred from engaging. In a run-up to events, Binance also halted its crypto margin trading involving the sterling, the euro and the Australian dollar back in July in a bid to appease financial regulators.  Binance is a separate entity from Binance Australia, which, in turn, is operated by InvestbyBit, a company registered with the country’s financial watchdog AUSTRAC as a “digital currency exchange provider.” The embattled Binance brand has repeatedly been under fire from regulators globally, including in the U.S. where it has been accused of insider trading, among other accusations.

There are strict guidelines in place at most gambling authorities, which are there to ensure player safety. Customers of online casinos and betting sites can now play without fear of their data being collected and sold to third parties. However, as we move into the realm of crypto gambling and cryptocurrency casino platforms, the issue of regulation begins to become more complicated. How Does Cryptocurrency Gambling Work? Generally, blockchain-based gambling occurs in two ways: on-chain and off-chain. The off-chain cryptocurrency gambling industry includes both physical and online casinos that accept cryptocurrency. To convert Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies into local fiat currencies, these establishments will often use third-party custodians, such as BitPay. It is possible to find online casinos that operate exclusively without fiat currency and payout in Bitcoin. A decentralized application that runs on a blockchain network, rather than traditional centralized servers, is the basis of on-chain gambling on a blockchain. Off-chain casinos are much easier for governments to pursue. The IP addresses of certain countries are often blocked by crypto casino websites.

Scammers in NFTs Non-fungible Tokens have been such a topic in both the art and the finance sectors of the economy. NFTs are tokens that deal with uniqueness as their determiner of value. They use the same technology as cryptocurrencies, but unlike cryptocurrencies, they have no replica, and copyrights belong solely to the owner of the NFT. After Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet at $2.9m, it set a great example to investors and artists and gave them ideas of what and where to trade in the form of NFTs. As fate would have it, some scammers saw this as an excellent opportunity to earn a massive amount of cash without doing much. Is NFT a scam? While some have begun investing in NFTs, some claim it to be a scam. The latter cling to their claims that some NFTs can be found on various websites for free. However, that is not the principle that NFTs work on. NFTs are owned because of their uniqueness.

Ethereum lowered 7 percent to just above $3,000 while Altcoins also suffered. Serious losses can be observed in major Altcoins, such as Cardano (9 percent), Ripple (9 percent), Solana (10 percent), Dogecoin (8 percent) and Polkadot (8 percent).

Traders remain skeptical about the coin&apos;s prospects since the news regarding Walmart&apos;s fake report on accepting Litecoin came into spotlight. Despite earlier momentum pushing price as high as $196 on Thursday, bearish returns have taken over the market. Trading volume does not present a bullish sight either, dropping down to near 40 percent. Litecoin&apos;s price action has replicated that of the larger cryptocurrency market, as Altcoins recorded decrements across the board. Ethereum continues to consolidate just under $3,500, with other Altcoins such as Cardano, Ripple and Dogecoin going down around 4 percent each. However, Solana comes off as a big winner in the market, upping 10 percent to rise above $160. Bitcoin also showed some promise in the market, consolidating above $48,000.
