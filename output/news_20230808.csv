15803114,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546329,1691539188,"Will Record Low Volatility Awaken A Behemoth Bitcoin Surge? 4,000% Signal Returns","Bitcoin price has been ranging around $30,000 for most of 2023, taking even the highest timeframes down to a record low volatility state — something highly unusual for cryptocurrencies. As a result, Historical Volatility in the 6W BTCUSD chart has fallen to the second lowest ever reading. The last time this signal appeared, it awakened a behemoth rally. Prices soared in the short- and long-term. Keep reading to find out by how much. Low Volatility Suggests Behemoth Bitcoin Rally Could Be Coming NewsBTC has extensively covered the lack of volatility in Bitcoin using the Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands are part of a trend-following, band-breakout trading system that also can be used to measure volatility. But it’s not the only way to read it. Other volatility metrics include Implied Volatility, which uses the VIX to potentially predict future volatility, and Historical Volatility (HV). HV, just like it sounds, looks at volatility from the past. Related Reading: Why Low Volatility Bitcoin Could Last A Lot Longer The 6W Historical Volatility in BTCUSD is now at its second-lowest level ever. This is important because when an extended sideways phase ends, it ends by awakening a monster rally or decline. Historical Volatility is the second lowest ever | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Is Another Monster 4,000% Move In BTCUSD Possible Considering it’s only happened once before, the sample size is too small to come to a conclusion about which direction prices might head. However, the last time the 6W Historical Volatility got this low, and then broke out, the direction was up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next? Not only was it up, but it was an immediate more than 60% move higher in a single 6W candle. The move that began around March 2016 also kicked off a more than year-long bull market that ended with more than 4,000% ROI following the period of inactivity. The power of volatility once it returns to an asset long trending sideways cannot be understated. Another 4,000% is unlikely after seven years of adoption, but something massive is waking up regardless of the final numbers and direction. Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

15801432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546290,1691535657,"Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $180,000 Next Cycle If This Happens","Since the Bitcoin bull market began, one discussion that has never left the crypto community is when the next bull rally will commence and if it would follow the previously established trend around the halving events. To this end, a crypto analyst, Lark Davis, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his forecast around the next bull market. What Could Happen If History Repeats Itself All of the previous Bitcoin bull markets have always begun after the BTC halving event which cuts block rewards in half. However, this time around, there have been dissenting views regarding the digital asset’s tendency to follow this established trend once more due to deviations in various Bitcoin metrics. But Davis has shared a possible scenario for BTC if the bull market begins after the rally once more. Related Reading: Litecoin Hashrate Taps New All-Time High, Will LTC Price Follow Suit? In the chart shared by the analyst on X, he points out a long period of accumulation. This is when investors fill up their bags with BTC as it is possibly the lowest that the price of the digital asset would get during the bear market. BTC could reach $180,000 if the bull market follows halving cycle | Source: Lark Davis on X Next comes the Bitcoin halving event, at which time, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market start to pick up steam. This is when the bull market starts to take shape, leading to the next part of the trend which is when prices explode. In Davis’ post, he shows that the price of the digital asset could rise as high as $180,000 during this time. If the cryptocurrency does touch this price mark, it would mean that the price of BTC would almost triple from its current all-time high of $69,000. How This Can Happen For Bitcoin As clarified by the analyst in his X post, for any of this to happen, it would mean that BTC would have to completely follow the trends of the previous bull cycles. This would mean the bottom could likely be reached in early 2024, but it would also be the same year for the start of the bull run. Even if Bitcoin does follow this trend though, it would not always be ‘up-only’ for the market. It would mean that the bull market would top out sometime in 2025 and then there would likely be a market crash that sends BTC spiraling in the following year. As Davis points out, the digital asset could tumble 70% to reach $50,000 again. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Break Above $2,000 If This Happens However, even with the obvious bear market that would follow this trend, it is still an incredibly bullish scenario for Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. The bull market would last around one year, following historical data, providing ample opportunity for investors to make the most of the market. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, and if history is anything to go by, this is around when the bull market should be expected to start back up.

Crypto Community Adverse to Paxos Wallet Freeze Feature The PYUSD stablecoin issued by Paxos has a condition that is not too welcomed by the crypto community, which has dulled the initial excitement for the launch of the PayPal stablecoin. According to reports, Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure firm that issued the PYUSD has several centralization issues which give them a certain amount of control over user’s wallets. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Information published on its GitHub account reveals that Paxos can freeze or suspend users’ wallets and transfer functions on PYUSD authorization in the case of a security threat. The Paxos freeze feature is quite similar to Tether’s USDT which is able to freeze/blacklist users’ addresses involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, Paxos can withhold users’ funds and assets, as well as wipe the account clean if the law requires it. The reactions from the crypto community were instant and not too favorable as investors’ anxiety spiked at the thought of possibly losing their substantial digital assets or having their wallets on lock. Centralization has always been a touchy subject for the crypto community as decentralized networks are often believed to be more secure and distribute control among network participants rather than a central body. Paxos has stated that freezing accounts is unlikely to happen often, and the company itself would not execute the process.

The crypto community has largely welcomed this new development, as investors and traders are gearing up to take advantage of the token and its conveniences. Analysts also predict that popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum prices will also benefit significantly from the new stablecoin. The PYUSD is an ERC-20 token developed on the Ethereum blockchain backed by the US dollar.

From Bitcoin's resurgence on the back of weak Chinese economic data to the buzz around PayPal's stablecoin, here's a comprehensive roundup of the day's most significant crypto news.  Bitcoin Climbs to the $30K Mark As Global Yields Decline  Bitcoin's price saw a 3% uptick, climbing to just shy of $30,000 in response to a plunge in global long-dated government bond yields. This fall in yields was triggered by China's far weaker than anticipated trade numbers for July. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield tumbled below the 4% mark. These macroeconomic shifts have seemingly buoyed the crypto market, with other notable cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), and Chainlink (LINK) registering gains of over 4% at the time of writing.

The co-founder and co-chairman of private equity giant Carlyle Group, Rubenstein admitted his regrets for not having bought bitcoin when it was at $100. He said that people who once mocked the crypto and the sector in general might be forced to take another look given recent interest from traditional finance giants like BlackRock.  “What’s happened is people made fun of bitcoin and other crypto currencies but now the establishment, Larry Fink at BlackRock, is now saying they’re going to have an ETF if approved by the government in bitcoin so you’re saying wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in bitcoin, maybe bitcoin is going to be around for a while,” he said.  Rubenstein has previously disclosed that he is personally invested in companies that facilitate crypto trading, although not owning any cryptocurrencies directly.  Speaking about recent enforcement actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chair Gary Gensler, Rubenstein said that Ripple’s win in a recent case proves that the agency has not yet convinced the courts that cryptocurrencies are “bad.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/08/private-equity-giant-david-rubenstein-makes-the-case-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/799a18375309aad4835c7ade7113a43c75a32ce1-1024x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move announced Tuesday doesn’t change any rules for crypto banking. Rather, it just defines how the central bank intends to handle its oversight, putting dealings with the crypto sector under the new “novel activities supervision program” in which the Fed’s specialized experts in digital assets will work alongside the regulator’s regular supervisors.  The Fed also issued a fuller explanation for how the banks it supervises need to get preapprovals for engaging with stablecoins. An institution that’s “issuing, holding or transacting in dollar tokens to facilitate payments” needs to prove to the supervisors beforehand that it can do all of that in a “safe and sound manner” and needs the Fed to formally sign off.  That permission could be difficult to win, because each bank will need to demonstrate it can ""identify, measure, monitor and control the risks of its activities,"" and the Fed will be looking for any vulnerabilities to money laundering, customer runs and hackers, among other things.  The central bank’s announcements were meant to reinforce the crypto guidance it issued in January, and the Tuesday statements come on the heels of PayPal’s (PYPL) news that it will roll out its own stablecoin.  U.S. banking regulators have been clear during this administration that they intend to maintain a substantial barrier between the banking system and the crypto sector, though they also insist that lenders are welcome to keep experimenting under their close supervision. The new novel-activities program will inform each bank when its digital-assets exposure is going to come under review, the Fed said.  ""The level and intensity of supervision will vary based on the level of engagement in novel activities by each supervised banking organization,"" according to the regulator.  Meanwhile, the central bank said its new program ""will help ensure that regulation and supervision allow for innovations that improve access to and the delivery of financial services.""

According to data from TokenUnlocks, Sandbox will release 332.55 million SAND tokens into circulation on August 14, representing 16.16% of the token’s maximum supply. New SAND Tokens In 2023 To Rise Over 700 Million With the upcoming SAND release, the total number of new SAND tokens in 2023 is expected to rise to 705.3 million. This latest unlock will add to the 372.75 million SAND released earlier during the last token unlock in February. Based on more data from Token Unlocks, the newly released tokens will be allocated to various parties, including the Sandbox’s development team, project advisors, strategic and seed investors, and the project’s reserve. SAND functions as the utility token of the Sandbox metaverse, serving as the platform’s payment medium and governance token. According to its design, SAND is expected to undergo a token unlock every six months until 2025. Currently, the number of circulating SAND tokens is 2.05 billion, representing 68.6% of SAND’s total supply. With the projected release on August 14, these figures are expected to jump to 2.39 billion and 84.76%, respectively. SAND trading at $0.40 on the daily chart | Source: SANDUSD chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: Massive Token Unlock: Ripple Releases One Billion XRP From Escrow Potential Impact of Token Release on SAND’s Price Token unlocks are common events in the crypto space, usually accompanied by fears of a bearish market. This is because the sudden introduction of massive tokens to the market creates a higher supply-to-demand ratio, which drives down asset prices. Looking at on-chain data, this is one likely effect of SAND’s upcoming token unlock on its market price due to declining network growth on the Sandbox platform. Based on data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of new addresses on Sandbox is down by 66.87% in the last month, falling from a peak of 649 in July to its current value of 215. The continuance of this trend means Sandbox may lack the necessary traction to counter the upcoming inflationary pressure, which may ultimately lead to a fall in price. Source: IntoTheBlock Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Gains By 10% Ahead Of July Token Release Following SAND’s last token release on February 14, SAND’s price movement was fairly positive, opening at $0.68 to trade as high as $0.72 and close at $0.71. In the subsequent days, SAND would record more gains, reaching a market value of $0.88 on Feb 20. While token unlocks are widely expected to precipitate bearish pressure, their effects are still unpredictable. Investors are advised to watch out for major developments on Sandbox regarding network growth and whale movement. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap data shows that SAND is trading at $0.40 with a 0.62% gain on the last day. However, the token is down on the weekly chart losing about 2.98% of its value.

Ransomware crime rings rely almost exclusively on Bitcoin payments to extract vast sums from major institutions, including hospitals and providers of critical infrastructure. But, in a groundbreaking move, a federal court case in Chicago has turned the tables on cybercriminals by using inventive technology to digitally lock the criminals out of their blockchain accounts. The case was brought against Russian and North Korean hackers who are under sanctions by the United States Treasury Department. Mike Kanovitz, CEO of Jurat Blockchains, the firm behind the technology deployed in the case, remarked, “It is encouraging to witness this invention in action, fighting criminals who misuse blockchains and give cryptocurrency a bad name.” Kanovitz explained that “Jurat technology provides the base layer for legal enforcement on blockchains by working in conjunction with official courts. It can help government officials prevent crime and lets cryptocurrency users access courts if they have had their cryptocurrency stolen, been defrauded, or lost their private keys.” The court’s order applies to 16 individuals and international criminal organizations sanctioned under Executive Orders of the President of the United States. Among those targeted was Hydra Market, the focus of “a collaborative initiative joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations,” according to a U.S. Treasury Department press release. Another major target named in the lawsuit is the Lazarus Group, which engaged in “malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency” on behalf of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The state-sponsored hackers committed “the largest virtual currency heist to date, worth almost $620 million, from a blockchain project linked to the online game Axie Infinity.” Using the first-of-its-kind judicial injunction, the federal court has locked all accounts belonging to the 16 criminals that contain the cryptocurrency $JTC.

Saddle’s founder Sunil Srivatsa on Tuesday proposed the group liquidate its treasury into Arbitrum (ARB) tokens and airdrop the proceeds to holders of Saddle’s SDL and veSDL tokens, with veSDL holders getting four times as big an allocation. It was not immediately clear how large Saddle’s treasury was.  The snap poll comes after the monumental hack of decentralized exchange (DEX) giant Curve last month, which ripped through Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and, according to Srivatsa’s blog post, reminded Saddle’s team of the ever-present threat of exploitable bugs.  Saddle Finance offers a similar feature set to Curve and previously faced allegations of cloning Curve's codebase. Srivatsa said the protocol’s developers need to step back from the project by September 30, 2023.  Saddle previously raised over $10 million from venture backers. The platform, which is used to exchange between stablecoins and other like-kind assets, currently has around $2 million worth of user deposits according to analytics on its website.  The snapshot for determining who is eligible for allocations has already happened, according to investors watching the situation.  Srivatsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The miner reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.13 on revenues of $81.8 million compared to FactSet analyst estimates for a loss of $0.06 on revenues of $83.4 million.  Shares of Marathon were roughly flat at $15.73 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Marathon shares are up almost 360% this year as the price of bitcoin has surged.  “After a strong start to the year, we accelerated our progress in the second quarter by significantly growing our hash rate and improving our efficiency,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, in a press release.  The company gained $23.4 million on the sale of bitcoin in the quarter as it sold 63% of the bitcoin produced in the quarter to fund operating costs. Marathon also benefited from lower impairment charges in the quarter of $8.4 million, down from $131.6 million in the year-ago quarter, as bitcoin prices rose in the quarter.  Marathon also filed an 8-K on Tuesday saying it needed to restate cash flow figures for the first quarter. The company said the restatement came from reclassifying proceeds from the sale of digital assets from operating activities to investing activities. Operating cash flow went from -$28.8 million to -$91.5 million, while investing cash flow went from -$72 million to -$9.4 million.  Marathon recently solidified its position as the world’s largest publicly traded bitcoin miner by self-mining hashrate, reporting 17.7 exahash per second (EH/s) of operational computing power on the bitcoin network in June.

The “halving” here refers to an event where the block rewards of Litecoin are permanently cut in half. Litecoin Long-Term Holders Sold During Price Surge Before The Halving According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the long-term holders had been well-prepared for the “sell the news” halving event. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) generally include all investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least six months ago. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Are At Important Retests, Will Bullish Trend Prevail? This group includes some of the most resolute investors in the Litecoin market, who don’t easily react to whatever is going in on in the wider sector, as they usually hold through FUD or profit-taking opportunities without participating in any significant selling. Because of how rare movements from these investors can be, the few times that they do sell can be the ones to watch out for, as they may spell trouble for the market. A way to gauge whether the LTHs are participating in selling or not is through the “holding time of transacted coins” metric, which tells us about the average amount of time that coins being transferred on the blockchain had been dormant prior to this movement. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the age of coins being sold on the network is high, which can naturally be a sign that the LTHs are active right now. On the other hand, low values usually indicate that the short-term holders (STHs) are the ones selling currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins over the past few months: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively low in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As you can see in the above graph, the Litecoin holding time of transacted coins spiked back in June, when the price of the cryptocurrency had been observing a sharp rally. During the largest of these spikes, the indicator’s value had exceeded 1 year, implying that some of the most experienced investors in the market had broken their silence. This rally had occurred as the market had started getting hyped about the halving, which was only a month and a half away at that point. This event takes place every four years, with the latest one having occurred just earlier this month. Unlike what some may have hoped for, the event didn’t prove to be bullish for LTC, as the aforementioned rally didn’t last for too long and the cryptocurrency only declined in the remaining leadup to the halving, until finally it actually sharply plunged on the day of the event itself. It would appear that the experienced LTHs had already predicted something like this may happen, so they had taken the wise decision of selling while the opportunity was there. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? In the post-halving selloff, the indicator’s value has remained low, implying that it’s only the short-term holders who have been panic selling after they saw that a bullish trend couldn’t return to Litecoin with the event.

Salame, a prominent Republican donor who also handled FTX's political donations, could enter a plea as soon as September to charges including campaign finance law violations, according to Bloomberg’s sources. It was not known whether he would cooperate with prosecutors and testify against FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Other top execs at FTX, including Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh, have already plead guilty to charges in the FTX case and will be part of the government’s case against Bankman-Fried.  The Wall Street Journal reported last month that federal prosecutors were investigating Salame over possible violations of campaign finance law related to his girlfriend's congressional campaign last year.

42419796,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrDx,1691522143,Desperately Seeking Crypto’s Killer App,"Since the start of the year, I’ve been pre-occupied by a question I can’t seem to get decent answers to. I’ve asked it at conferences, on live panels, on podcasts, and to smart friends over zoom. It’s pretty simple: “If you couldn’t get rich off of it, what currently existing products in crypto would significant numbers of people still use?”  Let me break that down. I use Uber, Google Docs, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Netflix, PayPal, Calendly, Slack and iTunes at least once a week, if not every day. And in the case of Gmail and Twitter (I refuse to call it X), I use them pretty much every hour. I use all of these products without any expectation of becoming a millionaire.  Shiv Malik is the founder of Pool Data and a former investigative journalist.  Some of these apps I love. Others not so much: iTunes sucks. I give most of them money. Or I even, as with Uber, Deliveroo and Paypal, transact with third party services through them. But again, even though I use them, I don’t expect to get rich. The utility is enough.  So what about Web3?  I’ve been in the space since late-2016. Fascinated by the socio-economic possibilities of smart contracts, I started by purchasing some ETH for $9 on Coinbase. I then rapidly degened into 10x margin trading XRP on Poloniex. I’ve worked for two Web3 companies and founded my own, been to a dozen crypto conferences on four continents, and I once had to hide Gavin Wood in my hotel bathtub. I’m no crypto hater.  I love Uniswap and my Metamask browser extension. I marvel at Aave’s technical accomplishments. I’ve used Opensea and operate a Gnosis Safe multisig. But I use all of these products to move and trade tokens. And I trade tokens so I can increase my wealth. (Though that often doesn’t workout for me). So what, in Web3, would I and say, another five million daily active users, just use? For the utility. And not to make a fast buck.  I’ve been given lots of answers. Most all of them invariably end up pointing me towards some future use case – distributed compute! Decentralized Uber/Twitter/Airbnb! – or some product or use case that in no way has the qualified number of daily users.  Some that do qualify are ENS, though one could harshly argue that when they sit atop speculation, ENS names like CryptoPunks are simply status symbols for traders. There is also IPFS, though it’s hard to discern who outside of Web3 is really using it.  The one hands down, surefire winner is international payments with stablecoins. In many countries across the world, it’s still incredibly difficult for ordinary people to send and receive money without being massively gouged. Crypto solves this. That PayPal is now moving into issuing a USD stablecoin, with the news being released as I type, proves the point. But if that’s it, then that’s a pretty poor showing.  A $1.2 trillion market cap, billions upon billions in funding, tens of thousands of developers and at least five years of buidling, is everything, aside from stablecoins, just powering speculation? In the wake of the horror show that was 2022, there has rightly been lots of debate about speculation actually messing up classic product market fit signals, with plenty of thoughtful pro-crypto people musing that perhaps crypto’s PMF was speculation. After all this time and money, where is crypto’s killer app for normies? It’s embarrassing we even have to ask.  Crypto sans grift  Here’s another question. If you just stripped out all speculation, what utility could crypto offer the world? Aside from “get rich quick,” what can Web3 technology deliver that is 10x better than the experience in Web2? I’m sure, (and I sure hope) there are more examples, but here are at least three areas where crypto offers something entirely set apart from the current status quo: self-custody, peer-to-peer connections at scale and new business models.  Self-custody  Web3 is impeccable at delivering self-custody of assets. Private keys, especially when attached to the utility of smart contracts and trustless verifiability of blockchains, enable users to ring fence code and call those lines of code “mine.” To abstract ownership principles from Roman property law, private keys enable the use, profit, and transfer the rights of digital assets. Paraphrasing Bankless host David Hoffman, private keys are the foundation of responsibility in the digital world.  So, can those assets be more than just money, and more than just hashes linked to a jpeg? What about turning other assets, like social graphs and physical property, into self-owned and controlled assets via private keys linked to public blockchain wallets? Given that it is already largely digitally-native, personal data still looks like the next best self-custody opportunity. Who wouldn’t want to custody their personal data, to stop others from using it, or to directly benefit from it themselves?  It’s embarrassing we even have to ask  The even better news is that the current Web2 system of personal data exchange is completely falling apart. Starting in January 2024, cookies are being deprecated in Chrome. Privacy laws abound, creating ever more regulatory complexity for those holding other people’s personal information.  Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid project, and others, are currently working on just this – a personal and interoperable data vault. The problem with data wallets is they face massive issues with adoption, best summed up by the economist Hyman Minsky, when he said about money, “Everyone can create money. The problem is to get it accepted.”  Giving people the tools to self-custody their personal data is actually the easy part. Creating common protocols and infrastructure for exchanging similar fields of personal data to make that self-custody worthwhile is what is hard. Nevertheless, self-custody that can enable the use, trade, or rights transfer of an asset, is 10x better than Web2.  P2P connections  When people hear “peer-to-peer connections,” thoughts inexorably drift towards messaging. No wonder when so many of Web2’s killer apps, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, have been messaging products. None of these apps are pure peer-to-peer: their messages are intermediated. But, for the end user, what’s the genuine problem Web3 could solve if the messages themselves can be end-to-end encrypted? What, for normies, is Web3’s 10x advantage here?  Censorship resistance is often Web3’s rallying cry. And yet un-censorable social networks bring their own end-user issues. Unending streams of bot fuelled porn and race-hate anyone?  But P2P connection doesn’t have to be just messaging. One of my favorite actions in Web3 is connecting my wallet to Uniswap or Aave. Each time I do it, it still feels magical, empowering, and best of all, damn convenient. On the other hand, my most frustrating experiences in Web2 are when I try to login, register, identify myself, or pay for things. I simply don’t understand why 30 years into the web, I’m still filling out tediously long forms, which often ask for the same information, again and again. It’s soul-destroying.  SSO via 0Auth is the most dominant Web2 system to solve for this. It is used by hundreds of millions of people each day. And yet, major publishers, most especially in news media, detest Google/FB/Apple SSO. They get almost nothing in return – an email they can’t use for marketing purposes and a user name. That’s it. Meanwhile, they’re giving over even more control to the very people eating their lunch. But brands really care about disintermediated P2P connection. They call it loyalty. So Web3 has powerful allies.  Why shouldn’t Sign in With Ethereum be the protocol we use to replace OAuth and re-create the new future of SSO? Imagine brokering peer-to-peer connections that enable instant registration, account creation, customer insights, imparting of home delivery information, user preferences, and yes, even money transfer, all easily controlled by the user.  We just have to want to kill the grift first  Again, adoption is the hard part. Big commerce brands and publishers aren’t just going to install SSO outside of the well-regulated OAuth stack. But here again is a 10x experience that Web3 can offer the world and doesn’t involve speculation. Every site on the planet could be as personalized and as convenient to checkout from as Amazon. And, utilizing zero knowledge proofs, it could be far more privacy-preserving.  New socio-economic models  Perhaps the most irreconcilable dividing line between Bitcoin and Ethereum is not the tech, but that they tend to attract supporters with very different outlooks on the world.  Bitcoin draws the more hyper-libertarian crowd who believe emancipation from corporations and government via self-sovereignty is the solution to a better future. Ethereans, in my six years on the conference circuit, tend to be more communitarian minded; people who ultimately think disintermediated cooperation between humans is the most rewarding strategy.  Why so? Most likely because, given that Ethereum smart contracts can be constructed in infinite ways, then the socio-economic possibilities of how digital wealth and revenues are created and distributed can also be infinite. Bitcoin resolutely doesn’t solve for this.  Read more: Joe Cortez - How to Pick the Right Play-to-Earn Game for You  In theory, then, Ethereum should be a creative wonderland for new socio-economic models. There’s no denying that since 2017, there have been a profusion of ideas. Some of this has desperately uncreative. “Let’s make X [Uber, Airbnb, Google, Facebook, Twitter …] but without X taking all the profits!” Other models have focussed on more efficient forms of the “X to earn” template e.g. play/ share/ move-to-earn. (With the advent of Worldcoin, you could argue we’re at the “eyeballs cans to earn” stage of the cycle.)  It’s worth recalling that before they got buried in grift, ICOs and utility tokens were about creating new business models. They solved an age-old problem of how to fund open source software. It’s why Ethereum can not be bought out by a Microsoft or IBM. It’s also how it funds the continuous improvement of the protocol. That’s a stunning success.  We just have to want to kill the grift first  Even more novel was the nascent events site Kickback, which asked event attendees to stake a small amount of a given token to assure their attendance. If they didn’t show up, the remainder would be distributed to those who did. That’s something that could only be built in Web3.  But those creative experiments seem to have fallen away. Many novel patterns such as staking and airdrops have been co-opted to fuel adoption of coins themselves, rather than create new models to empower people, rooting rewards in user groups, not external parties who leverage their capital to capture those gains. Hopefully, we’ll soon see much more being utilized with soulbound tokens, gated access via NFTs and other forms of loyalty.  So can crypto build killer apps for normies? Absolutely. The technology can, indeed, create a better world in all sorts of ways.

42419794,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrMD,1691521982,Crypto Market Leaders and Laggards: The Biggest Movers of the Week,"The CoinDesk Market Index of 183 assets – a broad-based indicator of crypto market sentiment – is down 1.4% for the last week. But that is just a blip in its 60.1% growth year to date.  Let’s take a look at the bigger picture of the top-10 and bottom-10 assets based on their performance month on month.  Leaders  Culture and entertainment assets and currencies predominated the leaders. Small gaming and metaverse protocols including Yield Guild Games (YGG), a global community that bands gamers together to play, and HighStreet (HIGH), a decentralized metaverse and massively multiplayer online role-playing game, as well as LivePeer (LPT), a decentralized video streaming network protocol, made a huge impression in the top 10 leaderboard. But their impact overall was not so large. As these are all small players, the culture and entertainment sector, which is market-cap weighted, was pretty flat month on month (down 0.4%).  The spectacular up and down of Yield Guild Games is a story still in progress. On Aug. 3, the guild announced the launch of its fourth audience-building campaign that features numerous quests and rewards. The token rose a dizzying 600% over the next four days, but on Aug. 7 began to plummet as rumors that the guild’s initial backers were using the opportunity to take their money out. “It appears to be a pump and dump,” said CoinDesk Indices Data Analyst Reilly Decker.  Stellar (XLM), XRP (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were the biggest currency leaders over the last week.  Stellar is building on a research report it released in July that supports the narrative that XLM is one of the most well-connected and integrated USDC cash off-ramps.  XRP is still benefiting from a U.S. judge’s ruling last month that the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts (and therefore are not covered by securities laws).  Just this month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) announced it would tie digital identity services across all of its platforms, another sign of its effort to distance itself from its meme coin origins and become a serious DeFi protocol. Recently, a shiba inu investor – believed to be a founder or founders holding 10% of the token’s total supply – moved some $30 million worth of their stash to eight wallets, on-chain analytics tool Lookonchain said in a tweet.  Laggards  Going the other way, the two biggest laggards month on month were also in culture and entertainment and in currencies. Augur (REP), a decentralized prediction market, otherwise known as betting, and Pepe (PEPE) is a meme coin. Both of these tokens seem to have lost investors’ interest lately.  Another tumbler was Curve Finance (CRV), which suffered a $70 million hack in July, at one point raising doubts as to its viability as a going concern.

15794611,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546237,1691521207,HBAR Token Scores Impressive Gains As Major Cryptos Nosedive,"Hedera Hashgraph’s native cryptocurrency, HBAR, is shining following the slight boost in the crypto market today, August 8. Hedera briefly broke through the one-month-long $0.5 resistance, climbing above $0.6, while top coins like Bitcoin bleed with losses. Even though the overall crypto market cap gain affected many assets positively, HBAR owes most of its gains to the latest ecosystem developments and partnerships. HBAR Price Performance Amid Impressive Ecosystem Updates Despite a drop in trading volume, HBAR has soared over 6%, attaining a peak of $0.06032 on Tuesday morning. This sharp spike represents a nearly 10% increase from the day low of $0.05483. But the token has now receded from its peak value and currently trades at $0.05951. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Moreover, the HBAR price has soared over 16% in a week, bucking the bearish trend that snatched all of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s past week’s gains. The token’s value is now over 22% higher than the price recorded 30 days ago. However, HBAR’s trading volume is south of its price trajectory. The over 16% decline in 24-hour trading volume raises questions about whether the bulls had reached saturation and capitulated to the bears even before the rally grew strong. Strategic Partnerships Drive HBAR’s Rally Hedera’s network advancements and strategic partnerships have helped to boost HBAR’s current market position. In August, the Hedera network recorded notable deals with leading banking and financial institutions and automobile companies. On August 2, Korean automobile firms Hyundai and KIA announced the launch of a new blockchain and AI-powered Supplier co2 Emission Monitoring System (SCEMS) on the Hedera network. This integration allows Hedera to record the carbon emission data from suppliers while AI will predict future emissions following the data provided. Similarly, on August 4, Hedera announced a partnership with FreshSupplyCoAu in a groundbreaking move that could reshape the digital finance landscape. The strategic partnership allows users to connect with conventional banking and the Mastercard network for a seamless, safe, and wider range of cross-border payments. Through Mastercard’s payment gateway, Hedera will connect traditional banking infrastructure with decentralized finance technology, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. These strategic partnerships mark significant milestones for the network. They could boost HBAR’s usability and trading activity as more investors adopt the token. This move could amplify HBAR’s reach and market presence, potentially increasing network activities and the token’s price. HBAR Market Outlook, Will The Bulls Sustain? Hedera’s dwindling 24-hour trading volume, however, raises questions about the longevity of the ongoing rally since a trading volume decline often signifies bearish market activities. The HBAR’s price chart reveals that technical indicators suggest a bearish trend reversal for HBAR as the token trades above the 50-day moving average, confirming the bullish momentum on its price today. But the Relative Strength Index has receded from 62 to 57, demonstrating weakening momentum as buyers exit the market.

42419788,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrH3,1691519971,Lessons of a $37M Attack: How a Ukrainian Payment Processor Was Hacked,"Exploiting DeFi protocols has long become crypto’s most popular type of crime, while traditional exchange hacks have become far less frequent. But cybercriminals haven’t lost all interest in the good old digital robbery.  The recent hack of a crypto payment processor CoinsPaid shows that the most industrious cybercriminal groups in the world are still willing to spend formidable resources on breaking into centralized entities.  CoinsPaid, a Ukrainian firm registered in Estonia, reported being hacked on July 22, with estimated crypto losses of $37.3 million. According to the CEO Max Krupyshev, the company ended up refunding clients from its own funds. Those customers likely include online casinos, which according to a Blockchain Intelligence Group, are widespread users of CoinsPaid.  In a detailed explanation of the incident published Monday, CoinsPaid said that, judging by the thieves’ on-chain behavior, they were very likely the North Korean Lazarus Group or affiliated with it. To siphon money out of CoinsPaid, the attackers used wallets that included the one spotted in another recent attack attributed to Lazarus – the Atomic Wallet hack in June, Blockchain Intelligence Group wrote.  The attackers had been targeting CoinsPaid for months before finally pulling off the theft, CoinsPaid said. Fishing and social engineering attempts started in March, including a request from someone posing as a fellow Ukrainian crypto processing startup, who was asking CoinsPaid developers about the firm’s technical infrastructure, the blog post said. The attackers also tried to bribe CoinsPaid staff and engaged in distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks aimed at the company’s servers.  Fishing for the gullible employees  Then, in July, several employees received lucrative job offerings from LinkedIn accounts posing as recruiters from other crypto companies, including the exchange Crypto.com. “For instance, some of our team members received job offers with compensation ranging from 16,000-24,000 USD a month,” the blog post said.  After making an initial contact, the fake recruiters asked the employees to install JumpCloud, a platform for user authentication that was reportedly also hacked by Lazarus in July, or other software, presumably to perform a test task. Several employees took the bait and installed malicious software, after which the attackers got access to CoinsPaid’s infrastructure.  During late-European hours on a Friday night on July 21, the attackers got access to CoinsPaid’s blockchain node and requested a large withdrawal of Tron-based USDT, bitcoin and several ERC20 tokens running on the Ethereum blockchain, Pavel Kashuba, CoinsPaid chief financial officer, told CoinDesk in an interview. The active phase of the attack took about four hours 23 minutes, he said.  While the thieves got free access to the company’s servers, they did not compromise the private keys for CoinsPaid’s wallets, CEO Max Krupyshev told CoinDesk: “As soon as we switched off our servers, the transfers stopped.” He added that, when the firm spun off new wallets with the same keys, those weren’t drained, confirming that the keys were safe.  Can’t block this  The firm lost money anyway. Most of the stolen funds, in a form of USDT on the Tron blockchain, were swapped for the USDT on Avalanche via cross-chain bridges and then sent to a decentralized exchange SwftSwap, Krupyshev said. Attackers also used decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SunSwap, as well as centralized exchanges Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, Bybit, Bitget and MEXC, according to the post-mortem blog post.  Bitcoin was laundered via the Sindbad mixer, which, according to the blockchain intel firm Elliptic, is the most popular mixer for North Korean hackers.  CoinsPaid said, although they notified the centralized exchanges as soon as they saw funds moving there, labeling crime-related addresses and taking action by exchanges is a process too slow to keep up with the hackers, who were cashing out in a matter of minutes.  Kashuba expressed frustration that law enforcement agencies go slowly in convincing exchanges to freeze criminal accounts. “You need to block the money but that money is already gone,” he said.  The bottom line is exchanges need to pay attention to digital hygiene and adequate training for the staff, Kashuba said. And that goes for all kinds of cybercrime.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/08/lessons-of-a-37m-attack-how-a-ukrainian-payment-processor-was-hacked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bffe083ad6627bc87d4dde870ec8ad15d0236328-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419789,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrG1,1691518166,Bavaria's Data Regulator Had Not Concluded Assessment of Worldcoin When the Project Launched,"Bavaria's data watchdog had not finished its privacy and security assessment of Worldcoin when the project launched, the head of the agency said.  Michael Will, president of Bavaria's Data Protection Authority, the lead agency supervising the OpenAI-tied project in Europe, told CoinDesk on Monday that it was still reviewing the project when it went live on July 24, though he noted thatthe company is not legally obliged to notify the authorities and get their approval prior to the launch. Bavaria is a German state where Worldcoin has set up an entity to manage the data for its European users, so the local authority is leading the investigation.  At the same time, Worldcoin's financial aspect is also under investigation. Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, known as BaFin, is monitoring the project. It is unclear at the moment whether it needs a permit from BaFin, as other crypto firms do, a spokeswoman from the authority told local newspaper Tagesspiegel.  Worldcoin is co-founded by Sam Altman, the entrepreneur behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and aims to promulgate a new way to verify that a user is human and unique on the internet using iris scans, artificial intelligence and zero-knowledge proofs. Verified users can receive grants of the Worldcoin token. Developers can build applications on top of this identification protocol, including a wallet where the Worldcoin token is distributed.  ""[Worldcoin] complies with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),"" the company said in a statement to CoinDesk. ""In the European Union, Tools for Humanity [the company behind Worldcoin] is under the supervision of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutz). The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices.""  Even before the project's full launch, it was the subject of controversy. Criticism has centered around potential privacy issues, the reported manipulationof people in developing countries, as well as the fact that a private company is building global identification infrastructure, which is normally the work of government entities.  Communications  The Bavarian DPA's journey with Worldcoin started last November, when its French counterpart asked it for information on whether the project had a Bavarian entity that was acting as the data controller, an entity that decides how and why data is processed under GDPR and is ultimately liable for the data processing. At the time, Worldcoin was doing testing in France, said Will.  It took a few months, but in March, Worldcoin responded to the information request from the DPA and also submitted a privacy impact assessment, which is required under GDPR for companies processing sensitive data such as biometric information. Based on that information, the Bavarian DPA concluded that the local Worldcoin entity fulfilled the requirements of GDPR, but had some additional questions, said Will.  More recently, about two weeks ago, a journalist from German newspaper Handelsblatt contacted the DPA to confirm whether they were in contact with Worldcoin co-founders, one of whom resided in Bavaria, said Will. The journalist received this information from one of the co-founders, he said. Worldcoin's co-founders include Altman and Alex Blania, who is reportedly of German origin.  This was a ""strange"" event and perhaps a ""miscommunication,"" said Will, as the authority was in his reading not in regular contact with Worldcoin. Perhaps ""there was a little bit of confusion, maybe not understanding properly what it means when you have notified"" the authorities, said the Bavarian DPA President.  The company is now in contact and cooperating with the regulators, said Will.  Regulatory probes  The Bavarian DPA, along with French and U.K. regulators, have said they are investigating the project. Authorities in Kenya have suspended Worldcoin operations in the country – citing privacy, security and financial regulation concerns – and reportedly raided its warehouses and seized hardware. Prior to the reported raid, Worldcoin said it suspended operations due to ""crowd control"" issues.  At the moment, the European data authorities are investigating Worldcoin's data flows, the pseudonymization of personal data, such as the biometric iris scans, as well as the transparency and fairness around users' consent, said Will. Worldcoin is expected to respond to the authorities' latest information request by September, at which point the investigation might delve deeper into its specific technology.  On data flows, Will explained that ""everyone talks about iris scans,"" but in Worldcoin's documentation there is a clear distinction between the iris scan and the identification code created based on the biometric data that is stored the database. So the authority will look into whether the iris scan data is indeed deleted, as Worldcoin claims, he said.  Worldcoin's technologies are not altogether new, but the way they combine them is, said Will. The complexity of the project is a challenge, he is confident in the regulators' ability to conduct an assessment.

The Managing Partner of ‘The Deaton Law Firm’ says he is willing to bet big on the exchange emerging victorious on appeal. Founded Belief Or Mere Speculation? John Deaton’s willingness to bet on an uncertain court judgment follows a recent thread penned by digital asset enthusiast and Australian-based lawyer Bill Morgan. According to the thread, Judge Analisa Torres did not err in her summary judgment decision. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF Morgan was of the opinion that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified sales of XRP by Ripple into three unique classes; institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other XRP distributions. Following the classification, Judge Torres evaluated each class by applying the popular Howey test. After evaluation, the Judge discovered major differences in each class. For instance, the Judge discovered that every institutional investor signed agreements with Ripple and expected to earn profits from the firm’s activities. While institutional investors entered contracts with Ripple, programmatic sales on exchanges did not require the signing of contracts, and purchasers, therefore, did not expect to make profits directly from Ripple’s efforts. Therefore, according to Morgan, Judge Torres ruled that the sale of XRP to institutional investors amounted to a sale of securities, while that of programmatic sales on virtual exchanges was not. XRP price still sitting at $0.62 as community awaits SEC appeal | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Deaton Ready To Go All In For Ripple Reacting to the thread, John Deaton commended Bill Morgan and noted that Judge Torres did not differentiate between Ripple’s XRP sales merely out of “thin air.” He stated that the Judge considered each sale the SEC alleges as securities “and applied the Howey test.” Therefore, given his confidence in the decision, he was willing to wager “significant funds that she doesn’t get reversed on appeal.” Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill While Deaton may have cause to believe in a favorable appeal outcome, recent developments may instigate some doubts in his prediction. Recently, US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversees the SEC’s lawsuit against Terraform Labs, rejected the approach used in Judge Torres’s ruling. This creates a certain unpredictability in the outcome of the upcoming SEC appeal. In the interim, SEC’s Chair, Gary Gensler, has suggested that an appeal against the decision in the Ripple lawsuit is under strong consideration. While Gensler’s comment does not expressly guarantee an appeal, however; it indicates that the US SEC has not conceded a partial defeat in the suit.

42419793,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrK9,1691516732,PayPal’s New Stablecoin and the ‘2 Wolves’ Inside Crypto,"Here’s some confirmation that crypto isn’t entirely toxic: In the hours after internet payments pioneer PayPal announced a stablecoin on Ethereum, the company’s stock rallied 2%. That may seem a tiny rally for anyone used to triple-digit gains on s**tcoins, but is respectable in the world of late-stage, slow-growth tech companies that have just about reached peak market saturation (PayPal reports having more than 400 million active users, and accounts for ~70% of eBay transactions).  Of course, as ever in the world of crypto, it’s not all sunshine and roses: After the surprise PYUSD stablecoin announcement, a bevy of imposter tokens like “pepeyieldunibotsatoshidoge” (aka PYUSD) have launched on Ethereum, various layer 2s and BNB Smart Chain looking to capitalize on post-announcement ignorance and buzz. The largest of these saw nearly $3 million in trading volume in mere hours, and almost assuredly more than a few will turn out to be rug pulls.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But this isn’t new for crypto, an industry racked by competing visions, contradictory strategies and occasional moral scruples. As the meme goes: inside crypto are two wolves. There’s money crypto and tech crypto. Regulation wanters and law-avoiders. The build-and-break-things contingent and those who go slow and steady.  It’s enough headbutting and disagreement to wonder how exactly crypto made it this far – that one of the most used payments companies is tapping the Ethereum mainnet, high fees be damned, for its next rung of expansion.  And so PayPal’s stablecoin is no different: PYUSD, which to begin with is U.S.-only, will eventually be a near-universally accessible payments option that is subject to just as much surveillance and “censorship” as PayPal or its subsidiary Venmo today. It’s crypto, sans crypto – or fintech with the benefit of blockchain. It’s the two wolves in conflict.  It should be no surprise which wolf is dominant in PayPal, the side that wants to work from within the system, rather than outside. The publicly-traded company, which launched the careers of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and the rest of the “PayPal Mafia,” learned pretty quickly that its initial vision for a stateless, global payments system would be beaten into submission by banks and governments. PayPal has been an active and consistent supporter of crypto since it expressed interest in Bitcoin in 2013, but it gave up on the cypherpunk ideal of a “new world currency.”  PayPal’s stablecoin may come with restrictions (no self-respecting extropian coder has ever signed a “terms of use” contract), but the company should be commended on its apparent commitment to transparency. As ex-PayPal comms director and typewriter aficionado James Wester says, “so long as freeze and seize is in the t’s and c’s” (terms and conditions) then there’s no real reason to complain that the PYUSD smart contract code has functions to confiscate and burn tokens.  I mean, freezing tokens is standard practice among the major, corporate-backed stablecoins including USDC and USDT – as is the commitment from Paxos, the actual issuer of PayPal USD, to publish a monthly “reserve report” starting in September. Does all this also cut against the idea that crypto should break free from third-party financial companies that control who people can transact with online, who can access an account and collect data about clients’ transaction history. Indubitably, my good man, welcome to the era of Censored Crypto; it started 10 years ago and is only picking up.  (To be fair to Tether, it did say it wouldn’t always abide by the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions program.)  But when big news like this comes along from big brands outside the world of crypto, all of the industry’s political commitments seem to matter less. A “Bankless” podcast co-host was saying this the biggest deal since PayPal announced in 2020 it would allow users to transact in crypto, largely because PayPal is like training wheels for the heavier stuff like decentralized finance (DeFi). In fact, as hardly noted anywhere, it’s not PayPal’s entire 435 million strong customer base that has access to the stablecoin, but only the U.S. residents who have already purchased crypto on PayPal.  That restriction will likely lift in time, and PayPal may ultimately onboard more people into crypto than Coinbase (108 million at last count). And even if only a fraction of those customers ever interact with Web3 beyond PayPal this doesn’t have to cheapen crypto’s purity (which frankly has already been tainted). It’s not like the existence of PYUSD means bitcoin or ether or dai will disappear. And as Austin Campbell, who formerly managed the BUSD stablecoin reserves at Paxos, wrote: “A player like PayPal entering the field is material, for credibility, for access, for public education and to force everyone else to start grappling with the reality of blockchains and the types of commercial applications they enable.”  See also: Is PayPal Going to Fine You for Your Opinions? | Opinion  But it is interesting to imagine exactly what Web3 would look like if a company like PayPal was a major crypto services provider, or even what the company’s own vision for Web3 in five years will be. There is little doubt that PayPal will have to abide by U.S. sanctions, develop lengthy blacklists and use automated software to (sometimes erroneously) freeze accounts; that it will likely have underpaid comms people doing its crypto customer service. More people will be in crypto, but like the internet after the “Eternal September” that brought a critical mass of people online (and necessitated the need for digital-first payments options like PayPal), crypto may become unrecognizable to today’s users.  Saying whether that is good or bad is like picking a preference in a wolf fight, a futile attempt to apply human morals to nature.

As investors continue to take profit, a total of $107 million in outflows was recorded in the previous week. Crypto investment products listed in the report are from various exchange-traded product (ETP) providers, including 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, Bitwise, and Proshares. However, it was found that a significant portion of the outflows came from Purpose Investments and ETC Issuance. From a regional standpoint, CoinShares discovered that the outflows were mostly from Germany and Canada, which recorded $70.8 million and $28.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, only Australia and the United States saw inflows, with $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Bitcoin Funds Record $111 Million In Weekly Outflows According to CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, Bitcoin (BTC) was primarily responsible for the significant outflows registered by digital asset investment products in week 32 of 2023. The premier cryptocurrency saw total outflows of $111 million, its largest since March. Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF It appears that investment in Bitcoin-related funds is slowing down, as institutional investors continue to sell for profit. This latest report represents the third consecutive week in which Bitcoin funds experienced outflows totaling $139 million. Prior to this recent negative run, more than $742 million went into crypto funds over a four-week period, with Bitcoin receiving a huge chunk of that figure. This positive momentum is believed to have been spurred by Ripple’s partial victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. CoinShares’ weekly report revealed that outflows into short Bitcoin have stopped for the first time in over three months. While this may suggest that institutional investors are no longer betting against the BTC price, the weekly outflows indicate that they are not banking on its rise either. For clarity, short products allow investors to profit when the price of a cryptocurrency – in this context, Bitcoin – falls. It typically involves borrowing Bitcoin, immediately selling it on the open market, and then buying it back at a lower price to repay the loan. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,164, with a 0.5% price increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency continues to lead the market with a market cap of roughly $567.3 billion. “Altcoins Sentiment Seems To Be Improving” While institutional investors continue to take profit from various Bitcoin-related funds, the signs seem positive for most altcoin investment products. According to CoinShares, altcoins (except Ethereum) recorded $3 million in outflows in week 31 of 2023. This trend appears to be gaining momentum, as Solana (SOL) particularly saw a substantial increase in buying pressure from institutions in Europe and the United States in week 32 of 2023. The cryptocurrency registered $9.5 million in weekly inflows, its highest figure since March 2020. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines?

Prosecutors will file a superseding indictment next week, bringing seven charges against Bankman-Fried, the letter said. Each of those will be from the original indictment, excluding only a campaign-finance charge that the Justice Department dropped to comply with the U.S.'s extradition treaty with the Bahamas. FTX's headquarters were in the Bahamas.  The Justice Department, however, plans to fold the campaign-finance allegations into a wire fraud charge, according to the letter addressed to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, the jurist who is the presiding judge in the Bankman-Fried case.  ""The superseding indictment will make clear that Mr. Bankman-Fried remains charged with conducting an illegal campaign-finance scheme as part of the fraud and money-laundering schemes originally charged,"" the Justice Department said in the letter, adding that the use of customer deposits for campaigns fall into the wire fraud allegations brought in the original indictment.  ""And as part of the originally charged money-laundering scheme, the defendant also concealed the source of his fraudulent proceeds through political straw donations,"" the Justice Department said. ""As the government will outline in its forthcoming motions in limine [a pretrial motion], the evidence of the defendant’s campaign-finance conduct is admissible at trial as direct proof of the trial charges.""  Bankman-Fried is set to go on trial in New York on Oct. 2, with another trial scheduled for March 2024 for additional charges brought across multiple superseding indictments.

After a network intrusion that jeopardized a portion of Curve DAO’s (CRV) smart contracts and caused a monetary setback of $50 million, the value plummeted drastically. This occurrence prompted numerous investors to bet against their CRV tokens, exacerbating the downward pressure on its valuation. Based on a recent analysis of the price trends, the value of Curve DAO experienced a favorable support level close to the $0.56 threshold. On August 1st, there was an instance of rejection for the lower price, indicating that buyers are accumulating at this reduced price point. Anticipated Curve DAO (CRV) Price Movement In the face of ongoing security concerns, a separate analysis anticipates a substantial 42.1% surge in CRV’s price, propelling it to $0.81 once the security issues are effectively addressed and resolved. Conversely, contrasting predictions foresee a potential 15.7% decline, bringing the value down to $0.48. This shift in sentiment is attributed to a significant number of investors diverting their attention toward competing options within the CRV ecosystem. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look Examining the daily chart, a notable trend emerges as the CRV price experiences its second reversal from a horizontal support level, indicative of the emergence of a double bottom pattern. Presently, this bullish reversal has facilitated an 8% upsurge, driving the price to its current value of $0.614. CRV market cap at $525 million on the daily chart: TradingView.com Within the framework of the double bottom pattern, an expectation arises for buyers to steer the prices upwards by 20%, seeking to challenge the upper trendline of the channel pattern. The true confirmation of a trend reversal lies in a bullish breakout from this resistance level, which would fortify the validity of the emerging pattern. A Potential Trend Reversal The double bottom pattern is a technical chart pattern observed in financial markets, characterized by two consecutive troughs forming near a common horizontal support level. Related Reading: PEPE’s Future: Will Prices Of Meme Coins Continue To Drop? This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend, as the initial downtrend exhausts itself and buyers regain control, leading to a bullish breakout when the price surpasses the pattern’s resistance level. Should the CRV breakout materialize, a subsequent rally could ensue, targeting an initial goal of approximately $0.08. Following this milestone, a subsequent price objective of $1.1 might come into play, underscoring the potential magnitude of the trend reversal that the double bottom pattern could potentially signify. CRV price action. Source: Coingecko With a CoinGecko listing of $0.603, the price of CRV demonstrated a 2% decline over the past 24 hours, while it managed a 1.7% increase over the last seven days.

Other investors included Brevan Howard Digital, the digital asset arm of the global asset manager with $33 billion in assets under management.  The new capital will help accelerate the development of Puffer’s open-source Secure-Signer product and go toward the creation of a permissionless staking pool.  Puffer aims to address the challenges faced by solo validators in Etehreum’s proof-of-stake network. Secure-Signer is a remote signing tool that limits access to validator keys to mitigate the risks of being penalized, or slashed, as a result of software bugs or user error. The penalty can be a hefty hit for stakers that don’t have a large amount of ether (ETH). Puffer is also working on a protocol to lower the barriers of entry for at-home stakers as a viable alternative to centralized liquid staking providers.

15788081,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546175,1691506805,"Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign?","On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have been expanding their reserves recently, a sign that could be bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Trending Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC miners have been accumulating during the past 48 days. The indicator of interest here is the “miner reserve,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that all miners are holding in their wallets right now. Related Reading: These Bitcoin Metrics Are At Important Retests, Will Bullish Trend Prevail? When the value of this metric goes down, it means that the miners are withdrawing coins from their wallets currently. Generally, these chain validators only transfer coins out of their reserve whenever they want to sell them, so this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the price. On the other hand, the indicator increasing in value implies the miners are adding a net amount of BTC to their wallets. Such a trend can be a sign that these investors are accumulating at the moment, and hence, can be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the last couple of months: The value of the metric has been steadily going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner reserve had observed a large rise back in May, but soon after this increase, this cohort started selling as the asset’s price continued to show struggle. After the rally had taken place in June, however, the indicator’s value had stabilized, meaning that these investors were selling the same amount as they were adding to their holdings. In the last few weeks, this sideways trend has slowly turned into an uptrend, as the miners have been gradually expanding their reserves. In the past 48 days, these chain validators have added a total of around 4,060 BTC to their holdings. This amount is worth around $118 million at the current exchange rate, which isn’t a ton given the scale of the total miner reserve, but it’s still nonetheless a positive sign that the miners have been accumulating despite the cryptocurrency’s price observing some decline recently. A notable portion of this latest accumulation by the miners has come from one mining pool, AntPool, as the below chart displays. Looks like miners belonging to this pool have been accumulating | Source: CryptoQuant In the past 52 days, the AntPool Bitcoin mining pool has added a total of about 1,020 BTC to their reserves, which is more than 25% of the total accumulation that all the miners have participated in during this period. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees 10% Pullback, But Here’s Why Rally Can Still Continue The quant has also attached the data for the exchange flows (as well the normal outflows/inflow) for this mining pool. Earlier, there was some concern around the market that these miners may have been selling as they were depositing to exchanges, but as it turned out, this cohort was merely transferring their coins back and forth from these platforms.

42419791,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrJ7,1691506255,Why PayPal's Stablecoin Scares Washington and Could Shake Legislative Talks,"The moment PayPal (PYPL) said it is rolling out a new stablecoin, every crypto policy expert in Washington whispered, “Libra.”  In digital-assets circles, that previous effort pushed by Meta Platforms (META) (then Facebook) will forever represent Big Tech’s folly with regulators, and PayPal’s new move will crank up the heat on an already simmering debate over U.S. stablecoin rules. Still, the payments company is coming into the market in a different era — arguably closer than the industry has ever been to getting lawmakers to write rules for these tokens that could soothe government fears.  See Also: PayPal’s Regulated Stablecoin Is a ‘Watershed Moment’ in Crypto Space, Says Partner Paxos  PayPal USD (PYUSD) — the latest stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar — will be an Ethereum-based token offered to the company’s online-payments customers before expanding to PayPal’s Venmo app.  PayPal has allowed customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) on PayPal since 2020 and on Venmo since April 2021, but customers were initially unable to transfer that cryptocurrency to an external wallet. In 2022, PayPal began allowing users to transfer their crypto assets to third-party wallets and expanded that capability to Venmo in April 2023.  PayPal’s PYUSD marks the first time a major financial firm is backing its own stablecoin. Specifically, PYUSD will be a fiat-backed stablecoin, a kind token pegged to a government-issued currency to maintain a steady value in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.  How PayPal’s stablecoin may affect U.S. regulation  The PayPal move arrives during a turning point, because Congress actually has stablecoin legislation that — for the first time — made it through the initial committee stage in the House of Representatives.  “This announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins — if issued under a clear regulatory framework — hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, which moved the stablecoin bill toward a potential floor vote. He says PayPal’s stablecoin makes it “more important than ever” to keep moving the legislation forward, though the push is widely expected to meet heavy resistance when it hits the Senate.  “We think this could spur Senate Democrats to get more engaged on stablecoin legislation,” Ian Katz, an analyst with Capital Alpha in Washington, said of the PayPal announcement in a note to clients. That’s not necessarily a good thing for pro-crypto forces.  The Democrat-controlled Senate includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who considers crypto a financial hazard that empties regular Americans’ pockets, and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who runs the Senate Banking Committee and has been highly suspicious of the sector. Apart from worries about crypto scams and hacks, they are concerned about the effects a large-scale stablecoin could have on the U.S. banking system in a major crisis and worry that customer runs could destabilize the industry.  One crypto lobbyist observed that the Democrats on McHenry’s committee who had recently voted against advancing the stablecoin bill had returned to well-worn talking points about giant technology companies inserting themselves in crypto. Those complaints reached a height when Facebook was starting its doomed three-year odyssey to establish Libra, later known as Diem. The project was eventually crushed by the Federal Reserve, which warned it might never approve the token.  See Also: Diem's Demise: A Timeline of Libra's Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the House committee’s ranking Democrat, complained during a recent hearing on the stablecoin bill that the current legislation would allow major technology giants to swoop in and launch their own tokens — a scenario she considers dangerous. PayPal now represents an immediate example for the representative to point to in her arguments.  PayPal’s token is also sure to “get the attention of regulators, particularly the Fed, which worries about the long-term financial stability implications of a dollar-linked stablecoin,” Katz said. But positive or negative, the news is likely to keep a sense of urgency on the legislative work. It shows that “moment is now” for Congress to act, argued Ji Kim, the head of global policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation.  “PayPal’s announcement reaffirms that stablecoins will play a critical role in digital payments, cross-border remittances and so much more in the payments ecosystem,” he said in a statement to CoinDesk.

42419786,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFrCv,1691506195,Where Will Bitcoin Mining Be After the Halving?,"It is no secret that bitcoin mining has come under fire for its potential impact on the environment due to its energy consumption. Nobody in the industry is shying away from the fact that bitcoin did not start out as the best environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment.  However, the mining industry has since become one of the most self-aware when it comes to its energy consumption, and as a result has created multiple potential pathways to environmentally-friendly solutions that could benefit industries and regions beyond just Bitcoin.  Rena Shah is the head of operations and strategy at Trust Machines, a company building the largest ecosystem of applications on Bitcoin.  Two of the most promising approaches gaining traction are flare gas solutions and exploring nuclear energy.  Flare gas mining turns waste into revenue  Flare gas, also known as associated gas, is a byproduct of oil extraction processes. Traditionally, it has been flared or burned into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and wasting valuable energy resources.  Forward-thinking bitcoin mining operations have recognized flare gas and the opportunity to utilize it to power their mining operations. But how?  Instead of releasing the gas into the atmosphere, bitcoin miners redirect the flare gas to power mining facilities using specialized equipment. Flare gas recovery systems are employed to capture and convert the gas into electricity, which is then used to run the energy-intensive computations required by bitcoin mining.  Harnessing flare gas can not only bring us into a carbon-neutral era for bitcoin mining, but it also serves a secondary benefit of providing a secondary purpose for an otherwise wasted resource in the oil and gas industry.  Bitcoin mining in this way, from recaptured energy sources, plays a vital role in the ""demand response"" of power grids, especially in Texas. Bitcoin miners dynamically adjust their load participation to help balance power grids. These timely adjustments instantly trim power usage so the grid can have an adequate supply during natural disasters.  Bitcoin mining can significantly reduce its carbon footprint.  Taking this a step further, a similar principle could be applied to a microgrid (a power generation and storage grid that distributes it to localized areas), then when bitcoin miners are connected to microgrids, they can lead to self-sovereignty for communities.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Machine Efficiency Doubled in 5 Years  Many developing nations lack centralized grids due to a deficiency of infrastructure and funding. Instead, communities could create microgrids and generate energy on-site coupled with bitcoin mining — gaining a potential revenue stream through reliable energy.  This innovative approach is gaining traction alongside another, more recent eco-friendly solution: nuclear power.  Bitcoin explores the nuclear option  Christopher Nolan’s ""Oppenheimer"" is not the only reason nuclear power has been trending lately. A string of recent announcements from mining operations are looking to use nuclear power as the prominent players in bitcoin mining look to double their hashrate into the future.  The steady and consistent energy output provided by nuclear power is critical for the continuous and uninterrupted operation required by bitcoin mining facilities.  Given that nuclear power is a zero-carbon base-load resource, as it does not produce direct carbon dioxide emissions. This does not make it explicitly a renewable green energy source comparable to hydro or geothermal. Instead, it creates a new incentive for miners to scale more efficiently as the computational needs become larger through the upcoming Bitcoin halving.  With stringent safety protocols in place, the potential benefits of nuclear power in reducing Bitcoin's environmental impact cannot be overlooked. However, in the current regulatory climate across the entire crypto industry, it is not likely that we see swift and specific legislation providing guidance around nuclear power and Bitcoin.  In 2021 alone, the United States removed about 475 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from nuclear energy production. That is the equivalent of 100 million fossil fuel cars on the road in a year for the amount of Co2 they produce. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of Co2 per year.  Where will bitcoin mining be after the halving?  As mentioned previously, all bitcoin miners will be looking heavily at their operations and how to increase output and efficiency post-halving. The integration of flare gas solutions and the exploration of nuclear power are but two solutions being pursued by the bitcoin mining industry.  Efforts are also being made to enhance the efficiency of mining hardware and to adopt renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydropower.  As someone who worked in the petroleum industry as a drilling engineer, working offshore on drilling rigs while spinning up bitcoin mining pools, understanding how Bitcoin becomes a well-oiled machine begins with the efficiency and long-term viability of bitcoin mining.  See also: 'We're Compute Cowboys': Gas Explorer Gideon Powell on the Pioneering Spirit of Bitcoin  Not only will bitcoin miners need to embrace these diverse and eco-friendly solutions, they will also be looking for new ways to incentivize use of the blockchain. Layer 2 solutions, Ordinals and other Bitcoin DeFi [decentralized finance] projects have been hard at work building use cases that bring activity to the Bitcoin blockchain.  That usage will feed the miners to incentivize further ESG-friendly solutions in perpetuity. By embracing the natural evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain and the diverse range of eco-friendly solutions, bitcoin mining can significantly reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MINING,Rena Shah,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/08/where-will-bitcoin-mining-be-after-the-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc717d6aa92ddca7b40f803a09468dff08dfa1d3-1192x671.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When asked whether Paxos, which issues PYUSD for PayPal, has previously spoken with Elon Musk and X (formerly Twitter) about developing a stablecoin for the platform, Hessert didn’t answer the question directly and simply said that more projects are underway.  “We have other white label stablecoin opportunities in the works,” Hessert said on CoinDesk TV on Tuesday.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  “Paxos has talked with a lot of the largest technology and financial services companies about stablecoins, integrating stablecoins, launching white label stablecoins in some cases, and we think that there’s going to be a lot of really exciting followers here to PayPal,” he said.  The launch of PYUSD signals a seminal moment for the digital asset industry, Hessert said, as it brings a new level of trust to users by being fully regulated and protected from bankruptcy, thus allowing it to be used for cross-border payments or consumer payments and settlements, among other uses.  “Now we can actually see those use cases come to life because it’s being put into products that people are using every day and it’s being presented in a way users can trust,” Hessert said.  Paxos is specifically focused on working with partners that have the ability to “move the needle” on mass adoption of blockchain products, such as PayPal, according to Hessert.  PayPal has been allowing users to buy,sell, and hold crypto assets for several years.

The project aims to reward all participants, including depositors, borrowers, and lenders. Hope.money, a pioneer in bridging DeFi to CeFi and TradFi, has launched HopeLend, a decentralized lending protocol, on the Ethereum network. In an announcement this Tuesday, HopeLend, a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol, aims to revolutionize the borrowing and lending systems across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to effectively utilize and interact with digital assets within the HOPE ecosystem and across other DeFi platforms. Regarding the launch, Flex Yang, Founder of Hope.money, said HopeLend will increase the overall liquidity across DeFi ecosystems and reward all participants on the platform to incentivize decentralized borrowing and lending services. “The debut of HopeLend is a milestone for Hope.money, as it represents an important move toward completing its all-in-one ecosystem,” Yang said. “The non-custodial lending protocol enables all users to benefit from it by increasing liquidity for the HOPE Ecosystem through deposits, loans, and liquidations, and rewarding them with $LT.” In addition, HopeLend will also significantly improve the capital efficiency and users’ liquidity within the DeFi space, allowing any user to borrow and lend within the protocol. This blends well with the protocol’s goals of providing frictionless and transparent financial infrastructure for everyone. Unlike legacy DeFi borrowing platforms, HopeLend introduces a pool-based system of borrowing, whereby users directly borrow and deposit to a pool. This eliminates the need for individual loan pairing, making the process of depositing and borrowing easy and frictionless. Hope.money aims to provide an all-in-one financial ecosystem, providing comprehensive utility for its decentralized stablecoin, $HOPE, including swaps, custodial services, clearing and settlement. The launch of HopeLend increases the utility of the stablecoin and will provide a “solid foundation for $HOPE’s future success as a stablecoin”, Yang added. Notwithstanding, HopeLend will also reward every contributor on the platform (depositors, borrowers and lenders) with its governance token, $LT, adding an extra layer of benefits on top of the standard interest income and borrowing services. The rewards distribution will be calculated using the relative Gauge Weights and utilization rates of various asset pools. Apart from regular loans, HopeLend will also offer users flash loans – loans that are borrowed and paid back in one transaction without having to own the assets. Hope.money steps up as a leading DeFi protocol The launch of HopeLend signifies the potential of Hope.money to become a leading protocol in the broader Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Earlier this month, the protocol added stETH in Hope.money’s reserve pool, which diversifies the assets on the protocol and strengthens the utility and value of $HOPE stablecoin. Additionally, the platform is enhancing the security of users’ funds by forming partnerships with established and trusted digital asset custodians. Following its partnership with Coinbase Custody in April, Hope.money announced a strategic partnership with Cobo, another leading digital asset custodial services provider.

Pomerdoge To Show 40x Growth,"If you are searching for a project that can make you a millionaire over the coming years, Pomerdoge is one cryptocurrency that you shouldn’t miss out on. Convinced by its growth projections and presale performance, experts believe that Pomerdoge’s value can rise by 40x this year. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved downward in recent months. Summary: ● Solana’s (SOL) social engagements have plummeted by 53% in the past week● Ethereum (ETH) is planning to launch the Dencun upgrade by the year-end● Pomerdoge’s presale tokens are selling out fast during Stage 1 Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Solana (SOL) Sees Drop In Social Metric Amid the bullish market sentiments, Solana (SOL) has seen growth in a key metric. The total value locked (TVL) of Solana (SOL) has increased over the past few months. The rise in Solana’s (SOL) TVL has been caused largely because of the increase in the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) vertical. Data shows that Jito, an LSD protocol operating on Solana (SOL), has seen a massive uptick after the Shapella upgrade. However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week. Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53. Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade. Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29. Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023. Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market. According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements. The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs. Pomerdoge’s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD’s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it’s too late.

15786964,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/leading-the-charge-in-defi-spotlight-on-solana-chainlink-tradecurve,1691504100,"Leading the Charge in DeFi: Spotlight on Solana, Chainlink, Tradecurve",">>Register For The Tradecurve Presale The DeFi space is experiencing a surge of innovation and interest, with Tradecurve, Solana, and Chainlink at the forefront. Particularly eye-catching is Tradecurve, now in its presale phase where early investors can acquire tokens for just $0.025 before the predicted 50-fold rise. Let's take a closer look at these three DeFi projects and how they are revolutionizing the industry. Tradecurve (TCRV): 50-Fold Gains on the Horizon to Surge Past Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) Traditional crypto exchange sign-ups can feel like walking through a maze: the invasive KYC checks, the complexity of user interfaces, the endless waiting – it all adds up to a stressful experience. Enter Tradecurve, a groundbreaking trading platform that's on a mission to turn the tables. Tradecurve is all about simplicity and anonymity, doing away with the tedious KYC procedures that often hinder traders. All you'll need is an email address and a bit of cryptocurrency, and the diverse world of trading is yours to explore. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or stocks, Tradecurve's doors are open. Whether you want to mimic successful trading strategies through copy trading, utilize AI-driven automation, or earn passive income with staking, Tradecurve's robust suite of advanced features ensures you have every tool to stay ahead in the trading game. The magic key to all these exciting offerings is the TCRV token, Tradecurve's native digital asset. With TCRV, you can pay transaction fees, earn staking rewards, access top-tier trading tools, and much more. During phase 5 of the ongoing presale event, early adopters can grab TCRV at the steal price of $0.025. With a flurry of activity that has already seen over 20 million tokens sold in just one week, this special price won't last long. Phase 6 will see the price rise to $0.029. Experts predict that Tradecurve's journey is only beginning. As the platform's reputation grows and the demand for TCRV increases, its value could soar to $1.00 and even higher. Solana (SOL): Get Ready for a New Era of DeFi 2.0 Solana has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, rebounding after a period of overselling tied to negative news and events. Traders and investors are once again taking note of its original potential that led to 10,000% gains in 2021. This optimism is backed by technical analysis, as Solana broke free from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern to grow from $18.70 to $32 in just nine days. The price has since adjusted to a $25 support level and left Solana enthusiasts in suspense. Platforms like Hxro Network and Crema are turning to Solana as a fertile ground for developing the next generation of decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is still too slow to handle the latest DeFi protocols, but Solana is more than capable of taking the lead. While it is unlikely for Solana to outperform Tradecurve, the asset is still expected to break out of the current range toward $80 in the not-too-distant future. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Chainlink (LINK): CCIP Protocol and Swift Partnership Leads to 20% Gains Chainlink is a strong contender to become the leading provider of blockchain oracles, allowing DeFi projects to connect smart contracts to real-world data. This has been further cemented by its collaboration with Google Cloud and other industry leaders. And it just got better this week – Chainlink announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Integration Protocol (CCIP), allowing Swift to use Chainklink's technology to send data between various blockchain networks. Chainlink has seen its value grow due to these developments, with a 20% price increase over a 7-day period. The price of Chainlink has since cooled off and returned to $7.09. Analysts note that Chainlink has been suppressed under the $10 resistance for over a year, so any further gains won't occur until it breaks past that barrier.

The company's amended reorganization plan is subject to a vote by creditors, while many of the settlements described require court approval, according to court documents filed Tuesday.  Core Scientific will buy 27,000 units of Bitmain Antminer S19j XPs, the manufacturer's most powerful air-cooled model, for $77.1 million, according to the documents filed with the bankruptcy court. The purchase will be funded by $23 million in cash and $54 million in equity in the company once the plan is effective. The transaction reduces Core Scientific's need for new cash by $30 million by paying for the machines partly in equity.  This is likely Bitmain's first stake in a publicly listed miner. The firm did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Read more: Bitmain's S19 Bitcoin Miners Account for Bulk of Network Hashrate, Says New Research  Companies that have lent funds to Core Scientific to buy equipment can elect to either have their claims converted into equity fully, or take on secured debt in the emerging company at 80% of the value of their claims. Only Anchorage Digital, which had a $29 million loan as of the bankruptcy date, is expected to pick the equity option, according to the document.  Mass Mutual Asset Finance, Barings, BlockFi, 36th Street Capital Partners and Trinity Capital, which together held about $193 million in loans to Core Scientific as of the Petition date, are expected to opt for secured debt.  The firm is also in negotiations for $55 million equity rights offering for current holders of common stock.  Investment bank B. Riley, which lent $70 million to Core Scientific to fund the bankruptcy costs, will convert the outstanding balance of that loan to a delayed term loan and provide an additional $25 million in new financing.  If secured noteholders vote to accept the plan, they can receive either new secured debt at 75% of the value of their claims or equity. If they don't vote to accept the plan, they will receive their prorated share of secured notes issued by the reorganized firm.  In addition, Core Scientific is negotiating a settlement with lender Foundry – which is owned by CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group – to fully recover Foundry's claim and is awaiting court approval on a number of settlements with equipment and services providers.  Core Scientific is the world's largest publicly listed miner in terms of total hashrate, even though Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is quickly catching up.

However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week. Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53. Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade. Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29. Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023. Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market. According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements. The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs. Pomerdoge’s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD’s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it’s too late.

The service runs across seven Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains supported by Forta, including Ethereum, Polygon and BNB Chain.  The blockchain security firm Forta Network upgraded its scam detector service to include malicious URL data, new types of threats and smart contract scanners that account for the latest types of crypto attacks, a representative told CoinDesk.  The move comes as crypto developers are ramping up security measures for users in an increasingly-growing ecosystem, one that is susceptible to malicious code, rogue coders and hacks.  The service, which will be online on Tuesday, runs across the seven Ethereum Virtual Machine chains supported by Forta, including Ethereum, Polygon and BNB Chain. A previous version focused on on-chain data only, such as smart contracts involved in scam activity. The latest version also incorporates malicious URLs.  The new version, built with contributions from security firms like Blocksec and Nethermind, uses predictive techniques to flag on-chain addresses associated with known scammers and contracts that closely resemble known scammers.  Forta claimed that wallets like Zengo had used the Scam Detector to warn their users about malicious addresses during the pre-signed transaction screening process.  The company’s service relies on a group of Forta bots that monitor different threat types to detect scam behavior in real-time. When these bots suspect a scammer, they emit a real-time alert for the user’s perusal.  The cryptocurrency ecosystem has long been a target for hackers due to its inherent vulnerabilities, such as complex code, a massively correlated ecosystem, and millions of dollars stored on sometimes obscure platforms.  Crypto traders lost some $303 million worth of tokens in July alone, as CoinDesk previously reported.

Particularly eye-catching is Tradecurve, now in its presale phase where early investors can acquire tokens for just $0.025 before the predicted 50-fold rise. Let's take a closer look at these three DeFi projects and how they are revolutionizing the industry. Tradecurve (TCRV): 50-Fold Gains on the Horizon to Surge Past Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) Traditional crypto exchange sign-ups can feel like walking through a maze: the invasive KYC checks, the complexity of user interfaces, the endless waiting – it all adds up to a stressful experience. Enter Tradecurve, a groundbreaking trading platform that's on a mission to turn the tables. Tradecurve is all about simplicity and anonymity, doing away with the tedious KYC procedures that often hinder traders. All you'll need is an email address and a bit of cryptocurrency, and the diverse world of trading is yours to explore. Whether you're interested in cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or stocks, Tradecurve's doors are open. Whether you want to mimic successful trading strategies through copy trading, utilize AI-driven automation, or earn passive income with staking, Tradecurve's robust suite of advanced features ensures you have every tool to stay ahead in the trading game. The magic key to all these exciting offerings is the TCRV token, Tradecurve's native digital asset. With TCRV, you can pay transaction fees, earn staking rewards, access top-tier trading tools, and much more. During phase 5 of the ongoing presale event, early adopters can grab TCRV at the steal price of $0.025. With a flurry of activity that has already seen over 20 million tokens sold in just one week, this special price won't last long. Phase 6 will see the price rise to $0.029. Experts predict that Tradecurve's journey is only beginning. As the platform's reputation grows and the demand for TCRV increases, its value could soar to $1.00 and even higher. Solana (SOL): Get Ready for a New Era of DeFi 2.0 Solana has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, rebounding after a period of overselling tied to negative news and events. Traders and investors are once again taking note of its original potential that led to 10,000% gains in 2021. This optimism is backed by technical analysis, as Solana broke free from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern to grow from $18.70 to $32 in just nine days. The price has since adjusted to a $25 support level and left Solana enthusiasts in suspense. Platforms like Hxro Network and Crema are turning to Solana as a fertile ground for developing the next generation of decentralized finance applications. Ethereum is still too slow to handle the latest DeFi protocols, but Solana is more than capable of taking the lead. While it is unlikely for Solana to outperform Tradecurve, the asset is still expected to break out of the current range toward $80 in the not-too-distant future. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Chainlink (LINK): CCIP Protocol and Swift Partnership Leads to 20% Gains Chainlink is a strong contender to become the leading provider of blockchain oracles, allowing DeFi projects to connect smart contracts to real-world data. This has been further cemented by its collaboration with Google Cloud and other industry leaders. And it just got better this week – Chainlink announced the launch of its Cross-Chain Integration Protocol (CCIP), allowing Swift to use Chainklink's technology to send data between various blockchain networks. Chainlink has seen its value grow due to these developments, with a 20% price increase over a 7-day period. The price of Chainlink has since cooled off and returned to $7.09. Analysts note that Chainlink has been suppressed under the $10 resistance for over a year, so any further gains won't occur until it breaks past that barrier.

The prevailing sentiment within the community leans towards directing these USTC tokens towards the burn address as opposed to reintegrating them into the community pool. Conversely, a noteworthy shift has been detected in LUNC’s staking ratio within the past day, where a previous upward trajectory has now given way to a decline. This alteration in the staking ratio commonly signifies reduced assurance among stakers regarding a specific asset. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look Here’s what’s going on within the struggling Terra community: Recent Community Decisions Shape Terra Luna Future In a significant turn of events, Proposal 11658 titled “Return of Community funds not used,” presented by Vegas, a former member of the ex-Terra Rebels developer group, has achieved approval with an affirmative vote percentage of 70.27%.

This proposition stems from the observation that the Ozone Protocol project is presently deviating from the proposed development plan. In a parallel development, Proposal 11660, labeled “Burn 100% of Funds Should Prop: 11658 Pass,” has garnered substantial support, amassing a “Yes” vote share of 82.55%. This counter-proposal asserts that a substantial segment of the community is advocating for the incineration of the 800 million tokens. Consequently, even if Proposal 11658 is ratified, the counter-proposal is poised to take precedence due to its higher vote count. Total crypto market cap reaches $1.12 trillion today. Chart: TradingView.com Awaiting the community’s consideration is another proposal, suggesting the burning of 80% of the funds while allocating the remaining 20% to the community pool designated for developers. Notably, this proposal has encountered limited favor, with only 46% of the community showing agreement. The aftermath of these recent updates has naturally sparked curiosity regarding their impact on the price dynamics of LUNC. How are these decisions influencing the valuation of the token? Staking Confidence Wanes As LUNC Faces Price Challenges Bringing the most recent developments to the forefront, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of LUNC staked within the past 24 hours. This shift indicates that holders and users are opting to un-stake their holdings, signifying a diminished level of trust and confidence in the token’s performance. The implications of this trend raise questions about the current sentiment surrounding LUNC. Related Reading: PEPE’s Future: Will Prices Of Meme Coins Continue To Drop? A fresh analysis of LUNC’s price dynamics reveals that the token’s staking ratio now stands at 14.92%. This percentage signifies the portion of LUNC holdings that have been committed to staking, underscoring the level of engagement and commitment from the community. Source: Coingecko Meanwhile, as observed on CoinGecko, LUNC is presently valued at $0.000077. Over the preceding 24 hours, the token’s price has experienced a reduction of 1.3%, while its value has declined by 2.7% over the past seven days. These figures shed light on the challenges LUNC currently faces within the market and the potential impact on investor sentiment. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

L1D will invest 70% of the funds directly into crypto startups and the other 30% into early-stage crypto-focused investment firms. L1D currently backs notable industry investors Multicoin Capital, DeFiance Capital, Castle Island Ventures and 1kx.  L1D is registered with FINMA, Switzerland's independent financial markets regulator, and manages one alternative investment fund plus the now two venture capital funds, which are backed by professional and institutional clients, including Swiss pension funds, family offices, wealth managers and banks. Founded in August 2018, L1D has had experience with both raising and deploying funds during a bear market.  ""We're most active during bear markets. If you look at our fund allocation, this is when it makes a lot of sense to onboard funds for two reasons. Number one, the effect of advantage is really important and acute,” said Ray Hindi, co-founder and chief executive officer of L1D, in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""The second benefit of investing in bear markets is to de-risk operations. In bear markets, competition is pretty low, typically,"" he added.  The new L1D Blockchain Venture II SLP fund has already deployed about one-third of its capital. Investments have included institutional credit ecosystem Centrifuge, blockchain-backed REIT manager Groma, crypto custodian Safe, decentralized bridge aggregator Li.Fi and treasury management startup Squads. The average check size for direct investments is between $1.5 million and $7 million per project, said Hindi.  When it comes to direct investments, L1D is interested in backing digital infrastructure, decentralized finance (DeFi) and the nascent field of decentralized science (DeSci), the last of which is exemplified by L1D portfolio company VitaDao, a Pfizer-backed project focused on longevity.  ""Our thesis is really that the [crypto] space will mature as time goes on,“ L1D investment researcher Jake Lynch told CoinDesk. He noted that potential areas of strength coming out of the bear market could include security or user interface improvements. “We're long term bullish here,"" Lynch said.

The partnership sees Nexus adding some of its $274 million on-chain capital pool capacity to The Retail Mutual, a U.K.-based mutual organization comprising more than 5,000 shopkeepers and small retail businesses. The total coverage provided by Nexus is $2.3 million for risks such as fire, theft and accidental damage. InShare manages The Retail Mutual and makes all the key decisions with claims, risk management and excess coverage.  There’s a shortage of capacity in certain areas of traditional insurance markets, particularly for small or niche business such as community-based, discretionary mutuals, which sit outside the U.K.’s regulated framework for insurance companies.  In addition, the niche world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is exploring ways to expand beyond crypto into real world assets and traditional finance models.  “It’s an on-chain discretionary mutual covering an off-chain discretionary mutual, which is interesting,” said Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp in an interview. “The insurance industry is starved of capacity and people are looking to the crypto world because they know there's capital there. From a Nexus point of view, we have excess capital that we’re looking to deploy effectively.”  Under the agreement, Nexus will pay out if The Retail Mutual is on the hook for more than 57% of the community’s contributions in any one year as well as single claims above 200,000 British pounds ($255,000). The Retail Mutual rakes in about 2 million pounds a year, so Nexus will pick up the excess if claims top 1.14 million pounds.  The Retail Mutual is made of small corner shops and the like, and the largest individual claim over the community's 20 years of operation is much less than $1 million, Karp pointed out. ""Even under their worst year in the last 20, the total cover amount of $2.3 million wouldn't have been fully utilized,"" he said.  Graeme Thurgood, chief underwriting officer of InShare, said his firm understands the “tremendous potential” of accessing alternative risk transfer capacity. “Being a progressive and forward-looking company, we are committed to continuously exploring innovative approaches that elevate our offerings and the overall customer experience,” he said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/08/decentralized-insurance-alternative-nexus-mutual-provides-cover-to-uk-shopkeepers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/366893e9e9506437bb13b4f4ec9f099ad54d0582-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392739,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAqYT,1691498243,Circle Seeks to Make Crypto Payments Easier With New 'Programmable Wallets',"USDC stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial on Tuesday released a new, programmable web3 wallet platform that the company says can help businesses offer digital-asset payments to customers.  According to a press release, developers and merchants can integrate and personalize Circle’s ""programmable wallets"" into their applications and build services on top, letting consumers send, receive and store cryptocurrencies, including Circle’s USDC stablecoin and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.  The service is available in a public beta version on the Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC) networks for developers, with plans to expand to other blockchains later this year, Circle said.  Circle’s new product comes as crypto firms aim to increase the role of stablecoin payments in the real-world economy.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrencies that anchor their price to another asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. They are a $128 billion asset class and a key piece of infrastructure that bridges traditional payment systems with the digital-asset economy, facilitating trading, transactions and conversion to crypto from government-issued (fiat) money.  Millions of people, especially in developing countries with fragile banks and currencies, including Argentina and Turkey, seek U.S.-dollar stablecoins as a safe haven to store wealth and send remittances.  “This new platform marks the first step for Circle’s Web3 services as we work to ease common pain points for developers, remove friction from value exchange, deliver more seamless user experiences and help drive blockchain-powered wallet adoption,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in a statement.",POSITIVE,ETH | MATIC | USDC,ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | TRADING | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/08/embargo-circle-makes-crypto-payments-easier-with-new-programmable-web3-wallet-for-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7f16aa7b30266e4e1969819e02d4973937402e4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Known for his crypto observations, his latest tweet has stirred conversations in the crypto community, especially pertaining to Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP. In his most recent analysis, van de Poppe indicated that XRP’s price movement is now at a critical juncture. XRP Entering The ‘Area Of Interest’ Particularly, according to Michael van de Poppe’s tweet, XRP is currently moving into what he terms an ‘area of interest’ on its weekly chart. This essentially points towards potential pivotal moments in the coin’s price trajectory that can be significant for traders. Related Reading: Ripple Report Foresees Blockchain Saving Financial Institutions $10 Billion By 2030 It’s $XRP which is getting into the area of interests. Just be able to buy the dip. pic.twitter.com/mBc71YtC2j — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 7, 2023 Based on his analysis, the current position of XRP may soon pave the way for a favorable long-trade entry, aligning with the upcoming market cycle. Further expanding on this, he advised traders to remain vigilant and consider buying the dip in the impending weeks. This comes at a time when XRP’s price has seen a decline of over 10% in the past two weeks, a movement influenced heavily by developments with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As recent data shows, the altcoin experienced a decrease of 10.8% over the previous seven days, positioning its trading value above $0.6. Understanding The Factors Behind The Dip So, what prompted this dip in XRP’s value? Van de Poppe’s analysis provides a perspective. He emphasizes that the significant price fall XRP experienced over the last month is majorly attributed to long-term holders. These holders, witnessing the surge or “heavy impulse” in XRP’s price, saw it as an opportune moment to offload their holdings. Additionally, another notable observation from van de Poppe is the current “lack of interest” in the cryptocurrency markets. This diminished interest, according to the analyst, is responsible for more pronounced price corrections compared to what’s usually seen during bull market cycles. Such market sentiment can significantly influence how cryptocurrencies, including XRP, perform and are perceived by potential investors. Related Reading: XRP Journey To $10: Unveiling The Forces That Could Trigger An Upward Momentum Over the past 24 hours, XRP has seen a slight dip of 0.5%. This price action has brought the altcoin to currently trade at a price of $0.61, at the time of writing. Notably, alongside its value, the asset’s market capitalization has also seen a significant plunge dropping by more than $4 billion, in the past week. XRP’s market cap is currently valued at $32.5 billion as of today, losing almost $4 billion compared to the value of $36.3 billion seen last Tuesday.

The Peer app is a novel social experience created using augmented reality technology and a proprietary ecosystem that enables people to explore and interact with the world around them in new ways, the startup explains. “All the world’s a game and Peer makes everyone a player,” said Peer founder and Chief Executive Tony Tran. “Get ready for a new kind of social network that’s all about fun, joy and gamification at its core.” According to Peer, the app combines geo-location technology with adaptive 3D maps to create a “game-like experience” of the physical world. With Peer, users will be able to customize and share maps of their own, unique social world, pinning their stories, memories and moments to real-world locations for others to find. To understand what Peer is really about, try to think of it as a social network experienced in AR graphics overlaid across the real world. With it, users will be able to explore their physical location and locate digital objects and information that’s posted within their surroundings. Peer will make it possible to overlay 3D graphics on top of the real world, integrating new experiences into our everyday lives. Unlike other social networks which simply focus on getting people to scroll through a newsfeed with their eyes glued to their device, Peer genuinely wants to get people out and about, interacting with real people and locations in the physical world. As part of this approach, users will be incentivized to post and explore digital content that’s tied to specific geographic locations. Someone who’s feeling hungry will be able to use Peer to facilitate their search for a bite to eat. Simply open up the Peer map and look for nearby restaurants, and you’ll find directions overlaid onto the real world to make it easier to find them. As that person arrives at their chosen eatery, they may be able to pick up a digital coupon posted outside by the owner of the business, giving them a 10% discount on their meal. At the same time, the user will be able to check reviews from previous customers, helping them to decide if they want to give the menu a try. Businesses will be able to use Peer to enhance their marketing efforts in creative ways. As an example, Peer created a video showing how an aquarium or dinosaur museum might get the attention of visitors by creating marine animals that swim across the skies, or virtual dinosaurs that roam around outside, enticing people to come and take a closer look. As Peer explains, the Peer app is designed to enable discovery, community-building and other kinds of real-life activities. It will act as a creative canvas anyone can use to design and develop digital experiences that enhance our lives in the real world. It’s an ambitious idea that has the potential to achieve one of the major promises of the metaverse, morphing digital elements into physical reality. Peer said the Peer app is available to download on iOS devices now from the Apple App Store, and will be joined by an Android version that’s due to launch later this year. The company is also reported to be working on an AR headset that will make it possible to experience Peer in the most immersive way. In the meantime, iOS users can expect to see additional features arrive in Peer soon. “In the coming months, we will deepen AI integration and deploy features that are sure to spark a new era of global interconnectedness,” Tran promised. “No social network puts the world in your hands like Peer.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin and ether remained little changed over the past 24 hours, another sign of just how tepid the market is, as even the entry of payment giant PayPal (PYPL) into the stablecoin market failed to move the needle. Both bitcoin and ether haven't moved much in price on the day and have had low trading volumes over the past few weeks. “The prevailing outlook suggests that in the absence of an ETF-triggered catalyst or substantial cryptocurrency-related drama, these price levels could persist for an extended period,” Matteo Bottacini, at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note.  PayPal USD (PYUSD) is the latest stablecoin to come to market. Stablecoins are digital tokens tied to a stable asset, typically the U.S. dollar. PayPal's Ethereum-based token will soon be available to PayPal users in the U.S. This is the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin. Users can transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.  Crypto exchange Bitstamp is raising capital to expand the number of markets it serves around the world, according to a report from Bloomberg. “Bitstamp is not for sale, and we are not actively looking to sell the company,” CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux said in a statement to Bloomberg. “Our current and exclusive priority is to raise money through strategic investors to accelerate Bitstamp’s growth by providing new products and services to retail and institutional crypto customers."" Bitstamp will use the funds to launch a licensed derivatives trading operation in Europe and expand into more markets in Asia.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily trading volume for First Digital's FDUSD stablecoin, which went live on Binance on July 26.  The bitcoin-FDUSD (BTC/FDUSD) volume has averaged less than $100 million per day, barring a spike on Aug. 1.

Fenwick & West, the law firm representing the fallen crypto exchange FTX, has been sued by a group of former FTX customers. The customers accused the firm of aiding in fraud via its legal advice to the exchange, Reuters reports. FTX Lawyers Face Class Action Lawsuit According to the complaint lodged on August 7, Fenwick & West allegedly offered service to the exchange that “went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide.” The complaint states the firm’s services included structuring transactions to avoid regulatory attention and setting up entities that helped FTX’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other exchange executives engage in fraudulent activities. The current complaint is the second to be lodged against Fenwick concerning its dealings with FTX. Previous reports state that the firm Gibson Dunn was appointed to represent Fenwick on similar issues related to the exchange, including in the criminal case against SBF and a federal class action lawsuit. According to the court filing, Fenwick acted as the primary outside legal representative for the now-bankrupt exchange and therefore had a unique insight into FTX’s “convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices,” Reuters reports. The dealings between Fenwick and FTX also extend to Daniel Friedberg. Mr Friedberg was a leading regulatory attorney for the exchange and joined FTX in 2020 from Fenwick. FTX’s new management is now suing Friedberg. Fenwick Allegedly Helps Conceal FTX Executives’ Use of Customer Fund for Speculative Investments The complaint further alleges that Fenwick & West assisted in setting up two entities used to hide exchange executives’ use of customer funds to make speculative investments and political donations.

This is the astonishing and ridiculous state our financial system has got into, and the vast majority of US citizens will probably just shrug their shoulders and carry on. An unfair downgrade? That the US was recently downgraded from triple A to double A+ was heavily lamented in US government and banking circles. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called it “puzzling”, “entirely unwarranted”, and a “flawed assessment”. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said that the downgrade was “ridiculous” and that “it doesn’t really matter”, and that the markets would decide rather than the Fitch rating agency. Both of these heads of finance were hardly going to say that Fitch was absolutely right to make the downgrade, and so their hollow protests were probably to be expected. However, many will take them at their word and wonder why Fitch made this awful decision… Of course we can print money out of thin air, we’re the US government So the already impossible and insurmountable US debt figure is set to rise from the current $32.5 trillion to around $50 trillion over the next 10 years. Given that this is a figure produced by a banker, perhaps the eventual figure might even be much higher. In congress, there are those who revel in the special privilege that the US wields with the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Brad Sherman is a staunchly anti-crypto congressman, always using his power and influence to malign and demean Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. When accusing “crypto bros” of printing $1 trillion from thin air during a key congressional committee, he speculated that these same people might accuse the US government of doing the same thing. He said “perhaps we do” and vindicated the act by saying “we’re the US government”. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in. From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost. Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.

He said “perhaps we do” and vindicated the act by saying “we’re the US government”. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in. From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost. Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.

However, the SEC can prolong the waiting game by 240 days, pushing the final response to January 10, 2024, for ARK Invest’s proposal and March 2024 for other applicants. Speaking on the topic, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that there is a high probability of the SEC delaying the matter further.

How profitable is it in 2023? Top 5 best cryptocurrency arbitrage services today.,"Nowadays, no one manually searches for crypto spreads anymore; everyone uses bots for cryptocurrency arbitrage. There are two types of arbitrage bots: automatic and manual. What are the differences? Automatic arbitrage bots are bots where you set limits on spreads, coins, and exchanges. The bots themselves place orders or buy cryptocurrencies. All automatic bots work through APIs. Due to this, the risk of using automatic bots is significantly higher since you are essentially granting access to your funds to a third-party application. Manual arbitrage bots are bots that provide information on spreads through separate applications, messengers, or even SMS. You still choose the limits, coins, and exchanges. Today, we will review arbitrage bots and rank them based on the following criteria: 1. Security 2. User reviews 3. Functionality 4. Prices 5. Additional features We will evaluate each criterion on a 5-point scale and calculate the arithmetic mean to determine the best cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. ArbitrageScanner Let's start with the first-place bot - ArbitrageScanner with a rating of 4.8. This service supports 60 CEX exchanges, 40 DEX exchanges, and more than 30 blockchains! The service even supports local exchanges in Turkey, Korea, and Latin America. Let's break down why it is ranked number one for cryptocurrency arbitrage scanning. 1. Security: 5/5 ArbitrageScanner is a manual cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. It sends you notifications about exchange rate differences on Telegram. This bot works without requesting API access, meaning all possible risks associated with your funds are eliminated. All exchanges connected to ArbitrageScanner have been verified and are safe to use. 2. ArbitrageScanner.io reviews: 5/5 We couldn't find any significant negative reviews online. There were a couple of users who were dissatisfied that the service wasn't working, but we verified that the project's official channels mentioned technical work, updates, and expanded functionality. Users' reviews in personal blogs are positive, and reviews from news resources are also positive. 3. Functionality: 5/5 The scanner works with a vast number of CEX, DEX, and blockchains. It is the most accurate scanner based on our measurements, always showing you the current cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. This alone gives it a high rating, but the service's development team has also created a screener for cryptocurrency arbitrage, which we'll discuss further in the Additional Features section. 4. Prices: 4/5 The minimum tariff costs $70, but we recommend paying attention to the Expert tariff at $399. It is ideal for both beginner and expert arbitrage traders. Opting for a more expensive tariff provides increased limits, allowing you to set up 30 different coins simultaneously, 15 different Telegram channels, and more. What caught our attention the most is that this tariff includes free access to the second service we mentioned earlier - the Arbitrage Screener. Additionally, you gain access to an arbitrage trader community, where experienced specialists share successful strategies, insights, and current spreads that can be profitable. The price of $399 doesn't seem too high, especially when you are offered numerous earning opportunities. There is also a free trial available. 5. Additional features: 5/5 Under additional features, we consider what the service offers besides its main product. ArbitrageScanner provides numerous additional functions. - Closed chat for arbitrage traders, where both the scanner team and the community share cases and hot opportunities. - Educational materials, providing training on how to use the scanner, real cases, how to find arbitrage opportunities, and how to set up the service. - Screener: This is the second product available to users with Pro and higher subscriptions. It displays all possible spreads that you set up across different exchanges and coins. This tool complements the scanner perfectly. You configure the screener to find the exchanges and coins with the largest spreads at that moment. Then, you switch to the scanner, set the settings for those exchanges and coins, and it shows you the most current spreads. Perfect for those who want to earn profits! - The website offers a free profitability calculator for arbitrage. Even if you don't have a subscription yet, you can calculate how much you can earn on arbitrage with a specific cryptocurrency. - Some users have been given access to beta testing of another product called Telegram Scanner. This tool allows you to search for all mentions of your chosen cryptocurrency or topic in all Telegram chats. It sends all mentions of your keyword to a separate chat, and with a single click, you can respond to the original messages. 3Commas In second place, we have 3Commas with a rating of 4.2. This is one of the most popular automatic bots at the moment, suitable for cryptocurrency arbitrage. However, it has its small downsides: 1. Security: 4/5 While this bot has not been associated with fund theft or hacking, we cannot give it the highest rating. It uses APIs for operation, like all automatic bots, which poses a security threat to your finances. 2. User reviews: 4/5 User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project. 3. Functionality: 4/5 The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, but compared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities. 4. Prices: 5/5 The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided. 5. Additional features: 4/5 This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides: - 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription. - A demo account where you can try out your strategies. - An internal portfolio rebalancer. Bitsgap In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6. This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges. 1. Security: 4/5 As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements. 2. User reviews: 3/5 User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers. 3. Functionality: 4/5 The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas. 4. Prices: 5/5 The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided. 5. Additional features: 2/5 The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides. Coinrule In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4. This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges. 1. Security: 2/5 Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims. 2. User reviews: 3/5 User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier. 3. Functionality: 4/5 The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today. 4. Prices: 5/5 The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors. 5. Additional features: 3/5 - Marketplace of arbitrage strategies HaasOnline In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8. It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges. 1. Security: 3/5 Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access. 2. User reviews: 4/5 User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot. 3. Functionality: 2/5 This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging. 4. Prices: 2/5 The price for this product is $9 – $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides. 5. Additional features: 3/5 This service offers additional features available to users: A demo account where you can try out your strategies. Cloud server (it's not safe) Conclusion We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to.

Additional features: 4/5 This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides: - 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription. - A demo account where you can try out your strategies. - An internal portfolio rebalancer. Bitsgap In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6. This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges. 1. Security: 4/5 As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements. 2. User reviews: 3/5 User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers. 3. Functionality: 4/5 The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas. 4. Prices: 5/5 The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided. 5. Additional features: 2/5 The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides. Coinrule In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4. This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges. 1. Security: 2/5 Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims. 2. User reviews: 3/5 User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier. 3. Functionality: 4/5 The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today. 4. Prices: 5/5 The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors. 5. Additional features: 3/5 - Marketplace of arbitrage strategies HaasOnline In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8. It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges. 1. Security: 3/5 Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access. 2. User reviews: 4/5 User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot. 3. Functionality: 2/5 This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging. 4. Prices: 2/5 The price for this product is $9 – $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides. 5. Additional features: 3/5 This service offers additional features available to users: - A demo account where you can try out your strategies. - Cloud server (it's not safe) Conclusion We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392723,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgApOf,1691495046,AI Will Be One of the Most Important Investment Themes Over the Next Decade: Morgan Stanley,"AI and the accompanying technology will be transformational across industries, and will be one of the most important secular investment themes over the next 10 years, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Monday,  The bank looked into whether recent outperformance in the sector could represent a bubble in the making, and concluded that AI index performance didn’t match the pattern of historical pre-peak bubble returns. A secular investment theme is a long-term trend that isn’t tied to market cycles.  “In the absence of knowing the date of the peak of the current AI bull-run, we assume the generative-AI fuelled market rally to have started with the launch of ChatGPT and so measure the current rally from December,” analysts Edward Stanley and Matias Ovrum wrote.  Typical investment bubbles tend to rally a median of 154% in the three years before peaking, and 217% on average, the note said. While AI winners, such as Nvidia (NVDA), have gained over 200% year-to-date, wider AI indices are up only about 50% and are not yet above prior 2021 highs.  “Stickiness and breadth of diffusion set AI apart from prior hype cycles,” the note added.  Rival Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS) predicts that AI adoption will likely start to have a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy sometime between 2025 and 2030.

Valkyrie Makes A Move To Stay Ahead Of The Crowd Valkyrie’s application represents a move to stay ahead of the crowd. While many have applied to launch their respective Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Valkyrie has simply moved to include exposure to ETH futures contracts in their existing investment strategy. Related Reading: Crypto Adoption: Singapore Red Cross To Accept BTC, ETH, USDT, And USDC While the likelihood of the SEC’s approving these Ethereum ETFs or in what order remains uncertain, Valkyrie plans to introduce its double-barreled approach on or around October 3, putting its launch date ahead of that of other competitors. Part of the filing reads: In addition, on or about October 3, 2023, the Fund’s name is expected to change to Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF. The Fund is expected to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol “BTF”. The foregoing changes will only take effect and are conditioned upon the effectiveness of the Trust’s Post-Effective Amendment No. 23 under the Securities Act of 1933, including any amendments thereto, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 4, 2023 and contains further information about the changes to the Fund’s name and investment strategy. Going by SEC Rule 485(a), those who applied for the Ether ETFs can launch 75 days from their respective filing dates if none of the applications before the SEC gets denied. In tandem with the 75 days, the earliest any of these fund managers (the first being Volatility Shares, who applied on July 28) can launch is October 12 (9 days after Valkyrie’s proposed launch if their application gets greenlit by the SEC). ETH retains $1,800 level | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com This first-mover advantage can be critical when looking back at history. Although Valkyrie launched its Bitcoin fund in October 2021, it wasn’t the first to do so, as ProShares had already launched its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). Many believe that BITO launching first is one of the reasons it has enjoyed more success compared to Valkyrie’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF). BITO now has over $1 billion in assets under management (AuM) compared to BTF’s AuM of about $30 million. Deja Vu? As Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a tweet, this isn’t the first time someone is moving to amend an existing fund to launch the first such product in the industry.

McHenry, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has released a statement calling for the need to pass the Stablecoin Bill in the wake of PayPal’s launch of its own stablecoin PYUSD. The Call For A Stablecoin Law According to the statement, McHenry believes stablecoins are the “pillar of our 21st-century payments system.” However, they must be regulated to reach their full potential. Related Reading: TRON’s Justin Sun Reassures Crypto Community That Huobi Exchange Is Solvent Part of the statement read: This announcement [Paypal’s PYUSD Launch] is a clear signal that stablecoins—if issued under a clear regulatory framework—hold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system,” said Chairman McHenry. “Clear regulations and robust consumer protections are essential to enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential. That’s why it’s more important than ever that Congress enact legislation to provide comprehensive digital asset regulation, especially for stablecoins.” McHenry also recognizes the role of Congress in providing regulatory certainty to the crypto industry and the need to enact these laws that can keep the US at the “forefront of digital innovation.” The bipartisan Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act recognizes the strong role that states have played in regulating digital asset firms and builds on successful state regimes, like New York’s. We are currently at a crossroads to keep America at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Congress is making significant, bipartisan progress on legislation to ensure the U.S. leads the financial system of the future. We must finish the job. The bipartisan Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, which was advanced by the House Financial Services Committee last month, is a legislative framework that seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Many will be hoping that this bill could spearhead the passing of other crypto-related bills. PayPal Continues Journey Into Web3 On August 7, payment platform PayPal announced the launch of its dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal (PYUSD), in collaboration with Paxos (Paxos also happens to be the issuer of Binance’s BUSD). This is part of Paypal’s efforts to increase its Web3 offerings as the company believes that fully-backed, regulated stablecoins can transform payments in the Web3 space. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale $4.5 Million Burn Shocks ETH Community, What’s Going On? “The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,” said Paypal’s President and CEO Dan Schulman. “Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.” This isn’t Paypal’s first attempt at launching a stablecoin. In 2021, the company explored the possibility of launching a stablecoin but faced a setback following heightened regulatory scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

42392735,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAq8p,1691487180,Rising Dormant Bitcoin Numbers Suggest Holding Is a Preferred Investment Strategy,"More than 13.3 million bitcoins (BTC) worth $388.7 billion have been dormant on-chain for at least a year, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The tally equals 68.54% of the circulating supply of 19.5 million bitcoins and shows a persistent bias for holding the cryptocurrency for long-term gains, according to analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, though some of the inactive supply could include coins lost. The level hit an all-time high of 69.2% two weeks ago.  The percentage of circulating supply inactive for at least two years recently jumped to a record 56%, with 40% inactive for at least three years. Dormant coins are those that haven't been spent on-chain over the relevant period. The increasing figure suggests a decline in the supply available in the market and the potential for a sharp price rally, assuming the demand side strengthens.  ""This trend, indicative of the prevalent accumulation strategy prevalent amongst long-term holders, showcases a robust belief in bitcoin's long-term value, even amidst the notorious downturns that have characterized the cryptocurrency market over the past one year,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  ""This inherent scarcity, juxtaposed with a burgeoning demand, has the potential to drive prices upward,"" the analysts said. ""The unwavering faith in bitcoin paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency's future. Only time will tell how these dynamics will shape the market, but for now, the sentiment is one of steadfast optimism.""  Note that the metric also overlooks the so-called ""financialization"" of bitcoin over the years.  Financialization refers to changes in the way people can invest in bitcoin. Over the years, CME's cash-settled futures spot, and futures-based exchange-traded funds have emerged as popular alternative investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it. These products, the so-called liquid tradeable proxies, also affect the cryptocurrency's price.

15779487,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546171,1691487027,Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: 28% Upswing Or 23% Drop Coming Next?,"Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at a pivotal $0.291. The question is: Will ADA experience a 28% upswing or is a 23% drop on the horizon? Remarkably, the ADA price still remains in bearish territory, but the potential for a trend reversal is palpable. Price Analysis: 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart paints a picture of ADA trading just a smidge above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at $0.286. Notably, on Monday, ADA briefly dipped below this level but was buoyed by the ascending trend line (black line) that was established in mid-June. This trend line is the bulls’ last stand; a breach could see a bearish descent to the year’s low of $0.22. Adding another layer of complexity, the 200-EMA (blue line) on the 4-hour chart is converging towards the 23.6% Fibonacci level. ADA’s recent inability to surpass the 20-EMA (red line) is concerning. With the moving averages trending downward, a compression between $0.28 and $0.30 seems inevitable. However, if ADA remains resilient above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the trendline, and manages to break the moving averages, especially the 200-EMA, then the bulls might just have a fighting chance. Related Reading: Can The Cardano Mithril Protocol Propel ADA To $1 This Year? In this scenario, the 38.2% Fibonacci at $0.319, the 50% Fibonacci at $0.346, and the 61.8% Fibonacci at $0.378 become the next logical targets. A daily close above $0.38 (July’s high) would be a clarion call for the bulls, marking a 28% rallye from the recent price. Bullish Arguments for Cardano The recent price movements by Cardano might be bearish, but there are compelling arguments in favor of ADA’s potential resurgence. Santiment, a renowned analytics platform, recently tweeted: As Cardano sits just above $0.29, whales and sharks holding between 100K-10M ADA have accumulated back to their highest level since September, 2022. Additionally, on-chain transaction volume has been rising nearly every week for the past 6 months. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Remains Muted Despite Significant Milestones, Why? This statement is supported by data indicating ADA’s transaction volume surged above a staggering 67 billion ADA in consecutive weeks, a peak not seen since September 2021. Such heightened network activity is often interpreted as a bullish sign, indicative of increased user engagement and interest. Furthermore, ADA wallets holding between 100K-10M ADA now account for a significant 34.04% of all circulating tokens, suggesting strong confidence among larger investors. Also, Messari’s recent report on Cardano offers more reasons for optimism. The report delves deep into Cardano’s ecosystem, financial trends, and network performance. One of the standout revelations is the surge in decentralized app (dapp) activities. For the third consecutive quarter, Cardano has seen a remarkable uptick in dapp transactions, boasting a 49.0% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q2, averaging 57,900 daily transactions. State of @Cardano Q2 2023 With a dedicated community of users and developers, Cardano has demonstrated staying power.

42392736,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAqDx,1691486984,Bitcoin Quiet in Asia at $29.3K as Market Hunts for Catalyst,"Bitcoin (BTC) declined slightly to $29,300, but remained largely stable following the U.S. government's report on the July Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed better-than-hoped year-over-year inflation rates.  July's CPI was higher by 0.2% versus expectations for 0.2% and 0.2% in June. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 3.2% versus expectations for 3.3% and 3.0% in June. The core CPI was up 0.2% in July, also meeting expectations and the same as June.  Core CPI year-over-year was higher by 4.7% against forecasts for 4.8% and 4.8% in June.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value attempted a very modest rally in the hours following the report, but mostly remained in the area around $29,300 throughout Asia trading hours, lower by 0.36% over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was off 0.19% over the previous 24 hours.  Bob Iaccino, co-founder and chief market strategist of Path Trading Partners, said on a recent CoinDesk TV appearance that, there’s still a gap between people’s perception of wage growth and inflation.  “Inflation is the rate of growth of prices, and although it's increasing at a slower rate now, it's still positive. This gap means people are complaining about wages because they haven't caught up to inflation yet,"" he said.  Regarding bitcoin and the crypto market, Iaccino expressed optimism and emphasized the need to make understanding and involvement in the crypto world more accessible.  ""I'm quite positive about Bitcoin, especially after BlackRock's endorsement. It seems to signal that Bitcoin will be around long enough to create an ETF,” he continued. “Despite mixed feelings in the short to medium term, I honestly couldn't be more positive about the asset right now.""  Fear, Greed, and Upswings  There’s a lot of talk about this coming bull market and upswing, but the question is… wen?Matrixport's proprietary Bitcoin Greed and Fear Index, which measures investor sentiment, is signaling a potential bullish revival in bitcoin prices, as CoinDesk reported earlier Friday Asia time.  The index uses above 90% readings to indicate greed or excess optimism, and below 10% to represent extreme fear or pessimism, with these extremes often marking trend reversals.  The latest data shows the index has moved from 30% to 60%, indicating a rebound from July's slide from above 90%.  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, noted that the index appears to have bottomed out and is projecting upside pressure, with signs of renewed upside volatility in Bitcoin.  The First Doge on the Moon is a Shib  Bitcoin is now boring, and some have said that it’s lost both its bark and bite.  Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens have seen a return of around 20% over the past week, outperforming other major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as CoinDesk noted Friday.  Trading volumes reached $315 million in a 24-hour period on Thursday, the highest since February.  The gains are attributed to increased developer activity on Shiba Inu and anticipation for the launch of Shibarium, a Shiba Inu-based blockchain, later this month.  Recent bullish sentiment is also linked to developers' plans to tie digital identity verification, known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), to all Shiba Inu developments, positioning it as a more serious and compliant project.  Shibarium is expected to focus on metaverse and gaming applications, particularly as the non-fungible token (NFT) sector is anticipated to grow, with the testing blockchain showing significant activity in recent months.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa, Stephen Alpher",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/08/bitcoin-ether-flat-as-paypal-usd-report-fails-to-ignite-market-shib-finds-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84f8bbc58a183124ce36c6a621f6ba039c58cbfb-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Systemic stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets that are in wide enough circulation to potentially disturb broader financial stability, should they fail. Respondents welcomed the central bank's plans for these types of stablecoins to be supervised by both the BoE and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), with relevant rules to be set by the bank.  Respondents and the government also supported extending existing financial markets infrastructure regime (FMI SAR) to cases of insolvency concerning systemic stablecoins, along with accountability measures (which evaluates whether the regulators' approach is future proof).  The U.K. released a series of consultations last year detailing that systemic stablecoins would be brought under existing regulations to ensure the return of customer funds and make sure company operations continue – something several respondents expressed concern about.  ""Few others noted concerns that adding a new objective for returning customer funds to all systemically important payments entities may lead to situations where this was prioritized over ensuring continuity of service to mitigate acute stability risks,"" the document said. The government said that it will continue to work with regulators to review its approach.  The U.K. recently passed the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 into law which gave the BoE powers to set up a regulatory regime for systemic stablecoins. The BoE has said it plans to publish its rules later this year.

A Closer Look,"Litecoin (LTC) has recently faced a period of bearish pressure that has taken a toll on its market performance. The months of July and August have witnessed a shift in sentiment, as bearish forces began to dominate the crypto market. As of the latest update, LTC finds itself trading within a critical support zone, prompting discussions among traders and analysts about its potential trajectory. With the value of LTC hovering just below the $80 mark, market observers are closely monitoring whether this level will hold against the prevailing bearish sentiment.

According to reports, a new Binance trading product and an ongoing community gaming event have played a pivotal role in the incredible price rally of the YGG token. YGG Token Surges According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Yield Guild Games (YGG) token saw a dramatic surge over the past week, rising by 580% and reaching a peak of $0.93 on the 7th of August, 2023. However, the token abruptly crashed soon after reaching this price level and is currently trading at around $0.36. However, the token had hinted at a decline in price in its gradually dropping trading volume. The trading volume recorded a drop of 26% in 24 hours, falling under $500 million, while the market cap increased by $17 million, reaching $161 million. Why Did The YGG Price Rally? Observers attributed the surge in the YGG token’s price to a couple of major factors. On the 3rd of August, Yield Guild Games announced the 4th season of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP). The Guild Advancement Program is a periodic gaming event that distributes rewards such as tokens to community members who successfully complete specified quests in participating in YGG-affiliated games. The 4th season of Yield Guild Games includes some of the biggest names in the space, such as Splinterlands, Skyweaver, and Axie Infinity. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the Yield Guild Games network usage saw a spike, reaching a one-month high of 192 active addresses. Yield Guild Games stated in its press release, “Some of the community’s most recent top picks are joining the fold this season, with all-new quests for guild members to dive into as they hone their skills and establish their web3 reputation. The season will officially begin on the 3rd of August, 2023, and will run until the 27th of September, 2023.” Barely a day later, Binance announced plans to launch a YGG/USDT trading pair for perpetual contracts on its CEX platform, allowing up to 20x leverage. Available on-chain data suggests that the announcement brought in about $100 million worth of new capital into the YGG ecosystem. Whales Dumping Share Of YGG While the growth has been quite notable, reports have emerged of venture capital companies who initially backed the project, reportedly looking to sell their share of YGG on Binance. Data from LookOnChain sourced on the 7th of August shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG holdings to Binance and are most likely looking to sell. DWF Labs had received around 29 million YGG from the Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data has suggested that most of these tokens have been moved to exchanges. Bitkraft Ventures also made large deposits on Binance using FalconX. Another whale, Wintermute Trading, has reportedly deposited just over 11 million YGG worth $6.7 million to different exchanges over the past four days. It currently holds a further 2.5 million YGG, valued at around $1.5 million. LookOnChain also showed that Youbi Capital had deposited around 1 million YGG to Binance. The firm currently holds about 11 million YGG. Sfermion has also jumped on board the selling wagon, using FalconX to deposit its YGG tokens on Binance. Large deposits generally signify an investor’s willingness to exchange the token for other assets or sell them. This is also true of whales such as the ones mentioned earlier.

Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps. Details Of The Hack News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol’s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app’s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating, “NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.” The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team’s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults. The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app’s “strategy” vaults could withdraw some of their funds. Farming Contracts Stopped Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app’s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch. According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge. Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker’s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix’s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions. “Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.” However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC. “You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.” DeFi’s Hacker Headache Crypto and DeFi remain highly vulnerable to bad actors, even as the space looks for wider acceptance. Last month, Coinspaid fell victim to an attack orchestrated by the dreaded Lazarus Group, a North Korean-backed hacker group.

At the beginning of August, decentralized exchange LeetSwap suspended trading thanks to fears of a potential exploit.

15776011,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546148,1691479222,Is Bitcoin Mispriced? Lessons From Past Volatility Slumps,"Since its inception, Bitcoin has (almost) always been the poster child for volatility. Yet, the Bitcoin price is hardly moving in any direction at the moment. But the latest data suggests a surprising twist in the tale. As per a recent report by on-chain data provider Glassnode, “Bitcoin markets are experiencing an incredibly quiet patch, with several measures of volatility collapsing towards all-time lows.” This raises the question: Are we entering a new era of Bitcoin price stability, or is the market misreading the signs? Historical Context For The Volatility Of Bitcoin To truly understand the current state of the market, it’s essential to delve into the historical context. The Glassnode report notes, “It has been 842-days since the bull market peak was set in April 2021.” During this period, Bitcoin’s recovery has been more robust than in previous cycles, trading at -54% below its all-time high (ATH), compared to a historical average of -64%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fate Hangs In The Balance, 50% Chance Of Falling Below $25,000 In September Drawing parallels with past cycles, the report highlights that both the 2015-16 and 2019-20 cycles underwent a “6-month period of sideways boredom before the market accelerated above the -54% drawdown level.” This could be indicative of a similar “boredom” phase in the current cycle. One of the most striking revelations from the Glassnode report is the extreme volatility compression Bitcoin is currently undergoing. “Bitcoin realized volatility ranging from 1-month to 1-year observation windows has fallen dramatically in 2023, reaching multi-year lows.” This is reminiscent of four distinct periods in Bitcoin’s history, including the late stage of the 2015 bear market and the post-March 2020 consolidation following the outbreak of COVID-19. Following the furious rally at the beginning to 2023, the price performance on both a quarterly and monthly basis has moderated. This mirrors Bitcoin’s previous cycles where the initial surge from the low is robust, but then transitions into a prolonged phase of uneven consolidation, a phase of re-accumulation. Furthermore, the report states, “The price range which separates the 7-day high and low is just 3.6%. Just 4.8% of all trading days have ever experienced a tighter weekly trade range.” The 30-day price range is even more extreme, constricting price to just a 9.8%, and with only 2.8% of all months in BTC’s history being tighter. Such levels of price compression are rare for Bitcoin, suggesting an anomaly or a potential precursor to a significant market move. Derivatives Market Insights The derivatives market, often seen as a barometer for underlying asset sentiment, is also echoing this quiet spell. “The combined Futures and Options trade volume for [BTC and ETH] are at, or approaching all-time-lows,” the report notes. This is further emphasized by the fact that “BTC is currently seeing $19.0B in aggregate derivatives trade volume, whilst ETH markets have just $9.2B/day.” Related Reading: Why Low Volatility Bitcoin Could Last A Lot Longer Interestingly, the options market is showing signs of a significant “volatility crush.” As per Glassnode, “Options are pricing in the smallest volatility premium in history, with IV between 24% and 52%, less than half of the long-term baseline.” This is further corroborated by the historically low Put/Call Ratio and the 25-delta skew metric, suggesting a net bullish sentiment in the market. The crux of the matter lies in interpreting these signs. The report aptly questions, “Given the context of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility, is a new era of BTC price stability upon us, or is volatility mispriced?” Historically, periods of low volatility in Bitcoin have often been followed by significant price movements. Whether this is a calm before a storm or a genuine shift towards a more stable Bitcoin remains to be seen. But as Tony “The Bull”, the chief chart technician at NewsBTC, has pointed out yesterday, the technical indicators are also pointing to a prolonged period of re-accumulation, meaning that the phase of low volatility is likely to continue for some time to come. At press time, the BTC price was at $29,277.

42392741,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgAqdb,1691477933,Fake PayPal USD Tokens Pop up on Several Blockchains,"Scammers are trying to defraud unsuspecting users, capitalizing on PayPal’s (PYPL) recently launched dollar-pegged PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, by issuing fake tokens on various networks.  Over 66 fake tokens have propped up on networks, such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, and others as of Asian noon hours on Tuesday, DEXTools data shows. The majority of these have been floated on Ethereum, where the original PYUSD exists.  New York-based payments giant PayPal said on Monday that it will soon make its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin available to users, marking the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin.  Users can transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.  While the tokens are yet to come, some scammers are already trying to trap unsuspecting users. The modus operandi is to issue a token, name it “PYUSD,” add liquidity with ether or another token and offer it to users on a decentralized exchange.  This is possible as anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  Most of the supply of these tokens are likely purchased by their creators after issuance, giving the illusion of a trendy token while being a honeypot in reality. The hustle may yield a few thousand dollars in a few hours for such developers – making it a profitable, albeit wholly unethical, venture.  Some developers may, however, pull all liquidity from the fake tokens hours after issuance, causing prices to drop 100% and leaving speculators holding digital dust.",NEGATIVE,BNB | PYUSD,ETH | MARKET | BNB | PYUSD,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/08/fake-paypal-usd-tokens-pop-up-on-several-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cce99480639abf439e0be49a02e469e52ef114ba-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The breach led to an estimated unauthorized transfer of assets valued at around $1 million. Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract. A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action: ""Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."" Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance’s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring. Community Response and Calls for Accountability The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren’t typical assets, but they bore messages – some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read: ""Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."" The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol’s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher. As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable. Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.

Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract. A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action: ""Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."" Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance’s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring. Community Response and Calls for Accountability The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren’t typical assets, but they bore messages – some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read: ""Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."" The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol’s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher. As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable. Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.

The digital payments and fintech giant announced the official launch of its very own Ethereum-based stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) yesterday August 7. PYUSD is an ERC-20 token which will be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of $1. It will be primarily used as a bridge between fiat currencies and web3, enabling conversion of any of the platform’s listed digital assets to and from PYUSD. The launch has been the result of PayPal’s own exploration into stablecoins at least as far back as January 2022 but which was temporarily halted due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The launch might mean that an agreement has been made between regulators and PayPal’s stablecoin issuer Paxos. Now, the launch has been received with much fanfare, with the stablecoin finally rolling out to customers “in the coming weeks.” However, this has not stopped scammers from riding the hype and launching fake PayPal stablecoins; which have since flooded cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap.

Finally, after more than a day since the PYUSD announcement, Paxos has released the official smart contract for PYUSD and the corresponding token address and GitHub repository. Currently, the max total supply of PYUSD sits at 26.9 million according to etherscan. The launch of PayPal’s own stablecoin could send waves throughout the crypto industry in the United States.

On days when the U.S. dollar is higher, ether tends to underperform versus bitcoin. Ether is both more volatile than bitcoin and highly correlated to bitcoin. By Erik Norland At A Glance Higher tech stocks tend to boost ETHBTC, while a higher USD tends to depress it Bitcoin supply is perfectly inelastic, which contributes to its high volatility Together, ether and bitcoin account for over 60% of the total value of the world's cryptocurrencies, but the exchange rate between the two has varied widely over time. So, what drives the Ether-Bitcoin exchange rate? The ETHBTC cross rate responds to many factors, but here are three of them. Technology Stocks On days when the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index rallies, ether tends to rise versus bitcoin. This may be because ether, which is the currency of the Ethereum smart contract network, has more practical applications in the technology space than bitcoin, which is mainly held as a store of value and a medium of exchange. U.S. Dollar On days when the U.S. dollar is higher, ether tends to underperform versus bitcoin. Bitcoin Supply While ether can be supplied up to 18 million coins per year, bitcoin supply is limited to a maximum of 21 million coins ever, of which about 19 million already exist. Every four years, the supply of new bitcoin drops in half. In the past, halvings have often been preceded by large run-ups in bitcoin prices and tremendous increases in the amount of revenue that bitcoin miners are paid for matching transactions. Ether is both more volatile than bitcoin and highly correlated to bitcoin. As such, when bitcoin rises or falls versus the U.S. dollar, ether often moves to an even greater degree.

15769171,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546113,1691463601,"Few Bitcoin Holders Withdrawing BTC From Exchanges, Is Fear Creeping In?","Recent data from CryptoQuant on August 7 shows that few Bitcoin holders are moving coins away from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Despite BTC prices increasing in recent weeks and teetering close to the $30,000 psychological level, this observation is accurate. More Bitcoin Held in Exchanges As of July 28, there were 30,663 addresses withdrawing coins from exchanges though prices were relatively higher, trading around $28,000, up from around $25,000 registered on June 14 when 39,311 addresses moved coins. On April 14, when BTC changed hands at around $30,000, 132,237 addresses withdrew the coin from exchanges. The drop in the number of exchange addresses moving coins to external, often non-custodial wallets can be a concern, significantly if prices are rising. The shift also raises important questions about why more Bitcoin holders opt to store coins in exchanges despite these ramps being targets by hackers. Usually, when fewer people transfer their Bitcoin to external, often non-custodial wallets, it might mean they’re unsure about the uptrend. As such, they keep their coins on exchanges to quickly sell for USDT or traditional currencies like USD or Euro if needed. Optimism Abound Even with this change, the broader Bitcoin community remains positive about the coin’s potential in the coming months. This optimism comes partly from recent classifications from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) that expressly endorse Bitcoin as a commodity subject to capital gains tax. Related Reading: Solana Products See Strong Inflows, Bitcoin And Crypto Lose $107 Million Other digital assets like ETH have not been categorized as such, sowing doubts among some Ethereum holders that US regulators can classify the second most valuable coin as a security. Because of this positive outlook on the world’s most valuable coin, advanced derivatives, like BlackRock’s planned launch (if approved) of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), are being developed. Complex Bitcoin trading products are already live in Canada and other parts of the world. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say that the odds of a Bitcoin ETF getting approved by the SEC are 65%. The increase is partly due to bullish progress, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s comments on Bitcoin, the regulator’s reportedly insisting that BTC is the only commodity before Coinbase was sued, and the agency accepting re-filing from BlackRock’s ETF.

As September approaches, market analysts closely monitor BTC’s possibility of plunging below the $25,000 mark. However, history has shown that September’s struggles often pave the way for a resurgence in October, with massive rallies that rekindle investor optimism. Potential For BTC To Drop Below $25,000 Before A Promising October When examining Bitcoin’s historical performance during September, it becomes evident that the month has posed challenges for the world’s most renowned cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BREAKING: Did Solana Miss A Golden Opportunity To Collaborate With PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin? Previous September has witnessed BTC experiencing declines of up to 13%. This downward trend has undoubtedly concerned traders and investors, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. According to Timothy Peterson, market analyst and investment Manager, based on current market analysis, there is a 50% probability that Bitcoin’s price will dip below the $25,000 threshold before September concludes. While a potential drop below $25,000 might cause temporary unease among Bitcoin enthusiasts, historical patterns suggest that October could be the month to look forward to. In the past, September’s price declines have often catalyzed significant rallies in the subsequent month. Observing the heatmap above, Peterson identified instances where Bitcoin rebounded with gains as high as 48% following sharp declines in September. If Bitcoin does indeed experience a dip below $25,000 in September, it may mark the final significant correction before the commencement of a new bull run cycle. On this note, Peterson believes that such a dip, coupled with the subsequent recovery and October’s potential rally, could set the stage for substantial gains in the coming months. Bitcoin Bullish Divergence As BTC experienced a drop from $32,000 to $29,000, trader Ali Martinez highlighted a significant trend; the number of new Bitcoin addresses continued to rise steadily. Related Reading: Ripple Is Now A Member Of Trade Organization That Hosts The Likes Of BlackRock This intriguing divergence between price and network growth provides insights into BTC’s potentially stable long-term uptrend. While Bitcoin’s price exhibited a downward trajectory, the number of newly created Bitcoin addresses has consistently grown. This divergence is noteworthy, suggesting that despite short-term price fluctuations, the network’s expansion remains robust. It signifies a growing interest in Bitcoin adoption and usage, which, in turn, supports the notion of a stable and sustainable long-term uptrend. Conversely, Bitcoin remains trapped within a price range of $29,200 and $28,900, a pattern that has persisted since the start of August. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $28,960, reflecting a 0.5% decrease in the last 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency markets closed fairly flat on Monday, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) up 0.23%, bitcoin (BTC) up 0.57% to $29,165, and ether (ETH) flat at $1,826.  The question on everyone’s mind, is what will move bitcoin past the $30,000 mark?  Bullish traders are eyeing the upcoming U.S. July Consumer Price Index report for signs of continued inflation trends, with expectations set at a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.3% year-over-year growth. In the backdrop is the Federal Reserve's historical monetary tightening and subsequent market anticipation of rate cuts, which have historically been intertwined with bitcoin's recent price fluctuations.  But a big question is will this be a bullish catalyst for the world’s largest digital asset? CPI could also come in higher than expected, which would signal that rate hikes are not yet done.  In a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, ""The Crypto Trader"" author Glen Goodman said it's concerning that bitcoin hasn’t moved all that much in the last few months and more regulatory clarity is required for the market to move.  ""I'm not very impressed with bitcoin. You'll remember months ago there was a strong correlation between the S&P 500 and bitcoin. We were following that for the best part of a year, and that correlation has pretty much broken down,"" he said.  Goodman argues that a break below $25,000 would be the end of the 2023 bull market.  But to even get to that point, there needs to be a big change in the regulatory environment.  “The exchanges need to be reliable,” he said. “Nobody worries about if the New York Stock Exchange is going to exist next week.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +3.1% Computing Loopring LRC +1.5% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +1.1% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB −5.2% Currency Decentraland MANA −3.4% Entertainment Terra LUNA −3.1% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Crypto Options Traders Bet Against Volatility: There is a lot of market chatter about an impending volatility explosion of bitcoin. Still, some crypto traders retain a bias for shorting volatility — that is, setting up strategies that bet against price turbulence. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has primarily traded in the range of $29,000 to $30,000 since July 24. That's below the $30,000-$32,000 range of the preceding four weeks. The cryptocurrency's price hasn't risen more than 4% in a single day since June 21. As such, key metrics gauging bitcoin's backward-looking realized volatility and estimated or implied volatility have tanked to multiyear lows.  CPI Preview, Bitcoin Unlikely to Get Bullish Catalyst:Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are hoping for continued good news on the U.S. inflation front from Thursday morning's July Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists expect a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis, the same increase as seen in June. Year-over-year growth is forecast at 3.3%, up from 3% in June. Headline inflation, which is not adjusted for seasonal factors and which includes often-volatile food and energy prices, peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and was running at an 8.5% pace in July of last year.

YGG is currently changing hands at $0.37 with a market capitalization of over $101 million when writing on August 7. Prices have since retraced from the $0.99 recorded earlier today as the token fell by over 60%. The recent spike and general volatility have seen trading volumes soar as trading activity is concentrated on Binance and KuCoin. YGG Whales Dumping Amidst the notable growth, there are reports of venture capital (VC) companies that initially backed the project, backing off and reportedly selling the token primarily on Binance. For instance, Lookonchain data on August 7 shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG to Binance and will likely sell. Last year, DWF Labs received 29.13 million YGG from Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data shows that most of these tokens have since been moved to exchanges.

Youbi Capital has also deposited 1 million YGG to Binance. Currently, it holds 11.6 million YGG. Sfermion is also joining the selling bandwagon, which initially claimed 1.2 million YGG. It used FalconX, a provider serving crypto whales, to deposit the token to Binance.
