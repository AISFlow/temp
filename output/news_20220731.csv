42395107,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASX36K,1659311072,First Mover Asia: BTC Dips Below $23.5K; The Crypto Bear Market Will Test Thailand’s SEC,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether trade slightly lower on Sunday; other cryptos are mixed.  Insights: The crypto bear market will test Thailand's markets regulator.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin and Ether Fall in Sunday Trading  By James Rubin  After a quick spurt upwards on Saturday, bitcoin returned to a lower altitude under $24,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently at roughly $23,350, down slightly over the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin finished its second consecutive positive week, rising more than 13% from its Monday low, at one point topping $24,500 amid hopeful signs the economy was slowing enough for the U.S. central bank to soon consider scaling back interest rate hikes. For July, bitcoin rose over 23%, while ether soared more than 55% to change hands a little under $1,700.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve increased interest rates by a widely anticipated 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point). A day later, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product (GDP) declined by an unexpectedly high 0.9%.  ""The FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee], some tech earnings and the GDP numbers didn't really dent market confidence last week,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. ""BTC had been showing positive signs in terms of price stability and bidding action below $20,000. All of those things resulted in a rally of sorts, seeing BTC trading just below $25,000.""  Most major altcoins were mixed with NMR and FIL gaining 20% and 10%, respectively, but AXS and SOL each dropping over 2%.  Crypto gains on Friday dovetailed with major equity indexes, which rose with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, jumping 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Both indexes rose in July with the latter gaining over 9% for the month, its largest increase since November 2020, as investors remained undaunted by disappointing earnings and warnings of slowing growth to come at a number of the world's largest brands.  Continued fallout for crypto  Crypto news included the now almost daily aftershocks from the the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin collapse and Three Arrows Capital bankruptcy. A report published by The Block, citing a restructuring proposal deck, said Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance lost $280 million in proprietary trades with customer funds. Babel Finance suspended withdrawals and redemptions, citing market volatility and hired U.S. investment banking firm Houlihan Lokey to help chalk out a restructuring plan. Babel is one of the several crypto companies, suffering from the “crypto contagion” following the Terra and Three Arrows Capital debacles.  Yet as Arcane Research noted in its most recent Friday newsletter, while the crypto lending space is in shambles, other industry developments were more favorable, including Spanish banking giant Santander's (SAN) announcement that its Brazil unit would begin offering crypto trading, and large, capital raises by several projects, including Series A rounds of $65 million by Web3 digital identity service provider Unstoppable Domains and $150 million by layer 1 blockchain Aptos Labs. The latter was led by FTX Ventures, the venture capital arm of crypto exchange FTX, and Jump Crypto.  ""Significant capital raises are back as the dust has settled in the industry,"" Arcane wrote.  Still, BitBull's DiPasquale remains wary about the macroeconomic environment and its potential to head off a longer-term crypto rally. He will be watching what comes out of the FOMC's September meeting. Another hefty interest rate increase is expected.  ""We are likely to see increased volatility in the coming month as speculators take their chances,"" he wrote, but added: ""We remain confident that bidding BTC under $20,000 is likely to be a decent entry in the long-term. We continue to look for signs of conclusive breakouts and would be comfortable taking entries during steep drops in the coming months.""

At the height of last year’s bull market there were more crypto trading accounts being created in-country than stock brokerage accounts, growing at a rate of 27.6% versus 2.9% for brokerage accounts.  Part of the appeal of crypto for Thais might have stemmed from lack of other investment opportunities. Real estate is often out of reach. The stock market is rife with fraud and Ponzi schemes. Crypto, in the eyes of many, would have offered an opportunity to generate wealth that can’t be found in traditional vehicles.  But that was the bull market. Most retail traders behind these accounts would have suffered heavy losses as the market slid into bear territory. Cracks are beginning to form in some of the infrastructure; local exchange Zipmex filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this week, citing exposure to troubled crypto protocols like Babel.  Thailand’s market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been active in crypto. Last year the Thai SEC banned tokens that have “no clear objectives or substance” from licensed exchanges. DOGE was gone. It put non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the same category but appeared to ease up as local incumbent bank Kasikorn got involved in the market.  Now the Thai SEC says that stricter digital asset rules are coming. Policy is in the early stages of deliberation, but Thai SEC Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol told Bloomberg that stronger supervision is needed: “Our main focus will be to provide more protection for small investors, some of whom are putting most of their savings into these assets,” she said.  Checking all digital assets  Speaking to Thailand’s public broadcaster’s English channel, Anusorn Tamajai, a former member of the Bank of Thailand’s audit committee, said that “the SEC urgently needs to check every digital asset exchange to verify whether all clients’ assets are kept safe there.”  Considering that Zipmex had sudden liquidity issues, and other exchanges like Vauld also had to suspend withdrawals, trying to isolate which exchanges have been exposed to crypto contagion could stop the problem right in its tracks.  Navigating the bear market by putting problematic infrastructure offline before retail investors get burnt would allow the ecosystem, as a whole, to come back stronger.  It would also be a victory for the regulator to take a comparatively soft touch; any sort of wholesale retail ban is off the table as is pushing digital assets into securities rules. That sets Thailand apart from Hong Kong and even Singapore, which is becoming more crypto skeptical.  Unlike Hong Kong or Singapore, Thailand isn’t known for the strength of its regulated financial markets. But if regulators are able to take a firm hand in cutting out problematic exposed infrastructure from the market, all the while treating crypto with a soft touch, they might demonstrate that there’s a way to regulate digital assets and protect retail consumers without a ban.  But if regulators are able to take a firm hand in cutting out problematic exposed infrastructure from the market, all the while treating crypto with a soft touch, they might demonstrate that it’s possible to work with the industry in building a safer environment for retail traders rather than being advocates for excluding retail participation altogether.

The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether the Bitcoin market as a whole is currently selling at a profit or at a loss. The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it sold at before this. If the previous value of any coin was less than the current price, than that coin moved at a profit just now. While the last selling price being lesser than the latest one would imply the sale of the coin lead to a realization of loss. When the SOPR&apos;s value is greater than one, it means the overall market is selling at a profit at the moment. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the average investor is moving BTC at a loss. Now, the &apos;short-term holders&apos; (STHs) include all Bitcoin investors who sell their coins after holding them for less than 155 days.

42411445,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlhB,1659279284,"Philosophically, It Doesn’t Matter Whether Cryptos Are Securities; Practically, It Does","I promised Twitter I would write about proof-of-stake and proof-of-work for this newsletter, but my computer (which kept restarting uncontrollably for a couple of days) and my immune system (which gave into a rhinovirus that deposited wet cement into my head) had other ideas.  Since a proper proof-of-stake and proof-of-work piece deserves a lot of careful, deep thought that I'm incapable of at the moment, let's instead focus on two players that are writing the narrative for us: Coinbase (COIN) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  On July 26, it emerged that Coinbase was being probed by the SEC for allegedly listing securities. This news came on the heels of an insider-trading case brought against a Coinbase employee and two others on July 21 by the SEC and U.S. Justice Department. Making matters (somehow) worse, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest off-loaded 1.4 million Coinbase shares on July 27.  Woof.  It has been tough sledding for Coinbase since it went public last April and the latest obstacle on its most recent downhill slide is securities law. Everyone’s favorite! No, I won’t make any assertions of if ether (ETH) is a security or not, but I will make the assertion that it doesn’t matter.  That (and maybe more …) below.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  So first, Coinbase. Coinbase is one of crypto’s non-token, real business success stories. Founded in 2012 as a means to easily and securely send, buy and receive bitcoin, Coinbase has since expanded far beyond its roots and now hopes to become the “Amazon of assets” and “list every asset out there in crypto that's legal.” It went public in April 2021 and it was a huge deal, debuting on Nasdaq with a valuation of around $100 billion.  Turns out that COIN going public marked the top of not only crypto markets but also the company. Aside from its dismal stock price performance (down 81%; see below, compared with bitcoin price), Coinbase is also losing in the court of public opinion.  Coinbase and the court of public opinion  Earlier this month, I wrote about how Coinbase going public led to an imperative on consistent, infinite earnings or revenue growth, which further led to an immense expansion in headcount. This all culminated in:  “...an absolute public relations nightmare when Coinbase cut back on hiring in May, which rolled into rescinding new job offers. The blowback in turn led to a pointed tweet thread from co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong urging dissenters to quit, following an employee petition to remove executives from the company, which was then followed promptly by the exchange laying off 18% of its workforce.”  Buried in that same piece was a link to a tweet thread by one Jordan Fish aka Cobie, an early bitcoiner who invests in crypto projects and co-hosts the UpOnlyTV podcast, in which he outlined how many of Coinbase’s asset-listing suggestions seemed questionable.  Cobie has posted several tweets and tweet threads about questionable practices across crypto. He even found someone, thanks to the transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, who bought tokens just before they were listed in a Coinbase asset listing (the blog posts where Coinbase outlines the assets it is considering to support on its platform). Assets that get listed on Coinbase usually spike in price shortly afterward, so there was something potentially fishy, as it were, given how obscure some of the considered tokens were.  This same tweet, and I cannot believe this is true, was cited by the Justice Department in its July 21 press release charging a Coinbase employee with an insider-trading tipping scheme. Here’s where it gets interesting. According to U.S. law, insider trading happens when individuals trade securities based on confidential or nonpublic information. But Coinbase lists cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies have been operating in a regulatory gray area for some time now.  The SEC, in this lawsuit, specifically called nine cryptocurrencies securities. (For the record, I had heard of exactly one of them before this case came to light). This means there’s probably a path forward where a meaningful number of cryptos get tagged as securities in the U.S.  Which nudges us toward our main topic: securities law.  Coinbase and the real court, with laws and stuff  Nik De, CoinDesk’s managing editor for global policy and regulation, is far more well-equipped to talk about all things SEC, so you should check out his work if you want to dive deeper. He wrote a great article in his newsletter about the SEC and crypto last week.  I’m not going to opine on specific projects, partially because that is not my job (looking at you, Gary Gensler), but mostly because it really doesn’t matter in the abstract. At the center of a lot of internet debates lies a seemingly simple question: “Is this cryptocurrency a security?”  I submit that this doesn’t matter philosophically and that it only matters practically. Because of laws and stuff.  Stay with me.  Yes, the SEC is tasked with enforcing laws against market manipulation to protect investors. And yes, that is a valiant purpose. But contending that market manipulation only matters in the context of securities is exactly wrong. Bitcoin (legally deemed a commodity in the U.S.) market manipulation should be stomped out as well. If the SEC decided tomorrow that bitcoin was a security, it would change nothing about bitcoin fundamentally. It would also change nothing about bitcoin market manipulation being bad. It would just change who thinks they can regulate it at this particular moment.  So no, it doesn’t matter whether bitcoin, ether, SOL, dogecoin or AVAX are deemed securities. The SEC cites the Howey Test when determining whether something is a security. While the agency has said in the past that bitcoin is not a security, and while I am not a lawyer, one could make the argument that the test sure makes bitcoin look a lot like a security because investing in bitcoin:  1) requires money (fiat money, but still money) unless you’re a miner (and even that requires money to pay the power bills) or one of the die-hard merchants who receive it in exchange for goods and services,  2) which is invested in a common enterprise (the Bitcoin network),  3) with a reasonable expectation for profit (maybe unreasonable, but if bitcoin demonetized gold, the price of bitcoin would go up),  4) derived from the efforts of others (I hold bitcoin and I haven’t once touched the code).  And that doesn’t matter one bit philosophically. It only matters practically because investors, institutional and individual, need to play by the SEC’s rules. Otherwise, they go to jail or get fined. But bitcoin is still freedom money, gold 2.0, or a reserve asset even if a government agency says it’s a security (though again, it hasn’t).  Of course, if this practicality applies to you specifically, then yes, it does matter. In that case, you should weigh the probability of bitcoin or ether being labeled as securities (which seems low at this point) and weigh the probability of other cryptocurrencies being labeled as securities (which seems higher at this point after the insider trading suit against Coinbase). Not because it changes why you’re investing, but rather it governs if you even can invest. Or at least, whether you can without using a VPN (virtual private network).  Last bit that I absolutely have to mention before tying this question back to Coinbase: It only matters in the United States. Most people, in case you haven’t noticed, don’t live in the United States. U.S. securities laws shouldn't and don’t directly affect my uncle in Greece.  Back to Coinbase and Cobie’s tweet thread that was cited by the Justice Department: The real issue with the front-running of a potential Coinbase listing by an employee and the questionable assets it was considering for listing wasn’t that the assets in question were securities. The issue is ethical.  First, employees at an exchange with that much sway over the price of an asset shouldn’t trade on material nonpublic information, whether or not the asset is deemed a security by the SEC. (I’m not suggesting that this should be illegal; I’m saying that it is ethically bad.)  Second, and more important, Coinbase has a (moral) responsibility to ensure for its largely retail customer base that the crypto assets it lists (whether the government considers them securities, commodities or condiments) aren’t best defined as valueless vaporware. Its failure to do so is the main problem and therein lies the true challenge for a company incentivized to hit quarterly numbers.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/31/philosophically-it-doesnt-matter-whether-cryptos-are-securities-practically-it-does,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c1e21fded19f3039943bf5716dfff0391bea6f1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
