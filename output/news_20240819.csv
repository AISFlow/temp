32601539,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636559,1724108421,"Ethereum Sees Major Outflow From Mega Whales – ETH Price Drops Below $2,600","The crypto market has been challenging, and Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, is no exception. Despite its dominant position, the token has faced significant headwinds in recent weeks, with its price showing no signs of a sustained recovery. Key Metrics Point To Continued Bearishness According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, some of the largest Ethereum whales, holding over 10,000 ETH, have been steadily selling their tokens over the past month, with no indication of slowing down. This mass exodus of large investors has contributed to ETH’s 26% price drop over the last 30 days, narrowing its year-to-date gains to just 55% – making it one of the weaker-performing tokens in this timeframe. The selling pressure from these Ethereum whales has been a key factor in the token’s ongoing consolidation at the bottom of the range it has experienced over the past seven months. Related Reading: MATIC Price (Polygon) Sets Sights Higher: Can It Gain Bullish Momentum? This bearish sentiment surrounding ETH is further exacerbated by the TD Sequential indicator, which has presented a sell signal on the cryptocurrency’s hourly chart, potentially intensifying the current downtrend. Looking ahead, Martinez has identified key support levels that could come into play if the Ethereum price continues its downward trajectory. According to Martinez, a crucial support zone to watch is between $2,300 and $2,380, where 1.62 million addresses have purchased over 50 million ETH. Maintaining this level will be crucial for bulls to prevent another sharp crash, similar to the one seen earlier this month, which saw the price retrace to the $2,100 level – a level not seen since February. Potential Price Upside For Ethereum Ahead? Despite these bearish factors painting a dark picture for the second-largest cryptocurrency on the market, market researcher Leon Waidmann claims that a significant development has emerged that could signal a potential bullish shift for Ethereum. The researcher explained in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that, for the first time, the ETH balance on cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped below 10%. This marks a notable milestone, as the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges is now lower than that of Bitcoin (BTC). Waidnmann said: The fact that there is significantly less ETH on exchanges than BTC is a highly encouraging sign. It suggests that Ethereum investors are increasingly withdrawing their tokens from trading platforms, potentially indicating a shift away from short-term speculation and towards long-term hodling.

Ultimately, the next move for the ETH price remains to be seen, whether the bulls or bears will get the upper hand, decide the next short-term movement for the token, and break the current consolidation phase.

32599224,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636475,1724103003,Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Bull Run Top With Historically Proven Indicator,"In a video update on YouTube, crypto analyst Rekt Capital delved into the dynamics of Bitcoin’s price movements through the lens of the PI Cycle Top Indicator, a predictive tool that has garnered attention for its historical accuracy in pinpointing the peaks of Bitcoin bull runs. Here’s How High Bitcoin Price Could Go This Cycle The PI Cycle Top Indicator operates by tracking two key moving averages: a short-term 111-day moving average (colored orange in Rekt Capital’s visual analysis) and the 350 day moving average (depicted in green) to gauge extended market trends. A crucial aspect of this tool is the “crossover” event where the short-term moving average rises above the long-term average, historically signaling a peak in Bitcoin’s bull market within a few days. However, the current market data shows that these two moving averages are diverging rather than converging, suggesting that the conditions for a bull market peak are not yet in place. “As these two PI Cycle moving averages are currently diverging from one another, the bull market peak is nowhere close,” Rekt Capital explained in his video. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Facing A Persistent Net Sell-Side Bias, Glassnode Reveals The 111-day moving average serves as a critical metric in Rekt Capital’s analysis. During bear market phases or pre-halving years, this moving average acts as a barometer for bargain buying opportunities, oscillating around it in downtrends. Conversely, in halving years, such as 2020, it tends to act as a support level, underpinning uptrends that lead to new all-time highs. “Any dip below this moving average is a bargain buying territory,” Rekt Capital noted, emphasizing the strategic importance of this level during different market phases. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below this moving average, approximately at $59,000, which has not happened for a significant period since the pre-halving year, marking a potentially undervalued state relative to historical patterns. The analysis suggests that if Bitcoin reclaims the $63,900 level—just above the current position of the 111-day moving average—it could end the current bargain buying opportunity, setting the stage for further upward movement. “We are approximately $5,000 away from reclaiming this region. Not much needs to happen for Bitcoin to bounce back and reclaim this region to end this bargain buying opportunity,” remarked Rekt Capital. Related Reading: When To Be Bearish On Bitcoin? On-Chain Analyst Answers Another element of the PI Cycle Top Indicator is the 350 day moving average. This average typically gets revisited in later stages of the market cycle, often acting as resistance before an upside deviation occurs. “Upside deviations beyond the green moving average that’s when we see parabolic price action take place,” Rekt Capital pointed out, referencing past events in 2013 and 2017 where such movements were observed. The current green moving average resides around $96,000, indicating a significant upside potential before any parabolic risks manifest. Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests that while Bitcoin is far from reaching the $96,000 mark, historical patterns predict that it will eventually approach and possibly exceed this level, leading to a short-lived period of rapid price increase. “[We are] nowhere close to this green moving average because it resides at around $96k, so we’re still almost $30k away from this region once we break beyond $96k we have to understand that the clock is starting to then start ticking really for the end of the ball run and we might have have a a window of just a few months where Bitcoin will be rallying uninterruptedly with of course pullbacks,” the analyst explained. Looking ahead, Rekt Capital emphasized the importance of monitoring the convergence of these two moving averages for signs of a potential bull market peak. “We need to see a flick up in the Pi Cycle moving average for that crossover to be in place to some degree,” he stated, indicating that a sharp rise in price action is required for a definitive crossover to materialize. At press time, BTC traded at $58,695.

42390571,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3nIR,1724100675,NY Judge Rejects SEC’s Efforts to Stymie Tron’s Arguments in Ongoing Securities Suit,"A federal judge pushed back against a Securities and Exchange Commission legal tactic in the agency's case against the Tron Foundation and founder Justin Sun.  The two sides are still battling it out in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  A New York judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to force a pre-trial conference or to require the filing of an additional response in its ongoing securities fraud lawsuit against the Tron Foundation and founder Justin Sun.  The SEC has accused lawyers for the Tron defendants – the Tron Foundation, Justin Sun, the BitTorrent Foundation and Rainberry (formerly known as BitTorrent) – of violating appropriate procedure by improperly advancing an argument in its defense.  In its letter to the court filed Aug. 12, the SEC accused the defense of trying to sneak in a new argument – that the sales of TRX and BTT did not meet the “common enterprise” prong of the Howey Test, the method used by the SEC to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract – after the Tron defendants had already filed their motion to dismiss on May 30.  Tron’s lawyers fired back against the SEC’s letter, writing their own missive to U.S. District Court Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), accusing the SEC of “attempt[ing] to manufacture a controversy” and urging the court to deny the SEC’s request for a pre-trial conference.  Lawyers for Tron reiterated that their defense largely hinges on their belief that the sales of BTT and TRX fail the Howey test’s third prong – the expectation of profits from the efforts of others – and argued that the SEC’s letter requesting leave to file an additional reply document (called a sur-reply) “mischaracterizes and disregards Defendants’ argument about Howey’s third prong in the context of this case (despite the point being in bold and italics).”  “Indeed, if the SEC is granted permission to file a sur-reply addressing the various common enterprise tests (which were not addressed in any prior pleading), Defendants will need sur-sur-reply to state our position on this new issue,” the letter from Tron’s attorney read. “In other words, the SEC asks for three pages to respond to an issue of its own devise.”  Ramos ultimately sided with Tron’s lawyers, ruling Monday to deny the SEC’s request.  “In light of defendants’ concession that they [are] not challenging the “common enterprise” element of the Howey test, the SEC’s letter motion to strike the untimely argument or for leave to file a sur-reply is DENIED.”  A representative for Tron declined to comment on “pending legal matters.”",NEUTRAL,TRX | BTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRX | BTT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/19/ny-judge-rejects-secs-efforts-to-stymie-trons-arguments-in-ongoing-securities-suit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e22a7cc6f60bb917388e1ace2079a43a53aabf7-1367x769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We believe investors are missing a major arbitrage between bitcoin miners and AI/HPC data centers. In its May 2024 update, Iris Energy noted that cloud services help optimize capital costs and diversify revenue streams, smoothing returns through Bitcoin’s cycle. Bitcoin miners are shifting to AI and HPC, unlocking new revenue through strategic arbitrage, with an estimated $37.6 billion net present value by converting 20% of their capacity by 2027. This month, we update the fundamental thesis for publicly traded bitcoin miners, highlighting their increasingly important roles in AI/HPC (high-performance computing) and energy markets. Publicly traded miners now control a record percentage of Bitcoin's global hash rate, and their collective market cap reached an all-time high in July. The MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index , tracking these stocks, has risen 2.8% as of August 12th, underperforming the bitcoin price by 3,000 bps. At these levels, we believe investors are missing a major arbitrage between bitcoin miners and AI/HPC data centers. Arbitrage Between Miners and AI Data Centers We speak to many investors who are still unaware that bitcoin miners now have significant exposure to AI. The synergy is simple: AI companies need energy, and bitcoin miners have it. As the market values the growing AI/HPC data center market, access to power - especially in the near term - is commanding a premium. Due to heightened energy demands from bitcoin miners and data centers, North American grid interconnection queues now exceed four years. However, by drawing large loads and collaborating with power grids by participating in grid balancing programs, existing bitcoin miners are uniquely equipped to support AI/HPC immediately. Suitable bitcoin mining sites can energize GPUs for AI in less than a year, compared to the 4+ years required for greenfield AI data center developments to go online. Highlighting the potential value of this time arbitrage, we found that bitcoin miners trade at an average of ~$4.5M per megawatt (MW) of installed capacity, compared to above $30M / MW for some data center stocks. If properly equipped with power, bandwidth, and cooling systems, bitcoin mining sites are ideal for capturing this value for AI/HPC cloud services. Early adopters like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) are reaping the rewards. On June 3rd, CORZ, the 4th largest bitcoin miner by hash rate, secured a 12-year contract with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave, projected to generate over $3.5 billion in revenue for providing 200 MW of infrastructure. CoreWeave exercised its first option for additional capacity three weeks later, adding $1.225 billion for an extra 70 MW over 12 years. Then, in early August, CoreWeave exercised yet another option for Core Scientific to deliver 112 more MW of HPC to host Nvidia ( NVDA ) GPUs. Core Scientific could soon become one of the U.S.’s largest data center operators if CoreWeave exercises up to 118 MW of further expansions. Following the first announcement, CORZ has added $1.6B to its market cap, with the shares +99% vs. the MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index (+0.29%), which is by far the best-performing constituent. Bitcoin Miners Revenue Potential of AI/HPC Accordingly, we believe investors should understand the potential size of the AI/HPC opportunity for bitcoin miners. This analysis examined the capital requirements and potential revenue if publicly traded bitcoin miners pivoted varying percentages of their energy capacity to serve AI & HPC customers. Based on an interview with Hut 8’s CEO at Bitcoin Nashville and third-party estimates, we assume revenues of $1.30 per kWh. By multiplying the $1.30 per kWh rate by 1,000 (to convert to MWh), then by 24 hours a day, and 365 days a year, we calculate the annual revenue per MW. After applying an 80% utilization rate - a rate that HIVE Digital surpassed as demand for its AI/HPC servers grew in 2023 - we project an annualized revenue of approximately $9.11 million per MW. The capital required to outfit these AI-oriented data centers is enormous. Borrowing from Core Scientific’s capital expense estimates of $5 million to $8 million per MW for converting Bitcoin mining infrastructure to AI/HPC, we conservatively apply a $7.5 million per MW cost of conversion in our model, arriving at a total of ~$23.1 billion for the infrastructure alone. We also assumed that the collective pivot would require 1,681,600 Nvidia H100 GPUs, each costing $32,500 or a total of ~$54.7 billion - for the first generation alone! As we further assumed that GPUs would need to be sold and replaced after four years, with depreciation derived by assuming GPU performance (FLOP/s) doubling every 2.30 years, our model includes two additional sets of replacement GPUs over the 13-year project. Bitcoin miners generally have bad balance sheets, either because of too much debt, too much share issuance, too much executive compensation , or some combination of all three. This cycle is somewhat better, as many miners restructured during the bear market. What’s great about AI/HPC is that the customers are willing to fund the capex, potentially providing a lower cost of capital for the bitcoin miners to strike their next energy deal. For example, per the terms of CORZ’s first agreement with CoreWeave, CoreWeave will provide ~80% of the capex to retrofit Core Scientific’s existing infrastructure for AI/HPC and additionally pre-finance Core Scientific’s ~20% share of the capex through deferred hosting payment revenue.

There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. Our discounted cash flow ((DCF)) model applies a 17% discount rate over a 13-year project duration to evaluate the profit potential for miners if they convert energy currently dedicated to bitcoin mining to AI/HPC. We estimated each miner's current and target power capacity based on publicly available investor documentation. Then, we determined the present value of each miner’s opportunity to allocate 20% of their current and target power capacity to AI/HPC. While still illustrative, please note that each of these estimates may exceed or fall short of each miner’s actual power capacity expansion, depending on what they have publicly disclosed as of our research and how they execute in the years ahead. We also assume no changes in miners’ power contracts with grid operators, typically lasting only a few years, so that miners can adapt to dynamic energy markets. While large-scale industrial customers like bitcoin miners generally have strong bargaining power to achieve stable or even reduced energy costs over time, it is important to acknowledge the risk that this cost variable could increase over our model’s lengthy 13-year duration - mainly if anti-growth regulations, such as net zero policies, are implemented. In terms of buildout, we assumed a 50% per year project completion rate, meaning that the megawatts allocated to AI/HPC revenues in our projection increase linearly from 0% to 50% at the start of year 2 and plateau at 100% at the beginning of year three. While some locations, such as in Core Scientific's first CoreWeave announcement, can achieve operational status in one year or less, we estimated two years to account for additional work required at mining sites that are less suitable or still under construction. We assumed a power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio of 1.4, meaning that due to cooling, ventilation, and other overhead infrastructure, 1.4 MW of power would need to be drawn for each 1.0 MW of active AI/HPC. Bitcoin Miners Potential Value Boost from AI Conversion at Current Valuations Financial Overview, AI/HPC Strategies, & Estimated Upside Potential Among MVDAPP Index Publicly Traded Bitcoin Miners (2024) Source: Company filings, Bloomberg, VanEck Research of 8/12/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The information and valuation scenarios in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell, or as a projection of how bitcoin will perform in the future. Actual future performance of bitcoin is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. If AI/HPC comprises 20% of these miners’ energy capacity by 2027, and assuming they could fund the investment, we think the publicly traded bitcoin miners’ total additional yearly profits could exceed an average of $13.9 billion per year over 13 years, compared to the trailing 12 months net income for the group at -$335 million. After factoring in the 17% discount rate, in the aggregate, we estimate the net present value of this opportunity to be ~$37.6 billion , compared to the current total market cap of the 12 companies under consideration, which sits at ~$19.7 billion as of August 12th, 2024. Please note that this exercise assumes miners buy the GPUs themselves when most would likely pursue a hosting model like Core Scientific. While the hosting model will lower the margin potential, it will also slash the required investment. Either way, we think that for many miners, the NPV of converting 20% of MW capacity can easily double the value of the stock. Preliminary findings suggest that miners already exploring or working with HPC, such as CORZ and WULF, are year-to-date outperforming those with no AI/HPC plans such as MARA and RIOT. In fact, likely driven by their ambitions in constructing AI/HPC revenue streams, CORZ and WULF are the only miners who have outperformed bitcoin YTD. One major obstacle is that only a small percentage of existing bitcoin mining centers have the necessary proximity to major cities, bandwidth, redundancies, and other critical infrastructure needed for AI/HPC conversion. In contrast, established hyperscalers like Equinix already benefit from specialized infrastructure, economies of scale, and the resultant network effects from years of operation and customer success. Bitcoin miners entering the AI/HPC market will likely face lower margins as they work to develop similar operational expertise, recognition, and trust. Additionally, while crypto's regulatory and security demands might partially translate to AI/HPC, working in both industries introduces further challenges. Still, given the lower cost of capital from potential customers such as hyperscalers and the relatively small amount of aggregate power we assume will be converted (20% of planned capacity, or 3GW, compared to Jefferies estimates that 6GW of electricity is required to power Nvidia GPUs already ordered for 2025), we believe these AI pivots will not cause over-supply and can be highly accretive for miners at current valuations. Moreover, if bitcoin miners can meet Tier 3 and 4 data center standards (achieving 99.982%+ uptime with multiple fault-proof redundancies) while continuing to leverage their expertise in energy grids and digital asset monetization, they could become uniquely attractive long-term investments, bridging two of this century's fastest-growing industries. Many miners are leaning toward the complementary strategies presented by Bitcoin & AI/HPC. In its May 2024 update, Iris Energy noted that cloud services help optimize capital costs and diversify revenue streams, smoothing returns through Bitcoin’s cycle. In the same month, Terawulf ( WULF ) outlined models for cloud services, customer colocations, and built-to-suit data centers to optimize land, power, and capital for long-term value creation. Further underscoring the opportunity, in June, the early-stage technology private equity firm Coatue invested $150M through a convertible note into Hut 8 to build next-generation AI infrastructure. As of August 12th, WULF (+58%) and CORZ (+176%) are the two best-performing bitcoin miners YTD, while IREN (+5%) has also outperformed despite a recent power-trading loss, vs. the MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index +2.8%. We hope investors don’t overlook another stakeholder taking part in bitcoin miners’ growth trend: electric grid operators. Bitcoin miners are attractive to grids like The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) because they have scalable, high-quality energy. Unlike other large power buyers, bitcoin miners can curtail consumption during peak demand, smoothing and lowering electrical costs across the grid. Exemplifying this practice, Riot ( RIOT ) earned $71.2M in power credits from ERCOT in 2023, generating over 25% of its revenue. While Bitcoin’s unique role as such a dispatchable energy resource or “economic battery” has been recognized as a driver of “green” energy investment for some time, we believe that miners’ more recent integration of AI/HPC further accentuates this dynamic, adding a new layer of versatility and value. While the miner AI/HPC trend is nascent, it represents a significant merger of two high-growth tech sectors, creating a fascinating game theory dynamic. As some miners go offline to run GPUs, Bitcoin’s difficulty algorithm will automatically adjust, allowing the remaining miners to gain a slightly larger market share. Consequently, unless the US aggressively builds more electricity-generating capacity, it may lose its share in not one but multiple new digital industries. As the synergies between bitcoin mining, AI/HPC, and electrical grids continue maturing - ideally in an energy-abundant, technologically progressive regulatory environment - we believe the miners in the MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index, collectively, should be able to easily double their market capitalization by 2028, even assuming no growth in bitcoin profits.

Even though XRP has not been able to witness a massive surge since its rally to its current all-time high in 2017, these analysts are confident that a similar move could take place in the ongoing bull cycle. Is XRP On The Brink Of Hitting A New All-Time High? In an audacious prediction, well-known crypto expert and trader, Xaif, delving into the current price action of XRP, has claimed that the crypto asset is preparing for a possible significant breakout, suggesting renewed strength for a major rally ahead. Xaif made the bold prediction after citing a bullish Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the altcoin‘s chart in the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Cross $250? Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,000% Breakout Specifically, this pattern develops when an ascending line connecting the lows and a descending line connecting the highs converge. Also, they suggest a consolidation phase before a potential breakout on the upside or the downside. However, in this scenario, the crypto expert has identified an impending massive breakout for XRP on the upside, indicating a possible strong move for the digital asset in the upcoming days. Analyzing the magnitude of the breakout, Xaif has set his next price target for XRP at the pivotal $150 level in the next 6 months. Xaif’s prediction appears to have caused quite a frenzy in the community as crypto enthusiasts express their strong displeasure with the analyst’s bold forecast. Despite the nature of crypto assets to undergo wild price swings, these enthusiasts have criticized the analyst for his claims believed to impact the community negatively. While the community has slammed his projection, Xaif remains firm, noting that the token is a real-life utility and that the possibility of XRP handling transactions globally will catalyze this massive rally to the $150 threshold and even higher. However, Xaif, in another post, highlighted that XRP is stabilizing with a rising trendline between the $0,5650 support range and the $0.6450 resistance level. Meanwhile, a decline below $0.5650 or the trendline may indicate a negative trend, while a breakout above $0.6450 would suggest a bullish move. The Altcoin Needs To Break Through Key Resistance Levels Whether a move to the $150 level looms, XRP is poised for a bullish breakout. Another crypto analyst, Fiatleak, has forecasted a breakout for altcoin in the short term. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Rally 10,400% To $60, Here’s When According to Fiatleak, the altcoin has been displaying strong signs of an upsurge for the past 2 days, due to growing market optimism and recent encouraging developments in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) legal battle with financial behemoth, Ripple. During the period, the analyst stated that the token has been fluctuating between $0.57 and $0.65, and other experts believe that if XRP can overcome significant resistance levels, it may soar to new all-time highs.

32592803,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636575,1724088514,Bitcoin Price Action Watch: 3 Pivotal Zones That Could Sway BTC’s Next Move,"As the Bitcoin price consolidates below the $60,000 threshold, the market has been characterized by a mix of indicators and technical levels, leading to a divided forecast and heightened uncertainty. Mixed Signals Cloud Bitcoin Price Trajectory According to Bitcoin maximalist Mark Cullen, the current Bitcoin price action presents a complex technical picture. He suggests that the $57.5,000 level will likely be tested, and the key question is whether it will hold. Cullen believes it will, at least initially, before potentially breaking lower. He also highlights the importance of the $59,500 level, stating that if Bitcoin can push through, it would be a strong signal to heavily long the asset with a tight stop-loss below. Related Reading: MATIC Price (Polygon) Sets Sights Higher: Can It Gain Bullish Momentum? However, Cullen also warns of the potential for a sweep of the liquidity below the $54,500 level, which could pave the way for a move to new lows in the $40,000 range if that level is breached. Crypto analyst Axel Adler also points to a similar picture, highlighting that as the Bitcoin price currently trades below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), this could lead to further bearish continuation for BTC. According to Adler’s analysis, the next support level is the 365-day SMA at $50,000. What Do BTC’s On-Chain Fundamentals Say? Compounding the technical uncertainty, the data intelligence platform Glassnode has reported that Swissblock’s Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) moved from positive to neutral territory last week. According to the platform’s co-founders Yan Alleman and Jan Happel, this shift reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Black Monday event and the post-Consumer Price Index (CPI) bull trap felt on the chain. The BFI, composed of two sub-metrics measuring network liquidity and network growth, has recently shown a bifurcation. While network liquidity has dropped into neutral territory, network growth has risen, painting a complex picture of Bitcoin’s fundamental outlook. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Breakout: Will It Trigger A Strong Rally? Alleman and Happel note that the drop in network liquidity, while concerning the short term, is not necessarily a bearish signal in the long run. They explain that increased network liquidity is desirable, as it enhances Bitcoin’s functionality as a medium of exchange. However, the rise in network growth is seen as a strong bullish sign, indicating that more players interact with the Bitcoin network on an entity-adjusted basis. This effectively creates a deeper pool of crypto-native capital, which could support the asset’s long-term valuation. The Glassnode co-founders stated: Given the current store-of-value ‘digital gold’ narrative and the increased ease of getting BTC exposure via ETFs, CEXes, etc., rising network growth is a strong bullish sign. When writing, the Bitcoin price is $58,680, down over 2% in the last 24 hours.

42390569,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3nDJ,1724085202,Why DePIN Is Taking Off Now,"The first wave of DePIN initiatives, around 2019, focused on digital infrastructure, but now we're seeing other types of networks emerging (DePIN stands for decentralized physical infrastructure networks). Projects centered on data or service networks are becoming more common. Ultimately, I classify DePINs as those that 1) use blockchain-based, decentralized coordination to operate infrastructure and 2) rely on or impact physical infrastructure like servers, sensors, or property.  Before moving on to the drivers, we need to understand that DePIN projects are almost always made up of two-sided marketplaces. These marketplaces have a demand and supply side.  Demand Side. The side where users look for services or products to address a specific problem or need, which can be met by a service or dApps.  Supply Side. The side of the market where the decentralized infrastructure, including nodes, hardware, sensors and more, are hosted through the front-end of projects or dApps.  So, what is happening on both sides of these marketplaces?  Supply side  Making it easier to supply DePIN allows for better, more diverse supply, which fits closer to the diverse demand side.  I see two main drivers behind the supply side coming online:  Cost curves coming down  Utility token design improving  Cost Curves  Historically, hosting infrastructure required upfront capital that only large centralized entities had access to. With cost curves coming down, it’s feasible for almost anyone to become an infra provider.  Recent studies suggest that memory costs have dropped 100x over the past two decades, and compute (GPU) costs have decreased by 100-300x. Although demand for these resources is growing (and there’s even a shortage), the entry barriers for hosting significant compute or memory have drastically lowered. The capital required to build infrastructure is shrinking, enabling more people to participate, run nodes, and make the network more robust without key points of failure.  Utility Tokens  The design of utility tokens has long been seen as a dark art. Over the past years, know-how has been improving rapidly to deliver more robust token models.  DePIN networks often rely on utility tokens due to their network effect, as these tokens align incentives among stakeholders with different economic interests. Sound token design is critical for creating the right game theory and incentivizing behaviors that support the network, rewarding contributions appropriately. Utility tokens also help kickstart the initial network effect, and more token engineers are now using scenario analysis and statistics during design. This should lead to more robust designs capable of withstanding time and market volatility.  Demand Side  Historically, DePIN projects have been demand-constrained, meaning that services and applications were live but saw low take rates for a variety of reasons. Increasing demand finally makes DePIN businesses viable, kickstarting the flywheel of improvements.  I see three main drivers behind the demand side coming online:  Usability of DePIN is improving  Privacy & security is becoming more of a concern  Data generation is exploding.  Usability  Let’s be honest: Many Web3 apps today are unusable to anyone who hasn’t spent significant time in crypto. Account abstraction and AI-enabled UX should solve this.  2024 is the year when account abstraction (which hides from users some of the technical wiring of blockchain transactions) picked up across Web3. The realization that the current Web3 user experience may not be compelling enough to persuade mainstream users to transition from Web2 has recently generated a lot of attention. Today, there are a large number of companies focusing on UX and account abstraction. At the same time, we’re seeing ERC-4337, the 2023 Ethereum upgrade focused on exactly this, really finding adoption with a wide range of projects, including DePIN.  Meanwhile, AI has been experiencing a renaissance since the launch of GPT nearly two years ago, with models improving and integration evolving rapidly. AI assistants, now being developed on blockchain, are set to simplify application use, reducing the need for human-friendly front-ends.  Privacy & Security  Concerns around data protection are proving beneficial for the adoption of DePIN, which foundationally improves this due to its decentralized nature.  While the privacy paradox is a well-documented reality, since the diffusion of AI across society, users are increasingly concerned. Particularly around data management, privacy and security are a growing concern. We see evidence that users are increasingly looking for alternative solutions that prioritize the protection of personal information. DePIN, with its decentralized approach, inherently enhances privacy and security, making it a more attractive option for individuals and businesses. The increasing sensitivity around this topic after decades of apathy creates a nice tailwind for DePIN.  Data generation  It’s estimated that around 350 million terabytes of data are created EVERY DAY. Humanity is generating an unprecedented amount of data that needs to be stored in memory and processed with computers, something DePINs are pretty good at…  We are creating more data than ever before. It is estimated that 90% of all data today has been generated in the past two years. With Gen AI, data has genuinely become the oil of the 21 century, so we need to make sure we store it well. Previously, many companies and individuals were agnostic whether it was stored in bare metal servers or the cloud; now there’s more of a decision process regarding data storage. With DePIN maturing, it’s finding itself more and more a viable alternative to the more established options for storage and handling of data.  What’s next  DePIN has a lot going for it, which explains the excitement among users, investors, and the entire community. I firmly believe that DePIN will soon redefine how economically important infrastructure is organized in society, positioning itself at least on par with traditional infrastructure.

42390585,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3oSF,1724083219,"Harris Leads Trump on Polymarket as DNC Begins, but They Got Tied Earlier Amid Volatility","This week in prediction markets:  Trump-Harris makes for a volatile market  RFK is seen dropping out by November, but probably won't endorse Trump  China's ""bitcoin ban"" is more complicated than Justin Sun thinks  Bettors trade volatile election markets  This past weekend was an active one for Polymarket traders betting on the 2024 U.S. presidential election. They pushed down shares representing Kamala Harris' chances of winning the election by nearly 8 percentage points, leading to a brief tie between herself and Donald Trump, before she regained a 4-point lead (as of Monday morning U.S. time).  One theory on Trump's buoyancy despite polls shifting toward Harris is some traders are sticking with outdated assumptions from when President Joe Biden was still the expected Democratic nominee instead of Harris.  On a recent episode of the political betting podcast Star Spangled Gamblers, one of the guests, a political gambler known as Gaeten Dugas, argued that the market wasn't correctly pricing in Trump's chances after Biden quit and needed to adjust.  ""A Trump win was pretty well priced in with Biden being the candidate,"" he said. ""Once I had convinced myself it was going to be [candidate] Kamala, then I thought that I was basically buying the no's at the highest price that they would be for Trump.""  It's important to note that Polymarket, which officially bans U.S. residents from using the platform, began the election with a significant premium for Trump, and it's tempting to dismiss its accuracy because of the embargo on Americans – the actual voters – as market participants.  Another prediction market, PredictIt, which has U.S. regulators' blessing to operate, currently gives Harris a more significant edge against Trump.     And, to be sure, prediction markets aren't perfect. PredictIt gave Hillary Clinton an 82% chance of beating Trump (she didn't) in 2016 – in line with New York Times models – and priced in only a 16% chance that Brexit would happen (it did) as polls closed in the U.K.  For now, Harris seems to have the lead in the race. RealClearPolling gives her a 1.4-percentage-point lead over Trump, while Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin model gives Harris a 2.5-percentage-point advantage. Whether that means PredictIt or Polymarket are more fairly priced is an open question.  With the Democratic National Convention taking place this week in Chicago – the event where Harris will officially become the party's candidate – this could be a busy week for punters on prediction markets. And with leverage also coming soon to these markets, even more volatility may loom.  Prediction markets show end to RFK Jr.'s campaign  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign has struggled to regain its momentum after getting close to 12% in the polls in February, with numbers now languishing around 8% to 9%.  Prediction market bettors are more sour on RFK Jr. than pollsters: one Polymarket contract that asks bettors to predict his share of the popular vote is giving a 50% chance that he takes less than 1% of the overall vote, and only a 7% chance that he'll be able to match what the polls currently give him.  Bettors are also putting their money on him dropping out before November, with a 56% chance of that happening.  Conservative commentator and former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly put it frankly on a recent show, calling the RFK Jr. campaign ""done"".  “I told you from the very beginning that this was going nowhere,” O’Reilly recently said on his No Spin News podcast. “I told you, this was never going to work.”  This drop-out will likely not mean an endorsement of Donald Trump, despite a friendly call (which was later leaked by Kennedy's camp) in July after the assassination attempt on Trump. Recently, reports emerged that Kennedy attempted to meet with Kamala Harris to discuss a potential role in her administration, but he later stated he has ""no plans to endorse"" her and intends, he says, to ""defeat"" her instead.  Bettors are putting the chances of a Trump endorsement at 35%, which shows a fair amount of doubt that relations between the two candidates will improve.  China's relationship with bitcoin is complicated  Tron's Justin Sun recently posted on X: ""China unbans crypto. What's the best meme for this?"" which, in turn, fueled headlines like ""Justin Sun’s Cryptic Post Sparks Crypto Community Speculation of China Lifting Bitcoin Ban"" and ""Justin Sun Sparks Rumours of China Lifting its Ban on Crypto.""  Bettors on Polymarket are writing the prospect off almost entirely, giving it a 10% chance of happening before the end of the year.  The question of whether bitcoin is banned in China is a complicated one, and there's no absolute answer.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this year, while China has imposed significant restrictions on crypto activities, a court in Fujian province and a Chinese law firm have noted that certain actions, like holding and peer-to-peer trading, are not explicitly banned, highlighting legal gray areas that allow for continued crypto use.  Beijing just doesn't want to normalize crypto trading in-country because it poses a threat to its strict capital controls, which are designed to regulate the flow of money in and out of the country to prevent currency flight and maintain the stability of the yuan.  This is also why mainland China traders aren't allowed to touch Hong Kong's crypto ETFs, which have unique in-kind redemption models.  Until there are significant monetary policy changes in China, crypto can't have a foothold.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/19/harris-leads-trump-on-polymarket-as-dnc-begins-but-they-got-tied-earlier-amid-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed79cae67da67c8b3ab43bc064f63d1f6e4e1fdb-5467x3075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Australians lost A$1.3 billion ($870 million) to investment scams last year, ASIC said.  Crypto scams can take a number of formats, including those that take customers' money on the pretense of investing in cryptocurrencies without doing so. Also included in the ASIC sweep were phishing websites, which harvest personal data, and those claiming to use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate outsize returns.  ""Innovative technology developments may improve how we live and work, however they also provide new opportunities for scammers to exploit,"" said Sarah Court, the organization's deputy chair. ""Every day an average of 20 investment scam websites are taken down.

32589951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636545,1724082061,Dogecoin (DOGE) vs Mpeppe (MPEPE): Why Market Experts Are More Excited At MPEPE Then DOGE,"The spotlight often shifts from one promising project to another. Currently, market experts are buzzing with enthusiasm for Mpeppe (MPEPE), overshadowing even the iconic Dogecoin (DOGE). Here’s a detailed look into why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the spotlight and why experts are more excited about its potential. The Rise of Dogecoin (DOGE): A Memecoin Icon Dogecoin (DOGE) began as a joke, inspired by the popular Doge meme. Despite its humble beginnings, it has grown into a significant player in the crypto world, thanks to its vibrant community and high-profile endorsements. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s success story is a testament to the power of meme culture in driving cryptocurrency adoption. However, as the market matures, new contenders are emerging, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to capitalize on this shift. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender with a Fresh Perspective Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn’t just another memecoin; it represents a significant evolution in the space. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which is primarily driven by its meme appeal and community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) features into its tokenomics. This combination of meme culture with DeFi functionalities is setting Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart and capturing the attention of market experts. The DeFi Edge: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Strategic Advantage One of the key reasons market experts are excited about Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its incorporation of DeFi elements. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just about being a meme token; it’s about leveraging decentralized finance to offer real utility. By adopting features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance mechanisms, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating a robust ecosystem that provides tangible value to its users. These DeFi features are designed to enhance the token’s utility and growth potential, setting it apart from Dogecoin (DOGE), which lacks these integrated functionalities. How DeFi Integration Elevates Mpeppe (MPEPE) Over Dogecoin (DOGE) The integration of DeFi protocols into Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s tokenomics adds a layer of sophistication and functionality that Dogecoin (DOGE) does not offer. Yield farming and liquidity mining create opportunities for users to earn rewards and participate in the ecosystem’s growth, while decentralized governance allows for community-driven decision-making. This focus on utility and engagement is making Mpeppe (MPEPE) a more compelling investment option compared to Dogecoin (DOGE)’s more straightforward approach. Community and Innovation: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Unique Selling Points While Dogecoin (DOGE) is celebrated for its strong community and viral success, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is combining community enthusiasm with innovative blockchain technology. Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to build a global community around its token, fostering creativity and positive change while leveraging the benefits of DeFi. This dual approach of combining community spirit with technological advancement is what sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart and fuels the excitement among market experts. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE) – A New Era of Memecoin Innovation Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a groundbreaking project that blends the excitement of meme culture with the power of decentralized finance. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a notable player in the space, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach and DeFi integration are making it a more attractive option for market experts and investors alike. As we move into a new era of memecoin innovation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to lead the charge, offering a glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency investment.

Despite some positive inflows into newer Ethereum ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, older products like Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) have faced substantial outflows , exacerbated by aggressive selling from major market makers like Jump Trading. This has led to a 40 percent decline in Ether’s price as of early August, with the ETH/BTC ratio hitting its lowest level in over 1,200 days. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have shown resilience , with consistent inflows and a more stable price performance. The market’s confidence in Bitcoin, despite challenges like supply overhang, remains strong. Bitcoin is still on track to follow previous halving year trajectories and we expect an extremely bullish Q4 . Based on historical data, either the Q3 low may be in or we have one last leg lower to find the bottom for Bitcoin. As Ethereum ETFs grapple with mixed performance and high outflows, the coming months will be crucial in determining their ability to recover and attract sustained investor interest. Key factors such as the broader macroeconomic environment and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts will significantly influence future ETF flows and market dynamics for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Macroeconomic data from the past week shows that in July, the US economic landscape showed signs of moderation in inflation , as consumer prices increased at a more subdued pace, indicating that inflationary pressures are gradually easing. For the first time in nearly three and a half years, the annual inflation rate dipped below three percent, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve may consider reducing interest rates in the near future. Complementing this trend, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for July rose by just 0.1 percent, down from 0.2 percent in June, suggesting that lower production costs are contributing to the overall cooling of inflation. Despite these positive developments, US retail sales surged in July, marking their most significant acceleration since early 2023. This reflects the resilience of consumer spending, which remains robust even in the face of persistent challenges such as high prices and borrowing costs. However, not all sectors of the economy are faring well. The US housing market continues to struggle , with single-family home construction falling to a 16-month low in July. This decline can be attributed to factors such as the impact of Hurricane Beryl, an increase in the supply of new homes, and the burden of high mortgage rates and rising property prices. Despite these setbacks, consumer sentiment has shown signs of improvement , with the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers recording its first increase in five months. This boost in confidence is largely driven by more optimistic expectations for the future, even as concerns about the current state of the economy persist. In crypto news last week, we saw the US government transferring 10,000 seized BTC , worth around $600 million, from the Silk Road case to Coinbase Prime, possibly for custody purposes. This move aligns with the Department of Justice’s partnership with Coinbase Prime to manage large digital assets. US government wallets now hold approximately $12 billion in Bitcoin. On the corporate front, Tether has leveraged its growing profits to challenge tech giants by investing in AI and technology startups through its new venture arm, Tether Evo . With $118.5 billion Tether tokens in reserve, Tether’s profits have soared, allowing the company to diversify beyond its stablecoin, USDt, into cutting-edge areas like neural implant technology and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, in the UAE, a landmark decision by the Dubai Court of First Instance has validated cryptocurrency payments for salaries under employment contracts. This ruling represents a significant shift in the UAE’s legal stance on digital currencies and further supports Dubai’s ambitions to solidify its position as a global crypto hub.

The BET service will allow traders to bet on binary outcomes (Will Trump win the election? Will Harris win the popular vote?) using cryptocurrencies, much like Polymarket has done atop Ethereum and Polygon.  Drift's rendition, though, will be more ingrained in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Users can also hedge their event-based forecasts with structured trades on the price action of various cryptos.  Prediction markets are proving to be a breakout crypto use case this election cycle, with pundits in the mainstream media often citing Polymarket-derived statistics in their reporting.

32587485,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636526,1724076744,Shiba Inu Investors Are on Their Toes as New Memecoin Steals The Show,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long been a staple in the meme-driven cryptocurrency space, captivating the imaginations of investors with its playful branding and potential for high returns. However, a new memecoin is quickly emerging, grabbing the spotlight and causing Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors to take notice. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin; it is positioning itself as a serious contender by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities, offering a broader range of financial services and transactions within the crypto ecosystem. This innovative approach has the SHIB community on high alert as they watch this new player shake up the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Memecoin with a Strong Community Shiba Inu (SHIB) has built a strong and passionate community since its inception, often being dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer” due to its rapid rise in popularity and value. With a robust ecosystem that includes its own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), Shiba Inu (SHIB) has established itself as more than just a joke coin. It has become a symbol of the potential for meme-inspired cryptocurrencies to achieve mainstream success. However, with the entrance of Mpeppe (MPEPE), even the most loyal Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are beginning to explore new opportunities. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a powerful force in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique value proposition is drawing interest from those who are keen to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies. MPEPE: The New Memecoin Turning Heads with DeFi Integration Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin hoping to ride the coattails of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Instead, it is carving out its own niche by integrating DeFi protocols, offering a level of functionality that goes beyond what traditional memecoins provide. By facilitating financial services and transactions within DeFi, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is adding a new layer of value to the meme-driven crypto space. For Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents an intriguing opportunity. While SHIB has established its own ecosystem, the addition of DeFi elements in Mpeppe (MPEPE) could potentially offer more diverse use cases, making it an appealing option for those looking to diversify their holdings. The ability to participate in yield farming, liquidity mining, and other DeFi activities through a memecoin like Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a game-changer, creating a new dynamic within the crypto market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Investors Weighing Their Options Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are at a crossroads as Mpeppe (MPEPE) gains traction. The integration of DeFi into MPEPE’s ecosystem enhances its functionality and positions it as a leader in the next generation of memecoins.

Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star with DeFi Integration Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining attention for its innovative approach to combining meme culture with decentralized finance (DeFi).

Yet, as the crypto landscape evolves, many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are finding themselves intrigued by a new player in the market: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE), a cryptocurrency that blends the fervor of sports fandom, the potential of blockchain technology, and the cultural impact of memes, is drawing attention. But what exactly is pulling Dogecoin (DOGE) holders toward this rising star? The Shared Culture of Meme Coins: DOGE and MPEPE Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) share a common foundation in meme culture, a unique characteristic that binds their communities together. Dogecoin (DOGE), famously inspired by the Shiba Inu meme, broke the mold of what a cryptocurrency could be fun, approachable, and community-driven. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into meme culture, but with a twist; it merges this with the world of soccer fandom, creating a powerful cultural blend that resonates with Dogecoin (DOGE) holders. For many Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts, the appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its ability to capture the spirit of memes while pushing the boundaries of what meme coins can represent. Mpeppe (MPEPE) doesn’t just ride on the meme wave; it adds layers of cultural significance by intertwining sports, a universally beloved activity, with blockchain innovation. This fusion of memes, sports, and technology presents a fresh and exciting narrative that aligns closely with the ethos of Dogecoin (DOGE). Community-Driven Wealth Creation: A Familiar Concept for DOGE Holders Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been known for its strong, supportive community that plays a significant role in its success. From grassroots campaigns to charitable endeavors, the DOGE community has shown that the power of collective action can lead to real-world impact. Mpeppe (MPEPE) mirrors this concept by focusing on community wealth creation, but with a twist that’s particularly appealing to DOGE holders. Mpeppe (MPEPE) envisions a world where soccer fans and cryptocurrency enthusiasts unite to create a new form of community-driven wealth. The token doesn’t just represent an investment; it embodies a movement where fans can engage with the sport they love while participating in the financial upside. For DOGE holders, who understand the value of a strong community backing a coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a similar sense of belonging and the potential for collective financial growth. This shared value of community wealth creation is a compelling reason why many in the DOGE community are gravitating towards Mpeppe (MPEPE). The Fusion of Sports Passion and Blockchain: A New Frontier for DOGE Enthusiasts Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been about breaking new ground, from its origins as a joke to becoming a widely accepted digital currency. Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues this tradition of innovation by merging the worlds of sports and blockchain, creating a new frontier that’s capturing the imagination of DOGE holders. Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a transformative approach to how fans interact with their favorite sports. By leveraging blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) allows soccer enthusiasts to not only support their teams but also be part of a broader community that has a tangible stake in the sport’s future. This innovative use of blockchain to enhance fan engagement and create new opportunities for interaction is a natural extension of the adventurous spirit that characterizes the Dogecoin (DOGE) community. For DOGE holders, the opportunity to be part of this cutting-edge movement—where their love for sports can intersect with their passion for cryptocurrency is a thrilling proposition. It’s not just about holding a coin; it’s about being part of a revolution that could redefine how sports fandom and cryptocurrency coexist. Conclusion: MPEPE—A Natural Next Step for DOGE Holders In summary, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a movement that embodies the fusion of sports passion, blockchain innovation, and the transformative power of meme culture.

42417412,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLld,1724072972,"Coin Center Wins Right to Sue U.S. Treasury, IRS Again Over Controversial Tax Reporting Rule","Crypto think tank Coin Center got the go-ahead from a U.S. court of appeals to re-try its lawsuit against the Treasury Department and the IRS.  Coin Center sued them in 2022 over a controversial amendment to the U.S. tax code that would require people to disclose certain crypto transactions – and personal details of the participants in those transactions – to the IRS.  The think tank has argued that the amendment is unconstitutional and is evidence of ""overbearing surveillance"" of crypto users.  Crypto think tank Coin Center will get another shot at suing the U.S. Treasury Department over what it says is an “unconstitutional” amendment to the tax code that would require Americans to disclose the details of certain crypto transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  On Aug. 9, Circuit Judge Karen Nelson Moore of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned an earlier decision by a U.S. District Court Judge – Judge Karen Caldwell of the Eastern District of Kentucky – to dismiss Coin Center’s lawsuit. Caldwell agreed to dismiss the case on issues of subject matter jurisdiction last July, ruling that her court did not have the authority to decide on the issues brought forth by Coin Center’s case because they were not yet “ripe” – a legal term meaning that a plaintiff has not satisfactorily argued that real harm has occurred, only that it could hypothetically happen in the future.  The amendment to section 6050I of the U.S. code, which was enshrined in the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed in 2021, would legally require crypto users exchanging digital assets worth more than $10,000 to collect and share personal information – including their real names, Social Security numbers and home addresses – with both each other and the authorities.  The amendment sparked a public outcry from many in the crypto industry, who saw the requirement as being antithetical to the ethos of crypto, where many users are pseudonymous, as well as a violation of their privacy and a potential government overreach.  Coin Center filed suit against the Treasury Department and the IRS in June 2022, arguing that the amendment represented “overbearing surveillance” that would infringe on numerous constitutional rights, including the First Amendment right to expression and associational privacy.  The Circuit Court's Moore ruled that some of Coin Center’s privacy concerns were not yet ripe, writing “We cannot invalidate 6050I based on scenarios that may never come to pass. Nor do we have authority to opine generally on its constitutionality.”  But she found that Coin Center did, in fact, have three claims – on Fourth Amendment, First Amendment, and enumerated powers (essentially, a question about the government’s authority as granted by Congress) – that were “ripe” enough to try in court.  “Plaintiffs’ enumerated-powers claim is clearly ripe,” Moore wrote in her judgment. “The enumerated-powers claim presents an exceedingly simple, pure legal issue: either Congress exceeded the powers given to it by the Constitution or it did not … [I]t was ripe the moment Congress passed the law.”  Moore’s partial reversal of Caldwell’s ruling means that the suit has been remanded back down to a lower court for fresh proceedings “consistent with [her] opinion.”  Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s director of research, celebrated the legal victory in a Monday blog post, writing:  “The privacy of those associations, the names and personal information of Americans who support our mission through donations is our constitutional right, and we’re excited to move forward defending that right on the merits.”  Neither the Treasury nor the IRS responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/19/coin-center-wins-right-to-sue-us-treasury-irs-again-over-controversial-tax-reporting-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b01fa7d1aabc4a63a8d308e8e72719dfa540699-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We just have to plan to regulate"" crypto ""in such a way that it is not injurious to the economic development of Nigeria,"" a report cited a senior official as saying.  Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) plans to present a bill for taxing the crypto industry for approval by parliament by September, news outlet Punch Nigeria reported on Saturday.  Zacch Adedeji, executive chairman of the tax collection agency, revealed the plan at a meeting with the National Assembly's Senate and House Committee on Finances.  ""The plan first is to have the law that regulates it, and that is why you see that we are here with the legislature, which will be the base of charging,"" Adedeji said.  Some authorities have claimed crypto was in part responsible for the country's currency, the naira, sinking against the dollar for more than a year. Central bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso also alleged that crypto exchange Binance allowed $26 billion of funds to leave the country untraceably last year, hitting tax revenues and triggering a series of events that led to the arrest of Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan.  Adedeji said that other places in the world were legislating to tax too.  ""... so you just have to get ready for it because you can’t go away from it. So we just have to plan to regulate it in such a way that it is not injurious to the economic development of Nigeria,"" he said, according to the report.

42417427,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLz3,1724069893,First Mover Americas: XRP Outperforms as Digital Assets Start Week in the Red,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,875 −2.0%  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,088 −2.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,576 −2.6%  S&P 500: 5,554.25 +0.2%  Gold: $2,526 +1.1%  Nikkei 225: 37,388.62 −1.77%  Top Stories  Crypto majors started the week in the red, with bitcoin dropping around 3% in 24 hours to $58,000 and change. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), fell 2.2%. ETH and SOL were around 2.5% and 2% lower respectively. One asset bucking the trend is XRP, which rallied 3% to just under $0.59 following the apparent conclusion of the nearly-four-year-old case between Ripple and the SEC. Ripple was ordered to pay $125 million for violating federal securities laws over the sale of XRP to institutional clients. That was a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC sought.  TON, the digital asset associated with Telegram, outperformed the broader market, rising nearly 3% to $6.75. The gain followed HashKey announcing a partnership with TON, in which it will offer regulatory guidance and collaborate on initiatives such as popular GameFi project Catizen, a Telegram-based gaming platform with multiple cat-themed mini games. ""[We'll] focus on the TON ecosystem to offer unique Web3 gaming experiences, fostering the prosperity and development of the TON ecosystem,"" Ben El-Baz, managing director of HashKey Global, said in an e-mail. ""Leveraging Telegram’s advantage to attract more developers represents a significant opportunity for TON.""  Donald Trump's election chances are not the dominant driver of bitcoin's price, contrary to the popular narrative, data show. Prime broker FalconX's analysis of the three-day change in BTC's price and the three-day change in Polymarket odds of Trump winning the presidential election between June 1 and Aug. 15 shows a lack of definitive trend or clear correlation between the two variables. “One reason for these weaker-than-expected relationships could be the many crosscurrents influencing prices, such as the path of monetary policy in the U.S., concerns around upcoming supply overhangs, and others, as we highlighted before,"" David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said in an email to CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows ""non-commercial"" or speculative positions in the Japanese yen.  Speculators have flipped bullish on the yen for the first time in over three years.  Yen strength is a classic ""risk-off"" reaction. Thus, expectations for yen strength raise a red flag for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Analyst Bets On 80% Odds","Ethereum might be on the verge of a major breakout, with predictions suggesting it might reach $3,000 next month. According to CoinCheckup, a popular crypto market prediction platform, Ethereum should rise by 51% in the next three months. With such a positive forecast, the current decline in the price of Ethereum could very well be a short-term hiccup against the looming rally. Related Reading: Helium Rockets Up 18% As Investors Weigh In New Developments – Details Short-Term Analysis And Market Indicators A crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has been following Ethereum’s recent performance and believes it may soon reverse into an upward trend. Poppe shed light on the fact that ETH had been trading 6.14% below the estimated price for the next month. Despite this, he feels there is an 80% chance ETH will surge above $3,000 in September. He likens the current market to past cycles, recalling the last time the altcoin saw a protracted loss was before the bear market in 2018. There’s only one occasion where $ETH has been making more than three monthly candles in red. It was the start of the bear market in 2018. I think that the chance of $ETH being above $3,000 in September is larger than 80%. pic.twitter.com/deUgSGfqkR — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 17, 2024 ETH found support close to $2,500 on weekly charts, a level usually seen before big recoveries. Another measure supporting the chances of price reversal lies with the stochastic RSI, now in oversold territory. If ETH could manage to clear itself of the $3,000 resistance and at least show some decent improvements in its demand trends, the rally would then be imminent. Demand Trends And Investor Sentiment Though the indicators are pretty promising technically, not everything is rainbow-colored with respect to Ethereum. The biggest altcoin has undergone a downtrend in demand, which the declining weekly RSI reflects. For Poppe’s projection to materialize, this downtrend needs to be negated. However, there will also be the uplifting signs. US investors are showing increased interest in ETH, highlighted by the positive Coinbase Premium Index. Even futures markets speculators are optimistic, with the Taker Buyer Sell Ratio indicating that there is more buying than selling. This sentiment of traders does tell the fact that the market’s mood is such that it will help Ether go up. Ethereum: Long-Term Growth Projections Looking beyond short-term moves, however, CoinCheckup predictions are overwhelmingly positive for Ethereum in the long term. It has forecasted the cryptocurrency will rise by 120% in the next six months and by 145% in the next year. That essentially means the current dip in price could just be a blip before Ethereum rallies significantly. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Skyrocketing Potential: Could SHIB Surge 500%? These independent forecasts now blend to show the big potential of Ethereum. It will be a good opportunity for investors to increase their positions in ETH if the present market conditions play out in accordance with the given predictions. The current Ethereum price levels, backed by these technical indicators and optimistic investor sentiment, do have the potential to push above $3,000. Of course, improving trends in demand and network activity will be hurdles to climb. However, the long-term outlook for this cryptocurrency is very promising. Investors should keep themselves updated and watch for signs that may confirm the predicted rally.

42417413,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLjZ,1724065037,What a Dubai Court Ordering a Company to Pay Its Employee in Crypto Means,"A recent court order in Dubai appears to have legitimized salary payment using crypto, but some experts point to unanswered questions.  It is unclear whether the ruling will be appealed.  A Dubai court ordered a company to compensate a worker through a cryptocurrency token, as stipulated in the employment contract, a legal precedent that raises several questions even as it lends some legitimization to crypto in the region.  The ruling does not, however, necessarily mean crypto is legalized for salary payments in general, two Dubai-based lawyers told CoinDesk.  ""The ruling merely recognises a specific Virtual Asset (EcoWatt Tokens) as being a legally valid part of a specific employee’s compensation package, indirectly implying that employee compensation packages may include Virtual Assets,"" said Ankita Dhawan, a senior associate at Métis Institute, a dispute resolution think tank. ""The ruling does not clarify which Virtual Assets. Would an approval from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority be required?""  The order by Dubai's court of first instance is dated July 17. Under Dubai labor laws there is a 15-day appeal period. Given the private nature of legal proceedings in Dubai, neither the name of the plaintiff nor the company were revealed and it's not clear if an appeal has been lodged.  The complainant alleged the company stopped paying their salary without reason for five months before terminating the contract. The court ordered the employer to pay 62,867 dirhams ($17,116) and 39,200 of the ecowatt (EWT) cryptocurrency, as unpaid dues. The token's value on different price-tracking websites varies widely, making it difficult to value the payment in dollar terms.  The court's decision ""supports the payment of salaries in cryptocurrencies, provided both parties agree to this arrangement in the employment contract,"" said Navandeep Matta, a senior associate at Kochhar & Co. Legal Consultants.  This could mean that there are chances other sectors start offering salaries with Virtual Assets as a component,"" said Dhawan.  Still, the lawyers said the ruling may be specific to this case and cryptocurrency, begging more questions.  Matta said ""As of now, the application of these regulations is limited to the Emirate of Dubai"" and not in the six other emirates of the United Arab Emirates.

42417416,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLkb,1724057955,"Attention Bitcoin Traders, the Japanese Yen Is Strengthening Again","The FX market shows a renewed bias for anti-risk Japanese yen.  A similar yen outperformance early this month, triggered carry unwind and rocked risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Some observers fear another round of carry unwind in the near future.  The Japanese yen (JPY) is rallying against the U.S. dollar (USD), outperforming other fiat currencies in a redux of early August market action that was characterized by sharp losses in global stock markets and bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Since late Thursday, the yen has strengthened 2.4% to 145 per dollar, aborting a weakening bounce from the Aug. 5 low of 141.68 in a sign of renewed bias for the ""anti-risk"" currency. Against the Australian dollar, a barometer of risk appetite, the yen has strengthened over 1%. It's showing even greater vitality against the euro and British pound.  The activity in the foreign exchange market is reminiscent of the yen's outperformance at the end of July and early this month that catalyzed the unwinding of carry trades, or bullish risk-on bets, financed by relatively cheap yen-denominated loans as it became more expensive to borrow the Japanese currency.  The resulting lowering of risk exposure in traditional markets also weighed on bitcoin and the wider crypto market. BTC fell from roughly $70,000 to $50,000 in the eight days to Aug. 5 before recovering to $60,000 alongside a bounce in the USD/JPY.  ""Yen strength is causing a negative feedback loop as stops get triggered and overstretched carry positions get unwound. This is rattling positioning in global risk assets,"" famous trader Simon Ree said on X at the time.  In his latest commentary, Andrei Kazantsev, the head of Goldman Sachs' crypto-linked trading desk, echoed Ree's comments, explaining how bitcoin and ether were caught in the yen carry trade unwind and the global VAR shock of Aug. 5. VAR, or value at risk, is the maximum amount of loss a market can sustain over a period of time. A sudden jump forces traders to scale back exposure to relatively risky assets.  Thus, the renewed yen strength warrants attention from crypto traders. According to ING, the yen's rally to 141.68 per dollar from 161 in the three weeks to Aug. 5 has set the tone for yen buying on dips.  ""A 20-big figure drop in USD/JPY we believe will have a meaningful impact on expectations for future direction and therefore potentially on behavior,' ING said in a note to clients on Aug. 16. ""Behavioral changes likely mean a greater willingness to buy yen at weaker levels, skewing the risk to a strengthening bias.""  Some observers, however, say that the carry trade unwind could resume in the coming weeks spurred by the U.S. economy and the next interest-rate decision meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), scheduled for mid-September.  ""The FFFs [Fed funds futures] currently predict a 50% chance of a 50-bps hike in September; however, we expect these odds to decrease as we approach the FOMC meeting due to generally acceptable economic data. Should the Fed cut by 50 bps, however, we think the market’s reaction will be positive initially, but a sell-off could ensue as concerns about the economy and strength in the Yen will revive the carry trade unwinds,"" Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions, said in an email.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/19/attention-bitcoin-traders-the-japanese-yen-is-strengthening-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d2924ddb6292f101f9d21615be226f8463ac415-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5640 level. The next major support is at $0.5620.

Javon Marks, one popular social media member in the crypto-verse, has taken to X, formerly known as Twitter, with some very bullish comments that SHIB is on the brink of a major breakout. Related Reading: AAVE Soars 18% Amidst Adverse Market Conditions – Details According to Marks, a serious price pattern has been forming that suggests SHIB could be getting ready for an explosive move higher. At the same time, though, another analyst, Alan Santana, suggests this current market phase is not going to rally but gives way as an opportunity for long-term accumulation only. The Falling Wedge Pattern Marks is optimistic due to the formation of what is known as a Falling Wedge pattern, which usually forms as a bullish reversal. This wedge has been emerging for many months, and SHIB is now reaching the point where a breakout could occur. $SHIB (Shiba Inu)’s ≈6X: Prices of Shiba are currently nearing the converging or breakout point of a massive Falling Wedge pattern on the daily (1d Chart) and with a recent confirmation of a Regular Bullish Divergence, this can be pointing to a bullish breakout! This can spark… pic.twitter.com/sAUSyrH4q0 — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 17, 2024 Marks said that the narrowing price action inside the wedge indicates a big price shift might be due. Should SHIB break out, Marks assigns a target price of $0.000081, which would be an incredible 498% higher from current levels. Rising Investor Interest In Shiba Inu Currently, SHIB stands at a price that is close to $0.000013, which signals that it is worth over 1% more in the last day. The insignificance of this price jump may serve as a rebounding sign for SHIB, which jumps to 25% from the lows of $0.000010 not too long ago. But not everyone is swayed that SHIB will experience such drastic moves in the short run. For example, Alan Santana, a respected crypto analyst, is a bit more level-headed. ✴️ Shiba Inu Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy Please, let me start by saying that the all-time high potential is based on the current price. Since Shiba Inu can move lower within the “accumulation zone,” by the end of the upcoming bull-market total growth… pic.twitter.com/fLdTbOGQvm — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 17, 2024 Santana holds his opinion that SHIB is within an active correction phase, which is likely to further slash its price before any substantial gains can be accrued. A sideways move and consolidation period shall be the best move for long-term investors in this case. Related Reading: Helium Rockets Up 18% As Investors Weigh In New Developments – Details Accumulation Zone And Long-Term Strategy Santana noted that the prevailing range is an accumulation zone—where patient investors are able to build their SHIB positions at lower levels before the token is reclaimed at parity. He sees SHIB rising by a factor of around 20 to 25 times from its current price by the peak of the next bull run in much the same way. According to him, this would only happen after 2025.

42417424,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLuv,1724052897,Shaquille O'Neal Will Have to Defend Some of the Allegations Against Him in the Astrals NFT Lawsuit,"Shaquille O'Neal will have to defend himself against some of the allegations in a class action lawsuit against him concerning the promotions he did for the Astrals NFT project.  The court did dismiss the allegation that O'Neal was a ""control person,"" meaning someone who exercised actual power.  A U.S. court has granted one part and dismissed another part of a class action lawsuit against legendary basketball player Shaquille O'Neal for his role in the NFT project Astrals, according to court documents filed on Friday.  Astrals was a project involving a collection of 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 3D avatars and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for ""incubating innovative projects."" Astral NFTs could be used as virtual avatars and the Galaxy token was the governance token of the DAO.  The case alleged that O'Neal acted as the face of Astrals urging investors to ""[h]op on the wave before its too late."" Even when cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, O'Neal sent out a graphics interchange format (GIF) on the community message board Discord, from The Wolf of Wall Street that read, ""I'm not F***ing Leaving,"" the court document said. The lawsuit alleged that O'Neal fled the project after that and ""the value of Astrals financial products plummeted.""  The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, dismissed the allegation that O'Neal was a ""control person,"" meaning someone who exercised actual power or control.  However, the court found that O'Neal's involvement in the project falls under the definition of a ""seller"" because he successfully solicited the purchase of the products, despite O'Neals argument that he was not an officer or director of the company.  The court did not dismiss the allegation that Astrals sold tokens which were unregistered ""securities.""  The attorney for the investors in the lawsuit, Adam Moskowitz, who also represents investors in the FTX, Voyager and Binance lawsuits, suggested that this ruling could bring clarity in other pending crypto class action litigations.  “We are extremely fortunate that District Judge Moreno authored the first extensive ruling on cryptocurrency and celebrity promotions ... bringing clarity and understanding in all of the other crypto class actions litigation, many are pending in this District.  O'Neal and the Astral project are supposed to reply to the allegations by September 12, 2024.  CoinDesk has been unable to reach O’Neal for comment.

BTC is now moving lower and might test the $57,650 support zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $60,000 resistance zone. The price is trading below $58,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $59,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might attempt a fresh increase if it stays above the $57,650 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price struggled to settle above the $60,000 resistance zone. BTC formed a top near the $60,200 level before the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $58,500 support zone. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $56,117 swing low to the $60,210 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $59,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair retested the $58,000 support zone. Bitcoin price is now trading below $59,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. However, the price is still above the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $56,117 swing low to the $60,210 high. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $58,800 level. The first key resistance is near the $59,500 level. A clear move above the $59,500 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $60,000. A close above the $60,000 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $61,500 resistance. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $58,800 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $58,000 level. The first major support is $57,650. The next support is now near the $57,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $55,500 support zone or even $55,000 in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.

42417432,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYM29,1724047801,"Trump's Election Odds Are Not The Dominant Driver of Bitcoin's Price, Data Show","Comparison of three-day changes in BTC's price and Republican election odds between June 1 and Aug. 15 show lack of definitive correlation between the two variables.  A lot could change in the coming weeks, according to FalconX.  While the popular narrative suggests a strong positive link between bitcoin's {{BTC}} recent price performance and Republican candidate Donald Trump's victory odds in the U.S. presidency rate, market data suggests otherwise.  Since Trump's mid-June meeting with bitcoin miners, crypto market experts have consistently associated the Republican candidate's performance on betting markets with bitcoin's price. The narrative strengthened after Trump survived an assassination attempt in July and as BTC came under pressure early this month amid Democrat candidate Kamala Harris' resurgence in betting markets.  However, prime broker FalconX's analysis of the three-day change in BTC's price and the three-day change in Polymarket odds of Trump winning the presidential election between June 1 and Aug. 15 shows a lack of definitive trend or clear correlation between the two variables.  The X-axis shows the three-day percentage increase or decrease in BTC's price between June 1 and Aug. 15. The Y-axis represents the increase/decrease in the odds of a Republican victory. Data has been sampled every 12 hours.  The red dots represent the period between June 29 and July 29 when Trump's probability of entering the White House surged on Polymarket. The blue dots represent the so-called Democrat momentum period. The grey dots represent the rest of the period between June 1 and Aug. 15.  The red dots show a scattered pattern, implying no connection between shifts in Republican odds and changes in BTC's price. The blue and grey dots show a similar pattern.  “Interestingly, there has not been a noticeable relationship between election odds and BTC prices throughout the entire analysis period from June 1 to August 15, 2024. One reason for these weaker-than-expected relationships could be the many crosscurrents influencing prices, such as the path of monetary policy in the U.S., concerns around upcoming supply overhangs, and others, as we highlighted before,"" David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said in an email to CoinDesk.  Some of the crosscurrents, like aggressive selling by The German state of Saxony and fears of supply deluge from defunct exchange Mt. Gox's creditors, have reportedly capped the upside in BTC since June, overshadowing shifts in the Republican odds.  Still, with Harris now catching up on crypto, the impending election could become a dominant driver of BTC prices.  ""Of course, a lot can change before November 5. As we get closer to election day, it’ll be fascinating to see if prediction market data reveals election news as a key driver—or even the dominant force—behind price action,"" Lawant noted.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/19/trumps-election-odds-are-not-the-dominant-driver-of-bitcoins-price-data-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38eb9d9690d69d229fe86adec13e20fd0984c3b3-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
