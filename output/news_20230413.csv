But its riches are alive – and available to be claimed by ROOK token holders for the next 90 days.  The former governance token has become a ticket to redeem around $25 million of the treasury that once belonged to Rook DAO, the defunct governing body whose members now run a new entity that only exists to liquidate the cash.  Incubator DAO, the new entity, is being run by activist investors who once bristled at Rook Labs' perceived slights and demanded they return value to token holders. Rook Labs, the builders of Rook's MEV technology and de facto operators of the project, ultimately obliged. They cut a deal that divorced ROOK, the token from Rook the project, by effectively buying out token holders' governing rights for around 60% of the treasury.  ""This has been a dynamic, collaborative process, designed to accommodate the community’s wishes for the ROOK token and the new Incubator DAO."" Rook Labs' pseudonymous CEO Hazard told CoinDesk in a Discord message. ""We’re grateful for the enthusiastic participation of ROOK holders and community members, and are happy to see the token holders of Incubator DAO exercising their new autonomy. From here, Rook Labs will move forward with our objective of building innovative MEV infrastructure, operating within the bounds of real-world legal and regulatory frameworks and business imperatives.""  Wismerhill, the Carl Icahn wannabe who leads the activist wing and now Incubator DAO, told CoinDesk he was glad all sides reached an amicable agreement.  ""This is the greatest outcome everyone could expect: token-holders can unlock their ownership of the treasury, and the Rook Labs team gets to continue working on exciting projects without the burden of a worthless governance token.""  ROOK holders who redeem their tokens through the smart contract get a pro rata share of USDC, plus a pROOK token. At the end of 90 days, the remaining USDC will be split among pROOK token holders, Wismerhill said.",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/13/rook-investors-begin-swapping-tokens-for-25m-crypto-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb70fb0a5a96033e994120e4c51ddbde71d6d806-483x272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412291,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4WU6,1681427815,Ether’s Post-Shanghai Rally Knocks Bitcoin Dominance From 21-Month High,"Ether’s (ETH) fresh rally above $2,000 after the successful Shanghai upgrade late Wednesday dropped bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance from an almost two-year record high, according to TradingView data.  BTC’s dominance rate rose to as high as 49.06% early Wednesday, according to TradingView data, before retreating to 48.12% as ETH’s price rose. The last time the metric was around the 49% level happened in July 2021, some 21 months ago, TradingView shows.  ETH dominance, on the other hand, surged to 19.87% on Thursday, marking a one-month high.  The BTC dominance rate is the BTC market capitalization’s share of the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market. The metric is important to assess the relative strength of BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, compared to the broader crypto market, or identify periods when altcoins outperform, also known as an altcoin season. Ether dominance similarly shows the second largest cryptocurrency’s relative value to the crypto market.  Ether’s improved performance has reduced bitcoin’s share of the crypto market. The shift has come after the Ethereum network’s long-awaited tech upgrade, called Shanghai or Shapella, was deployed without a hitch late Wednesday.  The upgrade enabled the withdrawal of more than 17.4 million of staked tokens, worth some $35 billion, from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain for the first time since its launch in December 2020. Its successful deployment eliminated a slight but concerning f risk that ETH investors might not be able to reclaim their tokens locked up in staking contracts..  ETH rose as high as $2,023 on Thursday, gaining 5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, leading the upswing of the broader crypto prices.  BTC, which also reacted positively to the upgrade, is only up 1.5% through the day, lagging behind altcoins.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/13/ethers-post-shanghai-rally-knocks-bitcoin-dominance-from-21-month-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3baaad1a58f3756e02ae4b4cd0ec502bf0b84a61-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is supported by previous BTC cycles as well as Elliott Wave Theory. Furthermore, this view can be supported by liquidity dynamics and macroeconomic factors. Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has made a convincing argument over the past few months that a cycle low could be in. However, history shows that we could get a very aggressive pull-back before the Halving takes place. This view is also reinforced by both technical analysis and macroeconomic analysis of liquidity and the business cycle. A Mirror Image of 2019? Let's begin with a trip down memory lane. This is how Bitcoin behaved leading up to the last halving, which took place on May 11th, 2020. BTC Previous Cycle Price Action (Author's work) As we can see, Bitcoin bottomed at around $3500 just before the start of 2019. The world's first cryptocurrency then rallied 346% over the next 192 days. Following this, we could characterize the next 260 days as a market correction, with Bitcoin losing 72.83% of its value. This movement was accelerated by the Covid crisis, but from an Elliott Wave perspective, it fits in perfectly as a I-II set-up, which was then followed by an aggressive wave III to the upside. Here's the Bitcoin chart now and what the next few months could look like if we assumed a similar behavior: Bitcoin Price Forecast (Author's work) The next halving should happen around April/May 2024. BTC has already nearly doubled since it hit a bottom over 140 days ago. Therefore, BTC could continue to rally over the next almost two months, probably targeting somewhere around the $40K-$50K area. This target was reached using Fibonacci extensions which I have discussed more in-depth with my subscribers. History would tell us that BTC could reach a top by the end of May and then begin a correction that, once again, using Fibonacci ratios, I believe, could take us back into the $22K area by January 2024. This would follow a similar time frame as in the past cycle, but the price swings are a bit less aggressive, which makes sense if we think about how Bitcoin's volatility has diminished with every cycle. Once again, this move would fit in well with my EW count, which would have us completing a wave 1 and 2 in what would be the larger wave V to the upside. By itself, this is just a neat little comparison, but I believe this can be supported strongly by macroeconomic fundamentals. Liquidity Seems to Agree Liquidity is a determining factor in market movements, and this is especially true of Bitcoin, which is perhaps one of the best liquidity proxies out there. US Liquidity can be calculated by taking the balance held at the Fed, subtracting the use of the Reverse Repo facility, the Treasury General Account and, as of recently, adding up Fed remittances, which is interest the Fed pays to the Treasury. From a US perspective, there are a couple of factors that could drain liquidity. First off, as we enter tax season, the TGA will be replenished, which is equivalent to liquidity being sucked out of the market. This was very eloquently explained by fellow SA contributor Pragmatic Value Investing in this recent article. He estimated that $398 billion in liquidity could be trapped in the next few months. Another bug drain of liquidity could be the unwinding of the recent loans that the Fed provided to distressed banks. Below we can see Fed assets over the last few months. Fed Assets (St. Louis Fed) A lot of noise was made, myself included, about how the Fed loans had undone months' worth of QT, but we can see how this has quickly reversed in the last few weeks. The fact of the matter is that QT is still in effect, and the economy is still digesting rate hikes from the last few months. In terms of global liquidity, things could be a bit better, but it's quite uncertain at the moment how some of the major Central Banks will act in the coming months. The Bank of Japan just changed governors and the Yield Curve Control policy, which has been instrumental in adding liquidity over the past few years, is being put into question. China has been quite accommodative in its monetary policy, and with low inflation numbers , this could continue, but the country also has to worry about the value of the Yuan, especially as more countries begin to use it in trade. All in all, expectations are that liquidity could come down over the summer months, and markets could be dragged down with it. Recession is Coming And the other big issue we are facing, of course, is the impending recession, which could come as soon as the end of the year. This is clear if we look at leading indicators. Below we can see the rate of change of M2, and the spread between the US10Y note and the Fed Funds rate. M2 Rate of Change (Swissblock Insights) Yield Curve (Swissblock Insights) The collapse in M2 and the inversion of the yield curve are warning signs that a recession is coming. In recent weeks, we have got more concrete evidence of recession. with coincident indicators such as the non-farm payrolls taking a turn for the worse: Non-Farm Payroll (TradingView) It looks like a deflationary recession could be coming soon, and this would drag down markets for sure. Bitcoin could actually hold up a bit better, but I'd still expect it to perform poorly. Takeaway It's quite simple, really. With the recent inflation data, the stage is set for a Fed pause. A rate pause is bullish for assets, and it's these expectations that are fueling the current rally. However, a recession will drag markets down with it, and based on history, it will only be after the Fed begins to cut that a solid bottom will be formed. The question is, how far can markets rally before the recession hits? My guess is we can go a bit higher, but we are entering the danger zone. I believe the next few weeks could be a good time to take some profits.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594001-bitcoin-highway-to-danger-zone?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11728111.jpeg

42410993,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvIQX,1681423371,"Ether Price Swings Upward After Ethereum Upgrade, but What About the Future?","Shapella’s arrival as the final leg in the Ethereum network’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus answered the question of whether the event would be bearish for ether (ETH) with an emphatic NO.  Ether was recently trading over $2,000, up nearly 6% and its highest level since August.  “Shapella,” represents the upgrade that occurred on both Ethereum’s execution (Shanghai) and consensus (Capella) layers, ultimately allowing stakers of ETH to withdraw their staked deposits.  The question for many investors was whether Shapella would lead to a rush from or to the Ethereum network, with bulls and bears standing on opposite sides of a double swinging door.  The bulls had the upper hand on Thursday because the prospect of additional liquidity while earning staking rewards trumped the desire to take immediate profits and run. Approximately 18.3 million ETH representing $36 billion, or 15% of ether’s total market capitalization, is currently staked.  Approximately 1.1 million in ETH rewards have accrued, which could represent an active amount that investors would be motivated to un-stake with the profits either sold or re-staked.  The former would lead to a price drop, while the latter would likely be supportive. Thus far, net deposits over the last 24 hours have declined by 79,000 ETH, with new ETH deposits outpacing the 172K ETH withdrawn. Additionally, 68,000 in partial withdrawals have occurred, approximately 6% of eligible rewards.  ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI),a measure of price momentum, has risen to 69, its highest level since January.  Not surprisingly, the ETH/BTC rose on Thursday, as ether was up 3% versus 0.17% for bitcoin.  Investors may want to continue to watch the direction of ETH deposits. Since January 2021 the trajectory of ether deposited into ETH staking contracts has steadily risen, a direction that suggests the asset is gaining, not losing, favor.  Over the upcoming weeks and months, this metric will likely flatten as investors who must un-stake ETH begin the process of doing so. But for those who want to stake, Shapella’s completion signals reduced risk, increased liquidity and and uptick in asset value.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/13/ether-price-swings-upward-after-ethereum-upgrade-but-what-about-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86281c81deff4b789f06e29272ce2575bf604ffa-4160x2690.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bidding for ""Glitch: Beyond Binary"" will open on April 19 at 2 p.m. ET and will feature 34 lots of non-fungible tokens (NFT) from different artists involved in the ""glitch art"" movement. This type of art practice uses digital or analog errors to achieve disruption to a piece of art in the form of a ""glitch.""  ""An MP3 might skip or crackle, a preview window might briefly show shards instead of an image and a website might hiccup on load and scramble its contents. While these occurrences are rarely anticipated and usually unwelcome, glitch artists may in fact intentionally provoke them,"" Sotheby's explains, noting that artists in this genre have often used glitches as forms of ""political and identity expression.""  Notably, the community of artists that engage in glitch art ""do not just identify as male or female but consist of people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation and background,"" Sotheby's adds. Artists participating in the upcoming auction include XCOPY, neurocolor, Jake Osmun and more.  The diversity of glitch art is an important component of its popularity. Last month, Sotheby's quickly paused its ""Glitch-ism” auction after several artists pointed out that no women were featured on its roster.  Sotheby's intends to right the wrongs of its previous sale, enlisting Dina Chang and Dawnia Darkstone, aka Letsglitchit, to co-curate the expanded group of artists for the upcoming launch.  “In co-curating Glitch: Beyond Binary, I aspired to present an eclectic ensemble of exceptional artists, each with their distinct vision and approach to the realm of glitch art,"" said Darkstone. ""My selection process was driven by a desire to reveal the multifaceted nature of this genre, emphasizing the intricate links between digital experimentation, philosophical exploration, and the depth of human existence. Each artist's work serves as a visual enigma, urging viewers to examine and challenge the conventions that dictate our lives and our comprehension of art itself.”  The auction house has continued its expansion into digital art through its Sotheby's Metaverse platform. In February, it offered the original manuscript for “Snow Crash,” Neal Stephenson's 1992 science fiction novel that introduced the concept of ""the metaverse.""

42411180,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQuA,1681419707,A ‘Super App’ May Be Web3’s Super Power,"Twitter version (v)2, the so-called “super app,” is … never going to happen. But by putting a dogecoin avatar on the Twitter website, Elon Musk at least made a feint in the right direction.  The idea of a super app is more vapor than reality. Failed attempts have been many. Partial examples exist in Southeast Asia and in Apple’s App Store on the iPhone – but the only fully fledged “app for everything” is WeChat, and its circumstances as one of the most popular apps in China are unique.  Galen Moore is the content lead at Axelar, which is building interoperable Web3 infrastructure.  To build Twitter into anything like WeChat, Musk would have to rebuild Twitter – and essentially every service that’s been built on the internet since 2004 because Big Tech's ""walled gardens"" do not always communicate.  The only way to actually build a super app is with decentralized applications, also known as dapps. These open-source applications are open in a way that not only frees computer code but frees entire networks of internet participants.  In short, developers on the decentralized Web benefit not only from composable software functions, i.e., blocks of code that are easy to integrate into other open-source projects, but also composable network effects. That is the aggregate value that participants add to a network, which can be snapped in like a Lego piece.  Network effects and moats  Network effects are the heart of many of the most valuable technology businesses in the world: Facebook, Google and Apple at the top; Airbnb, PayPal and Uber a tier or two below, but similarly impressive. The line between these successes and the many technology mediocrities is often drawn between those that have network effects and those that do not.  It’s easy to see why the “network-effect moat” is a pitch-deck staple. With network effects, the greater the effect, the wider the moat. Juggernaut companies of the U.S. consumer web have gotten very good at this kind of logic, and they have no incentive to lower the drawbridge for the likes of Twitter – or nearly anyone else.  Nearly, because there is one notable exception – the marriage of convenience between Apple and Google that puts Google search all over Apple devices. Apple is the largest producer of consumer tech hardware; Google is perhaps the single most important consumer web company. This relationship, which regulators have targeted, is worth billions to both companies.  See also: Axelar and Polygon Supernets Team Up to Provide Cross-Chain Functionality  The exception that is Apple and Google proves the rule: No super apps can form in this mercantilist internet economy where companies hoard networks like colonial powers hoarded precious metals.  Regulatory pressure and trust  In a hearing before Congress last month, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, ""It is our commitment to this committee and all our users that we will keep [TikTok] free from any manipulation by any government.” Imagine how much easier Chew's job would be, if he could cryptographically prove it.  The U.S. Justice Department is intensifying antitrust enforcement against both Apple and Google, distinct from its action against the two companies’ long-standing partnership on search. Imagine the Capitol Hill hearings in an unlikely scenario where – through acquisition or sheer ingenuity – one Silicon Valley giant did develop a super app capable of spanning multiple verticals.  WeChat, meanwhile, is in a different kind of hot seat – connected closely to the government in Beijing and used by it for censorship and surveillance, not to mention public service announcements. It’s ubiquitous and, to its users, essential: Being banned from WeChat is sometimes compared to being cut off from a public utility.  The building blocks of Web3 open-source code that together create something greater than the sum of its parts.  Without the help of a strong state it’s hard to imagine any application wielding that kind of power – or the leverage required to compel super-app integration. And users who love privacy and freedom of expression would be right to question the trust assumptions that come with such a public-private information partnership.  Composable network effects  The decentralized Web (Web3) is something different: it’s permissionless. If one project provides an app store, and another provides search, a third developer can integrate their functions into a new app without negotiating or asking permission at all. One person’s finished product is another’s Lego brick; the potential combinations are not constrained by moats or regulators.  Examples of this abound. Ethereum has built infrastructure that supports this kind of composability among Ethereum dapps. Ethereum dapps can tap into Uniswap’s contracts for liquidity or call Aragon’s contracts for on-chain governance. No negotiation is required.  Not surprisingly, dapps are also composing functions into unified offerings in the Cosmos ecosystem. Osmosis, for example, has made it straightforward for other dapps to tap into its on-chain markets, much as dapps use Uniswap on Ethereum.  We’re now beginning to see dapps that compose functions across multiple ecosystems. Squid is an example: Built on Axelar, Squid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that taps into liquidity on other DEXs on many chains in order to facilitate cross-chain swaps.  See also: The Metaverse or Metaverses? Why We Need Interoperability (Video)  None of these applications are “super apps.” However, all of them have one thing in common: the building blocks of Web3 open-source code that together create something greater than the sum of its parts. They are composing with the network effects built by other internet applications.  This is a feature of the decentralized Web that might be called composable network effects. In today’s applications, it often takes the form of liquidity, i.e., networks of buyers and sellers. But composable network effects exist at every layer of Web3. Even something as basic as the security of Ethereum is a composable network effect, available for application-layer compositions.  This isn’t to suggest that anyone should try to build so-called super apps in Web3. It seems a little early for that. But this quality of composable network effects will continue to attract builders, and their work will eventually lead to applications that wouldn’t be possible on the internet of 2004.

The cryptocurrency underwent a major upgrade, dubbed “Shanghai,” which enabled the un-staking of ETH locked on the “Beacon Chain,” the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Related Reading: Twitter Launches eToro Integration, Opening Up Crypto Trading To Millions Unlike some expectations, the update failed to push Ethereum’s price down. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency recorded an 8-month high, climbing north of $2,000 for the first time in 2023 and potentially reaching its next resistance area. Ethereum Price Will Run Higher Or Slow Down? Traders’ Disbelief Could Fuel The Rally Recent data from research firm Santiment hints at a potential drop for Ethereum. The cryptocurrency has been on a bull run since the start of 2023, and now it’s hinting at signs of a potential drop. The research firm looked at ETH’s 30-day Market Value To Realized Value (MVRV) which stands at 9.95% after the update, as seen in the chart below. This indicator enters a danger zone when it reaches around 15% or above. In other words, Ethereum could still record some profits in the short term. Despite this possibility, Santiment warned: (…) this MVRV being well over 0 does indicate a higher risk of a drop. But it is not quite at the level where we should be extremely concerned. On the long-term side, the 365-day MVRV is +29%, which is the highest it has been since December 27, 2021. This is a larger concern, with traders really showing heavy profits and not a lot of pain that is typically needed for prices to rise. Another positive sign for ETH in the short term is the funding rates in the derivatives sector. Santiment looked at Deribit, a futures and options trading platform, and discovered negative funding rates, which points to traders having little confidence in the current rally. The chart below shows that ETH’s price correlates negatively with its funding rate. In other words, if the funding rate is negative like now, meaning traders are shorting the crypto, the price trends upwards. The research firm noted: As of now, we are actually seeing quite a bit of disbelief. Shorting is quite prevalent, and this ultimately is a good sign that there could be more liquidations to add a bit more rocket fuel for prices to rise. ETH’s Price In The Long Run NewsBTC has been covering the analysis, speculations, and market expectations around Shanghai. While the event technically allows ETH holders to inject liquidity into the market, most of these individuals are holding the cryptocurrency at a loss. Thus, ETH holders have little incentive to dump their coins for now. In addition, as the CEO of Ether Capital, Brian Mosoff, told us in an exclusive interview, the people staking Ethereum are not speculators but bullish long-term holders. Related Reading: Crypto Mogul Says This Factor Is Key For Bitcoin to Reach $40,000 On the possibility that Shanghai was going to lead ETH back to support, Mosoff said the following, emphasizing its long-term bullish case: I think that this is just noise that will go away, even if there is some short-term selling. I think very quickly the price would rebound because people are seeing the opportunity around a best-in-class smart contract platform and the ability to generate yield.

42421085,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRo5,1681417579,The Future of Web3 Animation,"When Colin Brady saw a Buzz Lightyear figure in a small toy shop in South China, he immediately knew he wanted the same for his creative visions – global dominance. Since then the veteran animator has taken his experience and expertise to AMGI Studios, where he is developing the world's first Web3 animation studio and reshaping the way we view fictional content. As AMGI's chief creative officer, his goal is simple – bring the highest quality animations to the globe.  Colin Brady is a speaker at this year's CoinDesk Consensus festival.  And this is not the first time that Brady is working on projects that have created a dent in the global markets. In fact, his portfolio includes high-grossing movies, such as ""Spiderman"", ""Green Lantern"", ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Toy Story 2"". He has also worked with many of his (and your) childhood director idols including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Ang Lee.  Now, Brady is completely focused on AMGI Studios, where he built the famous Web3 game, My Pet Hooligan. For him Web3 offers the liberty to shape his projects unlike ever before.  ""In Web3, we have the freedom to choose what kind of story we are telling and what kind of animations we could create. And the animation that we create doesn't just get viewed. It gets viewed millions and millions of times if it's a successful game.""  Brady's success can be tied to his never-stop-growing attitude. In fact, he is a technology nerd who believes that adapting to new innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the best ways to save days of work and move towards more productivity.  ""My friends often say that AI is going to take our jobs aways. But at AMGI we are embracing it. We are already using it to code in the Unreal Engine. It's saving us days of work.""  As AMGI continues to announce exciting projects, including a live animation non-fungible token (NFT) line, we sat down with Colin Brady to uncover how to survive (and thrive) in the ever-changing world of technology.  This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  You've had such a successful career in the mainstream entertainment industry. Why did you decide to move to Web3?  That's an excellent question. I mean, what's interesting is that there's so much freedom in Web3. This is the first project I've ever been on in my entire career where we don't have to answer to anybody. And we've attracted some really great talent from Pixar and DreamWorks animators. I think they would say the same thing that, sure, as an animator you can aspire to work on a top Disney film, but perhaps if you're lucky you'll animate two or three shots in that film and then it’s gone.  In Web3 we have the freedom to choose what kind of story we are telling and what kind of animations we could create. And the animation that we create doesn't just get viewed, it gets viewed millions and millions of times if it's a successful game.  So I think the freedom in storytelling, character design, animation, it almost feels like the quality has finally caught up to feature films using the Unreal Engine and using a lot of this technology that I kind of see them as the same thing. Ultimately we are telling a story. And we're creating a global brand.  I was looking at your AMGI presentation on Cartoon Brew, and you mention studios are resistant to use new technologies. Why do you think that is happening?  When any studio gets too large, there's always going to be a risk of resistance. For example, if there was a construction company with hundreds of employees building a bridge and someone said, ""I can do this same job with only 10 employees,"" there would be natural resistance from those hundreds of employees.  So I think some of that is just simply with the resistance of large studios. But because AMGI Studios is so small, we could change and adapt very quickly. In fact, when we founded the studio almost four years ago we decided to use the Unreal Engine as the main render engine. And when we would give presentations to some large studios, they would say, “This is so cool! Why aren't we doing this?” And often I would say, “I think it's because you're too big.” And it really is true.  Interesting. If that’s the case, how will you handle this problem once AMGI Studios becomes big?  I mean, that's such a great question. I think you have to have small team pods that are always encouraged to innovate and to not be caught up into a larger structure. Even now in our studio with 60 people there's a handful of employees that we simply say follow the new stuff. Like if Epic Software released a new tool yesterday, we need to be experts on it today.  We always need a kind of an innovation arm and a technology arm that's just free to innovate. And one secret we have is that we macromanage, not micromanage. Meaning, we hire good people and we let them kind of do their own thing. I know it sounds very strange to say that. But they need to go down their own rabbit hole of interest in technology as far as they can.  I always tell people every person has a superpower and the only crime in our studio is to either be lazy or a jerk. Everything else in between is fair game.  Fair enough. You know, I recently saw a guy recreated Pong entirely using ChatGPT-4. How long before AI takes over coding? And have you ever used AI to code?  We're doing it right now. I mean, I love AI. You know, I have friends that are, like, “Oh, did you see this thing is going to be taking jobs. Are you worried about this?” We are completely embracing it. I'm a huge fan of technology. One of our top coders Kevin Mac, he's our [chief technology officer], uses AI (Chat GPT) probably almost every day to code in the Unreal Engine. It’s often saving us days of work. So we are big fans of AI.  Who was the Metazucbot in your journey? Although I am not sure about this reference, haha.  I think the whole Metazucbot could be a metaphor for anything that's trying to control us and manipulate us. Even with our social media algorithm, where we get bombarded with ads for products we briefly searched, I think we want to fight back and take the creator role each person is meant to have.  In the same way, when people say AI is terrible, our attitude is different. We are, like, let's make our own AI to fight back against anyone that's trying to control us. So let's say when you fight fire with fire, I think you could fight AI with AI. It’s similar to our game where you are being chased by zucbots (evil characters) that you can later capture and make your companions.  On that note, could you tell me more about the My Pet hooligans NFT line that can be animated live on your iPhone?  We like to think that this is the time to have the celebrity NFT [where] everyone's online personality can be animated and actually be trained to be your own personal assistant. And what's fun about My Pet Hooligan line is that they are all these kinds of cute bunnies that are also a little bit naughty, right? They have paintball guns and bloody noses. They're all battling. It's this mix of Zootopia meets Grand Theft Auto.  Once we created the My Pet Hooligan line, all of our characters shared the exact same DNA, meaning they all share the same internal structure. That’s when we thought that we should be able to have people connect their MetaMask wallet to our app and animate their own hooligan with their face. Only they will be able to animate that specific hooligan because it's gated with their MetaMask wallet. We understand that this is the era of Twitch streaming. This is the era of YouTubers. And my children would rather watch other people play video games on YouTube. And so we thought, well, actually what we've just created is the world's highest-quality Twitch streamer.  And it's not just it's not a person or it's not a realistic looking robotic version of the person. It's a cartoon character. It seems certainly when people use the app they are more free to express themselves as a cartoon character than as their actual self. It seems like everybody deep down wants to be a larger than life version of themselves.  What are some of the upcoming AMGI projects we should be excited about?  What's taken on a lot of new momentum is a My Pet Hooligan feature. And Kevin Johnson, who is one of our artists at AMGI and our head of development, he has written a script and we have a lot of great lore ties that expands the game. Not only does it involve the hooligans that are in the game but players, people in the community that have actually contributed ideas and graffiti. We are actually writing their own characters into the script.  Our goal is to absolutely make feature films. It also assures that we attract the highest-quality animators in the industry. But as you know, the money that feature films can make is dwarfed by video games. So if the video game was successful, I see a future where it's not impossible.  Sounds exciting!

42412311,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4Wj4,1681417094,Ether Jumps Above $2K a Day After Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade,"Ether (ETH) continued its recent strength Thursday afternoon, climbing above $2,000 a day after Ethereum successfully completed the long-anticipated upgrade.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at $2,015, up more than 5% over the past 24 hours.  The Shapella upgrade, also called the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork, continued the transformation of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that started in September’s Merge upgrade.  In the weeks leading to Shapella, market observers had diverged over ETH’s price reaction, with some predicting selling pressure would send the price down but others seeing little impact or even an increase in price.  Diogo Monica, president and co-founder of institutional crypto platform Anchorage Digital, told CoinDesk in an interview after the upgrade that investors would be more comfortable locking in ETH, leading to decreased supply. Monica noted that “there's liquidity on the chain directly.”  “Plus, demand is increasing with every successful upgrade that we have on the Ethereum network, which are two main reasons why the price is not going to drop massively,” he said.  Monica added that validators looking to exit the chain would have to join an exit queue, and that as a result, institutional investors would “stay on the sidelines” from staking – at least for the moment.  “How the exit queue behaves” in the next few weeks and whether “we get to a pattern of liquidity such that we can start being comfortable staking for the people that aren't staking” are questions that institutional investors currently have in mind, along with the next potential next move of EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, he added.  ETH's performance around the Shanghai fork will depend less on “technicals” and more on “what risk actually does at that time,” according to a report from Coinbase Research prior to the upgrade.  “If the trading environment sees risk assets selling off, people may decide to un-stake and sell ETH just to de-risk, while institutions may not step in as aggressively on the buy side,” analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  Elsewhere in markets  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 1.8% for the day to change hands at around $30,375 Thursday afternoon. Among institutional investors, for years the key question has been whether BTC is an uncorrelated asset, according to Mike Belshe, CEO of custody provider BitGo, in an emailed comment.  “We're now witnessing the proof that indeed, when the Federal Reserve stops manipulating markets with infinite money supply, bitcoin stands alone – uncorrelated,” Belshe wrote, adding that institutional adoption is “about to kick into high gear,” despite regulatory headwinds.  Liquid staking derivatives' token prices rose on Thursday. Lido DAO’s LDO recently spiked by over 7% in the past 24 hours to around $2.43. Rocket Pool’s RPL was up over 9% to trade at around $46.19, while Stader’s SD was up over 4% to roughly $1.33, according to CoinGecko’s data.  The Arbitrum Ethereum scaling system's ARB token has also been rallying. ARB is trading up 15% over the last 24 hours at around $1.37 – making it one of the day’s top-performing digital assets. Earlier Thursday, Uniswap announced a mobile wallet app that includes support for Arbitrum. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 3% for the day.  Equities edged up Thursday afternoon, a day after mildly promising inflation data. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq recently rose by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was recently trading up 1%. The two-year Treasury yield was flat to sit at around 3.97%. Gold rose above $2,050, inching toward its record high, as investors continued their recent penchant for assets that hold value.  The CME FedWatch tool showed that currently 66% of traders see the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates by 25-basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meeting on May 3.

The reason, Aave-Chan initiative founder and former Aave integrations lead Marc Zeller says, is because the exploiter paid back Aave users’ USDT debts as part of the flash loan heist. CoinDesk estimates they recouped over $350,000 whereas the exploiter – who repaid every USDT position on Aave version (v)1 in a flash loan – cashed out millions of dollars in stablecoins before converting to ether (ETH) and transferring funds to mixer Tornado Cash.  On April 12, the day before the exploit, 27% of the total USDT pool was loaned out, but at press time the amount of USDT borrowed on Aave’s v1 protocol now stands at $0.00. Roughly $1.31 million USDT is available for liquidity, according to the website for Aave’s v1 USDT market.  Thursday’s hack is the second time an exploit involved a positive aspect. Euler Finance, which originally suffered a $200 million hack, not only recovered the majority of the funds but opened up redemptions to let users withdraw their money.

42412300,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4Wba,1681414002,Bitcoin Miner Stocks Continue Torrid Run as $30K Level Holds,"A strong week for bitcoin miners got even stronger on Thursday, with the share price of several again posting double-digit percentage gains after bitcoin (BTC) rose more than 2% to $30,500.  Among the movers was Marathon Digital (MARA), up 14.6% for the session and now ahead nearly 50% for the week. Hut 8 Mining (HUT) is higher by 15.9% Thursday and and 37% for the week. Other Thursday movers include Stronghold Digital (SDIG), up 26%; Iris Energy (IREN), up 15%; and Bit Digital (BTBT), up 18%.  While the recent gains for the miners seem gaudy, these stocks remain sharply lower from year-ago levels as the companies contend with the combination of higher energy prices and a bitcoin price that remains more than 50% below its all-time high. Marathon Digital and Hut 8, for example, are each down about 50% year over year, and Stronghold Digital is off roughly 80%.  Helping the bullish outlook for bitcoin miners is the idea that both inflation and the jobs market are cooling, which could give room for the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause or even reverse its year-plus long string of interest rate hikes. Earlier Thursday morning, the producer price index (PPI) for March tumbled to 2.7% year over year versus February's 4.9% and against expectations for 3%. The core PPI – which strips out food and energy costs – fell to 3.4% from 4.5%.  Alongside that news, initial jobless claims for the week ending April 8 rose by 11,000 from the previous week to 239,000. That's the highest level since January 2022 and suggests the beginning of a slowdown in what had previously been a red-hot jobs market.

42421088,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRrB,1681413291,"Privacy-Preserving Payments Shouldn't Be 'Niche', Monero Contributor Justin Ehrenhofer Says","Privacy has always been an important part of the crypto industry. Bitcoin’s earliest adopters often thought of the system as truly private, digital money. It wasn’t until Mt. Gox went bust and Chainalysis was founded to investigate where all those missing coins went that the illusion of anonymous transactions on Bitcoin was shattered. This was a tough lesson for many to learn, and part of the impetus to develop different chains that put privacy first.  Monero is one of the oldest of those projects, founded in 2014, and one of the most used. Although many people still use Bitcoin for transactions they’d rather keep secret, those that are truly concerned about privacy know that a permanent, immutable and forever-traceable blockchain is not the best option. Monero keeps many of Bitcoin’s best attributes, but essentially shields the addresses. Like Bitcoin, Monero had a fair launch, and at this point is developed by a diverse community.  Justin Ehrenhofer is a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, April 26-28.  Justin Ehrenhofer, the vice president of operations at Cake Wallet, is one of the most prominent Monero backers. He found the monero cryptocurrency, XMR, after developing an interest in cryptography and online data security, while growing up gay in the not-always-friendly Midwest. He's one of the sharpest minds on Crypto Twitter regarding privacy, and is a board member for an organization that pays grants to people maintaining public payments systems.  CoinDesk caught up with Ehrenhofer ahead of Consensus, where he's scheduled to talk about policy in a post-Tornado Cash world. We cover the state of global privacy regulations, the beef between Zcash and Monero as well as the “technical debt” the latter has accrued over the years.  What are topics you think are under-covered or under-explored in crypto?  I think that there are several areas that are under-explored. The industry is massive now. People can specialize in anything from tokenomics to compliance. If you're working in a very niche field, you probably always feel like that particular thing is underreported. For instance, I tend to think privacy is often under-reported.  Did you have an “aha moment” where you realized the importance of privacy?  I arguably did. In high school I needed to use Tor in order to bypass firewall restrictions on my network about LGBT content – back then and possibly still now, a bunch of the family filters would block that type of content. That got me interested in privacy at a very early age. When I heard about Bitcoin, I just thought it would be very interesting to combine money and privacy. My first private payment was when I used cash to buy a Walmart gift card which I used to redeem for a VPN – back in 2013, or so.  That's funny. Where do you think the privacy debate is heading in 2023 – especially considering Tornado Cash?  I think each country is going to do its own different thing. Of course, the United States’ actions are going to have the most influence, but there are going to be some jurisdictions that will try to ban anything they consider to be a privacy enhancing tool completely. The international bodies that discuss anti-money laundering probably won’t oppose bans. Other jurisdictions may try to redefine what money transmission is to cover a broader scope. And there's going to be misses along the way. I hope that in the United States we continue to have very clear lines of what money transmission is so people know when they need to register and know specifically what activities apply.  See also: The Coming Privacy Wars (2022)  One thing I really hope for as well is that “regulation as enforcement” is less often done on an optics basis. Whether an asset is considered by optics to be a privacy coin or not, that's generally pretty arbitrary.  What is the role of private money? Is it always going to be a niche?  I don't want it to be a niche. I worry that if it's continuously pushed to the side that we're going to lose important parts of our identity. Most practically, I worry that less private money – something where some third party has high degrees of control over it, or some governments or regulators – will be politicalized. That’s how you end up with discrimination. There are many things under the guise of ""public safety"" – risk indicators and risk scoring that are attributed today to cryptocurrencies that label some addresses as riskier than others. When we rely on third parties to track this information and provide services it really has a high possibility of being discriminatory, whether that's intentional or not because they’re written by humans. So I do think having basic privacy protections for money is extremely important. Even those who aren't members of marginalized communities need to push for higher privacy protections by default, so everyone is better off.  Over the last decade are there design decisions that you would have made differently for Monero?  Monero as a network when it launched in 2014 was totally different from the network today. It did not hide things like amounts, and ring signatures were very poorly implemented. They initially tried to denominate amounts [being spent] and that was best described as a disaster. Privacy is a very complicated thing to do well, and it was awful. So that was learned pretty early on, to switch from that type of system. And that type of mindset has really stayed with Monero. If I was to relaunch Monero today or reboot the ethos of Monero today on a separate blockchain, it would be very convenient to get rid of a lot of the technical debt that has accrued over time. It has pretty messy code at this point. There are some efforts to rewrite portions of it in advance of the next large comprehensive change that's currently being proposed but has not yet been accepted by most people.  You hear stuff like that a lot in crypto – are there specific ways this impacts development?  Absolutely. There are many things that we learned over the years. One thing that keeps coming up is that privacy is always a battle – you always have people that are getting better and better about tracing. They will always develop new techniques to counter whatever you do to protect yourself. As this relates to data that you store on a public database and a permanent record [i.e., a blockchain], it's not going away, so your adversaries really have until the end of time in order to investigate that information. So privacy needs to keep getting better and better. The tools need to keep getting better and better. You can't just stand still because if you stand still you become obsolete. That's one of the most interesting things between the Bitcoin and Monero communities. They have many similarities, but one huge difference is that Bitcoiners generally require strong backwards compatibility properties – they want to be able to open a wallet and essentially use the same exact software that they set up 10 years ago. This certainly has some advantages, but as it relates to privacy, you kind of need to force people to keep using a better opsec.  Forcing people to use the latest reasonable privacy standard is one thing the monero community decided to do right. However, large changes aren’t considered unless they bring significant benefits. The key is being open to them.  This is probably a stupid question, but considering you made a comparison to Bitcoin: Could you explain the rivalry with [privacy system] Zcash?  Some members of the Monero community definitely dislike Zcash and vice versa. There was definitely a rivalry when Zcash first started. Members of the early Zcash community were typically from academia, so you had these academics that have really interesting cryptography that they implemented in Zcash. Arguably what Monero was offering at the time was significantly worse. If there was no “trusted setup” with Zcash and no dev tax and, you know, let's say it was a fair launch, meaning Zcash launched similarly to how Monero launched, then maybe a large portion of the Monero community actually would have switched over. You know, if there weren't those types of drawbacks.  There’s more to say but it boils down to Monero proponents think Zcash sucks at implementation, and the zcash community talks for hours about trademarks and other nonsense that shouldn't be a worry in this space. Zcash does have a sustainable way to get money from the block reward in order to continue to fund all these cool developments and things. And I would say there definitely are members of both communities who are far more interested in how both projects advance transaction privacy  Are you familiar with the idea of solarpunk – the idea that crypto transparency, or maybe data transparency generally is a better route?  I'm not familiar with that specific ideology, although I do think that maybe I'm too pessimistic at times. As it relates to transaction data, there's certainly some benefit that comes with transparency. We see that for charities that offer transparency – it can be a very good thing. But I'm just too worried about mass discrimination, and how data will be used against people.  As someone building a crypto wallet, could you give an overview of the type of advancements being made?  Yes, I work for Cake Wallet. It is an open-source and noncustodial wallet that initially launched in 2018 as a monero-only wallet for iOS. Since then, it’s added bitcoin [BTC] and litecoin [LTC] and other assets and has expanded to Android and desktop as well.  Some wallets will be tailored to specific audiences.  Custodial wallets generally prioritize user experience. They prioritize onboarding, and usually can integrate things like direct [paycheck] deposits or support a debit card. Those usually are trying to onboard less sophisticated, less technical users who often have a more investment-driven focus.  Then you have what I would say are the most common type of noncustodial wallets where you have your own access to funds and keep your keys. Even a lot of those are investment focused, so design their experience to look very similar to an exchange interface and gives easy options to buy and sell coins.  Then there are wallets that are much more specific. In Cake, we've kind of made our niche around payments. It shouldn't be surprising that monero is often used for payments rather than being held like bitcoin as an investment. We hope to keep growing this niche.  See also: Choosing Your First Crypto Wallet  Then you have other, certainly very specialized wallets like very specific Lightning wallets. They're specific in the support that they have for certain cryptocurrencies or entirely designed around certain asset classes like [non-fungible tokens].  One interesting thing is that many of these wallets are open source, and many of them have permissive licenses. So it does empower communities to start with a good design or a good existing project and run in their own direction. It also makes sure that everyone is on each other's toes and always innovating because if you're going to stagnate someone else could come around and pick up where you left off doing it better.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | XMR | ZEC,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/13/privacy-preserving-payments-shouldnt-be-niche-monero-dev-justin-ehrenhofer-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb91f522b50463896027288e6037d9a39f937ae2-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The two entities are collaborating on a merchandise collection, utilizing the intellectual property (IP) of both brands to release hoodies, T-shirts and wristbands. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Global Fund, an organization dedicated to providing resources to fight AIDS.  Peter Gould, chief communications officer at Okay Bears, said in a press release the NFT collection is emblematic of a “culture shift” in the space, utilizing NFTs to power philanthropy.  “We’re proud to collaborate with (RED) and build on our shared history of using merchandise and digital collectables to combat the most important human rights issues of our time,” said Gould.  Greg Sheps, head of business of development at (RED), said he views on-chain art as an innovative vehicle to fundraise.  “If we want to end the threat of AIDS, we must think outside the box, meet consumers where they are, and create new and exciting collaborations that generate more money and more heat to fight AIDS and the injustices that enable the pandemics to thrive,” said Sheps. “(RED) is thrilled to continue our foray into the digital art space by collaborating with Okay Bears to drive life-saving testing, treatment and care to those who need it most.”  Okay Bears has been working to expand its IP into partnerships and real-world experiences.

The integration, launched on Thursday, allows users to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and traditional stocks. Per the report, the partnership with eToro is expected to make it easier for Twitter users to access the world of finance and investing, particularly in cryptocurrencies. This move marks Twitter’s latest push into the finance industry, following the recent launch of its new “Tip Jar” feature, which allows users to send and receive tips from other platform users. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Hits $2,000 Mark Following Shanghai Upgrade Launch Crypto Goes Mainstream With Twitter And eToro Integration.

Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price experienced a significant surge of 35% on April 2nd, following a bizarre incident where Twitter used the Doge meme as their home button. This surge propelled the “meme coin” to reach the $1 mark for the first time. However, DOGE’s price quickly retreated below the $1 line and has since been trading within a newly formed range of $0.0812 to $0.0853. Following the announcement of Twitter’s integration with eToro, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a rise of over 4% in just a few hours. Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.878, representing a significant profit of over 6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming all other top 10 major cryptocurrencies in the market. If DOGE can break through the resistance level of $0.900 and establish it as a new support level, there is a possibility that DOGE’s price could surge above 10 cents. This would indicate a significant increase in value for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: This YouTuber Claims XRP Will Skyrocket Making Its Holders Rich, But How?

Ondo says its OMMF token will be pegged to US$1 and backed by money market funds that trade on traditional exchanges. Investors will be able to mint and redeem OMMF on business days and collect interest daily in the form of new OMMF tokens, according to the company’s blog post.  Read more: Ex-Goldman Sachs Traders Raise $4M for DeFi Risk Management Startup  Leading stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC currently do not pay out interest to holders, even amid a rising-rate environment, because doing so would strengthen the case that such stablecoins are unregistered securities. Ondo says that’s why the company is only targeting institutional investors designed as both accredited investors and qualified purchasers, a move that exempts Ondo from registering the product with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “There is no regulatory gray area with OMMF. We structured it as a security,” Ondo Finance founder and CEO Nathan Allman told CoinDesk in an interview. “Stablecoins were not designed to be able to pay out interest in a way that is compatible with securities laws. They’re a zero-interest rate phenomenon.”  According to the project’s website, OMMF lists an APY of 4.5%, in line with what publicly traded money market funds are currently yielding.  Stablecoins have also faced heat due to the fragility of their pegs. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST collapsed in dramatic fashion last May, and even Circle’s asset-backed stablecoin USDC depegged amid last month’s Silicon Valley Bank crisis.  Read more: USDC's Depeg Laid Bare the Risks Traditional Finance Poses to Stablecoins  “Money market funds have a constant $1 NAV [net asset value],” explained Allman. “We’re also targeting holding a few percent of the fund’s assets in stablecoins. That way, investors can get in and out.”  Allman declined to give a specific launch date for Ondo’s tokenized money market fund, saying it would go live “soon” and that the company was currently “in the process of onboarding clients.”  Simply DeFi  Security tokens like Ondo’s OMMF have seen a surge in interest as startups and institutional investors alike are exploring ways to migrate traditional financial assets on-chain through tokenization. Crypto enthusiasts say innovations like smart contracts and blockchain technology can modernize outdated financial plumbing and democratize investing, but such innovations have also faced scrutiny by critics, who say such innovations are thinly-veiled attempts at skirting securities laws.  “We designed OMMF in a way that makes it composable with on-chain infrastructure,” says Allman. “Because the token is composable with DeFi, you can lend against it permissionlessly.”  Enter Flux Finance, a decentralized finance protocol backed by Ondo that functions as a permissionless touchpoint and, crucially, makes it accessible to retail investors. Allman says one way retail investors can access OMMF’s yield without owning the security outright is by lending non-yield stablecoins like USDT and USDC into Flux, a protocol he describes as “similar to Aave and Compound” but without the overcollateralization. Then, whitelisted institutional clients can borrow the stablecoins in the Flux pool and mint OMMF, pocketing a small spread and paying out some yield to the protocol, which is passed onto retail investors.  “It’s really just DeFi,” added Allman. “This is what all of DeFi enables: the creation of financial services that are not operated by financial institutions.”  Read more: Has Tokenization’s Moment Finally Come?",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT | USDC | ONDO,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/13/ondo-finance-plans-yield-generating-stablecoin-alternative-for-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/feb179ad0e1a6e21ee515113d44f3e8f39ea5b2d-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411176,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQnY,1681406612,Bitcoin Should Be Central to Regulation of Digital Assets,"The chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), recently outlined two critical priorities for the House Republican majority’s crypto work this year – market structure and stablecoins. While McHenry’s comments about stablecoins have received most of the attention, his committee’s market structure work has the potential to allow the U.S. to seize a key advantage over its global competitors in the future of the economy.  U.S. policymakers should leverage crypto’s oldest tool and the work of a mysterious figure who just turned 48 years old. Unfortunately, Satoshi Nakamoto’s essential contribution, Bitcoin, has somehow taken a back seat in two years of crypto news focused more on Sam Bankman-Fried’s foibles and Do Kwon’s whereabouts. Yet, despite all this drama, Bitcoin endures, and 15 years after Satoshi’s seminal white paper its role in society and the implications for U.S. policy are becoming more apparent.  John Rizzo is senior vice president for Public Affairs at Clyde Group where he provides strategic counsel and communications. He most recently served as the senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury covering digital assets, fintech, climate finance, financial stability, domestic finance and economic policy.  Bitcoin is not a panacea for all that ails the economy. Also, it’s not yet a reliable medium of exchange for everyday transactions or a genuine rival to the U.S. dollar. But it has proven itself as an alternate source of value – a kind of digital gold if you will – and a tool U.S. lawmakers can seize upon as they confront an increasingly volatile and polarized world.  As the Bitcoin Policy Institute noted in a November 2022 letter to the U.S. Treasury Department, Bitcoin is “credibly neutral, widely decentralized, uncontrolled by any leadership or founding team, and optimized for resisting censorship.” For U.S. policymakers increasingly focused on rivalries with China and Russia, Bitcoin offers a real opportunity to enhance the economic freedom of residents of countries who can see their financial agency disappear if they oppose the ruling power.  Moreover, if dissidents in foreign countries can access sources of value outside the regime's control that oppresses them, then the political equation could shift. And all of a sudden democratic change in nondemocratic countries could be possible – certainly not assured, but distinctly more possible.  Read more: John Rizzo - How Industry Can Prevent the Crypto Winter From Becoming an Ice Age  There is also a more benign foreign policy benefit to Bitcoin than rivalries between countries. U.S. residents often take for granted the stability of our nation’s currency. But citizens of many other countries don’t have that luxury, and millions have learned how one’s economic circumstance can change when a national currency goes belly up. So while Bitcoin is volatile too, residents of unstable countries could use it as a preferable hedge to domestic economic risks. Holding Bitcoin is undoubtedly easier for this hypothetical resident than opening a U.S. or European bank account to store dollars or euros. Is holding bitcoin (BTC) the perfect answer? Probably not. But it can serve as an economic insurance policy against instability in countries whose economies are fragile.  Here in the U.S., crypto market structure legislation that supports Bitcoin can also positively affect American priorities beyond foreign policy. For example, while the current unemployment rate is low, bitcoin mining operations can provide jobs, particularly in rural communities left behind by economic growth over recent decades.  Of course, many point, including the Biden administration, to bitcoin mining’s impact on the environment, but the exact degree is disputed. It’s also important to note the downside for the environment is not unique to bitcoin – economic activity tends to use energy, which drives emissions and worsens climate change. There is also evidence of bitcoin mining having a beneficial impact on electric grids. There’s no reason bitcoin mining can’t be reoriented towards renewable energy. Many are moving in that direction already.  So, as lawmakers consider the crypto market structure, how can they take advantage of bitcoin’s potential? First, they should write into law the emerging consensus that bitcoin is a commodity. Second, they should set up a regime of spot market regulation overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Third, they should ensure that bitcoin mining takes place in the U.S., where the environmental impacts can be more strictly managed than in a country with little regard for the environment. Finally, they should incentivize bitcoin mining, which uses renewable energy and pays workers family-sustaining wages.  As we approach two decades since Satoshi’s landmark white paper, we still know very little about this enigmatic author’s politics or identity (although that has not stopped some from guessing). But we understand that this person (or persons) created an innovation – a technology derivative of another technology, encryption. As we’ve seen repeatedly, technology can be used for good or bad. It can create jobs or destroy them. It can harm the environment or bolster efforts to protect it. The art of sound policymaking is weighing the good and bad, risks and rewards, and putting policies that promote the common good in place.  As Congress launches into making crypto policy, here’s hoping they take advantage of this unique Bitcoin opportunity. They can even draft the legislation on a Mac, if they like.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/13/regulations-digital-assets-lawmakers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb6e44568534980d4ce230a36a9e4da22e099c12-2121x1193.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AI will “accelerate and empower even more creators,” he said.  The Sandbox, a culture and entertainment platform, is a user-generated and virtual gaming tool where users can build, own and sell their gaming experiences. The Hong Kong-based platform’s Game Client was installed over 1.3 million times last year, and has a digital presence in countries including Japan, China, Dubai and Saudi Arabia, Borget said.  AI has garnered widespread attention. Some of its use cases, including ChatGPT’s text generator, have been met with warm and not so warm reactions. In March, for example, Neal Stephenson, author of “Snow Crash,” a science-fiction classic novel where he coined the term “metaverse,” said that AI in general, and platforms like ChatGPT specifically, were not “at all interesting” to him.  Nonetheless, Borget said AI is one of the systems that could spur the growth of the metaverse. The technology removes the need to create every aspect of an environment or an avatar character, he said. AI can help “generate and populate the experiences that you create much faster,” he added.  AI can be leveraged by creators as a way to make the metaverse “more full of life, fun to play, creative and inclusive overall,” Borget said.

42411172,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQX1,1681406045,Why Didn’t You Sell the News of Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade?,"Going by the numbers, it seems like many ether (ETH) stakers have decided to hold onto their coins. Although several analysts predicted the just-completed Ethereum Shanghai hard fork (along with the separate Capella upgrade, together known as “Shapella”) would be a “sell-the-news” moment, ETH has actually climbed to eight-month highs. The second-largest crypto by market capitalization was trading above $2,000 for the first time since last summer, after gaining ~3% during trading hours in Asia.  What this says about the viability of Ethereum and the outlook for the price of ETH is an open question. Shanghai, the backwards-incompatible hard fork, unlocked the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw tokens they pledged to the Ethereum deposit contract used to validate the proof-of-stake network as well as the token payments they received for doing so. Many stakers initially pledged 32 ETH to become validators in 2020, and haven’t really had access to their coins since.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  So the 18 million-plus ETH currently staked (worth about $33 billion) has not led to a torrent of sales. Loyal CoinDesk readers likely knew the “selling pressure” on ETH was overstated. As Amphibian Capital CEO James Hodges wrote on Monday, the vast majority of ETH validators were in the red leading up to the event, making it unlikely they’d cash out at a loss. Now that crypto prices are rising, led in particular by bitcoin, which broke the important $30,000 psychological threshold this week, fortunes may reverse.  What’s most interesting for many is not how ETH tokens trade, but their synthetic counterparts known as “liquid staking derivatives.” These LSDs, as they’re often called (not to be confused with the entheogen) are essentially bearer instruments for staked ETH that allow users to trade an ETH proxy while still earning staking rewards. The biggest offerings from Lido, Rocket Pool, Frax and Stakewise all hit the market relatively recently. The question post-Shanghai is what role these assets will play.  See also: Ether Liquid Staking Platforms Will Benefit Amid SEC Action  LSDs still have tremendous value by allowing users to essentially double their holdings, for a fee. Put up ETH in a noncustodial platform and it’s still yours, along with a shiny new stETH or rETH or Coinbase’s cbETH. This makes these assets critical for creating and maintaining ETH liquidity (as well as part of the validation process). However, actual ETH has generally traded above the price of particular LSDs, in a similar way that you often see price discrepancy between a managed investment trust and its underlying assets (due to increased risk and fees).  The Shanghai update shows that Ethereum developers are continuing to successfully build out a network in real-time. Basic infrastructure is still being built on the main network, leaving opportunities for free-market alternatives to spring up in the wake. Initially allowing ETH stakers to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), the total value locked in LSDs actually surpassed decentralized lending last month. The whole pie seems to be growing, which is good news.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RPL | FORKS,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/13/why-didnt-you-sell-the-news-of-ethereums-shanghai-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae271c5bc5927c9f8845288a780db4fc45a84ae1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411178,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLR0m,1681405977,UN Cybercrime Treaty Could Lead to Sweeping Surveillance of Crypto Worldwide,"On Tuesday, the United Nations kicked off the second-to-last round of negotiations for a new international treaty on cybercrime. The latest draft includes language that, if adopted, would impose sweeping surveillance requirements on cryptocurrency and threaten financial privacy worldwide.  Article 93 of the draft treaty would require all nations that sign the treaty to implement onerous financial surveillance laws for cryptocurrency. Those financial surveillance laws would apply to any organization “engaged in activities related to the circulation of digital financial assets and digital currency,” even if they are nothing like a traditional financial institution. Like the dangerously broad Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act introduced in the U.S. Senate, this incredibly broad language could be interpreted to include software developers, custodial and self-hosted wallet providers, miners, validators, nodes, non-fungible token non-fungible token (NFT) trading platforms and even users.  Marta Belcher is the president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web, as well as general counsel and head of policy at Protocol Labs. Kurt Opsahl is the associate general counsel for cybersecurity and civil liberties policy for the Filecoin Foundation. Their views are their own.  Those organizations would be required to implement intrusive mass surveillance systems and turn over their users’ sensitive financial information to the government automatically. They would need to collect identity information for all users engaging in transactions, maintain that sensitive data so that it can be handed over to the government, monitor for “suspicious” activities and automatically report certain transactions to the government. In addition, when any person is suspected of “possible involvement” in a cybercrime, these organizations would have to give the government not only the financial records of the suspect, but also the financial records of the suspect’s “associates” and family members – a shocking overreach.  In addition, those organizations could be required to “apply enhanced scrutiny” to any individual identified by any government that is a signatory to the treaty. Because the U.N. includes states with problematic human rights records, this provision is deeply concerning because it allows countries to designate people in other jurisdictions as targets for “enhanced scrutiny” for dubious reasons.  For blockchain network participants like developers and miners, compliance is not only onerous but in many cases impossible. For example, software developers have no idea who the end-user of their software may be, and cryptocurrency miners and validators have no way of knowing the identity of the people whose transactions they are facilitating.  Read more: Marta Belcher: Reframing Privacy for the Digital Age  In addition, the draft Article 93 attempts to eliminate any “banks that have no physical presence and that are not affiliated with a regulated financial group.” While “bank” is not yet defined in the treaty, this could be interpreted to encompass some decentralized finance projects, even if they’re otherwise lawful. Nations signing the treaty would be required to prevent such “banks” from being established in their own countries.  The negotiations have been ongoing for over a year, with language expected to be finalized in the fall. More than 130 human rights organizations and academics from around the world have already raised concerns about the adequacy of the treaty’s human rights protections, and tech policy experts have questioned its effectiveness against cybercrime. While protecting against ransomware, malware, and other attacks from cybercriminals is a noble goal, laws designed to enhance police powers in the name of crime prevention can too often lead to civil liberties violations.  Many leaders from civil society are taking part in the negotiations and working to make sure that the treaty respects human rights. We urge all those participating in the negotiations to push back against Article 93’s sweeping financial surveillance requirements in order to defend financial privacy worldwide.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | FIL | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Marta Belcher, Kurt Opsahl",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/13/un-cybercrime-treaty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b43622843fa5526ea2535c3cbdb4e47e03abe758-5051x3546.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What makes the Saga different, according to Solana, is the “Solana Mobile Stack” (SMS), a lineup of custom add-ons that integrate crypto usefulness into the phone’s hardware and software. SMS has ingrained security features to provide for sending, receiving, trading and storing crypto on the device.  Saga’s secure element – the hack-resistant part of the smartphone where confidential information lives – is customized with a “seed vault” that stores a crypto user’s private keys. Keeping keys separate from the rest of the phone’s data makes them more secure, Solana says.  Saga has a custom “dapp” store that only lists crypto applications. Currently, over one dozen applications covering crypto trading, inter-wallet communications, music and digital collectibles were available for download, with more expected over time.  Solana says it won’t impose “extractive fees” on dapp store apps, a dig at the 30% tax Apple and Google charge on their respective storefronts. Its dapp store is separate from Android’s “Google Play” (also on Saga).  Phone maker names from the big – HTC – to the small – Sirin Labs have previously failed in their efforts to create a crypto-forward smartphone, setting an ominous precedent for Solana, a device built for and marketed to a single crypto ecosystem.  That ecosystem has taken a hit since June 2022, when Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko unveiled the Saga at a New York City event that headlined Sam Bankman-Fried, then the FTX exchange CEO and now an alleged crypto fraudster. Solana’s community of partisan developers and traders grew increasingly defensive even as some of Solana’s core technology repeatedly flailed.

42411170,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQQP,1681405175,New 1099-DA Reporting Creates More Headaches for Taxpayers,"The U.S. Infrastructure and Jobs Act ushered in “broker reporting” rules for centralized crypto exchanges, effectively turning digital assets into securities for purposes of the Section 6045 reporting requirement. Stock trading firms issue tax forms 1099-Bs with sales of securities and capital gains and losses, so centralized exchanges will do the same thing for crypto trades on the new Form 1099-DA. Cash App and Robinhood Crypto, for example, have already been issuing crypto trades on 1099-Bs for several years.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Tax Guide 2023. Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and author of ""The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.""  At first glance it might seem like crypto reporting by exchanges means less work for the taxpayer, but it’s the opposite. This creates a huge burden for centralized exchanges and saddles the taxpayer with a more onerous crypto tax reporting exercise. Taxpayers in other regimes that implement similar rules will suffer the same fate.  Let’s dig deeper and find out why.  The voluntary system and information reporting  The U.S. has a voluntary tax compliance system where the taxpayer is responsible for calculating and filing their own taxes. Taxpayers report two kinds of information:  Third-party reported information  Self-reported information  The Internal Revenue Service matches amounts reported by third parties to make sure they’re the same amounts reported by the taxpayer. Third-party tax forms include W-2s, 1099s, 1098s and so on. Taxpayers self-report any income, expenses or deductions not reported on third-party forms. Both of those reporting methods were completely separate until now.  Crypto tax calculations were mostly the 100% self-reported variety, but the new broker reporting rules relegate taxpayers to a combination of third-party and self-reporting, and that’s where the problem begins. Taxpayers will still manage their entire view of crypto tax calculations. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges will report their tiny view of a taxpayer’s crypto landscape, leaving the taxpayer to piece together 1099-DAs and figure out whether they’re correct.  What’s been described in these pages as “The Maddening Task of Calculating Crypto Taxes” is the first clue the new reporting rules will create more crypto tax headaches, not less. Taxpayers can easily rack up five to 10 times more wallets and exchange accounts than stock trading and bank accounts while having to untangle a web of crypto transactions contained within.  Reporting and reconciling pitfalls  Most crypto tax software providers deployed the universal cost basis feature that dumps all transactions into a single bucket for calculation purposes. Alice (not her real name!) has been in crypto for six years and accumulated seven exchange accounts and 13 wallets. The software commingles all her transactions from 2018 up to the current year and makes one calculation as if Alice was only using one wallet.  Under the new rules, Alice would receive seven 1099-DAs in addition to her own universal calculation. Alice is no longer solely responsible for her crypto tax calculations and instead has eight parties, including herself, in on the calculation exercise.  Alice has been calculating and self-reporting her crypto taxes on Form 8949 for years. She disregards the seven 1099-DAs because she’s already included all her transactions in the current Form 8949. Alice files her tax return as usual and gets flustered after receiving an IRS notice saying she underreported income. Now Alice must amend her tax return and report the information as received on the 1099-DAs.  Bob, on the other hand, has eight wallets and four exchange accounts. He reported four 1099-DAs on his tax return and deleted the transactions for those four exchanges from his crypto tax software. Bob thought this was a clever solution to avoid double-counting his exchange transactions, but he didn’t realize two of the exchanges didn’t report cost basis on 1099-DAs. As a result, he overstated his capital gains and significantly overpaid more tax than he should have.  Bob and Alice have run headfirst into some of the numerous 1099-DA pitfalls. Now they must go through a rigorous exercise to reconcile all the 1099-DAs with their own universal calculation to double-check the exchanges correctly reported information. The challenge of managing crypto taxes just got magnified. In the absence of a thorough reconciliation and cross-checking exercise, taxpayers will otherwise double count and/or omit cost basis and therefore understate or overstate tax liabilities. Let’s look at some other 1099-DA pitfalls.  Cost basis gotchas  U.S. taxpayers can use FIFO, first in first out, or specific identification for crypto cost-basis methods just like securities sales. FIFO is simply a tracking method where the oldest crypto purchased is considered the first crypto sold and specific identification allows taxpayers to choose a specific batch of crypto to sell before selling it.  In legacy finance, a taxpayer can give notice to their securities broker to use specific identification and then instruct the broker which tax lot of securities to sell. Specific identification doesn’t work this way in crypto because both exchanges and crypto tax software don’t provide any pre-sale identifying mechanisms. This means exchanges will default to providing FIFO-only cost basis on 1099-DAs.  Meanwhile, taxpayers use several cost method methods, numerous other ways crypto is considered sold for tax purposes, as proxies for specific identification because the cost basis in the calculation is “identified” after the sale instead of before. Nonetheless, if exchanges report on a FIFO basis and the taxpayer uses specific identification, then reconciling between the two will be impossible. This illustrates how cost basis would be double counted and/or omitted because the taxpayers and exchanges are using inconsistent cost basis methods.  Cost-basis tracking on a per-wallet and exchange basis would help the reconciliation process but doesn’t come without its own issues. Several crypto tax software providers, such as Cointracker and Bitwave, are rolling out per-wallet and exchange tracking and some already had these features.  Alice has consistently used the FIFO cost basis method and wants to reconcile her 1099-DAs so she switches her crypto software from universal to per-wallet tracking. She’s surprised to get different gains and losses for each tax year, but her new CPA explains the calculations go back to 2018 and the per-wallet method is recalculating what has already been calculated in prior years. Crypto software must lock down cost basis at the end of 2022, for example, so the shift to per wallet tracking avoids the double-counting and/or omissions dilemma.  How to avoid future Issues  It’s unclear how exchanges are going to manage customer basis and data tracking because 1099-DA reporting is currently deferred until final regulations are issued. One thing is clear, though – there will be differences and taxpayers will have extra work to correctly adjust gains and losses on their tax returns. Form 8949, used to report the detail all crypto trades, has adjustment codes to deal with incorrectly reported basis and other issues. However, this is easier said than done. In addition to the normal crypto tax headaches, taxpayers must track 1099-DA reconciliation differences, calculate adjustments and figure out reporting so final gains and losses are correct. There are also many other issues too numerous to mention here.  Bob, a decentralized finance (DeFi) degen, wants to avoid the 1099-DA conundrums and decided to use his centralized exchanges as stablecoin-only on- and off-ramps and use DeFi protocols for all his other crypto activity. His 1099-DAs would only show stablecoin sales with gains and losses essentially zero, thus eliminating the reconciliation and adjustment exercise. Bob is going to minimize transfers among exchanges to keep activity as self-contained as possible. He’s also considering opening new exchange accounts to containerize new trades and cost basis when 1099-DAs are finally issued.  We need crypto tax management to get easier, not harder. The ideal compromise for final broker reporting rules would be removing the cost basis reporting requirement to eliminate most of the cost basis reconciliation headaches. Then taxpayers would only have to deal with reconciling reported proceeds from trades.  Fortunately, the delay with 1099-DA will give more time for exchanges to develop better reporting, crypto tax software providers to develop more useful tracking features and taxpayers to strategize ways to minimize headaches. The IRS will be seeking public comments on proposed regulations to implement the broker reporting rules per Announcement 2023-2.

Notably, the US Federal Reserve has maintained a hawkish stance in its fight against inflation by increasing interest rates. The last interest rate announcement was on March 23, when the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve voted and approved an additional 25 basis point increase to the primary credit rate pushing it to 5%. BTC Price Will Increase Following Interest Rate Reduction, Novogratz In a recent Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday, Novogratz made forecasts on BTC price increases. According to him, the “clearest” trades are long Gold, long Euro, long Bitcoin, and long Ethereum, all of which should profit from the Fed’s predicted policy shifts. Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin He referred to Bitcoin’s $30,000 price level this week, for the first time since June 2022, as a significant run. Novogratz expects Bitcoin to consolidate here before heading towards $40,000, as long as the Fed plays out the way that is expected. On the contrary, he forecasts that shares will continue to be “range-bound” this year, pointing out that they are neither affordable to purchase nor extremely appealing to investors due to their high prices. Further, Novogratz stated that Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai are pushing for crypto-friendly regulations while the US Securities and Exchange Commission is targeting the cryptocurrency business. Bitcoin Price Outlook Since January Since the start of this year, Bitcoin’s price has increased gradually. It ended 2022 at $16,603.67 due to the FTX collapse and regulatory pressure. BTC started in 2023 at the $16,508 zone. However, investors began to show interest when BTC surpassed $19,669 on January 14, 2023, pushing the price to rise again. After crossing the $25,000 mark on March 16, BTC traded above $27,000 and $28,000 till April 10, when it climbed above $29,000. Today, April 13, BTC’s price stands at $30,212 as of press time. Its market capitalization has grown to $583,952,947,218 and has a 24-hour trading volume of $19,558,222,281.

It is generated via historical data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), using a non-discretionary algorithm.  ""We are excited to offer the Bitcoin Trend Indicator, which has been rigorously researched and constructed,"" Andy Baehr, CFA, managing director at CoinDesk Indices, said in a press release. ""We designed the BTI to help identify trends in the price of bitcoin, assisting asset managers to create new dynamic products and helping investors make better-informed allocation decisions over a long-term horizon.""  The BTI has been backtested over a five-year period using XBX data.  BTI can be used by asset managers and investors for long-only dynamic allocation strategies. Employing the widely used method of moving average crossovers, BTI’s algorithm identifies trends by comparing short-term price averages with their long-term counterparts.  According to CoinDesk Indices, a hypothetical BTI-directed portfolio of bitcoin and cash demonstrated reduced exposure during downturns – less “crypto winter” – in the cryptocurrency market, while still catching the market upswings.  BTI is one part of CoinDesk Indices’ portfolio, alongside the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) and the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).  ""The BTI is for everyone,"" Baehr said.

42412312,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4Wkw,1681402480,"Ethereum Unstaking Requests Pile Up After Shanghai Upgrade, Now at 2-Week Wait","So many Ethereum validators have put in requests to unstake ether (ETH) from the blockchain following Wednesday’s Shanghai upgrade that the queue to get the cryptocurrency out has backed up to two weeks.  In the hours following the Shanghai upgrade, also referred to as Shapella – the “hard fork” or series of blockchain code changes that enabled staked ETH withdrawals for the first time – the number of validators waiting for redemptions has grown to about 17,000 for full withdrawals and 285,000 for partial withdrawals, according to the network explorer Rated. (There’s not total agreement in the market about this number. The blockchain analysis firm Nansen estimates it at about 22,000 for full withdrawals, while an Ethereum Foundation-sponsored data dashboard on the website Metrika also puts the number around 17,000.)  The total number of validators is about 567,000, according to Nansen, so the ones waiting for full withdrawals represent just 4%. A full withdrawal is when validators request back their entire original deposit of 32 ETH (about $64,000 worth), the amount that's required to participate in the proof-of-stake network.  But also, the Ethereum blockchain appears to be processing the withdrawals at just 55.4% of its capacity, according to Rated.  The upshot is that there’s about a 14-day wait. That's quite a bit longer than several blockchain analysts' estimates prior to Shanghai – that it could take a few hours to a few days to get through the backlog.  Roughly 1,000 validators have fully exited the Beacon Chain.  Blockchain analysts have noted that validators associated with Kraken, the crypto exchange, make up about 80% of that queue. That dynamic was expected because Kraken agreed in February to shut down its staking service in the U.S. in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Read more: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Is Complete, Starting New Era of Staking Withdrawals  While stakers are starting to withdraw their accrued rewards, Nansen, a blockchain analytics provider, shows that ether (ETH) deposited into the Beacon Chain has started to grow, showing that stakers want to continue participating in Ethereum’s maintenance of the blockchain.  But on a net basis, withdrawals still outweigh the deposits. The 24 hour net deposit change into the Beacon Chain currently stands at minus 79,488 ETH (minus 0.4%) at the time of publication.  Data about the Shanghai Upgrade will still be rolling in as more liquid staking providers also allow its users to withdraw their staked ETH.  Later Thursday, Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange that holds about 12.6% of all staked ETH, will allow its users to decide if they want to unstake.  Ethereum developers met Thursday to debrief on Shanghai.  “Great work everyone on Shapella, it worked!” Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, said at the Ethereum All Core Developers execution layer meeting 159. “The network transitioned successfully. There were a couple minor issues that we saw, but I think overall this was very smooth, and great work everyone!”  ETH is up about 5% over the last 24 hours and rose to $2,003 earlier today, reaching the highest point since August.

The slide in non-fungible token (NFT) prices occurred after pseudonymous holder ""franklinisbored"" said on Twitter that he sold the majority of his collection. On-chain data shows that the user sold at least 27 BAYC NFTs over a 12-hour period, securing 1439.5828 ETH ($2.8 million) in the process.  Franklinisbored explained his decision was due to ""unfortunate"" real-life issues that prompted him to liquidate his NFTs.  ""Due to an unfortunate IRL issue, I have had to sell off a lot of BAYC apes to pay off BendDAO loans while the liquidity was available. I won't get involved in NFT trading/twitter for a while, and will just focus on my private life for the time being with my remaining apes,"" they wrote.  In a follow-up tweet, the investor elaborated they had fallen victim to a rug pull on a nearly 2,000 ETH investment.

Despite the Elon Musk effect that boosted the coin’s value earlier this month, Dogecoin has now taken a nosedive, erasing all gains and raising questions about its long-term viability in the ever-changing world of crypto. As investors brace themselves for the next twist in this rollercoaster ride, one thing is certain: Dogecoin’s journey is far from over. Related Reading: Solana Sparkles With Highest 24-Hour Gain Among Top 10 Cryptos Dogecoin Price Declines 2.7% Amid Crypto Market Correction Coingecko price shows Dogecoin dropping 2.7% to $0.084207, following a general correction in the cryptocurrency market. This decrease in price occurred just before the release of the US Consumer Price Index data for March, which indicated a reduction in inflation to its lowest level in two years. Dogecoin’s recent price decline also coincided with Elon Musk’s decision to remove the token’s official mascot from its home button on Twitter and replace it with the original blue bird logo. This alteration followed the previous surge in DOGE’s price by 30% to $0.104 on April 3, as rumors circulated that Musk was planning to integrate Dogecoin payments into Twitter. However, instead of adopting the Dogecoin logo on Twitter, the website removed it from its home button around April 7. Consequently, DOGE’s price has dropped by 10.2%. $DOGE: High time frames this is an area of huge volume, probably a fine area to accumulate a spot position. But it could take a looong time to play out as it normally does, so opportunity cost of that $ could be pricey. 1D: all EMAs flipped bullish, still looking ok. pic.twitter.com/76AM4JxsHm — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) April 11, 2023 DOGE/USD: Support Confluence And Potential Upside DOGE could still see a rebound in the near term as it approaches a significant support confluence and could attract buyers near $0.080, where its long-standing ascending trendline and 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA) intersect. This support level has proven to be strong in the past, limiting the downside in December 2022. Altcoin Sherpa, an independent market analyst, on Twitter, said that this support zone is an area of significant volume and could be an excellent opportunity for traders to accumulate a spot position. A bounce from this support confluence could push DOGE/USD towards $0.10 in April or early May, representing a potential upside of around 15% from current price levels. Crypto total market still a little over the $1 trillion level on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Radix Bullish Pattern Boosts XRD Price With 52% Rally If DOGE were to break below the aforementioned support confluence, it would indicate a decisive bearish move and could lead to a potential downtrend toward the $0.069 level. This price level coincides with DOGE’s multi-month ascending trendline support, which adds to its importance as a potential price floor for the cryptocurrency. DOGE’s price action will depend heavily on how it reacts to the support confluence. Traders and investors should keep an eye on this level to determine the potential direction of DOGE’s trend in the coming weeks. -Featured image from Getty/Thinkstock",NEGATIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-sheds-over-10/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Web3 musicians, fans and enthusiasts will be able to collect these NFTs through the end of April.

42411175,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQkF,1681398000,Financial Advisors’ Next Value Proposition: Preparation for a Digital Asset Future,"""The Untouchables"", a film produced in 1987, contains a memorable and emotional scene in which agent Jim Malone, shot by Al Capone's gang, lies dying. In his final moments, while spitting up blood, he shows Elliott Ness a paper with the train schedule for the mob's bookkeeper and utters the famous phrase, ""What are you prepared to do about it?""  I believe that financial advisors need to ask themselves, each other and their clients the same question now. We’re seeing upheaval in financial markets, uncertainty in banking, a war in Ukraine, protests, an Axis alliance of China and Russia with Iran and India, inflation and higher interest rates and the U.S. government trying to regulate crypto off American soil.  Most of us are tired of the bad news. Some of us complain about it to each other, as well as on Twitter or LinkedIn. Personally, I got caught up and complained as well – and then my astute wife asked me how we’re preparing. Funny, I hadn’t gone through that exercise yet. However, for financial advisors, this is exactly what clients will ask, and where you can provide the next wave of value.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The value waves  Financial professionals seem to always evolve their value proposition.  Their initial approach involved stock picking and brokering. But as algorithms eroded alpha opportunities, they shifted their focus to portfolio diversification. Then, their focus turned to financial behaviors – helping clients determine how to save, how much to save and in what vehicles. More recently, we have seen a focus on providing more education to clients by producing and distributing more content.  Each of these value waves came with a technology that disrupted the financial advisor market by bringing the value directly to the retail investor. Stock brokers were upset by online discount brokers and the emergence of robo-advisors and auto-rebalancing. And financial advisors were challenged by apps such as Mint and Acorns, which provide budget planning and tracking.  I think the next wave of value for advisors to provide to their clients is in preparation for the financial future.  “Well, duh, Adam. That’s the advisor’s job anyway,” you might say. However, the difference here is in my definitions of preparation and financial future.  The past, present and future  For the past several decades much of the planning has been built around several constants, which made the ability to add and subtract tools with relative ease.  The dollar is far and away the world reserve currency, and there is no close second  Ultra-low inflation  Centralized custodians hold our financial assets to keep them safe  We can trust our money at banks  Most jobs or businesses involve a location, or several, where we work  In only the last few years we have seen these constants challenged by several factors, and I think these challenges will continue:  Arbitrarily low interest rates for 15 years  COVID-19  Russia-Ukraine War  … and all the government decisions that went with these events.  We have seen inflation growth at near-wartime rates. Interest rates had the fastest rise on record and caused banks to have negative equity, leading to bank runs and the need for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve to promise deposit guarantees above the $250,000 FDIC standard.  We’ve lost more trust in our Western-style democracies, as evidenced in the U.S., France, Germany and Israel, because government officials (some elected, some appointed) have started making regulation and enforcement changes without due process. This has included the closing and sanctioning of bank accounts, often through no or little fault of the account holder.  This all leads to a handful of questions about the future:  How do we prepare for a future that doesn’t look like the last 30 years?  If the U.S. dollar isn’t as dominant, does another currency take its place?  Will many people feel more comfortable holding their own assets rather than having them housed in a bank or other custodian?  Will we look at investment options with even less correlation to the U.S. stock market? Alternatives like real estate, art, collectibles and, dare I say, crypto?  How will individual and business financial models change with instant settlement, whether via crypto or a centralized service like FedNow?  Where crypto fits in  For years the people who discussed crypto were talking about financial and political occurrences that were more theoretical. However, in the past year, those theories have become realities – so maybe more people will start listening and taking crypto more seriously.  Several of the problems I’ve pointed to above could be solved partially or completely via crypto rails: an asset to act as an inflation hedge – bitcoin (BTC); a way to hold assets outside a bank – self-custody; a non-correlated asset class – crypto.  In addition, I can honestly say I understand the economy and financial system so much better as a result of my crypto study and knowledge. We have been spoon-fed our current financial system to the point that we don’t question much of it at all. We just agree that it works. Learning crypto will help anyone gain a better understanding of the global financial system (and feel increased angst with such knowledge).  Advisors preparing themselves and their clients for the future will probably involve some advanced thought about the economy and capital markets – as well as an open mind. It will involve geographic and custodial diversification – holding my assets in multiple jurisdictions (Switzerland) and technologies (wallets). The future financial plan will regularly include discussions of multiple income streams, as well as the possibility of living abroad for some time.  In the past, financial planning involved reducing investment risk in a portfolio. In the future, it will include reducing the risk of wealth disappearing in a bank run, government seizure and hyperinflationary period. It will also include reducing the risk of getting caught in a crypto scam.  I don’t think crypto, DeFi, bitcoin and Web3 are the answer to everything. I do think the technology will be pervasive and will change the financial planning conversations, beyond simply whether to buy and hold bitcoin.  If you’re a financial professional, are you dismissing all the rapid and massive changes to the micro and macro economy and systems and assuming we go back to the world we knew a decade ago? Or are you paying attention to the movements and preparing yourself and your clients for the world in which they might need to use their money?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/13/financial-advisors-next-value-proposition-preparation-for-a-digital-asset-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90474f92bfeb04067aa68f813e74ce45cd6478b6-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token climbed 4.4% to $2K as of 10:53 a.m. ET, extending its year-to-date rally to 65%, after reaching as high as $2.01K earlier in the session. The intraday gains easily outpaced that of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which edged up 1.3% to $30.44K. The update, completed Wednesday evening, enables users of the ether ( ETH-USD ) network to withdraw their ETH tokens that have been staked, a process whereby users can pledge ETH tokens to help secure and validate transactions on the blockchain in return for rewards. Shanghai, or Shapella, marks the end of the network's multi-year transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work -- the same one used by bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). ""The Shapella upgrade went smoothly and speaks to how amazing the Ethereum community is,"" said Robert Ellison, chief growth officer of crypto hosting and staking platform Allnodes. ""Liquid staking will continue to grow as more non-custodial platforms and services appear on the market, the overall amount of ETH stakers will now start to rise due to withdrawals being enabled, and a good portion of this will flow into Liquid Staking as these platforms mature,"" he told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. When asked why investors should not rush to withdraw their ETH, Ellison said: ""Considering Eth is now deflationary, returns rewards consistently, and the risks of uncertainty are gone with withdrawals going live, Eth staking will increase and have a market positive effect.""

VanEck is dissolving the VanEck Digital Assets Mining ETF ( NASDAQ: DAM ), which intended to deliver exposure to companies that participated in the digital assets mining economy. The ETF tracked the MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index. According to VanEck, the ETF is expected to be de-listed after market close on Monday, April 24, 2023. VanEck stated : “Shareholders who do not sell their holdings on or before market close on Monday, April 24, 2023 and continue to hold their shares through the liquidation date on or about Monday, May 1, 2023 are expected to receive cash on or about Monday, May 1, 2023 in the cash portion of their brokerage accounts equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares.” DAM, which launched back in March of 2022, hit the market at $36.70 a share and peaked just a couple weeks later at $46.05 a share. The fund now sits at $13.60 a share, equating to a 63% drop since its inception. Moreover, the fund holds just $1.9M in assets under management. The ETF's performance has been hampered by weakness in its top holdings, like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc ( MARA ), Riot Platforms Inc ( RIOT ) and Hut 8 Mining Corp ( HUT ) which together represent 38.21% of the fund. Those stocks have collapsed 53% , 20% , and 55% over the past one-year trading period.

Messari’s State of NEAR Q1 2023 report reveals the token and its protocol recorded impressive financial performance in the first quarter of 2023. According to Messari, NEAR recorded increased network activity, with daily active accounts reaching a new all-time high during the reporting period. The token price took off after Messari released the report three days ago and has not relented in its rally since then. Related Reading: FTX Token (FTT) Price Doubles In 24 Hours, Here’s Why According to CoinMarketCap data, NEAR has registered a 10.69% gain on the weekly chart with a 24-hour price increase of 5.02%. The token witnessed a sharp spike in trading volume from $94.81 million on April 12 to $246.42 million today. NEAR Network Activity Reaches New Record High In detail, Messari’s report revealed that NEAR’s daily active accounts maintained the momentum from its Q4 2022 record high. According to the report, there was a slight increase in daily active accounts in Q1 2023, from 63,700 recorded in Q4 2022 to 63,940. Meanwhile, the average daily transactions slightly reduced by 13% from 453,440 in Q4 2022 to 393,050 in Q1 2023. Although the token witnessed a slight decline in daily active accounts and transactions, the numbers remained high, reflecting the network stability. Also, the transaction fee remained low at $0.002 due to NEAR’s fee adjustment mechanism. One would conclude that Messari’s report has influenced NEAR’s recent performance as it suggests the network’s scalability, stability, and reliability. Since releasing the quarterly report three days ago, NEAR recorded steady price gains, except on April 12, when it declined by 0.4% due to yesterday’s market-wide downturn. NEAR toke saw a 2.0% price increase on April 10 and 2.6% gains on April 11. At press time, NEAR is trading at $2.19, with a 5.02% price increase in the last 24 hours. But that’s not all. NEAR has recorded a notable surge in trading volume, confirming a rise in network activity. The 24-hour trading volume shows a 109.76% increase in the last day. NEAR’s Ecosystem Developments and Corresponding Price Actions Messari’s report revealed the NEAR protocol’s team has been pursuing ecosystem development projects. NEAR’s 2023-2024 roadmap revealed the network recorded an incredible growth rate since its launch in October 2020, with over 20 protocol upgrades. NEAR’s developer team planned to focus on improving the protocol’s scalability and decentralization in 2023. The report revealed the driving force of NEAR’s performance as the Sweat Economy, Aurora, Spin.fi, and NEAR Crowd launch. Also, the Blockchain Operation System introduced by NEAR Foundation contributed to the network’s high activity. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Pending For Withdrawal Rise Rapidly, Uptrend In Jeopardy? Another network activity growth driver is Binance’s recent Tether (USDT) integration on NEAR Protocol Network. According to the announcement, the integration allows millions of Binance’s users worldwide to access USDT on the NEAR ecosystem. This utility would see more users transacting on the NEAR protocol to access USDT. Since Binance announced this on April 12, it could be responsible for today’s surging trading volume and price.

Users can also swap funds on popular DeFi platforms, including Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. The wallet features in-app token price and NFT data, allowing users to favorite tokens and wallet addresses so they can track the trading activity that matters most to them.  Those features, the app's creators hope, will encourage users to custody their own crypto with DeFi wallets, which traditionally have a higher barrier to entry than more centralized modes of buying and storing cryptocurrencies.

11714013,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526760,1681392646,"Ethereum (ETH) Hits $2,000 Mark Following Shanghai Upgrade Launch","Almost 24 hours ago, the Ethereum (ETH) long-awaited Shanghai Upgrade took place successfully. Many have anticipated a dip alongside the upgrade. However, contrary to expectations, the price of Ether (ETH) has been on an upward trajectory since the upgrade took place. Over the past 24 hours, following the Shanghai launch, Ethereum has recorded a bullish trend that is currently up by more than 6% with its market price now trading above the $2,000 mark. Its trading volume has also surged suggesting buying pressure. Ethereum (ETH) Surges Over 6% As of yesterday, prior to the Shanghai upgrade launch, ETH was in a downtrend trading below $1,900. This could be a result of some investors in the hours leading to the upgrade selling off their ETH holdings in anticipation of a price crash. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes Key Upside Break, $2,200 On The Horizon However, after the upgrade was completed, the price of ETH started to rise steadily, and within 24 hours, it had breached the $2,000 mark. Looking at the chart, ETH just broke the marked resistance and is about to hit a major high around the $2,030 region. Should ETH tap into the major high, the price of the asset could see a notable fall as a retracement. This could happen due to several traders’ take profit orders being triggered as the $2,000 mark is a notable region for the asset to trade above. A trading price of $2,000 or above $2,000 would ETH be about 58% below its peak of $4,878 seen in November 2021. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s trading volume almost doubled last week’s daily volume. The asset currently has a 24-hour trading volume above $15 billion indicating strong buying pressure going on. In contrast, the asset has also added more than $10 billion to its market cap, increasing from a cap low of $225 billion as of April 12 to $240 billion, at the time of writing. Reason Behind ETH Unexpected Price Surge? Though there is no accurate reason behind the unexpected surge of Ethereum following the Shanghai launch, this spike could be attributed to a number of factors. As the global crypto market has been in an upward trend, the overall bullish sentiment in the market may have impacted the rising price of ETH. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory in recent weeks, and this could be influencing the value of other cryptocurrencies, including ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Pending For Withdrawal Rise Rapidly, Uptrend In Jeopardy? In addition, increased investor confidence in the Ethereum network may have also contributed to ETH’s current surge following the Shanghai launch. Many investors believe this upgrade is an important milestone for the Ethereum network since the merge last September. As a result, while many may have seen that it might cause a price dip, some investors may have also seen it as a great catalyst indicating a continuous development of the Ethereum network as well as long-term success and adoption of the platform and therefore, put more money into ETH. Furthermore, as more users are able to participate in the staking process knowing fully well they can now earn rewards and be able to withdraw them, the demand for ETH might have increased contributing to the current surge.

He expressed his optimistic views on Twitter, stating that the judgment will be the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one.

Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin He further implied that the new trend is for XRP investors to get rich from the asset.

He also attested to his failed prediction, saying it was a one-off event. However, he believes the trial calendar will soon expire; therefore, a resolution is needed. Attorney John Deaton shares similar views on the judgment timeline. Deaton, in an interview, stated that Judge Torres ruling timeline reveals that the summary judgment might occur before May 6, 2023. He pointed out the fact that historically, Judge Torres’ summary judgments come up within two months. Deaton listed scenarios where the summary judgment followed within one-hour and one month for some cases. Meanwhile, another crypto analyst, Ali, believes that XRP is on the verge of a 47% surge. However, he stated it could only happen if it secures a 3-day candlestick close above $0.54. The analyst believes that a successful breakout could launch XRP to $0.80. Nevertheless, the impending judgment is critical in XRP price performance. How Is XRP Looking Today? XRP is recovering today, forming a green candle on the daily chart. The brief retracement in the last two days served as a consolidation point for the asset. XRP is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bullish sentiment for the short and long term. Notably, the 50-day SMA crossed over the 200-day SMA to form a golden cross on April 4, reflecting the bullish pressure on the asset.

The separate service LCH DigitalAssetClear, part of the company's French arm, will finalize trades made on GFO-X, a U.K.-regulated digital asset exchange, LCH said.  “Bitcoin index futures and options are a rapidly growing asset class,” Frank Soussan, head of LCH DigitalAssetClear, said in a statement, citing “increasing interest among institutional market participants looking for access within a regulated environment they are familiar with.”  Clearinghouses offer a centralized venue in which to finalize trades that are agreed on an exchange. Since the 2008 financial crisis, they have been favored by regulators as a way to lessen the risk of separate bilateral deals among players such as investment banks.  The move represents the latest foray by traditional finance players into the crypto market. In March, the Stuttgart stock exchange secured a crypto custody license from German regulator BaFin, and Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear has said it will soon be ready to launch a bond settlement platform based on crypto-style distributed ledger technology.

42411023,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3ns,1681390261,"As Justice Is Sought for Do Kwon, South Korea’s Crypto Scene Emerges From Terra’s Shadow","Terra is back in the news as the United States and South Korea vie for the extradition of Terraform Labs co-founder and CEO Do Kwon, a Korean national who was recently arrested in Montenegro. The Korean crypto community is likely more invested in the outcome, but some actually prefer that Kwon be sent to the U.S. because the punishment might be harsher there.  The collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin project reverberated throughout the world, causing some $60 billion to evaporate. But the longest shadow fell over Korea, where it remains today.  The 2022 crash was all over the local media, which reported that the project had some 200,000 local victims. “Even my grandpa knew about LUNA,” said SungMo Park, head of Korea business development at Polygon Labs, referring to Terra's luna token. Projects that built on top of Terra found themselves homeless, at least temporarily. The Korean venture fund Hashed reportedly lost some $3 billion in the crash. A once pro-crypto presidential administration started to appear much less enthusiastic. To this day, the state of crypto regulation in Korea is not terribly friendly.  Terraform Labs was based in Singapore, not South Korea, but the project played a special role in Kwon’s native country. When I visited Seoul a few months ago, memories of the crash were vivid. I heard about people selling their homes to invest in luna, as well as speculation that if Kwon had returned to Korea after the crash he likely would have been killed.  The downfall of a prominent, Korean-born founder clearly had a psychological impact. “Do was a very young Korean leader making a big change in the global scene. There was no software company in Korea that was making that kind of impact on the global level,” said Jiyun Kim, CEO and co-founder of DSRV, which ran a Terra validator in Korea. “He was a kind of north star for Korean crypto founders.”  “Koreans don’t really think Koreans are capable of going global,” said Lloyd Lee, founder and CEO of Hyperithm, a digital asset management firm that is based in both Seoul and Tokyo.  “There were two stars that actually broke that belief. One was [the K-pop boy band] BTS, the second was Do Kwon.”  Going sideways  When it comes to crypto, Korea is one of the most powerful markets in the world. The Korean won is the second-most traded national currency for bitcoin (BTC), after the U.S. dollar, according to Coinhills. A report by Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in September said there were nearly seven million registered crypto users in Korea. The digital asset industry market size was nearly 23 trillion won for the first half of 2022, or close to $18 billion at current exchange rates. It dropped to 19 trillion won in the second half of the year, according to a newer report.  There were two stars that actually broke that belief. One was [the K-pop boy band] BTS, the second was Do Kwon.  The Terra crash appears to have taken a toll on local crypto trading, though of course there were other factors as well. In the first half of 2022, the domestic virtual asset market showed a decrease of 58% in market capitalization compared to the second half of 2021, according to the FIU. The report attributed this drop to the economic toll of the Ukraine crisis, rising interest rates and decreasing liquidity, “as well as the decline in trust in virtual assets due to the Terra-Luna incident.”  Unfortunately, Terra's crash was not the end of the drama. According to CoinGecko, Korea was the hardest hit by FTX.com’s collapse. Just this month, the Korean exchange Gdac was hacked for nearly $13 million. In December major crypto exchanges delisted the controversial token Wemix, leading to a loss of nearly $300 million in market cap. None of this would be reassuring to regulators and businesses who already suspected that crypto was unsafe.  The Terra crash, among other factors, seems to have had a political effect as well. In last year’s presidential election, candidates adopted crypto-friendly positions in an apparent attempt to win over young voters. The winner, President Yoon Suk-Yeol pledged to restrict taxes for crypto gains and allow initial coin offerings. His win came with a flurry of media headlines suggesting a crypto-friendly administration, with the price of at least one Korean crypto project soaring on these high hopes.  But Yoon assumed the presidency in May 2022, the very same month Terra collapsed.  “The new government can’t just go pro-crypto when all this Terra-luna happened and people are losing their assets or money, and companies are going bankrupt … and all these social problems are happening at the same time,” Hyperithm’s Lee said. “They can’t just say, we’re going to keep our pro-crypto stance. So they backed away a bit.”  Hedging risk  Earlier this year, Korean media reported that lawmakers were working on the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), which collectively refers to 17 draft bills that largely focus on investor protection. As of now, none of these bills has passed. “We were on the way to make some new crypto legislation, especially after the new presidential administration started. But so far there has been almost no new regulation, only discussions in Parliament,” said Jongbaek Park, a partner at Bae, Kim and Lee.  At present, the focus of crypto regulation is mostly to prevent money laundering and terrorism. Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) act was amended in 2020 to include virtual-asset service providers (VASP). Korean crypto exchanges have to report to the FIU and they are obliged to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks with new clients as well as report suspicious transactions.  Meanwhile, there are currently only five crypto exchanges that trade with Korean won. The government was trying to restrict the number of VASPs to make anti-money laundering (AML) regulation stricter than before, Park explains. So they set up a guideline that if you want to have a virtual-asset service involving Korean won, you should set up some special category of bank account.  “The Korean government tends to place too much importance on the prevention of risks, like investment protection, protection of market stability, rather than to encourage possible innovative effects to the market or community,” Park said.  “AML regulation is good to get rid of bad actors, such as those doing money laundering or terror financing,” Park added. “The problem is the government has not legislated other regulation.”  The arrest of Do Kwon has helped bring crypto assets back into the regulatory spotlight, adding some urgency to a long-delayed process, CoinDesk Korea reported. One crypto-related bill could be voted on as soon as this month, and another could be considered next month. The bills address protection of user deposits as well as the prohibition of the use of undisclosed information, manipulation of market prices and illegal transactions.  ""Last year, the Tera-luna scandal was still unresolved, followed by the FTX scandal. The pace of change in the digital-asset market is very fast, so related bills should be carefully enacted according to the situation,"" Yoon Chang-hyun, a member of the National Assembly, told CoinDesk Korea in late March.  ""The bill on digital-asset trading (currently pending in the National Assembly) is expected to be passed within the second quarter of this year,"" Yoon said. The first step is to enact a transaction law, and the second step is to enact a basic law.""  There was one sign of progress in February, when Korea issued guidance on security token offerings, or STO. “The Korean government didn’t want to permit token-type securities in general, even though they had designated regulatory sandboxes for four STO projects. These guidelines are a big change,” Park explained. But a more careful look at the guidelines shows they are not as progressive as they first look.  “The fact that the FSC announced STO guidelines is good news for crypto. But if you go into the details of that guideline, they have a restrictive attitude toward the extent of STOs. For instance, they essentially exclude public blockchains,” Park said.  Moving on  It’s not uncommon for a country’s crypto trajectory to be shaped, at least temporarily, by traumatic events. In Japan, the Mt. Gox and Coincheck exchange hacks spooked regulators and cast a multiyear chill over the domestic crypto community. But those same events also spurred Japan to devise some of the clearest crypto regulations in the world. The United States, meanwhile, is still reeling from the implosion of FTX, which dealt a very visible black eye to an industry that already had plenty of detractors in Washington. Partly due to recent crackdowns by the Securities and Exchange Commission, some crypto businesses are now avoiding the United States.  The dust of the Terra crash has not completely settled in Korea, though Kwon’s arrest does move this story a bit nearer to closure. Several people told me that after the crash, traditional Korean companies became more wary of being associated with crypto. “Before Terra, all the big companies were joining the momentum. Investment banks actually invited us to give them seminars on crypto [exchange-traded funds] or how they can pave their way into the crypto market. But I guess now the attention has become a bit selective,” Hyperithm’s Lee says. “Not all the companies are interested in crypto anymore.”  It is hard to know where Korea will ultimately end up on crypto regulation, but its retail market is still showing its power. Korea played a role in the recent surge of the XRP token, to give just one example, as XRP trading volume surged to billions of dollars on top local exchanges UpBit, Bithumb and Korbit.  “Whenever the next bull market comes, retail traders will be back. I had friends asking me at $60,000 bitcoin if they should sell their house to buy bitcoin. This all or nothing mentality is not uncommon in Korea,” said Anthony Yoon, managing partner at ROK Capital.  Some previous members of the Terra community found other chains. And in the crypto industry, optimism remains strong. “Right now the wave is gaming companies,” said SungMo Park. “And I think the next wave will be entertainment. We are good at gaming and entertainment, and we also have a big retail market. We have all the conditions to succeed.”  In other words, key parts of the Korean market are already moving past Terra’s demise. It may be some time before we see crypto friendly regulation, if it happens at all. But Korean builders and traders are not all dwelling on the past.  “People tend to move on quickly to the next hype or the next incident, in order to keep up with the fast-moving Korean trends,” said Erica Kang, founder and CEO of KryptoSeoul, a community-building team in Korea.  “When a huge, devastating crash happens people are shocked of course and are negatively affected, and they harshly criticize. But then, maybe weeks later, they are back in the game.”  UPDATE 4/17/23, 20:02 UTC: adds additional quotes and detail.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/13/dokwon-korea-terra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04519308a1a91e5794e64e37c66859d144bdcc67-1336x751.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Following Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which went live Wednesday evening, ether has gained just over 3%, approaching the $2,000 mark. Prices rose as deposits into the Ethereum network outpaced withdrawals, disappointing bears expecting a mass outflow of coins following the upgrade. The native token of Ethereum’s blockchain outperformed market leader bitcoin, having lagged in the lead-up to the upgrade. “We’re seeing a ‘sell the rumor buy the fact’ redux,” Paradigm’s David Brickell said. Analysts were divided on potential price action in the days prior to the upgrade, with many predicting that fresh supply would increase sell pressure, with others anticipating a psychological battle of traders punishing the over-crowded short trade.  Crypto exchange Kraken led ether’s unstaking parade, making up 62% of the exit queue, according to on-chain data tracked by the Rated network explorer. The number of validators in the exit queue had surpassed the 15,000 mark at press time, per Parsec Finance. Kraken’s dominance of the unstaking queue is largely expected, given the legal issues it has faced with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In February, the SEC determined Kraken’s staking offerings – but not staking programs offered by competing exchanges – to be unregistered securities.  Trading platform eToro is set to offer trading services of crypto and other assets directly to Twitter users via a new partnership with the social media company, the firm announced Thursday. The new service – named ""$Cashtags"" – is available from Thursday and will see the social investing firm provide its users with real-time prices for cryptocurrencies, stocks and other assets while directing them to the eToro platform to make trades. The news was first reported by CNBC and then confirmed by eToro on its official Twitter account. $Cashtags aligns with Twitter owner Elon Musk's plans to integrate financial services into the platform, as part of his intentions to create a ""super app.""“The next bull market is going to be wild,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger, tweeted, referring to the eToro/Twitter tie-up.

11711857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526708,1681387516,Can The Bitcoin Price Continue To Rise In The Short-Term? Market Update,"After the rapid rise above $30,000, the Bitcoin price is currently taking a break and hovering around the round number. In the medium term, Bitcoin looks bullish, but what about the short term? Can BTC continue to rise or is a correction looming? Axel Adler Jr. has published an analysis of Bitcoin’s on-chain data on this matter. In a series of tweets, Adler writes that the BTC inflow/outflow ratio on the 7-day moving average (MA7) is currently in positive territory, meaning that BTC inflows to exchanges are exceeding outflows. Adler concludes from this that investors may be preparing to sell BTC. However, he says that this value should be interpreted with caution, as it does not always correlate with future price changes. Nevertheless, the interpretation is confirmed by the BTC Netflow 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 7), which is also in the red zone. On the other hand, bullish signals are sent by the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume MA7, which is positive and indicates that the buying volume exceeds the selling volume. This could indicate increased demand and a short-term rise in the BTC price, the analyst said. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Inflation: What’s Next For BTC After CPI Rates Came In Lower Than Expected? Also supporting short-term price growth is the Futures Sentiment Index, which is based on average open interest and average funding rate. Currently, the index is rising, suggesting growth potential. Thus, Adler concludes, “Mixed BTC market situation!” Will Bitcoin Bulls Or Bears Win In The Short-Term? However, on-chain analyst James V. Straten has discovered another bullish signal. Via Twitter, the analyst shared the chart below and stated: Interesting developments from #Bitcoin whales. They have started accumulating again, while all other cohorts slow down accumulation. Whales buy value. $30k the new floor? In addition, according to on-chain data provider Santiment, social metrics are showing a bullish signal as the crowd is still skeptical of the rally. “Traders are beginning to show signs of FUD. Historically, this is a good sign for patient bulls, as markets typically move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectation,” Santiment states. Technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe also believes that Bitcoin can continue to rise. As long as the BTC price stays above $28,600 or $27,800, the analyst expects that the markets will not decline too much. On the lower time frame, van de Poppe sees $29,300 as a good entry opportunity. The analyst gives the price range between $32,400 and $33,000 as a continuation target.

Currently, it is at the upper edge, which is why he expects the rally to shift from Bitcoin to altcoins in a base scenario if the RSI is overbought and reaches the top. We are the top of the range with overbought RSI (again a bit of a meme) and bearish divergence. Dominance should drop here unless we see a MAJOR breakout and Bitcoin crushes everything. At press time, the BTC price was still hovering around $30,000, trading at $30,223.

This sudden growth was triggered by an announcement that said the bankrupt FTX exchange could possibly reopen for business soon. FTX Exchange Could See A Comeback In a court hearing for the FTX exchange that was held on Wednesday, one of the attorneys working on the case dropped a bombshell that would trigger a massive rally. According to the Sullivan & Cromwell attorney, Andy Dietderich, they were considering a relaunch of the crypto exchange. Now, the proposal was that users who still had funds locked on the platform would be able to transfer some of their frozen funds to a stake on the exchange instead of receiving cash back. This follows the attorneys revealing that they had been able to locate liquid assets belonging to the exchange worth $7.3 billion, which is a sizable amount but not enough to fill the hole in FTX’s balance sheet. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum (ETH) Still Trading Below $2,000? The attorney, however, explained that to restart an exchange the size of FTX, it would need a lot of cash. So re-opening the exchange is only one of many possibilities that they are considering at this point. Dietderich further explained that “There are possibilities that customers could have the option to take part of their proceeds that they would otherwise receive in cash from the estate and receive some kind of an interest in the exchange going forward.” FTT Token Doubles In One Day Following Dietderich’s comments in court, the price of FTX Token (FTT) quickly responded. Buying pressure mounted on the digital asset off of expectations that the defunct crypto exchange could resume operations and its price more than doubled in a single day. The token which started out Wednesday at a price of $1.3 peaked at $3 before the correction. This accounted for a more than 100% increase in the price of the altcoin, making it one of the best performers in the last 24 hours. FTT rises over 100% in one day | Source: FTTUSD on TradingView.com As the hype has died down, the price of the digital asset has begun to decline but at the time of writing, it is still trading significantly higher than its Wednesday opening price. At a price of $2.2, FTT is still seeing over 50% gains in the last day alone.

An official briefed on internal talks told CoinDesk it was likely that a planned vote will be pushed back one day as part of routine reshuffling of the schedule, implying a debate on Wednesday, April 19, and a vote on Thursday. The official asked not to be named as no final decision has been taken.  Lawmakers and European Union member states, who meet in a separate body known as the Council of the EU, already agreed an outline of the law last year, alongside parallel anti-money laundering rules known as the Transfer of Funds Regulation.  The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation, MiCA, requires providers of crypto services like wallets and exchanges to seek a license from national regulators, while the Transfer of Funds regulation obliges identity checks on those making crypto payments.  After months of drafting and translation, and several delays, the deadline for proposing further changes to the MiCA text has now expired, and documents now published by the parliament imply the agreed changes are the only ones that will be put up for discussion.

The rally to an eight-month high comes off the back of a successful network upgrade called Shanghai, or Shapella. The upgrade implemented during Asian hours enables withdrawals for users who have staked their ether, a process that helps secure and validate transactions on the blockchain. In the initial hours after the upgrade went live, ether traded fairly flat.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained over 3% since the upgrade, while market leader bitcoin (BTC) has added less than 2%, CoinDesk data show. The ether-bitcoin ratio has risen over 2.5%.  “We’re seeing a ‘sell the rumor buy the fact’ redux. ETH underperformed BTC with uncertainty around the upgrade and potential supply dynamic from the unlock. Now the risk event has past, no substantial selling pressure, market can unwind short hedges and rebalance towards to ETH,” David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  Heading into the pivotal hard fork, analysts were divided on how the backward-incompatible upgrade would influence ether's price, with some anticipating an investor rush to liquidate holdings.  The selling pressure, however, is likely to be less than what the market initially feared, according to North Rock Digital founder Hal Press.  “There was a large backlog of 15K [validators] waiting to enter the exit queue, which did so in a linear fashion. Now that they have been processed its flatlined. Puts us on schedule to clear the queue in ~2 weeks and is in line with my earlier estimate of ~$300m of total sell pressure,” Hal Press tweeted.  “This is still much more bullish than my baseline assumptions from a couple weeks ago,"" Press added.  Overall the demand for unstaking ether has been moderate, as a sizable portion is currently held at a loss. The biggest unstaker so far has been Kraken, which is shutting down its staking service for U.S. users as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ""Over 77% of ETH being withdrawn has been from the exchange Kraken and the majority of withdrawn ETH by validators outside of this is rewards, not rewards plus original stake. This is a more constructive than the market had potentially anticipated,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital said.  ""With withdrawal restrictions in place and liquid staking derivatives like Lido not implementing withdrawals until May, we think the market is realizing they over indexed on the upgrade concerns allowing for ETH to finally test the $2,000 level once again,"" Harland added.  Liquid staking system Lido makes up around 31% of all ether deposits. So far 108,402 ETH have been unstaked, according to data source Nansen.  Year to date, ether is up 65.25%, compared to bitcoin, up 82.04%.

The feature will provide Twitter users searching for ""$Cashtags"" such as $TSLA or $BTC with real-time prices for cryptocurrencies, stocks and other assets, and direct them to the eToro platform to invest in them.  ""The partnership is global so Twitter users around the world will be able to access this $Cashtags feature,"" a spokesperson for eToro told CoinDesk following the publication of this article.  While Twitter users searching a $Cashtag symbol currently see live price charts for a limited range of financial assets, the partnership with eToro will ""hugely"" expand that list, a press statement shared with CoinDesk said. Since Twitter added pricing data for $Cashtags in December the social media platform has recorded 420 million searches, with the top five searches including Tesla ($TSLA), bitcoin ($BTC) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF ($SPY), according to Twitter internal data included in the press statement.  The news was first reported by CNBC and then confirmed by eToro on its official Twitter account.  The expansion of $Cashtags aligns with Twitter owner Elon Musk's plans to integrate financial services into the platform as part of his intentions to create a ""super app.""  Musk has previously said he wishes for Twitter's proposed payments system to be able to accommodate crypto as well as fiat currencies.  ""We are pleased to partner with eToro to provide Twitter users with additional market insights and greater access to investment capabilities. Twitter will continue to invest in growing the #FinTwitter community,” Chris Riedy, vice president of global sales and marketing at Twitter, said in the press release.

Named BonkSwap, the DEX will utilize Solana smart contracts to allow users to swap solana (SOL), bonk inu (BONK) and stablecoins. The majority of fees (80%) on BonkSwap will be used to reward liquidity providers and locked stakers of Bonk and BonkSwap LP positions, which will likely accrue value for bonk holders  As such, developers plan to release more features in the months ahead, including a bonk-based game and futures offerings on the Bonkswap exchange.  “In the coming months we will integrate incredible, rewarding Bonk-powered games, add innovative trading features like options, and perpetual futures powered by HxroNetwork, and expand liquidity to make trading Bonk easier than any other token in Solana,” Bonkswap developers tweeted.  Bonk took center stage in the Solana ecosystem in January as sentiment around the blockchain network took a hit in the aftermath of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX exchange debacle.  BONK ran up as much as 3,200% in just three weeks, almost single-handedly inciting activity in the Solana ecosystem, as previously reported.  Bonk Inu is a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project, CoinDesk learned from one of the several developers. All of them have previously built decentralized applications (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other related products on Solana.  Read More: Inside Bonk Inu: How 22 Developers Put the Shiba Inu Fun Into Solana and Away From FTX  As such, the team does not see itself as a dogecoin (DOGE) or shiba inu (SHIB) rival and points out BONK is already different from the gazillions of dog-themed meme coins already in the market.  “It's already more useful than either of those. There’s (not) much you can do with SHIB or DOGE on-chain,” a Bonk developer told CoinDesk in January, adding there are over 50 integrations with other projects for using BONK already in the first few weeks after issuance.  These integrations included use cases ranging from minting NFTs to using BONK to trading futures and options to betting with BONK at Solana-based decentralized casinos.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | SOL | BONK,DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/13/solana-dog-token-darling-bonk-inu-releases-bonkswap-dex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0542ee978f6a45024c13e89e50fdbbf0d7992546-1024x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11704705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526691,1681370149,"Ethereum (ETH) Pending For Withdrawal Rise Rapidly, Uptrend In Jeopardy?","The long-awaited Shanghai and Capella update of Ethereum officially went live yesterday at 6:30 am EST. The hard fork has gone off without a hitch and is the first major upgrade to the protocol since “The Merge” on September 15, 2022. For the first time in over two years, stakers and validators are able to withdraw their staked ETH from the Beacon Chain. And contrary to some alarming fears, the ETH price has so far failed to plummet. The Latest Numbers On Pending Ethereum Withdrawals According to token.unlocks, about two hours after the Ethereum upgrade, about 17,350 ETHs were withdrawn, and 128 ETH were deposited. The number of ETH waiting for withdrawal at that time was around 319,000 ETH (about $563 million). Since then, however, the number has increased significantly. As of press time, there were 704,416 ETH waiting to be withdrawn, according to data from Nansen. The total number of staked ETH on the Beacon Chain including rewards was 19,227,545 ETH. This means that about 3.6% of all staked ETH are currently waiting to be withdrawn. Related Reading: The Best Bet: A Look Into Ethereum’s Future After Shapella With Ether Capital’s CEO Brian Mosoff The number of validators waiting for a full exit was 19,621, with the total number being 567,209 validators. The net outflow since the update was activated is -55,438 ETH. It is worth noting that the average price of all stakers is $1,973, according to Nansen, which is just above the current price. ETH thus only needs to increase by 3% for the average staker to be in profit. According to on-chain analytics tools, Huobi ranks first with 27.5% of entities waiting to unwind their staked ETH, followed by others (19%), PieDAO (15.7%), Kraken (13.6%), and Heavy Dex Trader 0xa3d (10.1%). According to people familiar with the matter, the large number of ETH withdrawals on Huobi is mainly related to the transfer of new and old shareholders, as reported by Chinese journalist Colin Wu. After the withdrawal is completed, the former owner of Huobi, Li Lin, has to do a handover. “Some ETH may be withdrawn and then deposited again.” According to the official Ethereum website, no transaction fee is required for the withdrawals, as the withdrawals do not compete with the execution level block space. Moreover, the website states that a maximum of 16 withdrawals can be processed in a single block. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes Key Upside Break, $2,200 On The Horizon This means that 115,200 withdrawals will be processed by validators in a single day. Subsequently, Ethereum predicts that 400,000 withdrawals will take 3.5 days, 600,000 withdrawals will take 5.2 days, and 800,000 withdrawals will take 7 days. ETH Price Trends Up The current data suggests that there is no rush among investors to unstake ETH. Thus, fears about an ETH dump appear to be proving unwarranted. With the current numbers, the initial withdrawals could be fully settled in as little as a week. The impact on the price is likely to be rather marginal. Accordingly, the ETH price currently looks very bullish. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,921, eyeing a break above $2,000.

Binance said that user requests for withdrawals, once submitted, cannot be cancelled and the process may be slow initially, requiring 15 days to several weeks for completion.

42387728,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQqVFB,1681369499,"Kraken Leads Ether Unstaking Parade, Makes up 62% of Exit Queue","Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade went live Thursday, Asia time, allowing those that have staked their ether (ETH) to begin the withdrawal process.  On-chain data tracked by Rated network explorer shows that of all the validators moving to unstake, Kraken leads with 62% of the exit queue breakdown. The number of validators in the exit queue has surpassed the 15,000 mark at press time, per Parsec Finance.  Kraken’s dominance of the unstaking queue is largely expected, given the legal issues it has faced in the U.S. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In February, the SEC determined Kraken’s staking offerings – but not other staking programs – to be unregistered securities.  “The complaint alleges that Kraken touts that its staking investment program offers an easy-to-use platform and benefits that derive from Kraken’s efforts on behalf of investors, including Kraken’s strategies to obtain regular investment returns and payouts,” the SEC said in a release from February.  Kraken ended up settling with the SEC for $30 million.  Overall, the Shanghai upgrade appears only to have had a marginal effect on the Ethereum protocol and its token. On-chain data suggests that very little ether has been withdrawn, with only a -0.25% change in staked ether, according to Nansen.ai data.  In March, CryptoQuant noted that 60% of all staked ether is held at a loss and suggested that the selling pressure on ether would be low after the Shanghai upgrade.  Nansen's Andrew Thurman noted on Twitter that ""the majority of withdrawals are [addresses] withdrawing their rewards, not their rewards and full stake.""  More recent data from Nansen shows that the average price of staked ether on Lido is worth $2,552. Liquid staking system Lido makes up around 31% of all ether deposits.  Data shows that 4.35 million ether, or about 24%, is staked at above $3000, a price point not seen since April 2022.

42387717,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQqUUP,1681369200,High Hopes for EU’s MiCA Law With Final Vote Imminent,"Proponents of the European Union’s forthcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation say it will have an effect beyond its limited scope – and the race to seize the bloc’s crypto crown has begun even before a final vote on the law.  After several years of consultation and lawmaker haggling, a final text of MiCA is set to be voted on by the European Parliament later this month. The law would likely then enter into force in July, with major provisions kicking in between 12 and 18 months later.  On paper, MiCA sets out to regulate those issuing crypto assets, ensuring white papers of investor information are honest. Providers of linked services – like crypto custodians, advisors or exchanges – will have to apply to one of 27 national authorities to get a license to operate across the whole bloc.  Beyond its limited scope, the hope is that it will also offer a wider halo of credibility to a sector that is sorely in need of it after a year of market turmoil. Both industry and government are certainly talking up MiCA’s significance.  “A crypto asset service provider, a CASP, will be a brand in the European Union… a kind of stamp of approval of the sector,” Rok Žvelc, a European Commission staffer who formed part of MiCA’s drafting team, told a Brussels event on March 30. “Investors will know that if they turn to CASPs, they will have all the protections that MiCA provides.”  Stablecoins  Companies squarely affected, such as stablecoin operators, are also upbeat.  “MiCA is an incredibly positive stop and a global regulatory landscape for crypto assets,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice president for policy and regulatory strategy at Circle, which hopes to use the new regulation as a springboard for its euro coin (EUROC), denominated in EU currency.  EU policymakers – alarmed first by Facebook’s Libra initiative, then by the dramatic collapse of terraUSD (UST) – said cryptocurrencies tied to other assets such as fiat should hold sufficient reserves, with trading volumes capped if they’re tied to foreign currency.  In spite of those restrictions, the new law is welcome, Baker-Taylor said.  “Just having clarity around what the rules of the road are ... is incredibly beneficial for the industry and for those market participants,” Baker-Taylor told CoinDesk. “Equally, I think it's incredibly beneficial for Europe's competitiveness.”  Much recent debate has focused on what MiCA doesn’t cover – crypto lending and staking, decentralized finance, and non-fungible tokens, all of which will be dealt with by further regulations if at all. It doesn’t go far enough to deal with major players such as Binance, the European Central Bank’s Elizabeth McCaul warned in a recent blog.  Yet, it still represents a significant step: It's the first time a major jurisdiction, comprising some 450 million people, implements a stable framework targeting the sector. Its benefits could be felt widely.  SettleMint – a Belgian company that offers blockchain platforms as a service to other businesses – isn’t directly affected by MiCA’s precepts. But the law could embolden potential customers, such as banks, to try out innovations like tokenized bonds, Chief Executive Officer Matthew Van Niekerk told CoinDesk.  “What holds them back is regulatory uncertainty,” in both the areas MiCA covers and related issues such as personal data protection, he said, adding that Europe is “100% going in the right direction” toward offering that greater clarity.  MiCA could also be the hook for countries that want to impose extra measures – such as France, whose recent proposed restrictions on social media influencers would prohibit publicity for any crypto company that doesn’t hold a license.  A strange race  With so much at stake, EU member countries are in a race to see which of them can become the crypto hub of choice. In principle, MiCA sets a consistent level of rules to be followed across the bloc; in practice, national authorities may end up differing in how they implement and enforce.  It’s a race not everyone’s trying to win. Dutch regulators have already said they aren’t prepared to cut corners in an effort to win business. There may also be more than one winner as different countries play to their strengths: The likes of Belgium could end up majoring on business-to-business blockchain services rather than, say, crypto for the retail market, Van Niekerk said.  But for the time being there does seem to be a clear leader – France, recently selected by Circle as its European home, whose existing regime known as PSAN has already registered some 66 crypto companies, including Binance, eToro and Societe Generale.  Though not the only EU country to anticipate MiCA – Malta, Estonia and Germany are among those with national regimes – France struck the right balance between attracting investment, protecting consumers and stabilizing markets, Baker-Taylor reckons. The similarities of PSAN and MiCA mean there’ll be a less bumpy landing for companies and regulators as they move from one regime to the other.  In other parts of Europe, the industry is wondering if they shouldn’t be following suit – like in Portugal, a country that attracted a significant crypto crowd in part thanks to a sympathetic tax regime, but which could now start to lose out.  “We have urged the authorities to anticipate the impacts of MiCA,” Hugo Volz Oliveira, secretary and founding member at industry group Instituto New Economy, told CoinDesk.  Oliveira’s concern is with the regulators who, in principle, need to put their heads together and decide on administrative procedures for companies to convert existing registrations into a MiCA license.  Spokespeople for both the Portuguese securities commission and central bank told CoinDesk they were preparing for MiCA, but that further details would only follow once rules are formalized.  Yet, the longer crypto companies are left in the dark, the more they – and the wider economy – will suffer, Oliveira worries.  “Portugal will be very likely to lose the race” to become a crypto hub, he said, meaning fewer applications for regulators to process. “That’s good for bureaucrats, but bad for the country.”  Read more: MiCA at the Door: How European Crypto Firms Are Getting Ready for Sweeping Legislation",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/13/high-hopes-for-eus-mica-law-with-final-vote-imminent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cdb9a1a6f38d5cbcd1514ee6fde384f705e48e4-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Losses could total over $11 million and occurred on Aave version 1, the data suggested. These were spread over U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins dai (DAI), tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD) and tru USD (TUSD).  Aave version (v)1 was previously thought to be affected by the exploit. However, Aave developers said the protocol was unaffected and merely used to swap tokens to conduct the exploit, which mainly involved Yearn Finance's yUSD stablecoin.  ""We need to clarify that the root cause is due to misconfigured yUSDT, not related to Aave,"" PeckShield said in a follow-up tweet following the initial flag.  PeckShield said exploiters were able to mint over 1.2 quadrillion yUSDT in early Asian hours using a $10,000 initial deposit, which was then used to trick the Yearn Finance protocol to eventually cash out millions in stablecoins.  Elsewhere, Marc Zeller, founder at Aave-Chan initiative and former Aave integration lead, said in a tweet that the impact to the protocol was limited as version 1 was ""frozen since December 2022.""  ""The current size of v1 is $18 [million], and the current size of the Aave safety module is $382.50M,"" Zeller said, adding in a separate tweet that version 2 and version 3 of Aave were not impacted at writing time.  UPDATE (April 13, 07:53 UTC): Clarifies Aave was not directly impacted and that Yearn Finance's yUSD caused the exploit instead.

BTC could start another increase if it clears the $30,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin corrected lower and tested the $29,650 support zone. The price is trading above $29,650 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a major declining channel forming with resistance near $30,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a strong increase if there is a close above the $30,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price started a downside correction from the $30,550 zone. BTC declined below the $30,000 support zone. There was also a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $28,200 swing low to the $30,586 high. However, the bulls were active near the $29,650 zone. Besides, the US CPI posted another decline to 5% in March 2023. It helped BTC to remain in a positive zone above the $29,650 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $29,800 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $30,586 swing high to the $29,645 low. Immediate resistance is near the $30,250 level.

Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $30,500 zone. A close above the $30,500 resistance might start a strong increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $31,200 level. The next key resistance is near the $32,000 level, above which BTC could rise toward the $33,500 level. Another Drop in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $30,250 resistance, it could another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $29,850 level. The next major support is near the $29,650 zone. A downside break and close below the $29,650 support might push the price back toward $29,200 or the 100 hourly Simple moving average.

42387725,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQqUwT,1681348474,"First Mover Asia: Major Cryptos Remain Unstirred by Inflation Data, Ethereum Shanghai Fork","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether were trading flat after a mildly encouraging inflation report and the unveiling of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.  Insights: Go whale watching for a sense of where bitcoin's price might be headed, writes CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams writes.  Prices  Bitcoin, Ether Remain Largely Unmoved by Major Events  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,317.72 −5.6 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $29,984 −258.2 ▼ 0.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,906 +15.7 ▲ 0.8% S&P 500 daily close  4,091.95 −17.0 ▼ 0.4% Gold  $2,032 +27.6 ▲ 1.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.42% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETCoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,317.72 −5.6 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $29,984 −258.2 ▼ 0.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,906 +15.7 ▲ 0.8% S&P 500 daily close 4,091.95 −17.0 ▼ 0.4% Gold $2,032 +27.6 ▲ 1.4% Treasury Yield 10 Years 3.42% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Neither hotly anticipated inflation data nor an eagerly awaited Ethereum Shanghai upgrade could move bitcoin or ether much from their most recent perches.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at about $29,900, down the better part of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was hovering around $1,905, up almost a percentage point. Many investors had been looking for both cryptos to react more strongly to Wednesday's events, particularly the Ethereum ""hard fork,"" a continuation of the platform's transformation from a proof-of-work to a faster, more efficient proof-of-stake protocol.  ""We should be looking ahead at what’s in store for the Ethereum roadmap,"" Jake Boyle, director of retail crypto brokerage Caleb & Brown, wrote. ""A lot of progress has been made, and a lot is going to be made. This paints a wildly optimistic picture going forward.""  Boyle added: ""We are heading into a recession, or at least it seems that way, and retail investors would be the profile of investors that would sell in the situation we find ourselves in. But this doesn’t seem to be the case, and this suggests to me that the profile of investors in the Ethereum ecosystem right now tends to be larger-scale. They appear to be more institutional-grade, and I don’t think that kind of investor would be quick to sell at this moment in time. They're long-term focused.”  Most other major cryptos were recently trading flat. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance, was recently down about a half percentage point. Equity indexes fell slightly with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 off 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold continued to hold strongly over $2,039, near its all-time high as investors look toward assets that hold their value.  Meanwhile, in an email to CoinDesk, Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, CEO at noncustodial platform Allnodes, struck an upbeat note about Ethereum's future.  ""With previously locked ETH becoming available again, it could lead to ""a rise in the staking ratio, increased liquidity, and potentially higher prices,"" Boyko-Romanovsky wrote. ""As the staking ratio rises, it will boost network security, a crucial indicator of blockchain health, and decrease the amount of circulating ETH.""  He added: ""Early stakers will be able to reinvest their staking rewards. At the same time, removing uncertainty related to undetermined ETH lock-up periods will likely generate more interest in staking among retail and institutional participants.""  Insights  Bitcoin Whales May Forecast BTC's Price Path  As bitcoin establishes new support at around $30,000, investors might want to track larger unique wallet addresses. Among wallets holding significant amounts of crypto to determine BTC's price path:  The number of wallets holding between one and 99 BTC and those with more than 10,000 BTC has been growing since January.  Over the same period, the number of wallets holding between 100 and 9,999 BTC has also been growing.  Whales holding at least 10,000 bitcoins have been willing to pivot quickly. While the bias is upwards, these larger traders have been willing to enter and exit positions, taking profits at short-term peaks, and retreating as the price retraces.  Investors on the precipice of 10,000 BTC may be optimistic, locked into the asset and increasing their exposure – ready to move into a higher tier.  Their positions may represent a base of support for BTC prices because investors who went long on the digital asset in January are up 80% year to date.
