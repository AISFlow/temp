42375906,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCQmZ,1636500651,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Enters ‘Extreme Greed’ Territory; Altcoins Rally,"Good morning, Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin enters “extreme greed” territory.  Technician’s take: Buyers could return on price dips into Asian trading session.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $67,293  Ether (ETH): $4,745  Market moves  Bitcoin was roughly flat the past 24 hours, trading at about $67,300 at the time of publication. The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization spent most of U.S. trading hours on Tuesday ranging between $63,500 and $68,500, with a slightly elevated volume across major centralized exchanges. Ether was down about 1.3% over the same period, trading at just above $4,700.  Data collected by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume has risen in the past two days, but it is still far from the high level last seen on Oct. 15. As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole wrote in his U.S. First Mover newsletter Tuesday, a low-volume price rally is often short-lived.  Meanwhile, the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which entered “extreme greed” territory on Tuesday, was at the highest level since Oct. 21, which preceded a sharp sell-off in bitcoin. The index measures market emotions: When investors are too greedy, the market may be due for a correction soon.  The kind of FOMO (fear of missing out) on the current market is also reflected in the rally of several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), such as loopring (LRC), livepeer (LPT) and litecoin (LTC). According to analysts, the reasons behind these rallies are more speculative than market fundamentals (notice that the three tokens share similar tickers).  “I don’t know if there’s a specific catalyst for livepeer’s recent price performance,” Messari research analyst Mason Nystrom said. He pointed out that the most recent development on Livepeer, an open-source video platform based on Ethereum, was the acquisition of MistServer, a streaming media server, on Oct. 19.  There have been rumors that the Loopring project is helping GameStop build its first non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. Daniel Wang, CEO of Loopring, said “no comment” on the GameStop hearsay to CoinDesk. At the time of publication, GameStop had not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin rally stalls; could find support at $63K-$65K  Bitcoin (BTC) is relinquishing some gains after reaching an all-time high near $68,500 on Monday. The cryptocurrency is overbought on intraday charts, although support around the $63,000-$65,000 range could stabilize a pullback.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is the most overbought since Oct. 20, which preceded a near-10% price decline. Still, pullbacks have been shallow over the past few weeks as buyers remain active on breakouts.  The 100-period moving average on the four-hour chart is sloping upward, indicating positive trend strength over the short-term. This means buyers could eventually return on price dips into the Asian trading session.

The first token will work as a cashback reward for Comerc customers who generate renewable energy through the company’s distributed generation system, Sou Vagalume. The company plans to allow the purchase of the token for a fixed amount and later to offer the digital asset for trading in a secondary market.  Users of Sou Vagalume now get 15% to 20% off their total electricity bills.  Comerc has 5,000 customers using its distributed generation system, although it expects to reach 150,000 customers by the end of 2022.  Roberto Dagnoni, CEO of 2TM Group, the holding company for Mercado Bitcoin, said that if a customer has a monthly expense of 1,000 Brazilian reais (about $180), he would receive 150 Brazilian reais converted into tokens per month.  According to Dagnoni, both companies are completing the legal and regulatory details and the product should be ready in December or January.  Bitcoin Market and Comerc plan to launch a second token, backed by the International REC Standard, a certificate that documents electricity consumption from renewable energy sources. It is still in preliminary stages, Reuters reported.  In June, Mercado Bitcoin raised $200 million from the SoftBank Latin America Fund in a Series B funding round .

42410965,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkTC,1636498315,DEXs Have Grown the Most as Competition Among Crypto Exchanges Intensifies: Chainalysis,"Decentralized exchanges (DEX) have grown massively since 2019, while the number of active exchanges – whether centralized or decentralized – has dropped in the same time period, according to Chainalysis’ latest report.  This finding, which the blockchain data firm published Tuesday, showed that as cryptocurrency exchange competition has intensified, the crypto market – especially large, sophisticated crypto traders – has favored exchanges with high innovation and scalability.  “DEXs have become extremely popular, which coincides with the explosive growth of the DeFi (decentralized finance) category in general,” the report concluded.  The number of active DEXs has climbed significantly since 2019, according to Chainalysis, but the monthly number of active cryptocurrency exchanges dropped to 672 in August 2021 from a peak of 845 in August 2020.  The Chainalysis report separated exchanges into six categories: centralized exchanges, DEXs, high-risk exchanges with few know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, over-the-counter (OTC) brokers and derivatives exchanges – based on their business models and technical infrastructure.  As a result, the blockchain data firm also reported that the number of large DEXs and the total value they have received have grown the most by far since August 2020.  “We see that DEX users carry out much larger transactions than centralized exchange users,” the report said. “This is likely because DeFi is also more popular in countries with bigger, more established cryptocurrency markets, which also tend to be wealthier countries.”  David Gogel, growth lead at popular DEX dYdX, told Chainalysis in the report that the majority of DeFi users are “established cryptocurrency investors or traders” seeking “new sources of alpha.”  Centralized exchanges: Still important  The report also noted that despite the DEXs’ growth, large-sized centralized exchanges remain an important market player.  Large centralized exchanges, including derivatives, spot, fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto, grew significantly in value received between August 2020 and August 2021.  “As cryptocurrency adoption grows, most new users will acquire their first cryptocurrency through centralized exchanges, as these are typically the easiest services to exchange fiat currency for different types of cryptocurrency,” the report said.  Another interesting trend is that a larger number of unique crypto assets available on a platform correlate with higher transaction volume. But bitcoin and ether remain the most traded tokens on exchanges overall.  “The centralized exchanges that continue to grow appear to be those offering the widest variety of assets, which keeps them attractive to the most active traders,” the report added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/09/decentralized-exchanges-saw-biggest-growth-as-exchange-competition-heats-up-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1de7239857c68a62545887136f9d1ad9b06ece0-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCQnp,1636498112,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Outperforms as Traders Prepare for Next Leg Higher,"Bitcoin’s rally faded on Tuesday, suggesting that buyers took some profits at around the $68,500 all-time price high.  The cryptocurrency is up about 5% over the past week, compared with a 3% rise in ether over the same period.  Despite a short-term pullback, some analysts are maintaining upward price targets for both BTC and ETH over the next month.  “There is a positive sentiment that often engulfs the crypto markets toward year’s end,” Galina Likhitskaya, vice president at smart contract audit company HashEx, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Likhitskaya has a price target around $80,000 for BTC by the end of the year, and a $5,500 target for ETH during the same period. ETH is currently at $4,777.  “Analysts are suggesting $75,000 as a target on the upside, but if the price takes a turn downwards the price could fall to the 50-day moving average at around $56,000,” Jonas Luethy, a trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $67,375, +1.93%  Ether (ETH): $4,777, +0.32%  S&P 500: $4,685, -0.35%  Gold: $1,832, +0.42%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.43%  Trading BTC relative to ETH  “Bitcoin is oversold versus ether, and likely to see short-term outperformance as cryptocurrencies digest their gains in a consolidation phase,” Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, wrote in a research report.  “The uptick to multi-day highs in BTC/ETH likely signals a switch to better relative outperformance in bitcoin to ethereum, but more is needed to confirm this move,” Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at FundStrat wrote in a research report.  Overall, analysts agree that BTC’s breakout to an all-time high could signal the start of a final leg higher this quarter. However, cryptocurrencies could see a “more pronounced consolidation into next year,” Newton wrote.  Decline in CME bitcoin futures open interest  The number of open contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is down 32% from its Oct. 25 peak, which could indicate reduced institutional presence in the bitcoin futures market at the moment, according to Arcane Research.  The surge in bitcoin futures open interest, or total number of outstanding derivative contracts, over the past month coincided with the launch of the first bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) introduced by ProShares, trading under the ticker BITO. “Now, the open interest has declined substantially, particularly when subtracting the BITO contribution,” Arcane wrote in a research report.     Some analysts expect recent market hype surrounding ETFs to fade, at least until a spot bitcoin ETF is approved sometime next year.  So far, BITO has lagged behind BTC’s price rally since inception. The ETF launch contributed to bitcoin’s previous all-time price high around $66,900 on Oct. 20.  Crypto fund flows rise  Digital asset products saw inflows totaling $174 million last week, bringing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $8.9 billion. This is a significant increase from the $6.7 billion pumped into digital assets in 2020.  Total assets under management (AUM) have also reached an all-time high of $80 billion, with bitcoin and ether leading the chart with roughly $53 billion and $20 billion, respectively.  Inflows in bitcoin-focused funds totaled $95 million last week, with a year-to-date record of $6.4 billion invested in the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Meanwhile, funds focused on ether saw inflows of $31 million last week.  Altcoin roundup  Neon Labs raises $40 million to bring EVM functionality to Solana: Neon Labs announced a $40 million fundraising round led by Jump Capital with participation from IDEO CoLab Ventures, Solana Capital, Three Arrows Capital and others, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. Neon Labs is the developer of Neon, a software environment on Solana that lets developers build applications using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and allows them to write smart contracts in familiar coding languages and use tools like wallet interface MetaMask. The project aims to bring Ethereum’s computation engine to Solana.  Ripple to launch liquidity service for six cryptocurrencies: Fintech firm Ripple will launch a product called the “Ripple Liquidity Hub” to give business customers access to the BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, BCH, and XRP, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported.

Down the road, Ripple plans to add features such as support for staking and yield-generating functions as well as getting liquidity from decentralized exchanges, RippleNet General Manager Asheesh Birla said.  Solana’s growth strategy is going mobile: Top brass at Solana Labs, which builds on the proof-of-stake ecosystem, waxed bullish on mobile wallet integrations in the past week, with Head of Growth Matty Tay saying Phantom’s yet-to-launch mobile wallet could “open the floodgates” to millions of new users, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. Mobile wallets wouldn’t be completely new for Solana. A number of crypto exchanges already let users send, stake and store SOL from their phones. Solana will also become wallet analysis company Nansen’s first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine chain, it was announced Tuesday.

42421692,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Sv,1636498081,"What FATF’s Latest Guidance Means for DeFi, Stablecoins and Self-Hosted Wallets","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s long-awaited update to its guidance on virtual assets lays out a comprehensive set of guidelines to regulate the quickly evolving cryptocurrency space. With this update released, digital assets firms in the coming years are likely to encounter more clarity on anti-money-laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations around the globe, even if some jurisdictions do opt for more restrictive policies than others.  The intergovernmental body’s updated guidance should not surprise anyone who has been tracking regulator discussion on crypto illicit finance, but it does address topics that have faced great regulatory uncertainty, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and “travel rule” compliance.  Yaya J. Fanusie is a former CIA analyst and the chief strategist at Cryptocurrency AML Strategies, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C. He also is an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, focusing on U.S. national security and anti-money-laundering issues relating to digital assets.  What it offers is not one way of dealing with these issues, but it unpacks and defines the risks that jurisdictions must address, often providing a diversity of approaches to keep emerging digital asset developments within a solid regulatory perimeter.  Here are some key takeaways for regulators, along with practical implications for the digital asset industry.  DeFi usually isn’t decentralized  FATF warns regulators to not blindly accept the crypto industry marketing that loosely calls various platforms “decentralized.” In function, these platforms typically have a natural, if not legal, person somewhere who controls or influences their activities. The term “controls or influences” is key and offers a framework to analyze who should be the entity obliged to follow AML/CFT regulations. In FATF’s view, almost all DeFi platforms are still Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP). FATF offers a broad playbook for bringing DeFi platforms under regulatory oversight, including one suggestion that if a DeFi platform truly has no entity running it, a jurisdiction could order that a VASP be put in place as its obliged entity.  Implications: The rise of new DeFi platforms probably will slow in 2022. And there will likely be contentious legal battles between regulators and blockchain entrepreneurs over who “controls or influences” various DeFi protocols. It is also likely that many organizers of DeFi platforms will start accelerating attempts to become truly decentralized, such as trying to dissolve the on- and off-chain ties that specific individuals may have with platforms. DeFi platforms that operate without following AML/CFT requirements like other regulated VASPs will increasingly be seen as riskier enterprises by those VASPs. DeFi activity is not going to go away but it will probably shrink, just as the once-booming initial coin offering (ICO) phase did a few years ago.  Keep stablecoin projects on a short leash before launch  According to FATF, there is one major factor that determines the risks from stablecoins: the potential for wide market adoption. FATF emphasizes that jurisdictions must supervise stablecoin projects before they launch and ensure that these projects have AML/CFT mitigation measures in place in the planning stage.  Implications: Launching a global stablecoin that is truly “global” is likely to get more difficult in the coming year. Regulators will likely feel more urgency to oversee stablecoin issuers and to establish rules and procedures specific to this type of cryptoasset. And although FATF focuses on AML/CFT and sanctions regulation, it seems likely that other types of financial regulators will be emboldened to assert their authority over stablecoins in their respective areas of oversight (e.g., securities regulation, consumer protection, etc.). The United States government certainly is in line with FATF’s take on stablecoins, with the Biden administration last week calling for the U.S. Congress to introduce legislation that increases regulatory oversight on stablecoin issuers.  You can’t stop unhosted wallets...  ... but VASPs can restrict users’ engagement with them, as appropriate  FATF does not recommend the outright banning of such wallets, where the private keys that control the funds are held by the user rather than an exchange or another centralized entity. Instead, it pushes regulators to pursue a risk-based approach.  The guidance acknowledges that unhosted wallets lack VASP oversight and thus bring certain risks by not having an obliged entity as an intermediary. Still, FATF explains that regulators need to study the nature and extent of the risks around unhosted wallets in their jurisdictions and manage those risks accordingly. The guidance suggests that one appropriate risk-based approach might be for VASPs to restrict or even prohibit their users from transacting with unhosted wallets. But again, policies should depend on the risk environment and VASPs should use technical tools like blockchain analysis software to counter much of the risk. There is not a one-size-fits-all approach for dealing with unhosted wallets.  Implications: Unhosted wallets have long faced some scrutiny from serious and compliant VASPs and that scrutiny is likely to increase, especially until VASPs develop formal risk-based restrictions such as transaction or volume limits between their users and unhosted wallets. FATF’s directive to study and understand the risks around unhosted wallets may be a boon to blockchain analysis firms. It also may encourage blockchain privacy advocates to double down on their support for anonymizing software. The regulated crypto space is likely to grow, but the unhosted ecosystem will remain as a niche area with significant development and innovation.  VASPs need to get on board with the travel rule already  FATF makes it clear that VASPs must comply with the travel rule and should not let perfect be the enemy of the good.  Even if the crypto industry does not have an agreed-upon compliance solution, VASPs must do what they can to record, and pass on to the next institution, the data about sender and recipient that the rule requires. There are lots of possible technologies that would do this, and FATF leaves it up to the industry to implement as appropriate.  Probably the handiest part of this update is a table with all the information that VASPs need to record and/or transmit, depending on whether the entity is the originator or beneficiary of a virtual asset transaction (see Table 1 on page 59). Also, FATF acknowledges the importance of data handling and privacy and hammers home the point that VASPs must do due diligence on counterparty VASPs before sharing travel rule-related data with them.  Implications: This should accelerate the industry’s experimentation with travel rule compliance. At the very least, some VASPs may not wait for industry-wide solutions and will probably try to create their own channels and mechanisms to comply, even if this may be an inefficient approach overall. But if there was any skepticism in the industry about the need to implement the travel rule, there’s little room for debate on it any more.  Loose ends  I noticed two things purposefully left out of the update that I believe are important.  One, this guidance explicitly does not relate to central bank digital currencies (CBDC). There is a good reason for this. CBDCs will likely be regulated as fiat currencies and including them under the guidance for permissionless virtual assets may complicate matters. Plus, there are only a few CBDCs that have actually launched. It would be a bit premature for FATF to address CBDCs. However, as CBDC pilots progress, they will deserve more attention by FATF. CBDCs will not proliferate without bringing new financial crime risks, as I spelled out last year in a Lawfare paper.  The other thing left out of the guidance is the risk arising from the potential of merchants widely adopting virtual assets as payments for goods and services. FATF specifies that a merchant accepting cryptocurrencies is not a VASP, but that a company that processes crypto payments on a merchant’s behalf is one. As with CBDCs, it may be premature to develop AML/CFT and sanctions guidance for the merchant crypto payments that don’t involve an intermediary payment processor. But regulators will have to give attention to this if merchant crypto payments scale up, especially if a significant number of merchants use unhosted wallets, as I discussed earlier this year in this article.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Yaya Fanusie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/09/what-fatfs-latest-guidance-means-for-defi-stablecoins-and-self-hosted-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08a65e877c787594e21ae5dbecb5b1904a13b98b-1440x1173.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading | Shiba Inu Beats Out Cardano, Dogecoin On Top 10 Watch-Listed Tokens Following the general market sentiment, Cardano seems poised for further upside with an important resistance at $2.5.

Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter also missed at $1.62 versus expectations of $1.81.  Coinbase posted $1.1 billion in transaction revenue in the third quarter, down from about $1.9 billion in the second quarter, the company said.  Q3 trading volume was $327 billion, down from $462 billion in Q2.  Coinbase had 7.4 million retail monthly transacting users (MTUs) in Q3, down from 8.8 million in Q2, but up from 2.1 million in the year-ago quarter.  As for its outlook, Coinbase said that “while we entered Q3 with softer crypto market conditions, driven by low volatility and declining crypto asset prices, market conditions improved meaningfully later in the quarter which we have continued to see into early Q4.”  The company had previously warned that its number of multiple transacting users (MTU) and trading volume would be lower in the third quarter than the second quarter.  Shares of Coinbase were down roughly 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday to $315 following the release of the results. They are still up roughly 26% from their reference price of $250. But they are still down from their opening trading price of $381.  Coinbase reported that the percentage of total trading volume coming from bitcoin continued to decline, falling to 19% from 24% in Q2 and 39% in Q1. Ether trading volume dipped from 26% of the total in Q2 to 22% in Q3. Meanwhile, trading volume for other crypto assets rose from 50% of the total in Q2 to 59% in Q3.

42375905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCQk3,1636490010,DAO Backed by Deadmau5 to Launch on Multiple Platforms,"While many musicians have used non-fungible tokens (NFT) to connect with their fans, MODA DAO is using the digital tokens as a governance tool for artists and their managers to control royalty contracts.  The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is pairing its NFT music streaming platform with its governance token, MODA, which is set for release on multiple blockchains, MODA DAO announced Tuesday.  The company said it will release a portion of its token supply on the Ethereum, Fantom, Near and Polygon blockchains by the end of November.  Artists have released their music and concert tickets as NFTs before, but governance through NFTs in the industry remains uncharted territory. The concept has caught the attention of electronic music producer and performer deadmau5, who is backing the project as an advisor and DAO member.  “I see the Web 3 ecosystem growing alongside streaming services, and eventually becoming more significant to the artists,” deadmau5 told CoinDesk in a statement. “This new [MODA DAO] world is creating new ways for artists to take ownership of their music, but it will take a while to scare the Spotify and Apple Musics of the world.”  With a MODA token, artists can register their music to be streamed on the MODA DAO platform. The company is targeting musicians and their managers as token holders, giving them a say in the royalties they receive for music released on the platform.  Revenue earned from songs published on the DAO’s platform is split three ways among the artists, the rewards pool and a token buyback program. MODA DAO told CoinDesk that it’s also working toward creating a decentralized finance-type lending program where artists can loan against their musical IP on-chain.  MODA DAO also gives token holders access to in-house blockchain products such as its new “audio fingerprinting” technology, which allows artists to mint and sell raw audio files of songs as NFTs before the songs have been approved to be published on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.  Deadmau5 has been involved in numerous NFT-related projects since 2020, including a recent collaboration with visual artist Gregory Siff that merged physical and digital artwork at a music festival in November.  MODA DAO raised $5 million in a private token sale in October and says it manages more than 10 billion music streams per month.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/dao-backed-by-deadmau5-to-launch-on-multiple-platforms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66c5d2760e4eb84da2974323363f5641532f46c8-1600x1068.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Periods of such sentiment have lead to corrections in the past, but will the trend be similar this time? Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Starts Pointing At Extreme Greed As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the fear and greed index is now pointing at extreme greed as BTC makes a new ATH. The fear and greed index is a Bitcoin indicator that shows what the current crypto market sentiment is. The metric uses a numeric scale that ranges from zero to hundred to display the sentiment. Values below fifty signal that the market is currently sharing fear, while values above it imply investors are becoming greedy. If the indicator&apos;s value goes above 75 or below 25, then it means the market is showing extreme greed or extreme fear, respectively. Periods with extreme values suggest the market could witness a reversal soon. A correction may follow extreme greed values, and a change to uptrend may follow from an extremely fearful market.

42421686,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9On,1636483653,Missed the ENS Airdrop? Here Are the Crypto Projects Rumored to ‘Decentralize’ Next,"Some people were annoyed when they heard Ethereum Name Service, more commonly known as ENS, would be issuing a token. It was the “one, legitimate tokenless project,” and it was bending the knee to the market. Tokens are speculative by nature, prone to severe price fluctuations and reminiscent of carnivals. Do they cheapen the prospects of a so-called public good?  Whatever reservations people had, there are plenty of good reasons to retroactively reward early adopters of – perhaps, speculators in – a crypto project. Airdrops distribute influence and wealth to early users and pay back some of their opportunity costs. It strengthens the community around the code and serves as marketing for the next wave of adopters.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ENS went with a broad distribution: sending a tidy sum of tokens (25 million total) to those who purchased or were given their brand of non-fungible tokens (or NFTs, those “.eth” names you may have seen around social media) used as domain names. Token holders will form the foundation of the protocol’s decentralized government and hold sway over what comes next.  In a way, yesterday’s airdrop announced that ENS has arrived. Often compared to the current web’s “domain naming system,” which uses “human readable” names for IP addresses, ENS is a functioning, alternate, open-source way for individual users to own their little corners of the web. Or Web 3, more accurately. Uniswap, Curve and 1inch all issued tokens over the past year and have seen measurable growth.  But not everyone wants to own their domain name (DanielKuhn.eth is still open). Many may have been skeptical of this whole “future of the web” thing or otherwise been turned off by high gas fees needed to do anything on the Ethereum blockchain. They lost out on free money this time around. But it’s OK, opportunities abound to build a little wealth in the next generation of the web.  The key is to just start using the stack of applications and protocols operating today. The decentralized web promises to reward users for their time and efforts. And key to that: It needs actual users. Some of these protocols may issue tokens in the future, others won’t – I don’t have any direct insight. Here’s a community sourced spreadsheet of rumored projects that may do the token thing (including projects that exist on alternate blockchains like Solana, Polkadot and Terra).  MetaMask, one of the key gateways into Web 3 with 10 million monthly active users, is considering a token. The rumor started when Joseph Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, the development hub that built MetaMask and a host of other essential Ethereum tools, tweeted “Wen $MASK? Stay tuned.” (He was responding to my colleague Andrew Thurman.)  Considering the influence JPMorgan has at ConsenSys, Thurman is skeptical that the popular wallet plugin will decentralize anytime soon, but we’ll just say for now that the $MASK ticker is already taken.

Coinbase, FTX and other massive crypto incumbents have announced plans for their own NFT platforms, and nimble startups are stealing market share. A token may be a way to retain users in the increasingly competitive market, in the same way that Uniswap was forced to decentralize during “DeFi Summer.”  Just about any crypto project that doesn’t yet have a token is in the running.

42375899,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwCQf1,1636481570,ETH-BTC Chart Points to Ether Leadership Ahead,"While bitcoin appears to be pulling the broader market higher right now, ether may take the lead in the coming weeks.  The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) weekly chart shows a bull pennant – a technical pattern marked by converging trendlines, indicating an impending continuation of the ether-bitcoin ratio’s upward move from 0.023 to 0.08 seen early this year.  A move above the upper trendline would confirm a breakout or shift in market leadership toward ether.  “It does look like a bull pennant,” Daniel Kukan, senior cryptocurrency trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “I believe ether can take the lead towards the year-end against BTC.”  “We see levels of 0.08 in the near term,” Kukan added. The ratio was trading near 0.0705 at press time on Binance.  A bull pennant is formed when an initial higher move is followed by a narrowing price range or a consolidation phase. This consolidation is usually resolved to the higher side, allowing for an extension of the price rally.  The pattern is negated if the consolidation ends with a downside break. Recent flows in both the spot and options market support the bullish case in ether.  Bitcoin was trading at record highs near $68,200 at press time, while ether was changing hands at $4,800.  “ETH was dragged up to an all-time high at $4,740 [last week], but it was actually BTC flow driving the move,” Adam Farthing, chief risk officer at crypto liquidity provider and over-the-counter trader B2C2 Japan, said in a weekly note published Monday.

42411152,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kvW,1636480866,"The Social (Token) Network: Rally, Friends With Benefits and the Future of Branding","!llmind is a Grammy-winning producer. He collaborates with artists like Beyonce, Kanye West and Lin-Manuel Miranda – it’s a long list.  The secret to his success? A concept he calls “BLAP,” which originally stood for Beats, Love, Alcohol, Parties. He builds communities. This started back in 2007, in a Soho lounge called Katra, where he threw events for up-and-coming producers to dance, drink and swap ideas on how to collaborate.  “It turned into a mini networking event,” said !llmind, who then expanded to meet-ups in London, Berlin and across the U.S. He kept building. He launched an online business that sold tools to musicians, like the “BLAP Kit,” a digital drum kit of “over 2,100 one-shot WAV snares, kicks, hi-hats, percussion, claps, snaps and more.” (Along the way, BLAP evolved into Belief, Love, Action, Positivity.) Then he embraced Twitch, Discord and even virtual reality studios.  Then came the $BLAP coin.  In April, !llmind used Rally.io, a social tokens platform, to mint the $BLAP coin, which aims to create a sort of “local economy” for his fans and community. The token gives you perks. Let’s say you’re an aspiring producer, hoping to one day work with Kendrick Lamar. If you pony up enough $BLAP, you can send !llmind “melody templates” – like a four-bar guitar riff or a piano loop with no drums – and he’ll make you a custom beat. Or maybe you just want !llmind to give you a personalized video shoutout that you can post on Tik-Tok; send him some $BLAP and he’ll hook you up. BLAP can unlock online training courses, deals on his drum kits or a Zoom session to collaborate.  “This is the type of technology that I wish existed many, many years ago when I first started doing this,” said !llmind. And these are the types of things you can do with social tokens, the latest blockchain disruptor d’jour.  Quick primer: Social tokens come in three flavors, more or less: Creator tokens, community tokens and the token platforms. $BLAP is a creator token. “Friends with Benefits” is a community token. Rally is a token platform.  “Social tokens put the power in the hands of creators,” said Bremner Morris, the CEO of Rally, a former executive at Patreon, and – most impressively – somehow able to pull off a bold Clark Gable mustache. “Creators have an independent economy that they own wholly.” And creators can be almost anything: guitarists, DJs, tech influencers, thought leaders, celebrities or streamers on Twitch.  Creators can be college athletes. Historically, even the stars of NCAA football and basketball teams, who drive an estimated $18.9 billion in profit to their universities, have never received a nickel. Then something extraordinary happened: All nine Supreme Court justices agreed on something, deciding, in June, that student athletes could now profit from their NIL, or “names, images and likeness.” Suddenly they’re eligible for social tokens. “These college athletes have valuable brands, and they’re going to make a lot of money,” said Mason Nystrom, a research analyst at Messari who studies social tokens.  Read more: What Happens to a Social Token When Its Creator Dies?  Some have already started. Jaylen Clark, a sophomore guard on UCLA’s men’s basketball team – who also has a side hustle building a following on YouTube, Instagram and Tik-Tok – created the $JROCK coin on Rally. Bruins fans can buy $JROCK for the current price of $0.63, essentially betting on his future. They’re buying a new kind of equity. If, one day, Clark gets drafted into the NBA and becomes an All-Star? This could make his fans rich. (Note: Rally and Clark don’t view $JROCK as an equity, and Clark has repeatedly said that his coin is meant to unlock benefits for fans, not be used as speculation.)  Of course, it’s easy to visualize the reverse. Imagine if Greg Oden, the top prospect from the 2007 NBA draft, had been able to issue a social token. Oden was hailed as the second coming of Shaq. He was destined for the Hall of Fame. Then injuries torpedoed his career, forcing him into an early retirement. If you aped into an $ODEN token? Rekked.  Clark isn’t alone. Kayvon Thibodeaux, a defensive end for the Oregon Ducks (already with four sacks on the season), recently created the $JREAM coin on Rally. There are many others. The platform, which launched in October 2020, said it has 212 creators, of which 74% have built six-figure mini-economies with their tokens, and five have built ecosystems worth more than $1 million. Rally’s creators include the actress Felicia Day (who offers weekly hangouts for people who hold her $GEEX coin), the artist Jen Stark ($STARK holders can get virtual studio visits), and BT, the electronica DJ, who offers perks like private listening parties for upcoming albums.  To help ensure that creators are actually making good use of their tokens – and not just ignoring them – Rally doles out regular rewards to both creators and fans. Creators need to hit certain benchmarks to receive $RLY, such as weekly growth in the number of token holders. “The rewards have been fantastic for creators,” said Jeremiah Owyang, an influential tech blogger who used Rally to create a $JOW coin. Rally distributes an average of 2.2 million $RLY each week, according to Morris, or about $1.5 million at current prices. The share for each creator? “It’s thousands of U.S. dollars each week,” said Owyang. “And the rewards are not limited to the creators. My fans are winning with me.”  The catch  Are you a popular creator, tattoo artist, podcaster, pole vaulter, mime or maybe a 13-year-old TikTok star who amassed 7 million followers through the videos of you flipping pancakes, and you’re thinking of cashing in with a social token? Careful. Tokens take work. One overlooked challenge of social tokens, said Nystrom, is that “you kind of have to provide perpetual benefits.” In today’s world, if you monetize your network with a free newsletter that’s ad-supported, you can simply stop writing the newsletter when you get bored. “But if people are buying your token, you have to continue to provide value, or have some exit strategy, which is fairly challenging.”  Just ask Joon Ian Wong, a widely-respected crypto reporter and researcher (and CoinDesk alum), who decided, as an experiment, to launch a $JOON token. He did it partly out of intellectual curiosity. Wong was intrigued by research suggesting that community currencies can jump-start and accelerate a local economy, such as the pre-bitcoin experiment of the Brixton Pound in London.  So in June 2020 (a lifetime ago in crypto), using a platform called Roll, he launched the $JOON coin. “It’s true ... I have my own token now!” Wong tweeted at the time. Flash forward to now. His takeaway? “I discovered that it’s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token going,” Joon said, chuckling a bit. “Oh, that’s why central bankers have jobs, because you have to think of all these things.”  He had headache after headache. For example, when he launched the token, he needed to create a pool on Uniswap – this would let people buy it. “So then it’s like, oh, s**t, what’s my pair going to be?” Should he go with $JOON/ETH, letting people buy $JOON with ETH, or $JOON/USDC, using a stable-coin? He chose $JOON/ETH. Then he discovered that was a “terrible idea,” as the price of ETH was low at the time, but then continued to climb for the next year and a half, which meant that “all the ETH is taken out of the pool, and you’re left with a ton of $JOON, so you have to keep pumping ETH in.”  Then he had to distribute the damn tokens. “I couldn’t get it into the hands of people,” said Wong, even though he tried to give it away on Twitter. He tried a series of meet-ups, using a clever service called Kickback that tries to prevent no-shows; you stake $JOON tokens to RSVP, and if you no-show, the tokens are dished out to the people who bothered to attend.  “All of this was manually done, and it was just very cumbersome,” he said. (It’s likely that the platform of Rally, which hadn’t launched yet, would reduce much of this friction.) Then Roll was hacked, the $JOON was drained, and Joon eventually put the project behind him. But the $JOON token still exists in zombie mode. “Tokens never die,” said Joon, noting that if he’s somehow elected president tomorrow, “maybe someone would pump 1,000 ETH into that pool.”  Despite all of that, Wong remains bullish on social tokens, as “the concept clearly has a lot of resonance and traction with a wide variety of people.” He also likes that tokens are more than just a gussied up version of equity. “It’s a lot more like loyalty points,” he said, “which itself is a massive, massive industry.” Wong even serves as an advisor to Rally and works with Seed Club, an accelerator for token communities.  Which brings us to the second type of social token.  Friends with benefits  “Community tokens” are trickier to define. At heart, they “help members share in whatever upside there is of a community’s value,” said Nicole d’Avis, the education and community lead at Seed Club. She gives an example from her own life. As a mom, d’Avis spends a lot of time on Mom Instagram with the Mom bloggers. “There’s tremendous economic power behind that demographic,” she said. “And those platforms are profiting from the creative work of the community members.”  By “centralized platforms,” of course, we’re talking about the usual punching bags of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But think about Clubhouse. Its value skyrocketed during COVID. And how does it reward the contributions of its members? “The platform wasn’t that technologically advanced,” argues Alex Zhang, the de facto head of Friends with Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). “The people brought the value, and all of the value accrued to the platform layer.” It’s the people who spoke, it’s the people who listened, and it’s the people who got nothing. (Clubhouse, of course, would argue that members received value by enjoying the platform for free.)  More philosophically, Zhang sees this as an almost existential limitation of corporations, a problem we can only crack with DAOs and social tokens. “Corporations are a century-old institution,” said Zhang. “Most of them were built with the framework of selling goods and services… They were not designed for these grassroots, community generated social networks, where the product is the actual human, populating the platforms with their ideas and content.” He said that a new structure – fueled by social tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DAOs – is needed to “incentivize all the pieces in the game.”  But what do these community tokens do, exactly, besides the usual crypto speculation? In the case of Friends with Benefits, as Zhang explains it, the tokens play two roles: gating and compensation.  Read more: What Do DAOs Actually Do? - Will Gottsegen  The gating starts with membership. Friends with Benefits isn’t cheap. Aspiring members need to fill out an application, join a Discord server and then buy a whopping 75 FWB tokens; as of this writing, that’s a tab of around $8,000. Joon remembers an incredulous friend telling him, “This is ridiculous … You’re asking me to join Soho House [the exclusive social club], and it costs as much as joining Soho House, but there is no house.”  “That’s accurate,” Joon told his friend. But then he had a comeback. “Chris Dixon isn’t hanging out in Soho House … If you want to hang out with Chris Dixon, he’s in a freaking Discord server.” Dixon, of course, is a prominent internet entrepreneur and partner at Andreessen Horowitz … very much a friend with benefits. The FWB community is about the intersection of “culture and crypto,” with the implicit lure of hobnobbing with notables. And just a few days after my call with Joon, Dixon co-wrote a piece on why he’s investing in Friends with Benefits, believing it will enable “a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of the internet.”  The gating continues once you’re a FWB member. It’s free to read all of FWB’s content online, but it will cost you 1 FWB token to read the newsletter. The gating can be literal. Earlier this summer at Bitcoin Miami, FWB threw an “All Time High” party, but you’d need to pony up 10 FWB tokens to enter (more than $1000 at today’s prices). Are social tokens the new velvet rope?  The second use of the FWB token is compensation. A network of 150 contributors works on six different teams at FWB: Editorial, Product, Events, Membership, and Cities. These members don’t work for free. They’re paid in FWB tokens. For example, the tribe of FWBers soon encountered a problem that vexes many online communities: the sheer volume of conversation can be overwhelming, especially on the Discord server. It’s tough to keep up.  So a few plucky members scoured Discord for the most interesting posts, flagged them, and essentially created a “TLDR” summary that members could skim in a weekly email. The creators of this email were paid in FWB tokens, and the email itself cost 1 FWB token to read. Now scale this concept. In theory, all of the chores, projects and grunt work of online communities – which often gets neglected – could be incentivized and powered by social tokens. Such is the potential of hyper-local economies.  The line between “creator tokens” and “community tokens” can blur. It might even be a false distinction. !llmind is a creator, but he’s also building his community. Friends With Benefits, a tokenized community, is packed with creators. Or consider one of the first social tokens, $WHALE, launched in May 2020 by the prominent NFT collector who goes by “Whale Shark.” The token is inspired by an influencer (so a creator coin), but the 25,000 $WHALE token holders act as a community (and DAO) by voting on things like which NFTs they should buy or sell, what events they should plan or how to structure the WHALE monthly distribution budget. “Over the last 12 months, we have seen 40 proposals being voted on,” said Whale, whose $WHALE vault valuation is now “conservatively pushing close to $100 mil.”  $COKE coin?  Then there’s the angle for brands. Joon had compared tokens to “loyalty programs,” and this could be prescient. The chief marketing officer of every corporation on the planet, one could argue, should be paying attention to social tokens.  “Brands are 100% going to embrace this stuff,” said Jeff Kauffman, who has a deep background in marketing and advertising, and, like !llmind, has spent most of his career building communities, ever since that time in 2005 he launched a MySpace page for his local skydiving chapter. Kauffman has created a community token called $JUMP – as in Jump into Web 3.0 – filled with brand and marketing experts, and they’re all trying to figure out how to make social tokens work for brands.  The reason for Kauffman’s optimism? Users aren’t the only ones upset with Facebook. Brands are grumpy, too. “Facebook promised a direct connection between brands and consumers, but then Facebook pulled the ultimate rug,” said Kauffman. Facebook’s “rug pull” was switching to a pay-to-advertise model, such as telling brands they needed to fork over money to see their posts appear on timelines. “Brands don’t want to pay a sh**load on advertising, but they’re forced to by these big intermediaries,” said Kauffman. “The hope of social tokens is that brands can do what they really want to do, which is have a real relationship with customers, and build a real community.”  So will we soon see a $NIKE coin, a $PEPSI coin, a $TESLA coin? Yes and no. In the short term, Kauffman suspects that regulatory hurdles will keep traditional, publicly traded companies from creating their own tokens … but he expects them to partner with new communities. He gives the example of Patagonia. Imagine that a tokenized community forms around an environmental platform – let’s call it the $GREEN coin. “Patagonia cares a lot about the environment,” said Kauffman. “It’s not a stretch to see Patagonia partner with that community. That’s what we’re going to see in a really big way. Tokenized communities will partner with brands that share the same values.”  Or maybe the regulation concerns can all be conquered, and brands embrace tokens more directly. That’s what Owyang envisions. “Brands will convert their loyalty program points into social tokens,” said Owyang, just as many brands have aped into NFTs. Owyang is keeping careful track of the many, many brands now dabbling in NFTs (he wrote a nice summary), and the list spans from Jimmy Choo to Campbell’s Soup.  Tokens could be next. Unlike loyalty points, tokens are programmable and can be wired to do certain things. “Instead of United [frequent flyer] points, those will eventually be social tokens. Those will grant access to their website and premium content, and to watch movies on the plane,” said Owyang. Maybe this United token will let you access the lounge at the airport. Or if you tweet positive things about United, you’ll automatically get UNITED zapped to your wallet.  In this world of hyper-tokenism, it might be a breeze to move your rewards from one company to another. “Anyone who has ever tried to exchange points, like from Marriott to American, knows it’s a nightmare. It’s a horrible process,” said Nystrom. But what if both Marriott and American use social tokens, and they’re easily tradable in a liquid market on Uniswap or Coinbase? “It would be awesome,” said Nystrom, “and so much better for the companies, too.”  Maybe. But as !llmind reminded me, “It’s still super early.” He’s excited about the potential of his BLAP token community, but it’s a tiny slice of his overall pie. !llmind has 37,000 followers on Twitch, 106,000 followers on Twitter and 342,000 on Instagram. He has 615 holders of his BLAP coin.  “The entire system is very new,” said the producer, but he expects it to grow, and plenty of his bets have been right. Because at the end of the day, !llmind reasons, social tokens can help him and his peers “ultimately make a living as a creator.”  UPDATE (19:25 UTC, 11/9/21): This article has been updated to clarify that $JROCK is not equity, and that Jayden Clark sees his coin as unlocking benefits for fans, not as an asset for speculation.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c702d2323a0b43674704557e3c647559c5c997f5-4715x3143.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4LAQ,1636477962,Ethereum Name Service Tokens Soar After $500M+ Airdrop,"One of the most popular apps on Ethereum is enjoying a surge in price for its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance token following a widely lauded airdrop.  Ethereum Name Service, a protocol that issues non-fungible tokens (NFT) that can represent Ethereum addresses as well as web domains, launched an airdrop portal for its newly issued ENS token last night. Airdrops are a token distribution method that awards a portion of circulating tokens to Ethereum addresses that fulfill certain parameters, such as having purchased an NFT.  ENS NFT holders are currently eligible to claim tokens, with many users reporting allocations worth upwards of $20,000, and the project’s circulating market cap currently sits above $500 million.  In an unusual twist, the airdrop required a number of governance steps prior to claiming tokens, and an overnight price surge now has traders eyeing valuations in the tens of billions.  Constitutional convention  The claims process kicked off on Monday at 7 p.m. ET (12 a.m. UTC Tuesday).  Ethereum Name Service domain holders’ eligibility and allocation were determined using a formula that took into consideration both the amount of time an address held an ENS domain, as well as the duration of its future registration.  In what may be a first, in order to claim allocated tokens users had to vote on four articles of a foundational ENS governance constitution. These articles covered ensuring governance cannot revoke ENS ownership, allowing governance to alter registration prices, allowing governance the authority to integrate with other software naming conventions like DNS, and allowing governance control over a grants program.  Claimants then were required to delegate their token voting power before receiving their tokens. Applications for delegates opened last week, and include some of crypto’s most powerful organizations. The token already has support from Coinbase, the U.S. centralized exchange behemoth, which has not listed the token for sale but in a tweet yesterday said the company would be participating in governance. As of last night, Coinbase is the largest delegate:  The claims interface, the requirement to vote and delegate voting power prior to claiming tokens, and the smooth rollout have all been widely praised, and some have referred to it as among the most successful airdrops in crypto history.  “ENS is for the people,” said Ethereum Name Service director of operations Brantly Millegan in a statement to CoinDesk. “No investors, decentralized and the community can now set the key parameters of the protocol. This is the essence of Web 3.”  Price action  The token has been remarkably volatile in the roughly 12 hours since launching, sitting at $39.46 per ENS at the time of writing and up 119%.  Multiple traders added Ethereum liquidity to Uniswap v3 pools prior to any ENS tokens being released, leading to unusually high prices on the decentralized exchange’s interface:  Once released, users added liquidity to the automated market maker (AMM), and trading volume has been rising steadily ever since. Per CoinGecko, the token has cracked the top 200 tokens by market capitalization as well as the top 60 by 24-hour trading volume.  Traders and analysts are now speculating how high ENS can fly.  A popular price target bandied about is $119. GoDaddy, the internet domain giant, currently has a market cap of $11.9 billion – at $119, ENS’s fully diluted valuation would exceed it, and an emerging narrative focuses on ENS as “the domain name of web3.”  Many traders are also eyeing the first major exchange listing as a “sell the news” event. Previous buzzy airdrops, such as AGLD, soared on release, only to plummet once listed on FTX.

The product will also include XRP, Ripple’s native coin that it already offers with its existing services.  The Ripple Liquidity Hub will use smart order routing to find digital assets at the best prices, according to an announcement Tuesday. The first partner for the new service is Coinme, the payments and crypto ATM company that is now working with Walmart to allow customers to buy bitcoin at about 200 kiosks in Walmart stores.  Ripple plans to add features such as support for staking and yield generating functions and will explore getting liquidity from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), said Asheesh Birla, general manager RippleNet, a cross-border payments system. The Ripple Liquidity Hub will go live in early 2022, Birla told CoinDesk.  The infrastructure for the service is already mostly in place, said Birla, thanks to the company’s RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) products. Branching out to include more cryptocurrencies was a response to customer demand, he said.  “We had a lot of expertise in connecting our customers that wanted to move money across borders by leveraging crypto exchanges,” Birla said. “Then we started hearing from our customers, saying, ‘Hey, we were buying cross-border payment liquidity from you; can we also buy crypto liquidity in terms of the ability to buy bitcoin and ether and other assets for our customers?’”  Birla said working with Coinme is a “match made in heaven.”  “What’s great about the partnership with Coinme is they have the right product to service end consumers with their Walmart deal,” Birla said. “They have a working capital issue when sourcing cryptocurrencies because they have to pay out bitcoin and other assets immediately when folks go to their ATM, but they don’t always get the cash several days later.”",POSITIVE,BCH | BTC | ETC,BCH | BTC | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/ripple-to-launch-liquidity-hub-with-5-leading-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d10374a984cd9fef3e794224c62ae04572259497-1152x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421698,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Y5,1636468200,The Crypto Industry Isn’t Too Thrilled About Biden’s Big Policy Moves,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass the infrastructure bill that contained a provision that shook the crypto world. Financial regulators called on Congress to regulate stablecoins. In other words, crypto had a big week in Washington, D.C.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Taxes and stablecoins  The narrative  The U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that contains two controversial crypto tax provisions, despite the ardent lobbying of crypto advocates who warned the provision would be terrible for crypto in the U.S. The bill passed the Senate without amendments back in August.  Why it matters  The Biden administration’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill contains a crypto reporting provision that appears to broaden the definition of a “broker” to potentially include crypto miners and developers, which would make compliance difficult, if not impossible. Another provision in the bill could make digital asset transactions – from purchasing cryptocurrencies to trading non-fungible tokens (NFT) – a felony if not reported correctly. Crypto proponents fear this could all be very problematic for the industry in the U.S., and could even push innovation offshore.  Breaking it down  Last Friday, the House of Representatives voted in favor of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The bill now awaits President Joe Biden’s signature.  Despite some heavy lobbying by crypto lobbyists back in August to clarify the definition of “broker” as it applies to digital assets, the proposed bill passed the Senate without any amendments. The bill was introduced and voted through the Senate within a week in August.  While the bill was awaiting House approval, I spoke to some crypto tax lawyers in the U.S. about how things might play out if it is signed into law without amendments.  Nathan Giesselman, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, told me that, as it is written in the bill, the provision runs the risk of capturing folks like miners and developers who don’t have the same customer information that a traditional broker might have, putting them in the awkward position of not being able to comply with the required reporting.  Now that the House has passed the bill, it’s clear that much will depend on how the U.S. Treasury Department interprets the definition of broker.  Back in August, reports surfaced indicating the Treasury Department might stick to the traditional definition of broker as laid out in the Internal Revenue Code, which would limit the term’s scope to only include dealers, barterers and other middlemen.  But David Zaslowsky, a partner at Baker & McKenzie and editor of the law firm’s blockchain blog, told me that it’s not clear if the Treasury Dept. will follow through.  “It is definitely the view of the Treasury [Dept.] that not everyone is reporting” who should be, Zaslowsky said.  Meanwhile, crypto lobbyists started pointing out that another potentially problematic provision in the bill had been totally overlooked.  The bill also proposed an amendment to tax code section 6050I to include digital assets. The original law put in place almost four decades ago requires anyone who receives more than $10,000 in cash in one transaction to report the sender’s personal information, including their Social Security number, to the government within 15 days.  Abraham Sutherland, adviser at crypto lobbying group Proof of Stake Alliance, wrote in a research report that this provision would apply broadly to all Americans who receive any kind of digital asset, from cryptocurrencies to NFTs.  “And under section 6050I, the failure to promptly and accurately verify and report the required information – information which might not exist – can be a felony resulting in prison time,” Sutherland wrote.  Jerry Brito, executive director of crypto lobbying group Coin Center, called the tax code amendment unconstitutional in a Twitter thread on Saturday. He also said there’s still time to “roll back” the provisions before they affect anyone as the provisions won’t take effect until at least 2024. According to Brito, options include working amendments into upcoming spending bills or introducing standalone bills.  “We’ve been working with several members of the House to introduce standalone bills to amend the new crypto tax reporting provisions. We would have over two years to get these passed,” Brito tweeted.  Meanwhile, the infrastructure bill has to be signed by the president, and the Treasury Dept. has to issue guidance on how these provisions will be enforced, particularly its interpretation of the term “broker.”  About that stablecoin report …  Last Monday, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets finally released its long-awaited report on stablecoins. The report, put together by a group of financial regulators representing various U.S. government agencies, recommended that stablecoin issuers should be subject to the same federal oversight as banks. The report also suggested that should Congress fail to take regulatory action, financial regulators will step in and establish oversight through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council.  I spoke to some of the top stablecoin issuers as well as crypto lobbyists to see what they thought about the report and noticed a discrepancy in their reactions. Some stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether welcomed the prospect of being treated as regulated banks. But crypto lobbyists were not as enthusiastic about some of the report’s other implications.  Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) said the oversight suggested in the report could put a damper on innovation and subject stablecoins to stricter rules compared to other payment systems like PayPal that offer similar services. Lobbyists also fear that things could get messy if multiple government agencies try to regulate the space.  Cornell economist Eswar Prasad told me the crypto industry wants the best of both worlds and is trying “to walk a fine line between benefiting from the legitimacy provided by government oversight while trying to stay clear of extensive and intrusive regulation that deters innovation.”  While appearing on Monday’s episode of CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said that the term “innovation” is getting thrown around a lot. There are some areas where we want unfettered innovation, Hsu said, but stablecoins may not be one of those areas.  “You want your money to be stable. You want it to be reliable. You want it to be there in good times and bad times and not have to think about it. If you innovate too much in that space, you’re going to get a wide range of outcomes that some of which are not going to be good,” Hsu said.  Biden’s rule  Last week, President Biden said that he will announce his choice for the chair of the Federal Reserve “fairly quickly” but did not specify whether it’s going to be Jerome Powell, whose term as chairman will expire in February.  Elsewhere  In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris: The civil trial Ira Kleiman v. Craig Wright, involving the self-proclaimed inventor of bitcoin, Craig Wright, kicked off last week in Miami. Kleiman is suing Wright for what he claims to be his brother Dave’s share of a sum of bitcoin currently valued at $66 billion.  Europe’s MiCA Crypto Rules Are Coming Soon. Here’s Why They Matter: The European Union will soon ratify a 168-page proposed framework for regulating crypto assets, which could set up a passportable license so crypto firms can expand through the bloc easily. But, drafted with Facebook’s Diem stablecoin project in mind, a great portion of the framework lays out rules for stablecoin issuers with some additional rules for larger issuers.

Solana went live with its beta network in March 2020, yet it has already positioned itself as one of the leading blockchain networks, as of today locking a total value of approximately 15 billion USD. Solana already supports a large number of DeFi solutions, including decentralized applications and smart contracts, as well as non-fungibles tokens. Solana uses a consensus mechanism that combines proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS), enabling the network to process more than 50,000 transactions per second. In comparison, the Ethereum network can only handle 13 transactions per second. Solana was designed to achieve high network operability with low transaction costs with its combined consensus algorithms of Proof of Stake and Proof of History. This tech stack is set to overcome the scalability issues of networks such as Etheruem, which depend on a volatile network fee for its block confirmation mechanism. DIA has been heavily broadening the availability of its data infrastructure.

The Sydney-based miner will list its shares on Nasdaq under the ticker “IREN.”  JPMorgan, Canaccord Genuity, Citigroup, Macquarie Capital, Cantor Fitzgerald, CLSA and Cowen are joint bookrunners for the deal.  The miner will use the net proceeds to buy bitcoin mining hardware equipment and acquire and develop data centers, among other growth initiatives.

The software company will add coverage for the Solana blockchain in the first quarter of next year, project leads said at the Solana conference in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday.  Nansen has made a business by turning blockchain technology’s hard-coded transparency into potentially actionable trading signals for its clients. It uses a blend of public intelligence and heuristics to “label” addresses tied to hedge funds, banks, venture capitalists and large investors – the “smart money” for others to follow, so to speak.  Alexandre Caillol, head of institutional sales at Nansen, told CoinDesk that Nansen clients have been asking for Solana coverage. The network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is worth over $15 billion and has 1.2 million monthly active addresses – all potential gold mines for traders who know how to read them.  “It’s for the traders,” Caillol said. “They’re concerned about OK, where are the hot contracts that are coming in? Where are the yields?’”  Read more: Analytics Platform Nansen Expands to Fantom, Spotlighting Emerging DeFi Ecosystem  But getting that information for Solana isn’t quite so simple for Nansen. Solana uses a consensus mechanism that differs from Nansen’s other covered networks. It doesn’t work well with Ethereum blockchain-based smart contracts, either. Fantom, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain all do because they are compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), Ethereum’s computation engine.  “That’s why it takes us a little while to load Solana: because it’s a different technology,” Caillol said.

The statement was released after the committee reviewed comments on its consultation from June, which said banks exposed to high-risk crypto assets like bitcoin should hold capital equal to the exposure.  Under that proposal, a bank with an original exposure to crypto of $100 has a minimum capital requirement of $100.  A forum of some of the largest global banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, opposed the requirement, calling it “overly conservative” and said it could preclude bank involvement in the crypto market.

Panetta, a member of the ECB’s executive board, said this was “likely” during a panel in Helsinki on Tuesday, according to a Bloomberg report. However, this status “should not be taken for granted,” he added.  CBDCs being legal tender would give them an edge over other payment options provided by private companies and help achieve wider use by the public.  “It would be quite awkward not to have legal-tender status for an additional instrument issued by a central bank,” Panetta said.  A document published today outlining the ECB’s policy considerations for introducing a digital euro lists the possibility of legal tender status as one of its principal areas for investigation.  Other considerations include interaction with the European retail payments market, design choices, use cases and what front and back-end technical infrastructure could best handle these issues.

Kazakhstan is facing severe electricity shortages, in part due to the swarm of crypto miners arriving in the wake of China’s crackdown on the industry. Miners in the country have been facing power rationing since September, an Enegix spokesperson said prior to the event.  The government has also drafted a bill to limit the total energy supply from the national grid to new mining centers to 100MW.  The company said it will start building the hydropower stations in the first quarter of next year as part of a pilot. It plans to expand its hydropower capacity to 150MW in the next five years.  Enegix is one of the largest hosting firms in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the world’s second-largest bitcoin miner, according to data from the Center for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge.  The company’s initial plan is to build small generators of 1MW-3MW in close proximity, the company representatives said, adding that this model can be expanded.

42396559,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4LEM,1636457286,"Solana Wallets Phantom, Solflare Eye Mobile for Growth","Solana’s growth strategy is going mobile.  At least two wallet projects are moving to get their crypto apps in people’s pockets: Fund management protocol Solrise Finance launched its Solflare mobile app last week and Phantom, a popular browser-based wallet, is working on an iPhone and Android offering of its own.  The move highlights crypto developers’ increasing belief that mobile is essential to crypto mass adoption. Just as traditional financial services – from cashing checks to swiping cards – have migrated to phones, crypto, the thinking goes, must readily do the same.  That, at least, is Solana’s party line. In the past week, top brass at Solana Labs, which builds on the proof-of-stake ecosystem, waxed bullish on mobile wallet integrations. Head of Growth Matty Tay said Phantom’s yet-to-launch mobile wallet could “open the floodgates” to millions of new users.  The project’s browser-linked wallet has more than 1 million weekly users, according to project statistics. Meanwhile, Solflare, the new wallet from Solrise protocol, said it already services staking for $16 billion in SOL.  The announcements were pegged to Solana’s Breakpoint conference in Lisbon. Slope Finance launched its mobile-friendly web wallet last month.  SOL phones  Mobile wallets are not completely new for Solana, one of the low-cost, high-speed blockchain networks competing with Ethereum on decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). A number of crypto exchanges already let users send, stake and store SOL from their phones.  Both newcomer apps differ by being “non-custodial” wallets that leave users in direct control of their coins (similar to a slew of Ethereum-based wallets on the market). They also provide staking and token swapping services that many exchange mobile products lack.  But their biggest contribution to Solana’s mobile growth could come from a different corner of crypto: NFTs. Solana has been flooded for months by fresh NFT projects looking to mint on a low-cost chain; a flood of new users have followed.  “A really big pain point is NFT drops,” Phantom CEO Brandon Millman told CoinDesk in an interview. “They happen at all times of day and so if someone’s at work they can’t participate if they don’t have their laptop. That’s actually been one of the primary drivers for mobile.”  Solrise co-founder Filip Dragoslavic shared a similar perspective.  “More and more crypto users are becoming mobile-first every year, and we believe that making the Solana experience easy for these users is key to continuing its explosive growth,” he said in a statement.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/solana-wallets-phantom-solflare-eye-mobile-for-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85cb8553ffbfb2ce6a405e61fcf5a1eb938ef574-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the case for a retail CBDC is not urgent, Menon said, according to a report by the Straits Times on Tuesday.  Menon said the benefits of a digital Singaporean dollar from a financial inclusionary perspective are “not compelling.”  A desire to address the decline in cash usage is one of the major motivations by some of central banks with more advanced CBDC plans, such as China and Sweden, something Menon said does not apply in Singapore.  “A high proportion of Singaporeans have bank accounts, and electronic payments in Singapore are pervasive, highly efficient and competitive,” he said.  Nonetheless, Singapore’s central bank and private-sector companies are building the technological infrastructure necessary to launch a CBDC, should the island city-state decide to introduce one, Menon added.

October had proven to be just what the doctor for the pioneer cryptocurrency as a number of bullish news saw the digital asset bound towards a new all-time high. After hitting $67K in October, BTC had consolidated well below its record high for some time. However, this would not last. November came in with even better optics for the digital asset, leftover from its rally the previous month. With this, BTC had taken off on a slow but steady upward trend.

The Banque de France’s experiment commenced in March 2020, with results published Monday.  “We have demonstrated that a wholesale CBDC would be of benefit for cross-border and cross-currency payments as it would improve the efficiency of processing chains,” said Nathalie Aufauvre, head of the bank’s experimentation program.  However, further examination is required of important questions pertaining to the role of financial intermediaries and the transmission of monetary policy, according to the Banque de France.  “It is essential, therefore, that central banks retain full control over a wholesale CBDC once it has entered circulation.”  A wholesale CBDC is a digital currency issued specifically for use by financial institutions to exchange central bank-issued money. In this sense, it is distinguishable from a retail CBDC that would be intended for use by the public as a form of digital cash.  The Banque de France is also exploring a retail CBDC as part of the European Central Bank’s broader work on the potential development of a digital euro.

Announced Tuesday at the Solana conference in Lisbon, Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Solana Ventures are committing $100 million to grow decentralized social media projects on Solana. Originally, the commitment was for $50 million, but at an onstage discussion, Ohanian increased it to $100 million.  A key ingredient: Ohanian’s early work in building Reddit from the ground up.  “With a high performance blockchain like Solana, there is an unprecedented opportunity to fuse social and crypto in a way that feels like a [Web 2] social product but with the added incentive of empowering users with real ownership,” Ohanian said in a statement.  The announcement comes a day after FTX CEO and vocal Solana backer Sam Bankman-Fried signaled his support for social on Solana.  “Social media on the blockchain,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview with this reporter, “I continue to think this could be absolutely huge.”  Decentralized social media platforms exist on a number of other blockchains, including Twetch on BSV and DLive on Tron-owned BitTorrent.  “Web 3 turns users and creators into owners and stakeholders, a change that can’t come soon enough to social media,” Solana Labs COO Raj Gokal said in a statement.  Oddly enough, the announcement comes a day after Gokal was suspended from Twitter. “Twitter suspends accounts which violate the Twitter Rules,” a banner on the blanked-out @rajgokal account read Monday.

42396568,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4LME,1636444589,Open Positions in Ether ‘Calls’ Hits 1 Million Mark as Traders Pile Onto Higher Strike Options,"Ether’s options market flows appear more bullish than ever, with the cryptocurrency eyeing the psychological level of $5,000.  Data tracked by Swiss-based analytics firm Laevitas shows there are currently 1.02 million call option contracts ($4.8 billion) open on the Deribit exchange – perhaps a record figure and twice more than the put option tally of 426,950 ($2 billion).  The big gap reflects top-side bias. “[That’s] pretty bullish positioning,” Amber Group said in a Telegram chat. “skew is favoring topside as well.” Traders buy call options to bet on price increases and seek downside protection via puts when anticipating a correction.  Both short-term and longer-duration calls are drawing higher prices than puts at press time, as evident from the negative one-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews. Put-call skews measure the cost of puts relative to calls.  As seen below, the majority of open interest is concentrated in the so-called out-of-the-money or higher strike call options. On Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest, one ether options contract represents 1 ETH.  Call options at $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000 account for nearly 300,000 in open positions.  According to QCP Capital, increased buying in the $15,000 call has been driven by last month’s high conviction recommendation by Real Vision Founder Raoul Pal.  “On Deribit, you can buy the March 2022 [expiry] $15,000 calls for around $167 [premium paid to purchase call],” Pal said in a note to clients, according to QCP Capital’s Telegram broadcast dated Oct. 28.  Pal called the trade a lottery ticket, meaning the maximum loss a buyer would suffer is limited to the extent of the premium paid for a single contract, i.e., $167. At the same time, profit can be huge if ether rallies to $15,000 or more.  “If it goes to $20,000, you make 28x. If it goes to $40,000, you make 85x,” Pal said.  Traders have been buying cheap out-of-the-money call options since the first quarter in a bid to make millions on a relatively small investment.  Ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, is currently trading at record highs near $4,800, representing a 550% year-to-date gain versus bitcoin’s 134% rally.  Investors have been snapping up ether in recent weeks on expectations that U.S. regulators would approve an ETH futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF).  “Our flow report again shows a stronger bid [bullish] side bias for ETH (55.6% buying) over BTC (51.7% buying),” Adam Farthing, chief risk officer at crypto liquidity provider and over-the-counter trader B2C2 Japan, said in a weekly note published Monday.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/09/open-positions-in-ether-calls-hits-1-million-mark-as-traders-pile-onto-higher-strike-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b0de1d13c2df0497f45870254cd8bee0642b665-1200x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The markets have been in bull mode since the beginning of the October, with the crypto market in total adding nearly $1 trillion to its total value in just a month. At the press time, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has reached near $3 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  As CoinDesk reported, bitcoin is widely perceived by many investors as a store-of-value asset like gold, making the crypto a haven as worries about inflation increase. Meanwhile, blockchain data from Glassnode shows that the number of unique wallets with a balance of more than zero bitcoin has returned to near 39 million, a number that’s close to a record high of 38.7 million in May.  At the same time, Glassnode noted in its weekly report on Monday that bitcoin’s balances on exchanges continued to drop, while Bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of the total computational power being used to secure the Bitcoin blockchain, could return to new all-time highs before the end of the year – after the hashrate plunged in July due to China’s crackdown in bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin was surging above $68,000 at around 05:00 a.m. UTC on Tuesday. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also set an all-time high, hitting $4,823.95, according to CoinDesk data.  Ether’s surge came as reports show that the Ethereum network burned more ether than it issued for at least a week, after Ethereum’s London hard fork upgrade introduced a mechanism to burn a large portion of transaction fees, measured in ether, instead of sending them to miners. Burning means that the ether is permanently removed from the circulating supply.  Meanwhile, the concerns around Ethereum blockchain’s scalability and high transaction fees continued to move parts of the market’s attention to so-called Ethereum alternative tokens including solana (SOL), polkadot (DOT), terra (LUNA), and avalanche (AVAX).  Data from blockchain data firm Kaiko shows that Ethereum is losing market share to other popular layer 1 blockchains since the beginning of the year, as ether’s trading volume on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume in the world, has fallen to 42% from 76% in the beginning of the year with the lost volume shifting to other layer 1 tokens.  “The recent [non-fungible token] fervor has again generated high transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, making alternate networks that solve for scalability concerns more attractive,” Kaiko wrote in its newsletter on Nov. 8.

42424332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2nVdh,1636430503,Biden Administration Sanctions Crypto Exchange Chatex Over Ransomware Allegations,"The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned crypto exchange Chatex for its alleged involvement in ransomware operations, the federal agency said in a Monday press release.  It is the second time that the U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned a crypto exchange. Chatex “has facilitated transactions for multiple ransomware variants” and has provided “material support” to crypto over-the-counter exchange Suex, which is also associated with ransomware, the press release said.  In September, Suex was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for ransomware activities.  The Biden administration has launched a crackdown on ransomware and is trying to convince other governments to follow its lead. Crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis estimates that North American crypto addresses sent $131 million to ransomware-linked addresses between July 2020 and June 2021, more than double what Western Europe, the second hardest-hit region, sent.  The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) added Chatex to its “Specially Designated Nationals” list. Another three entities associated with Chatex were also added to the blacklist, including Izibits OU, Chatextech SIA and Hightrade Finance Ltd.  The list covers individuals working for governments involved in terrorism or drug trafficking, according to the Treasury Department. Being on the list means the individuals’ assets are blocked and U.S. citizens are barred from doing business with them.  Suex and Chatex share a co-founder, Egor Petukhovsky, and at one point, a holding company, Estonia-based Izibits OU, according to TRM Labs.  A separate Treasury Department announcement mentioned about 30 sanctioned crypto wallet addresses associated with Chatex.  Chatex operates a crypto exchange and wallet through a Telegram messaging bot.
