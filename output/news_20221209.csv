42413443,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9F50,1670628993,Class-Action Lawsuit Against Sam Bankman-Fried and Celebrity FTX Promoters Gets a New Judge in Miami,"CORRECTION (Dec. 11, 17:36 UTC): An earlier version of this story said the class-action lawsuit had been voluntarily dismissed, or dropped, by the plaintiffs. The case was not dropped, but rather consolidated and transferred to another judge. The updated article also adds quotes from the plaintiffs' attorneys. CoinDesk regrets the error.  A class-action lawsuit filed against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and a host of paid celebrity promoters for the now-defunct crypto exchange is forging ahead in Miami.  Three separate lawsuits filed by plaintiffs represented by the boutique Moskowitz Law Firm and white-shoe law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner have been consolidated and will be overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Moore in the Southern District of Florida.  The initial suit called FTX a “house of cards, a Ponzi scheme where the FTX entities shuffled customer funds between their opaque affiliated entities.” The plaintiffs alleged that celebrity promoters of FTX – including National Football League quarterback Tom Brady, comedian Larry David, tennis player Naomi Osaka and the National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors team – drew in unsophisticated retail investors and promoted unregistered securities.  “We have been working with our team of crypto experts and are more confident than ever that all of the FTX interest accounts will be found by our state and federal courts to be ‘securities’ and thus each of the FTX Brand Ambassadors will be liable for promoting an unregistered security,” said Adam Moskowitz, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs.  Moskowitz said he was confident the FTX celebrity promoters will also be found to have violated state and federal anti-touting laws.  “We have no doubt that Sam [Bankman-Fried] committed one of the country’s largest financial scams and he had no intention of complying with any of these FTC and SEC celebrity endorsement regulations,” Moskowitz said, referring to the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “That was part of his fraudulent plan to compete with Voyager, Gemini, Coinbase and BlockFi.”  Voyager Digital and BlockFi are crypto lenders, Coinbase is the only publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. and Gemini is also a cryptocurrency exchange.  The class-action suit, which has called for unspecified damages and a jury trial, is one of a handful of similar class-action lawsuits already filed against Bankman-Fried and FTX since the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection one month ago.

42413438,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9EzO,1670626310,EU Lawmaker Kaili Suspended From Party in Corruption Scandal,"European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili, a key figure in ongoing efforts to regulate crypto in Europe, has been suspended from her party in reaction to reports that she and others are allegedly tied to a wide-ranging corruption scandal involving illicit lobbying activity for Qatar.  Kaili – a rare crypto ally among progressives – is a Greek politician and member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, which said they’d suspended her “in response to the ongoing investigations.”  “We are appalled by the allegations of corruption in the European institutions,” the group said in a Friday statement. And it separately confirmed a decision to suspend her “membership of the S&D Group with immediate effect.”  Kaili's national party in Greece, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, also announced on Twitter it would expel her.  The vice president had recently indicated she’d be holding the pen on the Parliament’s effort to clear up ambiguities in the rules for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and she said she wanted to avoid the controversies of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA) by focusing on regulating activities rather than individual entities.  Kaili didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation, nor did the public prosecutor there.  The EU lawmaker’s home was reportedly raided and she was detained, according to Belgian newspaper Le Soir, with local press saying the public prosecutor confirmed the raid happened.  Kaili has maintained an open approach to the digital assets industry as Europe made ground-breaking efforts in beginning to establish rules of the road – well ahead of U.S. efforts.  “We don’t expect innovation to fit our old boxes,” she said in a CoinDesk interview last year. “We are creating new boxes and allowing them to keep evolving without feeling that it is a hostile environment.”",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,"Jesse Hamilton, Jack Schickler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/09/eu-lawmaker-kaili-suspended-from-party-in-corruption-scandal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4cb08b154cbc6989753c41c85028c28fb2a0bca-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Block confirmed the report on Friday.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The Block’s CEO, Michael McCaffrey, immediately resigned after the loans came to light. He will also step down from The Block's board.  No one at the company had any knowledge of the loans except for McCaffrey, according to the company.  McCaffrey received three loans for a total of $43 million from 2021 through this year, The Block confirmed.  undefined  Bobby Moran, The Block’s chief revenue officer, will be stepping into the role of CEO effective immediately, according to the report.  “From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX and Alameda Research,” Moran said in a statement.  Frank Chaparro, an editor-at-large at The Block, said in a tweet that he was ""gutted by this news,” which was briefed to the company Friday afternoon, adding that McCaffrey ""kept every single one of us in the dark.""  The Block is a competitor to CoinDesk.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH): BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $17,140, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. BTC has been hovering at the $17,000 mark for 10 consecutive days. Ether followed a similar pattern, sliding 0.8% to $1,260 as of publication time.  Fetch.ai (FET): The blockchain-based project focused on artificial intelligence (AI) was the top performer this week among the 167 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI). Its native token FET’s price jumped from 6 cents at the start of the week to now 11 cents, surging 80% in the five days since Sunday and 36% in the past 24 hours alone at the time of publication. The price jump came after the release of an upgrade to the Fetch.ai wallet with features, including “more easy-to-use messaging,” “fewer server interactions” and “faster load times.”  FTX Token (FTT): The native cryptocurrency of the failed FTX crypto exchange surged Friday after the platform's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, came out in support of an exchange revival plan proposed by a crypto influencer Ran Neuner. The FTT token surged as much as 47% to $1.97, its highest level since Nov. 16, after Bankman-Fried's tweet at 08:18 UTC, TradingView data show. The token has since settled back to $1.64.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin's in the Doldrums as Investors Eye FTX Hearing, FOMC Meeting  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.  BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.  ETH’s price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22, is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day. A distinction between ETH and BTC’s recent price action is that ETH has pushed past a high volume node at $1,200 with the next stop above being at $1,340.  Read the full technical take here.

42413439,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9F0K,1670624370,"Bieber, Madonna Among Dozens of Celebs Named in Lawsuit Alleging Yuga Labs NFT 'Scheme'","A number of celebrities, including Justin Beiber, Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon and Madonna, among others, were named as plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit, alleging that Yuga Labs non-fungible tokens (NFT) collections were ""misleadingly promoted"" and resulted in financial damage to the defendants.  The lawsuit, filed by John T. Jasnoch of Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Thursday, was brought forward on behalf of ""investors"" who purchased Yuga Labs NFTs including Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) or ApeCoin – the Ethereum-based governance and utility tokens used within the APE ecosystem – between April 2021 and the present. The two plaintiffs, Adam Titcher of California and Adonis Real of Florida, purchased Yuga Labs assets during that time.  Titcher purchased Mutant Ape Yacht Club #1984 in August 2021 for 5.3 ETH (about $17,000 at the time) and minted Otherdeed for Otherside #16235 on OpenSea in April, while Adonis purchased an undisclosed amount of ApeCoin on Coinbase. According to the filing, both men purchased the assets ""in reliance on the misleading promotions"" from Yuga Labs and a number of celebrities, resulting in ""investment losses.""  The 95-page filing repeatedly refers to NFTs as securities, a question the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly been investigating since March. In October, Bloomberg reported that the SEC was probing Yuga Labs to determine if sales of its digital assets violate federal law.  The suit also alleges that Yuga Labs and Web3 investor Guy Oseary were involved in a ""vast scheme"" and used crypto payments platform MoonPay as a ""front operation"" to promote and sell digital assets. ""The executives at Yuga and Oseary together devised a plan to leverage their vast network of A-list musicians, athletes, and celebrity clients and associates to misleadingly promote and sell the Yuga Financial Products,"" the lawsuit reads.  In total, the lawsuit names 37 defendants, including the founders and leadership team at Yuga Labs; MoonPay and its CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright; Reddit co-founder and investor Alexis Ohanian; NFT artist Beeple; Ape DAO board members Amy Wu, Maaria Bajwa and Dean Steinbeck; Guy Oseary; Justin Beiber; Jimmy Fallon; Gwyneth Paltrow; Madonna; Paris Hilton; Serena Williams; Post Malone; Diplo; Snoop Dogg; Kevin Hart; Steph Curry; Future; The Weeknd; DJ Khaled; Adidas and several others.  The lawsuit alleges that BAYC and related NFTs ""rely heavily on the perception that 'joining the club' ... brings investors status and provides them access to events, benefits, and other lucrative investment opportunities exclusive to BAYC holders.""  ""The exclusiveness of BAYC membership was entirely based on the inclusion and endorsements of highly influential celebrities,"" the lawsuit claims.  ""Sales of digital assets like NFTs and tokens come with disclosure duties just like any other financial product,"" Jasnoch told CoinDesk. ""And whether it is a company, [decentralized autonomous organization] or celebrity influencer, the individuals involved in misleading investors should be held accountable.""  He added that celebrity endorsements created a ""fear of missing out with an endless parade of Bored Ape and ApeCoin promotions. Had there been proper disclosure, the price wouldn't have swung so high and so wildly.""  A spokesperson for Yuga Labs called the claims ""opportunistic and parasitic. We strongly believe that they are without merit and look forward to proving as much.""  Representatives for MoonPay and Guy Oseary did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  This is not the first time Scott+Scott attorneys have attempted to wage war on celebrity endorsements in the crypto space. The law firm was also behind the proposed class-action suit filed against celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather over their promotion of the cryptocurrency ethereumMax on social media. A federal judge in California dismissed the suit on Thursday, stating that investors are expected ""to act reasonably before basing their bets on the zeitgeist of the moment.""  In his ruling, the judge said that lawyers for the plaintiffs could refile their lawsuit with amended claims.  ""We were disappointed in the dismissal,"" Jasnoch told CoinDesk. ""But the judge gave us leave to amend the complaint and gave us a bit of a road map to get a claim sustained. And he also said that the case raised important issues regarding celebrity promotion of crypto tokens.""

In that time frame, the altcoin depreciated by 1%. In the past week, LUNC logged gains worth 2.5%. Much of the weekly gains have been lost due to losses on the daily chart. At the moment, LUNC depicts consolidation beneath its immediate resistance mark. With the FTX collapse, LUNC has been teetering under a bearish influence for quite some time. Over the last month, the coin has lost more than 10% of its market value. On the development front, there is a new update. This is the introduction of the new Alpha package for TerraDart. TerraDart is a Dart SDK that is used for writing applications that would be interacting with the Terra blockchain, which has launched a new package called Alpha. The Alpha package has been available to communicate with the LUNC blockchain within Flutter and Dart environments. Related Reading: Yearn Finance: What The Final Quarter Of 2022 Has In Store For YFI Price Luna Classic (LUNC) Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LUNC was exchanging hands at $0.000162 at press time. The altcoin just fell from $0.000170 due to intra-day losses. Even with developments in the ecosystem, the LUNC price remains largely unaltered. The rigid price ceiling was at $0.000175, but demand for the coin was too low for bulls to take charge. Once the altcoin topples above the $0.000175 mark, it will be an easy path to the psychological level of $0.00019. On the flip side, with lesser accumulation, LUNC would eye its closest support line of $0.000148. Falling through the $0.000148 mark will bring LUNC to $0.00012. The amount of LUNC traded in the last session was low, indicating bearish strength. Technical Analysis In the past month, the coin displayed a bullish divergence, after which LUNC noted a slight increase in price. Despite that, the bulls could not build on their strength. The Relative Strength Index was near the 40-mark, which meant that the coin was moving toward the oversold zone. Similarly, the LUNC price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which denoted a lack of demand. The reading also indicates that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. In regards to buying strength, capital inflows have also declined due to a lack of investor interest. The Chaikin Money Flow depicts capital inflows and outflows at a given point. The indicator was below the half-line which meant low capital inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs. Bears Battle – Who’s Winning?

42411673,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfElu,1670621336,What Is dYdX? Understanding the Decentralized Crypto Exchange,"The continued maturity of the crypto market has led to a positive feedback loop between the market and its participants. As new participants enter the market, the market has matured, leading to new crypto platforms and products to invest with.  No other sector in crypto has experienced this positive feedback loop like decentralized finance (DeFi). Increased adoption from both retail and institutional investors has led to a robust financial ecosystem with new, more advanced methods of DeFi trading.  If you are looking for a platform for more advanced DeFi trading methods, then you’ve probably come across dYdX. The decentralized platform for perpetuals trading was founded by ex-Coinbase and Uber developer Antonio Juliano and has been backed by industry leaders including a16z, Polychain Capital, Hashed, Spartan Group and others. For a brief moment, the popularity of dYdX even gave the platform more trading volume than Coinbase.  See Also: What Is a Perpetual Swap?  In this article, we’ll take a look at what dYdX is and how to get started on the platform.  What is dYdX?  DYdX is a decentralized exchange (DEX), currently based on the Ethereum layer 2 system StarkWare. The platform utilizes StarkWare’s zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) to create a more secure, decentralized and privacy-focused platform.  Read More: What Are Rollups? ZK and Optimistic Rollups Explained  In June 2022, dYdX announced plans to leave Ethereum, replacing its StarkWare-based platform in favor of its own Cosmos-based blockchain. DYdX’s founder stated that the move to the Cosmos ecosystem will provide a better user experience through customizable fee structures and transaction fees. The dYdX chain is set to feature a decentralized, off-chain order book capable of scaling alongside the platform’s continued growth.  While dYdX offers a DEX similar to Uniswap or SushiSwap, dYdX was designed to trade a specific type of asset: perpetuals. Short for perpetual swap trading contract, perpetuals are essentially a derivative, or financial instrument that derives its value from an underlying asset. Like futures or options, perpetuals provide an opportunity for traders to speculate on the future value of an asset. Unlike futures or options, perpetual swaps do not have expiration dates, hence the “perpetual” nature of the contracts.  Unlike Uniswap or other DEXs, dYdX does not rely on an automated market maker (AMM) to facilitate trading. Instead, the platform utilizes a traditional orderbook + matching model to meet the requirements and expectations of institutional traders. Despite the niche trading style of dYdX, the platform’s acceptance of institutional and retail traders has made it one of the more popular exchanges on the market. At the time of writing, dYdX has nearly $450 million in total value locked (TVL).  Getting started with dYdX  Before diving into how to get going on dYdX, it’s important to note that perpetual trading isn’t available for everyone. Specifically, trading perpetuals are not available for anyone who is a resident or currently located in the United States. For more information on whether you can access the dYdX platform, make sure to check out the terms of service.  With that in mind, to get started on dYdX you’ll first need to find the right DeFi wallet for you. MetaMask is the most popular wallet dYdX supports but you can also use Coinbase Wallet, a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, or any wallet that uses WalletConnect such as Trust Wallet.  Once you’ve finished setting up your preferred wallet, you’ll need to fund it with ether (ETH) if you don’t hold any, in order to pay gas fees for transactions.  Now that your wallet is ready to go, you can access the dYdX platform. To trade perpetuals and interact with dYdX’s decentralized application (dapp) you can either connect your wallet to the desktop application or through the dYdX iOS app.  Finally, while not a requirement to use the platform, if you’re interested in being a part of the governance and evolution of the exchange you can buy dYdX’s token, also called dYdX. In late 2021, dYdX held a token airdrop for its native token. Holders of the dYdX token can vote on governance proposals and reduce trading and market making fees based on token holdings.

Michael McCaffrey, The Block's CEO, immediately stepped down from his role after he failed to disclose the Alameda-backed loans, the company said, adding that he was the only person who knew about the funding. McCaffrey, who will also step down from The Block's board, received three loans from Alameda totaling $43M from 2021 through 2022, the company noted. The first loan amounted to $12M and was used last year to buy out other investors in the news site. That's when McCaffrey took over as CEO. The second loan, which was used to help fund day-to-day operations, consisted of $15M in January, and the third one was for $16M earlier in 2022 to buy personal real estate in the Bahamas, where Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX is headquartered, The Block explained. Meanwhile, The Block’s chief revenue officer, Bobby Moran, was said to succeed McCaffrey as CEO effective immediately. “From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX and Alameda Research,” Moran said in a statement.

The exact reason for the suspension was not disclosed, but it typically is due to the pending release of news.  At the end of October, Argo said that a deal to raise $27 million from a strategic investor had fallen through, sending its shares tumbling more than 70%.  ""Should Argo be unsuccessful in completing any further financing, Argo would become cash flow negative in the near term and would need to curtail or cease operations,"" the company said at the time in a statement to the London Stock Exchange.  In its November operational update released Friday, Argo said it was continuing to engage in financing discussions to “provide the company with working capital sufficient for its present requirements.” It added that “a further announcement will be made in due course.”  Argo and many other publicly traded bitcoin miners have been suffering lately from the combination of falling crypto prices and rising energy costs.  Argo shares began plunging in early October, when the firm announced a set of strategic actions including the sale of bitcoin mining rigs, to fulfill its obligations and execute its strategy.

Bitcoin Whales Continue To Sell Despite The Recent Deep Lows As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the number of investors with balances in the 1k to 10k BTC range have continued to decline recently. The relevant indicator here is the “UTXO Count – Value Bands,” which tells us about the number of UTXOs (or wallets) that are currently in each Bitcoin value band. These value bands are groups that define ranges between which the balances of UTXOs falling into said bands lie. For example, the 100-1k BTC value band includes all UTXOs (or wallets) that currently have between 100 and 1,000 coins. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales And Sharks Continue To Add To Their Holdings The value band of interest in the current context is the “1k-10k BTC” group. Here is a chart that shows how the UTXO Count of this value band has changed over the last several months: Looks like the value of the metric has taken a hit in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin UTXO Count for the 1k-10k BTC value band has observed some steep decline over the past month. Wallets with such large balances usually belong to the whales. This means that the holdings of these humongous holders have gone down in this period. This entire latest decline has come following the crash caused by crypto exchange’s FTX collapse, which means whales have sold their coins while the prices have been hitting lows. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bottom In? This On-Chain Condition Hasn’t Been Met Yet Historically, whales have shown accumulation behavior as bear markets have bottomed out. But recently instead of seeing an increase or even sideways movement, the UTXO Count of this whale value band has been strangely decreasing. This trend could be a sign that whales are still not finding the current lows attractive enough to buy more, and that they may rather be selling off their reserves as they expect the bearish winds to continue further. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $17.2k, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 7% in value. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days.

On Friday, CZ replied to CoinMamba, saying that “there is almost no way for us to be sure users didn’t steal their own API keys.” After that, CoinMamba started publishing multiple tweets accusing CZ of being “greedy” and claiming that “all of these exchanges are shady.”  In response to CoinMamba, and in a now-deleted tweet, CZ wrote that he was considering putting CoinMamba’s account in withdrawal-only mode because he was being “unreasonable.”  “On top of 3Commas, I am actually thinking of putting @coinmamba’s account in off boarding (withdrawal only) mode,” CZ tweeted. “We don’t want to service people who are unreasonable. Just more problems down the road. It’s a 2 way street. Might get a lot of flak, but…”  About an hour later, CoinMamba’s account was closed by Binance in response to “threats” it said he made to customer service employees at the world's largest exchange by volume.  “You have doubled down, refusing to file a police report and instead attempting to blame us, demanding compensation. You have even gone as far as to make threats, which we will not tolerate,” Binance’s Customer Support account on Twitter replied to CoinMamba.  In a direct message, CoinMamba told CoinDesk this was ""just an excuse.""  ""It was the same thing I told CZ in a tweet how they will pay for this. Main reason for suspension was my public tweets,"" the user said.  Binance has not responded to a request for comment.

42420860,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVnx,1670617897,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin's in the Doldrums as Investors Eye FTX Hearing, FOMC Meeting","Prices and Charts  After last month’s extreme market plunge as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange collapsed, some traders might be grateful for a bit of respite – in the form of a sideways-trading market.  Both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were essentially flat over the last week, with the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value trading .005% and .006% higher than the last recorded price on Dec. 2. Volume for both has been stable, with trading activity falling slightly below their respective 20-day moving averages.  BTC appears to be bumping up against potential resistance at current levels. A look at the asset’s Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) indicator indicates high levels of price agreement at current levels, which can lead to static price movement. If BTC breaks above this level, the next high volume node appears at the $20,000 level.  ETH's price, since hitting a short-term bottom on Nov. 22 is showing the early makings of a potential uptrend, with prices up 12% since that day. A distinction between ETH and BTC’s recent price action is that ETH has pushed past a high volume node at $1,200 with the next stop above being at $1,340.  Top 90-day performers  Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, your 90-day winners are dogecoin (DOGE), litecoin (LTC), XRP and Polygon's MATIC.  The laggards are Polkadot's DOT, Avalanche's AVAX, Cardano's ADA and Solana's SOL.  Bitcoin and ether are near the middle of the range, ranking 13th and 15th, respectively.  Each leader is down versus the U.S. dollar over the last seven days, as are the laggards, except for SOL.  Correlations  Bitcoin and ether prices remain tightly correlated at 0.96. Despite the differences between the two assets in supply, consensus mechanism, and utility, their prices continue to move in tandem. Other bitcoin correlations of note include:  Bitcoin to the U.S. dollar: Bitcoin’s correlation with the U.S. dollar index continues to move deeper into inversely correlated territory. This has been the norm for much of 2022, reversing only recently following FTX related contagion  Bitcoin to copper: Bitcoin’s correlation with copper futures continues to grow stronger with its coefficient increasing to 0.88. The linkage to copper implies a growing alignment between BTC and overall U.S. economic prospects.  Bitcoin to the S&P 500: Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has weakened to 0.33. For the bulk of 2022, Bitcoin and equities have traded in lockstep, but the relationship has weakened lately.  The week ahead …  The upcoming week will have its share of headline-worthy moments.  On Dec. 13, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee will hold part 1 of a hearing titled “Investigating the Collapse of FTX.” The embattled former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has agreed to testify before the committee, following the threat of a subpoena.  The Senate Banking Committee will be holding its own FTX hearing the following day. Whether Bankman-Fried appears remains unclear.  The threat of a Senate subpoena may have a similar effect to the House Financial Service Committee’s action.  The impact of these events on crypto prices will be long term and connected to legislation arising from each committee’s findings.  The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14 may have a more immediate effect, although markets seem to have already priced in a 50-basis point rate hike. Investors will likely be eyeing the Fed funds futures rate curve following the meeting.  Currently, markets anticipate that rates will reach 5% during the second and third quarters of 2023.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/09/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoins-in-the-doldrums-as-investors-eye-ftx-hearing-fomc-meeting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da0c162eff618ed11c472672b3be14159b0731b1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wyatt, previously head of gaming at YouTube, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday the West Hollywood, California, company is leveraging its team of veteran developers, who understand “the polish of Web2 and the excitement, enthusiasm and nuance of Web3.”  “We’ve built this great funnel for partners to come through and make the onboarding to Polygon really seamless,” Wyatt said, referring to Polygon’s partnerships with companies including Nike, Reddit and Starbucks.  Read more: Starbucks Launches Beta of Web3 'Odyssey' Loyalty Program  Polygon Studios, which has an estimated 198 million unique wallet addresses and allows users buy, sell and collect non-fungible tokens (NFT), most recently partnered with Starbucks to launch its NFT-based Odyssey loyalty program. Wyatt said the partnership with Starbucks is the latest example of a “Web2-esque” company looking to implement a Web3-based component into its brand.  “The idea behind the Web3 component, or putting it on-chain, was the fact that the stamps are NFTs,” Wyatt said. “They are collectible. You can buy and sell them on Nifty Gateway.”  That’s what is “necessary” in order to be a part of a decentralized protocol, he said.  Read more: Leading the Best Business-Development Team in Web3  “The real catalyst for saying why do we actually need to put any of this on a decentralized protocol largely stems from this idea of earning, minting and being rewarded stamp NFT's and what you can do with those on open marketplaces and trade and transact and so forth,” he said.  Wyatt said that when a client company is looking to launch a wallet or an NFT-based product, it is likely that it will be working across the Polygon Studio’s departments, including its engineering solutions and implementation teams, in order to “actually build and launch on the protocol.”  “The way that you actually get these partners is that whole funnel end to end and to provide that experience,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MATIC,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/09/polygon-studios-ceo-our-company-is-a-funnel-for-big-brand-partnerships,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2796da256cfe91e6f4f8739b93d4597cef07b245-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Block’s CEO, Michael McCaffrey, immediately resigned after the loans came to light, and will also step down from The Block's board. The company said no one at the company had any knowledge of the loans except for McCaffrey.  According to The Block, McCaffrey received three loans for a total of $43 million from 2021 through this year. The first loan was for $12 million in 2021 to buy out other investors in the media company, at which time McCaffrey took over as CEO. The second was for $15 million in January to fund day-to-day operations, and the third was for $16 million earlier this year for McCaffrey to purchase personal real estate in the Bahamas, according to The Block.  Bobby Moran, The Block’s chief revenue officer, will step into the role of CEO, effective immediately, according to the report.  “No one at The Block had any knowledge of this financial arrangement besides Mike,” Moran said in a statement. “From our own experience, we have seen no evidence that Mike ever sought to improperly influence the newsroom or research teams, particularly in their coverage of SBF, FTX and Alameda Research.”  Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, is the founder and former CEO of FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy last month after CoinDesk revealed an unusually close relationship between FTX and Alameda, a trading firm affiliated with FTX.  In a tweet thread on Friday, McCaffrey said that in early 2021, the company was in dire straits and “the only option that materialized” was to secure a $12 million loan for his holding company from SBF.  He said he didn’t disclose that loan, nor a subsequent $15 million loan, to anyone since he didn’t want knowledge of the loan to be seen as compromising the objectivity of the coverage of Bankman-Fried and his companies.  McCaffrey added that he “never attempted to influence coverage of FTX, Alameda or SBF.”  Frank Chaparro, an editor-at-large at The Block, said in a tweet that he was ""gutted by this news, which was briefed to the company this afternoon, adding that McCaffrey ""kept every single one of us in the dark.""  The Block is a competitor to CoinDesk.  Axios previously reported on the news of the loans.  UPDATE (Dec. 9, 19:45 UTC): Updated with additional background throughout.

The company's debt burden presents a long-term headwind to a balance sheet now under siege by what looks set to be structural unprofitability for most of 2023. A cumulative cash burn in excess of $150 million over the next four quarters could see further stock price weakness. Marathon Digital (MARA) incurred net losses of $75 million for its last reported fiscal 2022 third quarter. This led to cash and equivalents declining sequentially to $55.3 million from $86.5 million in the prior period. The Las Vegas-based Bitcoin mining company needs the price of the cryptocurrency to quickly start rising otherwise it faces a continued deterioration of its liquidity position. Gross profit also turned negative, reversing what has been an established positive trend since the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Data by YCharts The worsening profitability backdrop all came in the period that preceded the collapse of FTX (FTT-USD), an event that some bears have argued will come to form the theoretical base for an elongation of the crypto winter. Things are not looking great for Marathon. Its long-term debt reached a record of $781 million during the third quarter, cash burn from operations at $43.4 million was the highest on record, and the perception of Bitcoin has taken a sudden and negative turn with just 8% of Americans having a positive view of Crypto. The Crypto Winter Gets Longer Why am I bearish? I believe this crypto winter is unlike the others. 2021 saw record institutional adoption of crypto on a scale never before. Tesla ( TSLA ) would buy $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and would begin accepting the digital currency as a payment option for its products, over a dozen crypto firms would emerge on the NASDAQ and NYSE either through IPO, reverse merger or SPAC, and new crypto and blockchain-related companies would also pull $32.8 billion in VC funding in the pandemic year. This figure would be in excess of the aggregate of all prior years combined. Hence, with the current waning adoption, the utility of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem beyond being a speculative store of value is once again being questioned. NFTs have all but collapsed into obscurity , the metaverse has become a meme and is stalling , and crypto yield farming faces headwinds due to a heightening of counter-party risks. 2021's great advance of adoption helped drive Bitcoin prices to record highs but has now turned into a rout. This will mean a far longer crypto winter Indeed, Coinbase ( COIN ) released a report in the middle of November; The long winter gets longer , stating the FTX collapse could extend the crypto winter to the end of 2023. Marathon's business model is straightforward. It uses specialized hardware called ASICs to solve extremely complicated math problems to verify transactions on the blockchain. The company is then rewarded with new Bitcoin for the energy-intensive effort. Marathon Digital Interestingly, whilst the company states it controls the price of electricity, November Bitcoin production at its King Mountain Texas mining facility was curtailed on the back of higher spot electricity prices. The company produced 472 Bitcoin during the month, a decline of 23% from October. At the current Bitcoin price of around $17,000, Marathon is not profitable. When the company last reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 third quarter it reported revenue of $12.7 million which was down 75.5% year-over-year and was a miss by $6.77 million on consensus estimates. 616 Bitcoin were mined during the quarter, a 51% decrease from the year-ago comp. The closure of a mining facility in Montana and an initial delay to the startup of its Texas facility were the main driver of this fall. Lower Bitcoin prices, higher energy prices, and decreased production all partnered to see a marked decline in profitability. Gross profit at negative $1.1 million was a decline from a gross profit of $45.8 million in the year-ago quarter, a change which overall led to total free cash outflow to come in at $137.6 million. How Can Marathon Bear The Losses? Against cash and equivalents of $55.3 million, how can Marathon bear the losses? Perception matters and the FTX failure, the collapse of the third largest crypto exchange, materially adds to the quandary Bitcoin faces in the year ahead. Fundamentally, the price of Bitcoin forms the main consideration for buying the commons and it's hard to see how institutional investors, apart from those with the highest tolerance for risk, will ever consider investments into the sector at the same level as in 2021. FTX had a cap table that included the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, SoftBank, and Sequoia Capital. The total losses and the subsequent save face of these prestigious financial institutions will likely present a must-avoid scenario for other firms considering taking a stake in further crypto endeavours. However, bulls would be right though to state that the situation is still evolving and with Bitcoin prices being extremely responsive to Fed dovishness, the digital commodity and its miners could stage a rally if inflation figures begin to come in below expectations in the new year. Bitcoin is also here to stay. Data by YCharts Marathon held 11,285 Bitcoin as of the end of October which is roughly worth $190 million at today's Bitcoin prices. Whilst this provides a bulwark for its balance sheet, consecutive operational cash burn could be in excess of $150 million over the next four quarters until Coinbase's stated end of the crypto winter. This would see its current cash pile exhausted and Marathon likely have to start materially selling down its Bitcoin holdings to fund continued mining operations. Against this, the stock price would fall into a cycle of decline as the company leans on dilutive at-the-market offerings to also fund operations. Dilution, cash burn, a large debt burden, and an extended crypto winter are what lies ahead for Marathon's commons.

42411303,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmJS,1670607000,ChatGPT Will Kill Search and Open a Path to Web3,"It has been a long time since a software release has consumed the tech community as much as ChatGPT, the latest offering from OpenAI, the AI startup founded by Elon Musk.  This chatbot, trained on massive pools of data and now able to answer any query you might have, gained more than a million users in less than a week. Post after post on Twitter revealed the inanimate interface crafting eloquent, believable prose on whatever topic was asked of it. Economist Tyler Cowen even got it to write a passable poem in iambic pentameter about economist Thomas Schelling’s theory of deterrence for foreign policy.  ChatGPT is far from perfect. It struggles with facts from time to time, as Bloomberg journalist Joe Weisenthal discovered when he asked it to write his obituary. And The Atlantic columnist Ian Bogost rained on everyone’s parade by observing that the chatbot doesn’t “truly understand the complexity of human language,” ensuring that “any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight.”  But to Bogost’s boss, Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson, those imperfections won’t hinder the disruption this technology poses to a key part of the internet: search.  In an enthused video post, Thompson argued the chatbot would resolve most people’s general questions about the world, such that it will quickly overtake Alphabet’s Google algorithm. Rather than “Googling” something and waiting for a variety of ad-supported answers to come back, people will simply ask a chatbot and get an immediate answer.

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Web2 upended  It’s hard to overstate how transformative that idea is.  The entire Web2 economy, with its hierarchy of websites, from most trafficked to least, is built on a foundation of search.  We in digital media have been slaves to it for decades, constantly trying to satisfy ever-changing demands that we tweak the SEO (search engine optimization) elements of our content posts (headlines, in particular) to keep up with Google’s algorithm.  But it’s not just media outlets. It’s brands, governments, not-for-profits, bloggers – anyone striving to grab a piece of the world’s limited supply of audience attention is locked into a competitive dance ruled by Google’s search algorithm. From that structure was built Web2’s core business model: the sale of user data to programmatic advertisers who pay fees structured on a commodity-like measure of “page views,” “uniques” and “sessions.”  All of that, conceivably, could go away.  Web3’s chance  What does this mean for crypto?  Well, I think we may have just stumbled on the catalyst to take the digital economy into the decentralized Web3 era, creating new monetizable opportunities for non-fungible tokens (NFT), stablecoin payment systems and metaverse projects.  NFT and open metaverse enthusiasts have debated for some time about what would drive mass adoption of their projects and lead to their longed-for disintermediation of the dominant internet platforms. Would it be the deployment of digital collectibles in gaming? Would it come from household consumer brands and entertainment companies developing direct NFT-based engagement strategies to forge “ownership” relationships with their customers and fans? Would it lie in the new models of collective value creation and shared intellectual property spearheaded by projects such as Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club?  Read more: What Does an AI Chatbot ‘Think’ About DeFi? We Asked ChatGPT  This thinking presupposes these Web3 ideas will drive the opportunity by virtue of their own intrinsic appeal. But the problem has always been that human beings are addicted to, or at least dependent on, the communities that the Web2 model has fostered. Everyone keeps going to Facebook because everyone keeps going to Facebook.  The vista opened by OpenAI suggests that our Web3 future might not be dependent on the appeal of Web3 technologies per se, but by a force external to them, one that disrupts the core Web2 economy and leaves the world open to an alternative.  If the Web2 advertising model is about to get overturned, how will brands and media companies reach their customers and audiences to generate revenue? Maybe with NFTs.  An end to search means that, suddenly, the NFT projects of Nike, Starbucks, Anheuser-Busch, Time and others – all of them championed as a new way of connecting directly and meaningfully with loyal fans – could go from being cute ideas to a viable way to remonetize customer relationships.  All of this portends massive challenges for many Web2-founded businesses. There are also legitimate fears that AI systems like ChatGPT could become manipulated by agents of disinformation and do even more harm to human free will than the surveillance capitalism introduced by Web2 internet platforms.  Still, to think we may no longer be controlled by a single Silicon Valley company is appealing.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

Bitcoin miners often tout their economies of scale and low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as competitive advantages. While harnessing vented methane in other ways is possible, ARK believes that Bitcoin mining is ideal. By Sam Korus Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is a byproduct of oil and natural gas drilling. Every year, the global oil and gas industry spews 265 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas emissions into the atmosphere, vast amounts of energy that Bitcoin mining could harness productively, as shown below. While oil and gas companies flare/burn roughly 140 bcm of natural gas emissions to convert methane into less harmful carbon dioxide, it vents the other 125 bcm of methane directly into the atmosphere. Only 25 bcm, or ~10%, of total natural gas emissions would be necessary to support Bitcoin's current hash rate [1] globally.

Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2022; Chen et al. 2022 [2] The oil and gas industry will not be able to capture and convert all 265 bcm of natural gas emissions into electricity. While both flared and vented methane emissions could be used for Bitcoin mining, ARK believes that vented methane will be the first target because it is ~120 times more toxic than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere [3] , and companies haven't sunk infrastructure costs into flaring ecosystems. Of the 125 bcm in vented methane emissions, ARK estimates that only half occurs at well sites, the easiest and most productive locations for Bitcoin mining, as shown below. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold, any particular security or cryptocurrency. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2022; Chen et al. 2022; International Energy Agency 2022 [4] ARK's research suggests that installing natural gas generators at well sites and using methane that otherwise would be vented to mine Bitcoin could generate electricity at a cost much lower than public Bitcoin mining companies pay today. Assuming no supply constraints on mining hardware, Bitcoin miners could harness vented methane and undercut ""pure play"" Bitcoin mining companies, pushing them into the unprofitable territory. Moreover, if utility regulators were to introduce carbon abatement pricing plans, using vented methane to mine Bitcoin would become that much more attractive. We illustrate this competitive dynamic in the chart below. Bitcoin miners often tout their economies of scale and low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as competitive advantages. ARK's research suggests the LCOE of a natural gas generator using stranded methane [5] is lower today than that of public Bitcoin mining companies. If more companies or individuals were to mine Bitcoin at well sites, the network's hashrate likely would increase, lowering the average revenue/hashrate of miners elsewhere. If Bitcoin miners using vented natural gas were to generate revenue/hashrate at a price below 6 cents, then public mining companies paying roughly three cents for electricity today potentially would be forced out of business. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold, any particular security or cryptocurrency. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2022 While harnessing vented methane in other ways is possible, ARK believes that Bitcoin mining is ideal: it is distributed and highly scalable with modular hardware that can be transported to and shifted among operating well sites. Because oil and gas wells often have short lifespans, Bitcoin mining could make the difference between high and low returns on investment in oil and gas fields. 1* Hash rate is a measure of computational power used to mine and secure proof of work blockchains. 2* https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c06458 Yuanlei Chen et al. 2022.

Uniswap community members will get to vote on Dec. 14 on a restructuring package that will ""improve efficiency and efficacy"" for the DAO, according to a forum post by Devin Walsh, the foundation's executive director.  The biggest changes would see Uniswap governance reduce its requirement for off-chain ""snapshot votes"" that precede on-chain votes. It would drastically raise the barrier for clearing preliminary votes, a move that will ""prevent lower quality proposals"" from breaking through, according to Walsh's blog.  Final governance votes (the on-chain votes that approve or deny proposals) will remain the same.  ""One of the Uniswap Foundation's mandates is to enable better decision-making by the DAO, and a pain point has been the community governance process,"" Walsh told CoinDesk. ""We are pleased that this proposal has received so much feedback from delegates, and are excited for these changes to both increase the process's effectiveness as well as reduce its operational overhead.""  Uniswap community members have been active in their efforts to streamline governance and limit friction within the protocol.

42388264,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCUiB,1670601426,India Looks to Coordinate Global Crypto Rulemaking as It Assumes G-20 Presidency,"India, a country that has at times sought to ban and severely limit crypto usage within its borders, has as of Dec. 1 assumed the presidency of the Group of 20 – the intergovernmental forum of some of the world’s largest economies – just as much of the world is pondering whether stricter regulation of the industry is needed.  As India takes over the group, which includes 19 nations and the European Union as a bloc, for the next year, the country will bear the responsibility of shaping the group’s agenda.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no stranger to crypto. He has previously called for global cooperation to tackle challenges posed by cryptocurrencies as the technology “makes decisions taken by one country inadequate to meet the challenges.” India and its prime minister will host the 18th G-20 summit in New Delhi next year, Sept. 9-10.  The prioritizing of framing globally coordinated crypto rules reflects a renewed urgency for tighter regulations amid another chapter of crypto contagions triggered by the collapse of FTX.  A larger IMF role  India is looking to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lead consultations around the question of how to regulate crypto assets during its G-20 presidency, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  This could be a strategic geopolitical shift away from the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the international financial watchdog that has been the de facto leader in framing rules. Recently, the FSB proposed comprehensive international crypto rules. The chair of its crypto working group urged authorities to agree on global norms for the industry even as he warned that crypto would soon threaten global financial stability.  “The IMF is [a member] of the FSB but the FSB, established after the 2009 G-20 London Summit is seen to be closer to the G-20 and the U.S. at a time of Russia’s war against Ukraine,” said a person often consulted on policy matters by India’s Finance Ministry. “India may not want to alienate its old ally, Russia. Instead, a subtle shift towards the IMF may be seen as more neutral.”  The IMF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Indian finance ministry’s role  The G-20’s work is divided into the Finance Track and the Sherpa Track. The Finance Track consists of finance ministers and central bank governors from all G-20 members. With India assuming the presidency, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her team, led by Finance Secretary Ajay Seth, will be setting the agenda.  The other track, known as Sherpa because it involves envoys appointed by heads of governments who take leaders of nations to the final G-20 summit carrying all the responsibilities, is for all agendas outside the financial sector.  India’s finance ministry brought in several officers to supercharge its efforts around agenda-setting for its G-20 presidency, CoinDesk has learned. The ministry has assigned these officials priorities, including crypto policymaking. In the past few weeks, these officials along with senior officials of the ministry have traveled to Bengaluru where the first two G-20 meetings in the Finance Track will take place.  The first of around 40 meetings in the Finance Track, the “Finance and Central Bank Deputies Meeting” will be held from Dec. 13 to Dec. 15, followed by the G-20 “Framework Working Group Meeting” Dec. 16-17, confirmed people familiar with the matter.  India’s position on crypto  India’s government has refrained from taking a clear position on crypto. Sitharaman has said India hasn't set crypto-specific legislation yet because ""we need to have all the members of the G-20 first of all to come on board to see how best it can be done.  ""But this has not stopped India from imposing stiff taxes that have helped crush the local crypto industry. Other macroeconomic and crypto contagion factors are exacerbating the situation.  India will introduce its budget for the 2023-2024 fiscal year on Feb. 1, which is early during India’s yearlong G-20 presidency. The country could unveil new crypto-related tax rules that may be aligned with the G-20 but that would require a complete rethink, said Rajat Mittal, a tax counsel in India's Supreme Court.  Sitharaman can introduce rules for crypto if it is considered an asset in India, but the nation's central bank is responsible for overseeing crypto regulations if crypto is considered to be a currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained a view that banning cryptocurrency usage within the country is the most suitable choice for India. In June 2022, RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar said that CBDCs could ""kill"" whatever little case that could be for private cryptocurrencies.  Sitting in on those Finance Track meetings will be Sankar and other RBI officials, who will showcase the bank's retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDC), the pilots of which began in the past month, as part of India’s digital plans.

42388277,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVqL,1670601395,Bitcoin's Lightning Network Could Be Getting a Privacy Upgrade,"The Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling platform, has a privacy problem. Receiving payments, requesting refunds, and opening and closing payment channels (connections between Lightning nodes) – all raise privacy concerns for users of the payment network.  Those concerns have inspired protocol-based solutions like “Basis of Lightning Technology 12” (BOLT 12), a proposed upgrade that not only enhances privacy but also introduces many other useful features. (BOLTs are Lightning draft proposals similar to Bitcoin improvement proposals or BIP.)  Independent solutions have also sprung up – notably, lnproxy, an invoice privacy tool (invoices are simply payment requests), and LNURL, a suite of tools for enabling communication between various Lightning applications and services over the web.  So what’s a privacy-focused Bitcoiner to do, rely on the fledgling BOLT 12 specification or turn to one of these independent tools?  “The best thing about BOLT 12 and the technologies it relies on is that you won't need anything else,” Rusty Russell told CoinDesk. Russell is the lead developer of Core Lightning (CLN) at Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream. “Lightning nodes will give everyone the privacy they should have by default.”  Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?  What is BOLT 12?  “BOLT 12 adds a ton of functionality to Lightning invoices. It also adds privacy,” said Jack Sweeney, communications manager at LN Capital, creators of Torq – capital management software for Lightning routing nodes – in an interview with CoinDesk. “The real difference between BOLT 12 and something like lnproxy is that BOLT 12 is a protocol-based solution, whereas something like lnproxy is an application layer solution.”  BOLT 12 introduces “offers” to the Lightning Network. According to the official BOLT 12 website, “offers are a precursor to an invoice” that enable key functionality such as reusable QR codes, the ability to both send and receive payments and of course, enhanced privacy.  Reusable QR codes pave the way for use cases like recurring subscriptions and donations. Send and receive functionality can now be used for Lightning ATMs and private refunds. Finally, new features like route blinding, payer keys and Schnorr signatures will provide an extra layer of privacy.  Route blinding and receiving payments  Currently, receiving a Lightning payment means sharing private details with the sender (via an invoice). Route blinding (also called “blinded paths”) makes it possible for the sender to make that same payment to an anonymous recipient by hiding details about the route or path a payment has taken.  Lightning payments go from sender to receiver by “hopping” from one channel to the next via a series of Lightning nodes. With route blinding, each node only receives just enough information to pass the payment on to the next node until the payment reaches the recipient.  Payer keys and private refunds  How does a customer request a refund for a product or service they are unhappy with while keeping their identity private? Enter “payer keys.”  Offers in BOLT 12 generate payer keys that prove the origin of an invoice without revealing the customer’s identity. Combine that with route blinding and you get enhanced privacy during the refund process.  Schnorr signatures for on-chain transactions  BOLT 12 uses Schnorr signatures, the central component in Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade. Schnorr signatures are a simpler and more efficient alternative to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures that are still commonly used in Bitcoin today.  When a Lightning channel is closed, the closing transaction is currently reflected as a 2-of-2 multisignature (multisig) transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This metadata, together with additional information and some sophisticated sleuthing, can ultimately expose the personal financial data of private users.  Schnorr signatures could potentially solve this issue by making Lightning transactions look like regular single-signature Bitcoin transactions via a signature scheme called MuSig2.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: The Developers Who Wrote Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade  Lnproxy  An anonymous developer has been quietly working on lnproxy, and although the project is new and limited in scope, it’s been gaining a few fans among Bitcoiners.  The tool uses a feature called “wrapped” invoices to hide the destination of a Lightning payment or conceal the identity of a sender’s public Lightning node. Essentially, wrapped invoices do for lnproxy, what route blinding and payer keys do for BOLT 12.  Wrapped invoices are really just “hold” (or “hodl”) invoices – payment requests that require the recipient to perform some action before cashing the payment.  Per the lnproxy website, “lnproxy takes a Bolt 11 invoice and generates a ‘wrapped’ invoice that can be settled if and only if the original invoice is settled [first].”  BOLT 12 vs. lnproxy  CLN still considers BOLT 12 experimental, and not all Lightning implementations have adopted it.  “The thing about the way Lightning spec implementation works is that you need two implementations for it to be considered fully ratified,” Sweeney explains.  Based on responses in the BOLT 12 Telegram group, several teams like Lightning wallet firm ACINQ, open-source wallet project Lightning Development Kit (LDK), and open-source Lightning implementation project Lightning Network Daemon (LND) are all working on incorporating the specification, but none has fully adopted it.  “It's essentially in beta on Core Lightning,” Sweeney says.  Lnproxy also seems to be in some sort of beta stage, based on nascency alone, although nothing on its site explicitly mentions that. Nevertheless, it’s not as fully featured as BOLT 12.  “The privacy aspect [of BOLT 12] is just one part of it. The other part of it is the ability to pay with a static invoice,” says Henrik Skogstrom, CEO and founder of LN Capital.  An alternative to lnproxy in that regard may be something like LNURL which, although comparable to BOLT 12, requires a complex setup.  LNURL  LNURL is an independent project that’s developed a set of tools for enabling communication (over the web) between various Lightning applications.  Much like BOLT 12’s offers, LNURL enables withdrawals and reusable QR codes. LNURL can also replace standard username/password login schemes with a unique wallet-generated Bitcoin key, something not currently available via BOLT 12. Conversely, LNURL lacks standard BOLT 12 enhancements like blinded paths and payer keys.  But LNURL’s major drawback is that its users must run their own web server. This means setting up things like dedicated machines, software, domain names and web certificates – a process that requires time, money and expertise.  As it stands, both lnproxy and LNURL are effective additions to the Lightning “toolbox.” But the general sentiment seems to indicate little need for either, once BOLT 12 is fully adopted.  “The lnproxy server can hide your payment from the payer, but the server still knows who you paid and can definitely reveal it later. LNURL provides a nice way to request invoices but requires that you run a web service, which is not a simple thing to do,” Russell explains. “Lnproxy is a wonderful development and so is LNURL. But these are not substitutes for native Lightning privacy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/09/bitcoins-lightning-network-could-be-getting-a-privacy-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9600d3cbce70961939fe6117d49eae0febb5fbb0-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411306,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmWg,1670598494,Apple's New Encryption Policy Is a Huge Boon for Crypto,"On Wednesday, Apple Inc. made an announcement that might sound minor: It will now offer end-to-end encryption for most material its users backup on its iCloud storage service.  That means only a user with an authorized device will be able to access the contents of their cloud storage, in much the same way only the holder of a private key can control a bitcoin wallet. The new feature will protect photos, notes and other files for users who choose to activate it. Email, calendar and contacts material aren’t included, however, because they need to interact with multiple services. In an announcement that also outlines impressive new high-security messaging features, Apple said encrypted iCloud storage will begin rolling out worldwide in early 2023.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This change is, in fact, a huge deal.  Apple emphasizes the benefits of the new system for defending against hackers. But the privacy implications are arguably more profound. Until now, most materials on iCloud could be accessed by Apple under duress, such as when a search warrant or other court order forced them.  Apple has tried to stand up to those demands, for instance in its inconclusive 2015 court battle with the FBI. But the new encrypted storage system will render the legal debate moot: law enforcement and intelligence agencies will not be able to subpoena or otherwise compel Apple to hand over user data, because Apple will simply not have the technological ability to comply.  That’s why governments and intelligence agencies have reportedly pressured Apple for years not to release the feature. Apple’s defiance of that pressure is admirable, and has potentially immense benefits for public perception of digital privacy.  The most influential digital hardware and software maker on the planet, in short, is making a strong stand for the idea that real digital privacy should be allowed to exist. That Apple regards this as important enough that it is pushing back against the U.S. government puts the lie to one of the most shallow and cowardly arguments against privacy: the idea that “if you haven’t done anything wrong, you shouldn’t care about privacy.” Clearly, Tim Cook disagrees.  The move towards end-to-end encryption should in turn help normalize online financial privacy, a major agenda item for the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto privacy has been under mounting attack in cases such as the sanctioning of Tornado Cash.  The new Apple systems will benefit crypto more directly in two other ways. First, they will have some direct impact on the security of things like crypto keys and wallets. Whether through negligence or truly bad judgment, some crypto users have been known to store their security keys in iCloud backups. That makes them vulnerable to both hackers and, in one notorious instance, the FBI – but with Apple’s new encryption that risk will be massively reduced.  The final notable upside for crypto is that Apple’s new system will introduce a huge new user base to security practices and interface features also widespread in crypto. It will be the first time many users are asked to manage their own personal encryption keys, without a centralized recovery process. It’s not dissimilar to how non-custodial crypto apps and protocols require users to keep track of private keys to “be their own bank.”  Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi has called this a major responsibility because, much as with blockchain systems, Apple won’t be able to simply reset and send a new password when a user loses theirs. Though technical details are scarce, this is likely impossible to do without effectively giving Apple a backdoor to user files.  See also: 4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off | Opinion  To mitigate this downside, Apple will also introduce a process known as “social recovery” to a mass audience, according to the Washington Post. An encrypted iCloud user can name another person who will have to participate if they ever lose their encryption key. Social recovery or other “multi-signature” backup schemes are becoming more widespread in crypto as a solution to the risk of key loss.  We haven’t gotten a look at the interface or workflow yet, but you can bet Apple has designed something elegant and intuitive. Hundreds of thousands of users are about to be introduced to private key management by the most respected name in computing.

The letter, which was given to CoinDesk in response to a freedom-of-information request, is the latest indication that the European Commission is getting antsy about delays to its landmark crypto-regulation bill, called markets in crypto assets, or MiCA, which it sees as more urgent now in the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  “Recent events have highlighted once again the importance of having adequate regulation of crypto markets” to protect clients' assets and the wider economy, McGuinness, who is the EU's commissioner for financial services, said in the letter to Irene Tinagli, chairwoman of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, and Czech Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, who is also chairman of the EU's Council of Economy and Finance Ministers.  “I would ask you to do your utmost to ensure a rapid vote and subsequent publication of the MiCA and TFR (transfer of funds) regulations,” McGuinness wrote. McGuinness she wants the rules to come into force at the latest in spring of next year. The TFR is a parallel law intended to counter money laundering and requires crypto companies to verify the identity of those making transfers.  A European Parliament vote on the legislation, originally scheduled for this month, has been pushed back to February because of concerns about the length and complexity of the text, which must be translated into 24 languages. CoinDesk understands it’s also possible the vote could be held in March, though the legislation was in principle agreed last June. It will take effect 12 to 18 months after being published in the bloc’s official journal.  The two regulations “set a clear signal to other jurisdictions worldwide,” McGuinness said, with countries such as the U.S. and U.K. contemplating their own crypto laws.  Officials have noted that MiCA would have stemmed alleged improprieties at FTX , because it includes rules against the misuse of customer funds, though some lawmakers appear to be skeptical about that.

COIN shares slid 3.3% in premarket trading. The company's interest income, which accounted for 10%-15% of its Q3 revenue, from stablecoin issuer Circle's USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) has been increasingly vital for Coinbase ( COIN ) this year in the wake of bearish crypto sentiment and deteriorating trading volume, Dolev pointed out in a note.

Circle's payout to Coinbase climbed to $22M in Q2 from just $4M in Q1, the analyst noted.

42411688,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfFMH,1670594884,"What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, Explained","At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.  At Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.  In December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.  Read More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience  Below is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.  DESK FAQ:  What is DESK?  DESK is CoinDesk’s social token.  What is DESK’s mission?  DESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.  DESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.  How can I get DESK?  As of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:  Listening to episodes of Carpe Consensus  Watching select CDTV episodes  Visiting the DESK Hub  Engaging in chats on our Discord server  At Consensus 2023, we'll have many in-person ways to earn DESK, such as 2022's Easter egg airdrops around the festival. Stay tuned!  Cool, so what can I do with DESK?  Unlock the token-gated Discord server  Users with at least 1 DESK can vote for our special community polls and earn DESK for engaging.  You can tip other users with DESK  At Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:  A drink at the bar  Food from nearby vendors that have partnered with CoinDesk  Merchandise, such as hoodies or T-shirts  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) from our online marketplace  Special on-site offers from Consensus exhibitors and partners  Unique experiences, like playing ""Horse"" basketball with Spencer Dinwiddie or chess with Garry Kasparov.  On what blockchain is DESK?  DESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.  Why isn’t DESK on Ethereum proper?  Polygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.  What do I need to do before the next Consensus to be able to spend DESK?  You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.  Read more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet  Do I need to create a CoinDesk account to use DESK?  Yes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.  What is the problem you’re trying to solve?  In the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).  We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.  We believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.  We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.  Why do you need a blockchain for loyalty points?  Social tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.  Initially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.  Simply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.  Will DESK increase in value?  No. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.  Why doesn’t DESK have monetary value?  It is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.  By providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We've seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.  Can I mine DESK?  No. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.  Can I stake my DESK to earn more tokens?  No. See above.  Is CoinDesk using DESK to raise funds?  No. We're not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.  If the token is on mainnet, what’s to stop anyone from listing it on an exchange or trading it?  Listing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.  Banning? Blacklisting? That doesn’t sound very decentralized. What gives?  It’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.  So, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.  OK, but if DESK has no monetary value how did taco stands or bars in Austin accept it during Consensus 2022?  Part of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.  Are there gas (on-chain computation) fees for using DESK?  No. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.  How?  CoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.  What if I got DESK in 2021 at the virtual Consensus? Can I still use it?  Because DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK's beta testers.  Who are the 'Piranhas'?  Piranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.  At Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.  Who built DESK?  CoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.  Which wallets support DESK?  As mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.  How do I connect my DESK wallet to my CoinDesk account?  Navigate to the DESK dashboard. Select ""Create or Connect Wallet"" and approve the transaction in your wallet.  Are DESK transactions anonymous?  Depends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK's page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.  Do I need to report DESK transactions on my taxes?  DESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.  How do I keep up with DESK updates?  We’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.  You can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.  What’s the future of DESK?  The latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We'll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experience",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC | MINING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-desk-coindesks-social-token-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6507cf132c4deddfef77a84b1f2689043e574429-1440x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stock fell 2.8% to $41.60 in premarket trading.  In a research report, Mizuho also said that interest income from Circle’s USD coin (USDC) has become increasingly important for Coinbase, accounting for 10%-15% of third-quarter revenue, amid deteriorating sentiment and trading volumes.  Any potential changes to Coinbase’s USDC income from Circle could have an “amplified adverse effect on its profitability,” the report said.  Coinbase, which is a co-founder of USDC, on Friday waived off conversion fees for users who wish to switch to USDC from Tether's USDT.  Irrespective of interest income risks, the bank’s analysis shows that 2023 revenue estimates are likely overly optimistic.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on Wednesday that the company’s revenue will be half or less what it was last year as the exchange struggles amid sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX.  The company's shares have fallen over 80% this year, and the stock has been one of the worst performers on the Nasdaq index.

5335834,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511827,1670593490,Ethereum: On-Chain And Social Metrics Reveal Bulls Vs. Bears Battle – Who’s Winning?,"Ethereum (ETH) has failed to rise above key resistance at $1,300 despite rising around 4% over the past 24 hours. At press time, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $1,289. As the trading volume shows, the bulls and bears have woken up again. In the last 24 hours, the trading volume was $6.4 billion, which is about 31% higher than the previous day. Ethereum On-Chain And Social Metrics Show Uncertainty Analysis company Santiment has conducted an analysis of bullish and bearish signs in on-chain and social data for Ethereum and the result is mixed. A bullish argument is made by Ethereum’s shark and whale addresses. As Santiment writes, just as with Bitcoin, the ETH millionaire addresses gave up much of their supply while conditions looked poor. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department However, this circumstance has fundamentally changed recently. A month ago, large ETH addresses started accumulating Ethereum again. Since November 7, Ethereum addresses holding 100 million to 1 million coins have accumulated 1.36% of the total supply and 2.09% more ETH overall (than before). Social volume, on the other hand, looks bearish. As with the majority of all cryptocurrencies, the number of discussions on Ethereum is decreasing, but this seems normal for a bear market. As Santiment notes, this is not necessarily a bad thing when the weak hands leave the market. What is negative, however, is that “there is so little talk about Ethereum compared to other top assets.” Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot At the same time, this could also turn into a bullish argument if bullish whales can drive the price higher with little resistance, thus significantly affecting the general market sentiment. Currently bearish is also the MVRV (average trading return of addresses). The average return among long-term (365-day) addresses still indicates a “lot of pain.” However, based on an emerging long-term uptrend in the MVRV, the metric could also be moving into bullish territory. Extremely bullish is the remaining supply of Ethereum on exchanges. This is at a 4-year low of 12.1% of total supply. Thus, the metric clearly points to a nascent bottom that is forming. Sides Are Still Polarized In contrast, funding rates (perpetual contracts) are neutral. Neither the bulls nor bears can prevail on this metric at the moment. ETH funding rates have been too flat to swing in either direction since the FTX implosion. In terms of realized gains/losses, the bears are clearly winning at the moment, according to Santiment’s analysis. Given the recent surge in the Ethereum price, there is currently a lot of short-term profit-taking. Ultimately, Santiment summarizes: Overall, Ethereum’s on-chain and social metrics are about as mixed as the crowd’s perspective is. Long-term? […] Ethereum is very likely closer to its upcoming 3-year low vs. its 3-year high. But are we at maximal pain? Probably not yet.",NEUTRAL,ETH | LTC,BTC | ETH | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-metrics-reveal-bulls-vs-bears-battle-whos-winning/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5335834.jpeg

According to information from Coingecko, at press time, the ERC20 governance token built on the Ethereum blockchain is changing hands at $7,087, going up by 5.7% during the past week and tallying an impressive 15.7% jump on its bi-weekly gauge. Here’s a quick glance of YFI performance: YFI is experiencing a significant decline in its daily trading volume Yearn Finance could fall all the way down to $6K within the next few days The altcoin could start 2023 with a bullish run to reclaim the $8K territory However, the altcoin’s technical indicators, specifically its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), on its 4-hour chart doesn’t give much for traders to desire as they indicate a potential bearish run for the asset. The RSI settled below the 50-neutral zone at 48.97, suggesting that selling pressure increased and a lot of buyers veered away from the asset. Meanwhile, Yearn Finance’s CMF fell into a negative value of -0.07 – an indication of a weakened buying activity. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department Source: TradingView Daily Active Addresses Count And Trading Volume Decline Along with the above-mentioned technical indicators, some developments concerning the cryptocurrency and its network pointed towards a bearish momentum. During the previous week, the number of unique addresses that traded Yearn Finance decreased sharply, going down by 41%. In fact, at the time of this writing, there were only 248 wallets monitored to have participated in YFI transactions. While the cryptocurrency’s spot trading price went up by 3% over the last 24 hours, its trading volume took a hit as it became lower by 25% during the same period. With these, there is a need for a significant uptick in demand for the crypto asset for another increase in value to be triggered as buyers in YFI market appear to be exhausted. However, it would seem that the digital currency could not catch a break as even in that particular department, it is showing signs of struggle. According to latest data, at the moment, only 59 new addresses were present at the network – 48% lower than what was observed within the last eight days.

The SEC issued letters to companies flagging the need to disclose any potential impact from the mayhem in the crypto markets. “Recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants have caused widespread disruption in those markets,” the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance said in a sample letter to companies, published Thursday.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) discount has widened to a record high near 50%. Bearish sentiment surrounding the trust deepened over the last few weeks as fears surfaced that crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), could file for bankruptcy. DCG is also CoinDesk's parent company. Shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, GBTC, hit a record-high discount rate of 47.3% on Thursday, according to data from crypto index provider TradeBlock.  Crypto trading firm Amber Group has ditched its $25 million Chelsea FC sponsorship deal and is laying off staff. Amber Group, which is backed by Singapore's investment fund, Temasek. and Sequoia Capital, is terminating its sponsorship deal with the soccer team, according to a Bloomberg report. The company is also laying off about 300 employees to slash its workforce to fewer than 400. At one point, Amber Group employed more than 1,100.  Chart of the Day  The chart compares bitcoin's implied volatility with the dollar index, WTI crude, swaps and the S&P 500 going back to September 2021.  Bitcoin’s implied volatility (shown in deep purple at the bottom of the chart), which represents investors’ expectations for price turbulence, has drifted lower this year despite the collapse of several crypto industry leaders, including Terra, FTX and BlockFi.  ""The cryptocurrency's volatility is likely to drop significantly next year – either because all the major risk events are out of the way or speculators lose interest to put on leveraged positions,"" Matrixport said.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Chainlink’s First Staking Pool Pulls in $170M of LINK Tokens, Hitting Community Limit After 2 Days  How Confident Are Institutional Investors About Bitcoin?

The trading debut for the new fund, under the symbol “DEFG,” comes as the shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Grayscale has said it’s operating business as usual, but speculation about the fund’s future has arisen among traders and on Twitter in recent weeks amid swirling questions about the finances of Grayscale’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, after a halt in crypto lending operations at another subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital. (CoinDesk is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.)  Similar to Grayscale’s other multi-asset investment vehicles, the DeFi fund is designed to give investors exposure to price movements of a basket of digital assets through a single investment vehicle via the stock market instead of buying the cryptocurrencies directly.

An earlier suspension order, issued on Nov. 10 after FTX Japan halted user withdrawals, was set to expire on Friday.  The FSA reiterated its earlier position, saying that it is necessary to take all possible measures to ensure that FTX Japan's assets do not flow out to overseas affiliates and that the interests of users are not harmed.  Japan may be one of very few jurisdictions where FTX customers might be able to receive their funds back, following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange in early November.  FTX Japan said the company is proceeding with the business improvement plan submitted to the regulator on Nov. 16, in a notice posted on its website today. Trading services, deposits and account opening will remain suspended.  It has been working on a plan to return user assets but has not released specifics on when users can expect to receive their funds back.  The FSA responded to a written enquiry from CoinDesk saying that it had ordered FTX Japan to return assets promptly, but had not given a specific deadline.  “We understand that client assets held by FTX Japan are preserved and segregated from its own assets,” the FSA wrote to CoinDesk.

5334329,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511747,1670589664,Latest Ethereum Short Price Rally – Courtesy Of Whale Activities?,"Ethereum has been showing bullish momentum in the last seven days. ETH has gained momentum in the past 24 hours, while other coins are still declining. This rally supports some theories that the asset will rise above the resistance level in the coming days. Weeks after a massive fallout, the second largest cryptocurrency is heading towards a comeback. The FTX crisis, with other macro factors, affected the entire crypto market, with many assets crashing flat. Although there are many uncertainties in the crypto market, hope seems to be returning to the Ethereum community. Related Reading: MATIC Price Battles Under $1 Despite Bullish Signals Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder, made a statement urging people to focus on the technology instead of the current prices. The co-founder was confident that Ethereum-based applications for monetary transactions would scale up the blockchain in the long run. Ethereum Whales Are Buying The Dip In Buterin’s notes, he expressed a bullish stance that the decentralized stablecoins and the other applications built on Ethereum could have long-term benefits. Meanwhile, bullish Ethereum holders are taking advantage of the dip to accumulate more Ether positions. According to data from Santiment, Ethereum whales are taking advantage of the low prices to buy more ETH. The blockchain analytical firm tweeted that the shark and whale address, with 100 to 1 million ETH, added 2.1% more coins to their wallets. It could be a sign of bullish sentiment for a price rally in the weeks to come. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,280. Two months ago, before Ethereum transitioned to proof of stake, many investors were bullish about the price increase the upgrade could bring. However, two months after the merger, their hopes got dashed as the asset price continuously dropped. Although the upgrade sought to improve the blockchain’s infrastructure, the co-founder said it could take months to reflect on the ETH price. Bitcoin Stays Down While XRP Surges Amid Whale Accumulations While Ethereum seems to exhibit some bullish trend, Bitcoin is declining with a 24-hour price drop of $0.02%. Other coins are not doing any better, including FTX, except XRP. The report shows that the XRP price increased in the last 24 hours after whale accounts moved over 160 million tokens. According to a report, whales accumulated more than $19 million of XRP tokens from the Bitso crypto exchange. In addition, the report revealed that the tracker recorded another whale addition of 40 million XRP, approximately $15.3 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: What Elliott Wave Theory Suggests Is Next For BTC The tracker also reported that an account with the name, Ripple, moved more than 50 million XRP of about $19.2 million to an anonymous wallet.

Parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes Genesis about $1.7 billion. Bernstein sees three potential approaches for DCG: It could raise capital, sell non-strategic assets and save digital currency asset manager Grayscale or dissolve the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  The “nuclear option,” and the least preferred choice for DCG, would be a dissolution of GBTC, the report said. DCG could apply for Reg M relief and instead of bitcoin (BTC) being sold in the open market upon dissolution, it could be exchanged for GBTC shares. That would leave holders of GBTC with bitcoin instead, causing the least market impact. It's unclear, however, if GBTC holders want to own the bitcoin itself as many bought the fund to avoid the hassles of cryptocurrency custody, the report added.  Raising capital may prove difficult as valuations have dropped significantly in the private market since DCG’s last fundraising in November 2021, the note said. And with $2 billion of loans, the company’s balance sheet position is much worse. Therefore, a potential DCG deal structure would be a “comprehensive strategic financing” using a combination of debt to fund the loans, and fresh equity, the note added.  Given the size of loans and illiquid assets, it is likely that the state of the balance sheet would weigh on the residual equity value, Bernstein said. This suggests that any deal would require a more strategic partner to be involved.  “The feasible deal might be somewhere between a large minority partner or a buyout-like structure into DCG, led by more strategic partners, possibly financial institutions looking to buy entry into the industry,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  As Grayscale is the “crown jewel” and largest revenue generator in the group, the founders could decide to sell non-core assets including CoinDesk, Luno, Foundry or other venture assets, the note said, but it is not clear if this would bridge the balance sheet gap or happen quickly enough.  The best option would be for DCG to work toward a comprehensive, strategic financing of the group, and any deal may involve founder Barry Silbert “giving up a large part of the pie,” the note added.

5333197,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511797,1670586758,Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot,"With the Bitcoin price posting a small gain of over 1.5% over the last seven days, the market is in for a blockbuster next week. The release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on December 13, Tuesday at 08:30 AM ET, will once again be “the most important CPI ever”. Just one day later, on December 14, Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET, the final Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the year will take place. Remarkably, FED members will release their updated forecasts for inflation and interest rates (dot plot) at the meeting. A Blockbuster Week The dot plot is released only four times a year – in March, June, September, and December – and presents the FOMC’s economic projections, which look at GDP, unemployment rates, and inflation for the coming months as well as over the longer term. Within the dot plot, each member of the Committee publishes its view of potential interest rates over the longer term. For investors, this is extremely useful information as it allows market participants to see if the consensus path for longer-term interest rates is changing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Regains Strength, Why BTC Could Surpass $18K This Time The markets, as well as Bitcoin investors, will therefore be eagerly watching the inflation forecasts for next year, as well as the interest rate expectations for 2023 and 2024. As economic journalist Colby Smith wrote in November, the September dot plot showed most officials favored a slowdown to 50 basis points in December. The question for next week will be whether the Fed, led by Powell, will put into play a slower rate hike pace of 25 basis points (bps) or even a pivot. The Fed introduced the notion of slowing down the pace of hikes in July and the September dot plot showed support from most officials for a downshift to 50bps in December. The question today is how far Powell goes to ratify that move https://t.co/Pn8n0lh4kZ @FinancialTimes pic.twitter.com/62XOqMlm3T — Colby Smith (@colbyLsmith) November 2, 2022 A Year-End Rally for Bitcoin? These two events could be the “last remaining hurdles” for a year-end rally for Bitcoin, QCP Capital wrote in an analysis. However, a higher-than-expected consumer price index and a tighter stance by the Federal Reserve could derail that rally, as was seen in the April and August reversals. Related Reading: Ethereum Addresses Holding 32 ETH Or More On The Rise, This On-Chain Data Shows On the other hand, further disinflation could lead many to seek a continuation of the rally through the end of the year, according to QCP Capital’s analysis. It goes on to say that the question markets now face is where inflation will bottom. Even if 2% inflation is out of reach next year, will it fall low enough such that the Fed will have room to cut rates while keeping real rates positive? Therefore, one key market theme for next year will be the shift from ‘peak inflation’ to ‘trough inflation’. This is another reason why the dot plot is of paramount importance. As the last two releases show, Powell has stuck relatively strictly to projections regarding interest rates. Thus, the dot plot could reveal some insights into Powell’s thoughts about a pivot. If the new data matches CPI expectations, it would be the fifth consecutive monthly decline. After peaking at 9.1% YoY in June. Next week’s reading could be even the lowest since January. Will Powell Follow His Words Given Powell’s recent comments to the Brookings Institute on November 30, it is also likely that the FED will stick to the script and raise the policy rate by only 50 basis points to 4.5%, reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market. If the CPI even comes in below expectations, markets could frontrun the Fed’s decision and trigger an end-of-year rally. In any case, next week will provide blockbuster volatility in the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Investors should pay close attention to the release of the FED’s dot plot.

42388482,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGwpX,1670585586,FTX Revival Proposal Supported by Sam Bankman-Fried Lifts FTT Token,"FTT, the native cryptocurrency of the failed FTX crypto exchange, surged Friday after the platform's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, came out in support of an exchange revival plan proposed by a crypto influencer Ran Neuner.  ""I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to explore! I *hope* that the teams in place will do so,"" Bankman-Fried tweeted in response to Neuner's proposal to restart FTX by issuing a new FTT token and giving it to creditors and depositors.  Neuner, the host of CNBC's ""Crypto Trader"" show that launched in 2020, recommended distributing 100% of profits to token holders, adding that the idea would reestablish FTX as a dominant player and make users whole.  ""Neuner's proposal is equivalent to a debt restructuring plan,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin. ""Sam's support for the same seems to have revived hope among investors that they would get their funds back.""  The FTT token surged as much as 47% to $1.97, the highest since Nov. 16, after Bankman-Fried's tweet at 08:18 UTC, TradingView data show.  Not everyone is positive on this move.  “I think this is like a perfect… second-leg-of-the-scam strategy,” said Markus Thielen, head of research at crypto lender Matrixport, on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Friday.  Thielen likened the issuance of new FTX tokens to the history of BTC-e, the Russian crypto exchange that closed down in 2017 after its founder was arrested for laundering a total of $4 billion. The exchange was later reborn as WEX with the promise of returning BTC-e account holders’ money. However, WEX, too, was shuttered a year later, with some $450 million said to be stolen.  For Thielen, FTX’s revival is a tall order.  “The brand is just extremely tainted,” he said, adding that exchanges tend to have a “shelf life” of a couple of years. “Investors have really shown that once they have been really scammed out of a project or protocol, that they just move on to the next one.”  FTX's troubles began early last month after a CoinDesk story showed sister concern Alameda Research holding large amounts of the illiquid FTT tokens, a sign of the unusually close relationship between the two entities.  In response, leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the sale of its FTT token holdings, triggering a bank run-like situation at FTX and forcing it to halt customer withdrawals. On Nov. 11, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections.  FTT crashed 94% to $1.31 in November, destroying billions of dollars in investor wealth.  FTX's failure, described by many as crypto's Lehman moment, has brought down several industry heavyweights, including lender BlockFi.

42388471,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRGwIn,1670579969,Crypto Miner Hive Cuts Computing Power Forecast for Intel Chip-Based Rigs,"Crypto mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) will receive less computing power than forecast from its mining rigs using Intel's (INTC) new chips.  The 5,800 new machines, dubbed Hive Buzzminers, will have total computing power of more than 630 petahash/second (PH/s), the Vancouver firm said Friday. In October, it estimated a total of 1 exahash/second (EH/s).  Hive did not give a reason for the discrepancy, and had not responded to CoinDesk's request for comment by the time of publication. It's possible it changed the specification of the machines to lower power consumption during a period of high electricity costs. It's also possible it ordered fewer machines than anticipated as the price of bitcoin fell more than 60% this year.  Some of the machines have already been installed, with the rest expected by the end of January. The rigs' computing power of about 109 terahahes/second (TH/s) per machine is a little over that of Bitmain's Antminer S19 Pro, released in 2020. Hive didn't divulge the energy efficiency or cost of the rigs, key metrics for miners struggling to keep up with high power costs. The Intel chip is touted as environmentally friendly, indicating that efficiency will be its strong suit.  Intel's second-generation Blocksale application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for bitcoin mining rigs was announced in April. It is expected to break the Bitmain and MicroBT duopoly in the bitcoin mining ASIC market. Miners can configure the chip into machines of their own design, such as Hive's. That is a marked difference from the Bitmain machines, which are notoriously closed-source. The flexibility, however, comes with the difficulties of deciding on designs and bringing them to production.  Argo Blockchain (ARBK), another one of Intel's early clients, decided to redesign the machines, leading to delays in deployment. The London-based company, which is working with ePIC Blockchain on the rigs, said it wanted to reorient the machines more toward power efficiency, bringing them closer to close to Bitmain's Antminer S19 XP with 134 TH/s at 21.5 joules/terahash. Initially, the machines were designed for computing power, Argo said.  Griid Infrastructure and Jack Dorsey's company, Block (formerly Square), have been named as other first customers.

5330619,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511781,1670578227,How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department,"Litecoin (LTC) seemingly hit a speed bump that caused its bullish run to slow down a bit after it rallied all the way up to the $83 zone on December 5. The following day, the cryptocurrency closed the trading session with a trading price below the $80 marker before reclaiming said territory on December 7. Since then, the altcoin has been on a downward trend although it is already showing signs of recovery. In fact, at the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, Litecoin is changing hands at $78.18. LTC only managed to go up by 3% during the last 24 hours but it is still enjoying an increase of 36.3% in its value over the last 30 days. Moreover, the asset, despite its recent price dump, has once again managed to outperform other major cryptocurrencies in other departments. Related Reading: Solana Price Falls Below $14 – Does This Signal A Gloomy Week For SOL? Litecoin Surpasses Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP In Transactions The 13th largest digital currency with a total market cap of $5.60 billion recently emerged as one of the top choices among cryptocurrencies used as a mode of payment for Bitpay. Specifically, Litecoin accounted for 27.64% of the overall tally of transactions that were being processed by the company’s platform. Although it failed to supplant Bitcoin in this category after the maiden crypto appeared to have been utilized as payment for 41.62% of Bitpay’s total transactions, LTC still beat the likes of Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). In addition, the altcoin also proved to be profitable for its miners as data shared by CryptoCompare revealed Litecoin mining had an extremely high profitability rate of 58%. Along this line, its network hash rate also spiked by 3.05% during the last 30 days – a development that suggests that the asset’s blockchain remains strong and healthy. A Bearish Outlook Looms For Litecoin After a bear market-defying performance, LTC seems to be headed on a decline that might cause it to lose the gains it had when it increased its price by more than 33% after November 23. The cryptocurrency experienced rejection when it tested the resistance region of $84.45 as its Relative Strength Index (RSI), which now stands at 38.40, has fallen below the 50-neutral score. The current state of the above-mentioned technical indicator coupled with its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) which was below zero (-0.06) at the time of this writing indicates the momentum now belongs to sellers. With that being said, Litecoin appears to be headed for another bearish trajectory and if left to deal with the possibility of a decline all the way down to $70.40.

Amber Group, which is backed by Temasek and Sequoia Capital, is also laying off around 300 staff to slash its workforce to less than 400. At its peak it employed more than 1,100, the report said.  Under the sponsorship, Chelsea would show the logo of Amber’s WhaleFin trading platform on team shirts for the duration of the current 2022/2023 season.  The decision to reduce its workforce and scrap the sponsorship, which was announced just seven months ago, comes during a cyclical lull in the crypto market that prompted the collapse of numerous key companies including FTX, BlockFi and Celsius Network.  The crypto trader is also winding down its retail operations, a move that will see its customer base fall to around 100 from hundreds of thousands as it focuses on institutional investors and family offices.  Amber also raised just half of a planned $100 million round and halted its expansion plans, according to a FT report.  On-chain analysts have suggested that Amber Group may follow in the footsteps of Alameda Research, the trading firm tied to FTX that imploded last month, with crypto sleuth lookonchain claiming that Amber Group has just $9.46 million in assets.

In October, minister Andrew Griffith said he wanted to “tentatively seize"" crypto opportunities, and promised a consultation on how to use new legislative crypto powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Bill before the Christmas holiday.  In a package of financial services reforms unveiled Friday, setting out how to replace European Union banking and financial-market laws, the Treasury said it would extend an existing tax break, which allows investors to use a U.K.-based manager without drawing extra tax liability, to the crypto sector. The change will be made via regulations this year.  The Treasury also said it will implement a ""sandbox"" to test out innovative financial market infrastructures next year, and will consult on a digital pound in the coming weeks.  In April, Rishi Sunak, then finance minister and now prime minister, said he wanted to make the U.K. a global crypto hub. While U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority has already tentatively set out how it would use new crypto powers, some in the industry have warned that new advertising restrictions could prove unduly complex.

If you look at the data from CoinGecko, the most notable positive change is 4.1% on the bi-weekly timescale. The red flashing of the longer time scales, however, indicates that ETH has been declining in value since the FTX collapse, and this fact overshadows the shorter time scales. The upswing was triggered by a sudden increase in demand for prime real estate The descending triangle, a confirmation of a rally, is formed in part by accumulation blocks To push prices higher, ETH buyers need to break over the $1,306.66 barrier However, a number of indicators are suddenly showing optimistic signs. With the price of ether at $1,283 right now, recent headlines have reported a sharp increase in the number of holders with certain units of ether. Glassnode discovered a surge in the number of addresses holding 32 ETH or more, or nearly $42,000, despite the fact that the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been dropping and has been volatile. The chart indicating the number of active addresses that had been tallied showed that there were more than 127,000 of them. In addition, it was quite evident that the number of addresses at this time had not only been up but had reached an all-time peak in the previous few years. Related Reading: Up Or Down? What To Expect From Solana (SOL) In The Homestretch Of 2022 Possibly Creating A Rally? Contrary to the rise, CryptoQuant reports that the number of active addresses fell on December 7th. Another bullish indicator is the sharp drop in foreign exchange reserves that has coincided with the rise in the number of high-value addresses. ETH created two bullish order blocks before the increase in high-value addresses. The price of ETH increased by 14.33% and 12.94% during the first and second bullish blocks, respectively. Chart: CryptoQuant The increase of high-value addresses has not yet been reflected in the price, as the price has decreased throughout this time period. Recent market moves have also contributed to the creation of a bullish descending triangle. The regression channel, which has a Pearson’s R value of 0.6824, bolsters this bullish finding. This indicates that the upward breaks of the upper half of the regression channel correspond to a significant upward trend. Chart: TradingView Quite Surprisingly Bullish The moving average of the Bollinger band acts as resistance at $1,252.15, thereby prolonging this surge. With the RSI rising and the MFI turning bullish, though, the ETH price should explode. Consequently, ETH bulls should initially aim for $1,306. If momentum permits, a further target of $1,348 would indicate that this is the relief rally that ETH holders have been anticipating. The construction of bullish order blocks, the decline in exchange reserves, and the increase of high-value addresses led to the current state of affairs. With Bitcoin’s bullish trend, the future of Ethereum appears to be very bright. Related Reading: Solana Price Falls Below $14 – Does This Signal A Gloomy Week For SOL?

""The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we’ve seen a flight to safety,"" Coinbase said in blog post published Friday morning Asia time. ""We believe that USD coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin.""  Coinbase said starting today it's waiving fees for global retail customers to convert tether (USDT) to USDC.  Coinbase is a co-founder of USDC.  On-chain data shows that USDT is the third-most widely traded digital asset on Coinbase, representing 5% of the volume on the exchange, where it currently trades for 99 cents.  Days after the FTX collapse, USDT was knocked off its peg and traded as low as 93 cents. The majority of trading pairs on exchanges have returned to $1, though CoinGecko data shows that USDT continues to trade at 99 cents on some pairs at Binance.  In late September, the issuing company, Tether, was ordered by a federal court judge in New York to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT. This is separate from the lawsuit before the New York Supreme Court (where CoinDesk is a party to the proceedings) that's asking for the New York Attorney General to release documents it gathered in its investigation into Tether’s reserves.

5322295,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511719,1670558442,Polkadot Bears Might Drag Its Price Down Despite Bullish Signals,"The Polkadot price has attempted to break past its immediate resistance several times during the first week of December. Despite that, the bulls could not build on their strength. This suggests that the coin’s buying power remained low at higher price levels for the altcoin. The technical outlook for the coin depicted a fall in demand. Accumulation has remained quite low for Polkadot throughout the month of November and the first few weeks of December. DOT increased 2% over the last 24 hours, but that doesn’t reflect bullishness on the one-day chart. The Polkadot price has to trade above the $5.71 mark to target $6. The $5.71 price resistance has been a strong barrier for the coin. Broader market strength and a push from buyers can only help the altcoin move north. Polkadot market capitalization also declined, indicating that bearish strength still prevailed. Related Reading: MATIC Price Battles Under $1 Despite Bullish Signals Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.30 at press time. Although the coin crossed the $5 mark, the bears could drag the price to $4.30. Immediate resistance for Polkadot was at $5.71, breaching which DOT could have a shot at $6. On the other hand, the first line of support stood at $4.50, falling through which the coin will rest at $4 if DOT does not lose momentum, which appears unlikely given the low demand for the altcoin. A bounce off the $5 mark could help Polkadot move above the $5.70 mark. Toppling the $5.70 level will give DOT a chance to rally to $6.21. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session remained low, which meant bearishness on the chart. Technical Analysis DOT depicts that buyers have lost interest in the altcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell closer to the 40-mark, meaning that buying strength was much lower than selling strength on the chart. The Polkadot price had tried to move above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line several times in the past few weeks. Despite that, the bulls lost steam. At the moment, the Polkadot price was below the 20-SMA line, which indicated low demand and that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The other technicals also pointed towards negative price action. The Directional Movement Index was negative, as the -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index (red) indicates the strength of the price momentum; it was above the 20 mark but noted a downtick. This downtick denoted a loss in the strength of the price momentum. Bollinger bands depict price volatility and fluctuation. The bands were constricted, indicating range-bound movement and low volatility for the altcoin.

BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $17,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin found support near $16,700 and started a decent increase. The price is trading above $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $16,875 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

However, BTC bears failed to clear the $16,700 level. The price traded as low as $16,700 before there was a fresh increase. There was a decent increase above the $16,850 and $16,900 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $17,440 swing high to $16,700 low.

The next major resistance is near $18,250, above which the price rise towards the $18,500 zone in the near term. Dips Supported in BTC?

5317640,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511687,1670547605,"Crypto Crisis Pushes BTC Mining Difficulty To Bottom Spot, Any Possibility Of Reversal?","The low profitability of BTC mining is still puzzling for many crypto fanatics and investors. There’s no surprise here, given the ever-increasing energy costs. Moreover, the bear market is also significantly impacting Bitcoin’s mining difficulty. As for now, making reasonable profits from mining Bitcoin is not probable. This fact, however, doesn’t imply that BTC mining is fruitless. On the contrary, miners would be alright, provided they engage the right tools in the mining process. Related Reading: Data Suggests Ethereum Layer-2 Tokens May Experience Explosive Upside The Difficulty of BTC Mining Drops The BTC mining sector is experiencing a downturn. The difficulty percentage of mining Bitcoin dropped to about 7.32% on Tuesday. This occurrence isn’t far-fetched from the plummeting prices of digital tokens, which has also lessened miners’ gains. According to data from the BTC.com mining pool, the system made the most significant adjustment since July 2021, with block height at 766,080. The adjustment matched July 2021, when many miners backed out of the system. This motion resulted from China’s ban on digital currencies at the time. As per the BTC mining process, the computing power or hashrate upon mining defines the outcome of mining difficulty. This system is essential to stabilize the time required to achieve one block of Bitcoin. As the number of miners increases, so does the mining difficulty. In addition to the reduced mining difficulty, BTC miners are also seeing a steady increase in energy costs and electricity rates. These events also negatively impacted miners’ revenue in the last few months. Howbeit, miners are not the only victims of the stubborn plummeting price of Bitcoin. Recognized producers like Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Core Scientific (CORZ) strive to survive bearish market liquidity pressures. Compute North, on the other hand, saw Chapter 11 bankruptcy as the only way out. The company witnessed a breakthrough after acquiring new and efficient equipment a few months back. At the time, they received new miners who drove several projects into success. Also, there was a notable increase in difficulty and hashrate between August and November 2021, when the last positive adjustment was made. Crypto Winter Becomes The Main Influence The company had hoped that the success would continue, only to be driven by the adverse wind of the 2022 crypto winter. This was the beginning of the downturn of the hashrate. Nevertheless, it displays higher values than those shown immediately after China’s breakoff from the crypto sector. Miners now seek to have a reduced price of electricity due to the steady plunging in profits. But, according to a Luxor analyst, Jaran Mellerud, miners still pay between $0.07 and $0.08/kWh for an average electricity price of $0.05/kWh. In the meantime, the price of BTC stands at $16,961. The token shows a 24-hour price change of -0.46%.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin's late surge sends it above $17K again.  Insights: Tokocrypto would not confirm reports that Binance is acquiring the Indonesia exchange. In the interim, Tokocrypto token holders are seeing the token price rise.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 870.77 +18.6 ▲ 2.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,232 +394.2 ▲ 2.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,280 +49.2 ▲ 4.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,963.51 +29.6 ▲ 0.8% Gold  $1,801 +15.5 ▲ 0.9% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.49% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Returns Above $17K After Late Surge  By James Rubin  Bitcoin ignored concerns about inflation, a cratering economy and the latest crypto woes, rising 2.3% over the previous 24 hours after a late Thursday surge.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $17,230, its highest point since early Monday.  BTC subsequently struggled to clear the $17,000 support it has held for much of the previous 10 days as fearful investors returned to risk averse crouches. Crypto markets have been fearful of events within the industry and beyond that might send prices tumbling to lower levels.  ""It's going to be a a bit slower growth pattern,"" JJ Kinahan, CEO of online trading firm IG North America, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, although he added that he sensed ""new money wanting to get into the market,"" saying that investors were ""over"" a ""crisis of confidence.""  Kinahan added that for the remainder of the year he will be watching if investors return to crypto or ""if people say, 'hey, I'm gonna regroup, wait til 2023 and reinvest at that time,' which is a behavior pattern we often see in other asset classes.""  Ether was recently changing hands at just below its most recent $1,300 support, a more than 4.5% gain from Wednesday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value rose after Ethereum developers determined that the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. The March fork and a second one in the fall will give developers time to focus on technical issues and alleviate stress for individuals who have their ETH (and any accrued rewards) locked in the Beacon Chain staking smart contract.  Crypto news has been anything but straightforward this year, though. Earlier in the day, CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole wrote that an ETH bear market was likely to intensify after dipping below pivotal support. ETH fell 17% last month, breaching an ascending trend line connecting June and October lows. Later Thursday, CoinDesk also reported that shares of the world’s largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hit a record-high discount rate of nearly 50% relative to the price of bitcoin.  “The fact that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is now trading at nearly 50% discount is just awful for holders of GBTC. It really highlights the vast differences in structure quality between different investment vehicles,” Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a note to CoinDesk.  Grayscale and CoinDesk are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.  Most other major cryptos were recently in the green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, up about 3.3% and popular meme coin DOGE climbing almost 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, jumped more than 2%.  Major equity indexes snapped a five-day losing streak with the tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively despite recent macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, investors will be eyeing the University of Michigan's widely watched consumer sentiment index, which is expected to tick up a few fractions of a percentage point in its preliminary December reading compared to the previous month.  IG North America's Kinahan sees cryptos' recent sideways movement as a victory. ""If you get through the end of the year going sideways, I would look at that more as building momentum,"" he said. ""If you're long right now, you're saying to yourself, 'can we just stay in 1% to 3% of the levels we're at right now because that's building a base that will be longer-term confidence.'""  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA +5.5% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH +3.9% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +3.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  Tokocrypto Token Holders See an Upswing  By Glenn Ardi  Media reports from Indonesia say that Binance is in the process of acquiring Tokocrypto, one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges – except this deal hasn’t yet been completed.  It's far from official. Despite the narrative that says otherwise, there’s no signed acquisition agreement.  When asked by CoinDesk Indonesia about the acquisition process, Rieka Handayani, Tokocrypto’s vice president of corporate communications, said the exchange doesn’t comment on “rumors and speculation that are circulating.”  “Binance is one of Tokocrypto's investors who have joined since 2020 to jointly develop the company and help build the crypto asset industry in Indonesia,” Handayani said in a statement to CoinDesk Indonesia. “Tokocrypto's focus is on building a sustainable business and actively continuing the development of the crypto asset industry, which has grown significantly.""  There’s been one beneficiary of this preemptive announcement: token holders. According to CoinGecko data, Tokocrypto’s exchange token, TKO, jumped 97% after the first story was published, and is up 50% over the last week.  TKO’s trading volume has jumped from around $3 million pre-story to around $67 million as of Dec. 8.  Binance acquiring Tokocrypto would make a lot of sense. Indonesia has 16.3 million crypto users registered with its national know-your-customer system, and a population of 280.7 million. As of August 2020, the country reportedly has more crypto investors than stock market traders.  Meanwhile, Tokocrypto has had a rough crypto winter. In the past month, the exchange has laid off 20% of its employees and has begun separating out its business units, such as T-Hub (a crypto lounge community in Bali) and TokoMall (a non-fungible token marketplace), into separate entities and will likely spin them off to raise cash.  A Binance acquisition would be the perfect opportunity for the struggling exchange. It’s not that the deal will never happen; it’s just not official. Yet. But somebody has already made a tidy profit on the rumor.  Glenn Ardi is CoinDesk Indonesia's managing director.

Ethereum Whales And Sharks Bought 561k ETH In A Single Day As per data from analytics firm Santiment, ETH whale and shark addresses are accumulating back towards pre-Merge levels. The relevant indicator here is the “ETH supply distribution,” which tells us which wallet groups are currently holding what percentage of the total Ethereum supply. Wallet addresses are divided into these groups based on the total number of coins that they are holding currently. For example, the 1-10 coins group includes all addresses that are carrying between 1 and 10 ETH right now.

Here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Ethereum supply distribution for all the wallet groups falling into this range: The value of the metric seems to have shown some sharp uptrend in recent days | Source: Santiment As you can see in the above graph, the percentage of the Ethereum supply held by wallets in the 100-1m coins range has observed rapid growth recently. Between the 5th and the 6th of this month alone, the indicator saw its value go up by 561k ETH. The holder cohorts with wallet balances lying in the range are sharks and whales. Movements from these investors (especially the whales) can have noticeable impacts on the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Feel The Heat, More Selling Pressure Might Be Imminent The latest uptrend suggests that these groups have been filling up their bags with more Ethereum recently. Such an accumulation implies the ETH whales and sharks are bullish on the crypto right now. Earlier in the year, these humongous investors accumulated during the Merge hype, and subsequently dumped the crypto in a sell-the-news event as soon as the actual PoS transition took place (which can be seen by the sharp plunge in the chart). After the recent accumulation, the whale and shark holdings have now returned close to the levels they were before the Merge leadup. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price floats around $1.2k, down 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 21% in value.
