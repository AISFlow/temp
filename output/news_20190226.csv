42381650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd6b,1551200427,Bolivars to Bitcoin: Activists Take Down Venezuela's Maduro in Crypto Art Exhibit,"Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro will be taken down today.  At least his visage, painted on 1,000 bolivars by cryptocurrency-focused artist cryptograffiti, will be. The destruction of the artist's newest piece ‚Äì an 11-foot by 10-foot portrait of the Venezuelan leader ‚Äì will happen in Cucuta, Colombia, about 500 yards from the Simon Bolivar Bridge, a landmark hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have walked across to escape the poverty of their home country.  Since Maduro took office in 2013, Venezuela has suffered drastic inflation, starvation and socio-economic decline. And in recent months, the situation has worsened. This past weekend,¬†violence broke out on the border with Brazil as the Venezuelan military moved to block food and medical supplies from entering Venezuela.  Feeling for the people of Venezuela and hoping cryptocurrency can prove to be the economic alternative it's touted as,¬†cryptograffiti decided he needed to see its potential for himself.  Cryptograffiti told CoinDesk:  ""After reciting the tired 'Maybe it doesn't apply directly to you, but bitcoin is important in authoritarian regimes' line one-too-many times, I wanted to contribute and experience the situation first-hand.""  In partnership with AirTM, a Mexico-based digital wallet and peer-to-peer exchange platform, and Cripto Conserje, a cryptocurrency-focused merchant services provider, cryptograffiti will watch as his portrait gets torn down. For every donation made, a Venezuelan at the event will physically remove a bolivar from the mural.  Only two pieces of the mural will be saved and signed as donor prizes ‚Äì one section going to the highest donor and the other being given to a donor drawn at random.  ""Venezuelans will literally and figuratively be bringing down Maduro,"" cryptograffiti said.  The all-day, livestreamed event is part of a larger project, #AirdropVenezuela, which plans to use 50 percent of the donations to send cryptocurrency to more than 100,000 Venezuelans in April.  While the focus is on bitcoin, AirTM is also accepting a number of cryptocurrencies, including zcash, bitcoin cash, ether, XRP¬†and dash.  The other 50 percent of the funds contributed will go towards rebuilding facilities at Fundaci√≥n Renacer, a non-profit organization providing daycare services to families displaced by the crisis, where the event will be held.  During the event, Cripto Conserje will be focused on educating individuals and merchants on cryptocurrency use. (Venezuelan regulators have imposed a more than 11 percent fee on all crypto remittances into the country, so crypto holders will likely want to learn how to transfer their money in a peer-to-peer way to forgo those.)  Several food merchants will be at the event so attendees that get crypto can purchase food right away.  Cryptograffiti concluded:  ""People are using it to steer clear of hyperinflation but also to escape with money to. All the stuff we talk about as possibilities for crypto, it's happening right now.""  To donate to the cause, visit: http://airdropvenezuela.live/.

42381632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncih,1551198616,Widow of QuadrigaCX CEO Denies Hiding Assets from Crypto Creditors,"Jennifer Robertson, widow of QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten, asked a judge to put a restructuring specialist in charge at the failed crypto exchange, saying her management role has brought unwanted public attention.  In an affidavit filed with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Canada, Robertson asked for Peter Wedlakehttps://www.grantthornton.ca/en/meet-our-people/peter-wedlake/, a retired partner and senior vice president at audit firm Grant Thornton, to be appointed chief restructuring officer (CRO).  In this role, Wedlake would take charge of Quadriga's efforts to recover some $136 million in cryptocurrencies said to be held in inaccessible cold wallets.  One problem with the status quo, Robertson explains, is that neither she nor Quadriga's other current officer, Tom Beazley, have any ""significant experience in the cryptocurrency industry,"" nor any ""experience with an insolvent business.""  She went on to say:  ""Further, the public attention my role as director has brought is unwanted, and online commentary which I have reviewed has suggested that I, in particular, am trying to hide assets or am acting contrary to the best interests of [Quadriga and its affiliates], which is not true.""  The full motion filed  Monday by the company adds that ""the independence of the CRO would ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are protected and that any alleged concerns in relation to Ms. Robertson's continued day-to-day involvement with the Companies would be addressed.""  Extension of stay  QuadrigaCX also wants another 45 to 60 days to look for its missing cryptocurrencies.  The initial stay of proceedings protecting the exchange from user lawsuits that was¬†granted on Feb. 5 expires next week, but Quadriga says this is not sufficient time to recover any assets.  ""This work in [sic] complicated by the lack of accessible business records of the Companies that one would expect to have on hand, and while significant efforts have been expended in the last three weeks much more needs to be done to try and maximize the recovery for the users,"" the motion says.  As such, Quadriga's lawyers are calling for an extension to continue its efforts to recover assets, ""particularly cryptocurrency assets,"" saying the company is acting in good faith.  Efforts to recover assets to date have been complicated by issues pertaining to unlocking bank drafts held by third-party payment processors, which in turn have ""caused the Companies and their counsel to spend valuable time addressing those issues,"" according to the document.  While the filing asks for an extension of anywhere from 45 to 60 days, it notes that Quadriga would prefer a full 60-day reprieve. However, a petition created by some creditors calls on the court to reject this extension and instead pursue criminal charges.  It is unclear whether Miller Thomson, one of the law firms appointed as representative counsel for Quadriga's creditors, will file a motion opposing the extension. A request for comment was not immediately returned.  Bank drafts  QuadrigaCX and its court-appointed monitor Ernst and Young (EY) have at least scored one victory thus far: During a hearing last week, Nova Scotia judge Michael Wood granted an order facilitating the transfer of fiat currency holdings by third-party payment processors to EY.  According to the order  , which was published Monday, the Royal Bank of Canada will accept deposits into a ""Disbursement Account,"" which will hold funds from some of these payment processors, as well as any proceeds from cryptocurrencies sold during the proceedings.  Moreover, the Bank of Montreal is ordered to endorse certain bank drafts it previously issued to Billerfy, another payment processor.  Stepping back, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) froze various bank accounts belonging to payment processor Costodian, Inc. and its owner Jose Reyes in January 2018 after questioning the origin of the funds in these accounts. The action kicked off a year-long legal battle which saw the Ontario Superior Court of Justice taking¬†charge¬†of the funds briefly. Ultimately, the court released the funds to Billerfy, which, like Costodian, is owned and operated by Reyes.  However, the funds were released in the form of bank drafts, meaning the cash itself is inaccessible until a bank endorses the drafts. In a previous interview with CoinDesk, Reyes explained that his company was having difficulty finding a banking partner to endorse the drafts.  During Friday's hearing, attorneys for the Royal Bank of Canada, as well as the Bank of Montreal (which issued the drafts in question), explained that they were looking for legal protection against mismanagement or negligence concerns.  In his order, Judge Wood granted this protection, writing that ""BMO shall have no liability or obligation as a result of the performance of their duties in carrying out the provisions of this Order,"" excluding any issues that arise from negligence or ""actionable misconduct"" on BMO's part.  The order also granted Reyes roughly $61,000 CAD ($46,300 USD) that he claimed as personal funds caught up in the CIBC court case.  Another $778,000 CAD ($588,000 USD), which Costodian claimed it was owed in fees is being placed into a trust pending a firm decision on whether the company is actually owed these fees.

42381645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd0J,1551192315,Samsung Teases Early Blockchain Partners For Galaxy S10 Phone,"South Korean tech giant Samsung looks to have revealed some of the first blockchain partners for its upcoming flagship cellphone, the Galaxy S10.  At its Samsung Mobile Business Summit session at MWC Barcelona 2019 on Monday, the company presented the new phone's Blockchain Keystore to affiliates and customers, displaying a picture that included the logo for Cosmee, a beauty community service dapp (decentralized application) from the Cosmochain crypto project, as well as that of the Enjin crypto gaming platform.  As reported by CoinDesk Korea on Tuesday, while Samsung did not disclose precise details of the partner services, they are likely to be featured on the phone at launch or soon after.  Cosmochain has reportedly confirmed the relationship with Samsung. Developed to connect beauty industry companies with customers, the project incentivizes users to create content such as reviews with rewards in its ethereum-based ERC-20 token, cosmo coin (COSM).  Cosmee users can save their cosmo coins directly in the Galaxy S10's crypto wallet, according to CoinDesk Korea.  Howon Song, CEO of Cosmochain, said in the report:  ""Since last year, the blockchain team of Samsung Electronics Wireless Division has been searching for dapps that have been commercialized. As a result, Cosmochain has been selected as a partner of Galaxy S10. We did dozens of meetings to verify the model and technology. ""  While the Enjin logo was also displayed at the event, its partnership with Samsung hasn't been confirmed. However, promotional shots tweeted Monday also showed a wallet app on the S10 that looked identical to the Enjin offering.  Enjin is a cryptocurrency project targeting the gaming industry. It offers a platform for blockchain game development, as well as tokenized in-game goods and an ERC-20 token called enjin coin (ENJ).  According to CoinDesk Korea,¬†a person familiar with the S10's technology said Samsung has been in discussions with Enjin for about six months.  Being able to store the tokens for both projects in the S10's wallet app will likely make it easier to use the apps, the report adds.

42381640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncu1,1551189652,$66 Million Building to Be Tokenized on Ethereum Blockchain in Record Deal,"For Patrick O'Meara, there is a world of difference between security tokens and tokenized securities.  A security token merely means an issuer is selling a crypto token in compliance with securities laws. But with a tokenized security, ""it's a whole different world,"" where blockchain technology gives investors an unprecedented level of transparency, said O'Meara, chairman and chief executive officer of Inveniam Capital Partners (ICP).  ICP is about to put this idea to the test. The company plans to tokenize some $260 million in four private real estate and debt transactions, starting with a WeWork-occupied building in downtown Miami, Florida. Announced Tuesday, the firm intends to sell tokenized shares of the building, valued at $65.5 million, likely the largest piece of real estate to be financed this way to date.  The company placed a deposit on the building last month using an unspecified amount of bitcoin. Once the other three deals are finalized, ICP will be auctioning off shares in the assets, represented by ERC-20 tokens on the ethereum blockchain, in the coming weeks.  Shares in the four assets will be sold through what is known as a Dutch auction, meaning potential investors will place their own bids outlining how many shares they want, what price they would like to pay per share and which cryptocurrency they would like to pay with.  Inveniam will accept bids denominated in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap at launch.  When the sale concludes, tokens will be distributed in order from the highest bids to the lowest, O'Meara told CoinDesk.  ""The price that every bidder pays will be based on the lowest price of the last successful bid dependent upon the bidder‚Äôs fiat-to-crypto conversion rate limit,"" a press release noted.  In order to participate, potential buyers must hold at least $10 million in crypto, with a minimum purchase of $500,000. The sale will be conducted in accordance with private placement rules issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Inveniam.  Tokenized transparency  Perhaps more ambitious than the auction, however, is what ICP intends to do with the tokens representing each share.  A Wall Street veteran, O'Meara explained that typically, shares come with large amounts of data, from how they are created, as well as data collected through its life and performance¬†‚Äì which could be 20 or 30 years in the case of some debt offerings. ICP will put all of this data onto its platform and associate it with a token, he said.  ""We built our entire software, our stack, everything we do, the way we tokenize the instrument is so the enormous amount of data that's associated with the financial instrument ... can be aggregated and is attached to the token,"" he explained.  One of the benefits to collecting all of this data into one system is that it is suddenly ""uniquely searchable,"" he said.  At present, legal documents are converted into PDFs or similar file types, which make them difficult to search through.  If, instead, a company stores the hash and a cipher¬†that is associated with a legal document on a blockchain, it allows for these documents to be stored in their native form.  ""We can store those documents in their native form, Word, Excel, because an Excel table in a PDF document is uniquely useless,"" he said, adding:  ""If we can store all this data in its native form, and the way that we have surety is because of the hash and the cypher ... you can literally trace, as a regulator, every document associated with this transaction.""  This allows a large amount of data to be stored, which in turn can allow the investing world to make decisions based on quantitative data in a way that was not as accessible before, O'Meara said.  Other offerings  In addition to the WeWork building, Inveniam plans to tokenize shares for a student housing facility in North Dakota, which is being valued at approximately $90 million; a North Dakota water pipeline worth $50 million; and a multi-family housing facility in southwest Florida worth $75 million.  Like the WeWork auction, shares from each building will be sold as tokens and can only be purchased using cryptocurrency.  The proceeds will be converted into their fiat equivalents before being passed to the buildings' sellers, O'Meara noted.  The company may launch other projects as part of this transaction as well prior to the auction's starting date.  All told, the total value of the four properties will add up to $260 million.  Future of real estate?  Tokenized real estate has become an increasingly popular use case for blockchain in recent months. Templum Markets, a token trading platform and advisor, sold a security token representing shares in a Colorado ski resort last year, accepting U.S. dollars, bitcoin and ethereum.  Similarly, security token startup Harbor is working with Convexity Properties and broker-dealer Growth Capital Services to sell¬†955 shares in a high-rise building in South Carolina, though each share is only worth $21,000.  Harbor CEO Josh Stein told CoinDesk last November that using tokenized shares allowed the company to more easily track shareholders and verify that they are compliant with relevant securities laws.  UPDATE (March 5, 22:00 UTC): The second-to-last paragraph of this article has been updated to clarify Harbor's role in the South Carolina high-rise transaction.

42381638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncqF,1551189613,Blockchain-for-Banks Startup Switches From Hyperledger to R3's Corda,"MonetaGo, a software development¬†company that builds private blockchains for financial institutions and central banks, has decided to change its underlying architecture from Hyperledger Fabric to R3's Corda platform.  The New York-based firm, which has been testing its blockchain-based anti-fraud platform for receivables financing in India, cited concerns with how Hyperledger Fabric would scale up once large numbers of participants joined the system.  MonetaGo CEO Jesse Chanard¬†told CoinDesk,  ‚ÄúAs we looked at the different scalability pieces of Hyperledger, we saw that it could get challenging, at least at the current throughput of Fabric. So we started doing some testing on Corda and realized, at least in this specific case, it made a lot of sense.‚Äù  Specifically, Hyperledger uses numerous¬†channels, or ""subnets,""¬†to ensure the privacy of data shared between parties on the blockchain. It‚Äôs this facet of its architecture ‚Äì which is evolving with each version of Fabric, it must be said ‚Äì that Chenard is referring to.  ‚ÄúTrade finance involves thousands and thousands of participants Looking at the scalability and load testing, you have to ask how will Fabric scale when you've got tens of thousands of suppliers with tens of thousands of channels,"" he said.  Corda, on the other hand, tackles privacy in a different way: it only shares data between counterparties to a deal (and possibly their regulators) rather than broadcasting it like on a public blockchain, removing the need for partitioning.  Hyperledger declined to comment on MonetaGo‚Äôs change of platform choice.  India to Mexico  A former bitcoin exchange that pivoted to enterprise¬†software, MonetaGo had already been working with Corda to automate the issuance of commercial paper, yet another reason to make the change, Chenard said.  The next version of MonetaGo's receivables anti-fraud network, built on Corda, will go live early this year in Mexico, he said.  David E. Rutter, R3's founder and CEO, said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to see the network running in production on Corda Enterprise with a number of our member banks in Mexico.‚Äù  In April of last year, MonetaGo announced that its receivables financing blockchain on Hyperledger Fabric was being tested in conjunction with the Reserve Bank of India. The central bank licensed it to three so-called factoring exchanges ‚Äì RXIL, A.TReDS, and M1xhange ‚Äì where small businesses bring invoices to obtain financing from banks.  Squaring off  This is not the first time organizations that have been building on Hyperledger have changed their minds and moved to R3 Corda.  It has happened on a rather large scale in the blockchain and insurance world, where both the B3i and RiskBlock consortiums migrated to R3 after kicking the tires of Fabric.  However, the trade finance blockchain space has remained evenly split with likes of we.trade on the Hyperleder Fabric side and Marco Polo and Voltron using Corda.  Chenard explained that interoperability with the Corda trade finance ecosystem was another driver for MonetaGo's decision, concluding:  ‚ÄúThe trade finance solutions we are really looking at are Voltron and Marco Polo and we began to think, 'wouldn't it be great if you were writing this stuff natively for Corda, rather than trying to figure out how to connect Hyperledger and Corda and vice versa?'‚Äù  David Rutter image from CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/02/26/blockchain-for-banks-startup-switches-from-hyperledger-to-r3s-corda,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3612224f13c78ec8ee4af75728dbfcdcb3b62827-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381648,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd5L,1551179720,"Bitcoin Price Holds Above $3,700 But Bulls Need Progress Soon","View  Bitcoin‚Äôs defense of $3,700 is encouraging, but a positive follow-through is needed soon to invalidate a bear flag pattern that has developed on the hourly chart.  A UTC close below $3,714 would validate Sunday's bearish outside reversal candle and confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The probability of BTC closing today below $3,714 would rise if the cryptocurrency drops below $3,764 in the next few hours confirming a bear flag breakdown.  A bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to levels below $3,400.  On the higher side, a move above $4,190 (Sunday's high) is needed to revive the bullish view.  Bitcoin risks a further sell-off if the bulls' defense of $3,700 fails to produce quick recovery.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization created a big bearish outside reversal candle on Feb. 24, weakening the bullish case put forward by last week's high-volume breakout above $3,800.  The sell-off was likely driven by the unwinding of long positions (profit taking), as the notional value of short positions fell 12 percent to 11-month lows, according to Bitfinex. Notably, the long-short ratio is still holding near the high of 1.5 seen earlier this month, signaling bullish market sentiment. Further, the bullish higher low of $3,550 set on Feb. 17 is intact.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is still to the higher side. So far, however, the bulls have not taken advantage of better entry levels offered by Sunday's price drop, leaving the cryptocurrency directionless around $3,800.  So an upward move is needed soon, as the short duration technical studies are turning bearish and a break below $3,700 could yield deeper losses.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.5 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly chart  BTC seems to have carved out a bear flag on the hourly chart, which often ends up accelerating the preceding bearish move.  An hourly close below $3,764 ‚Äì the confluence of the lower edge of the flag and the rising trendline ‚Äì would confirm a flag breakdown and, with RSI back in the undersold territory (50-30), there is enough room for a drop to levels below $3,400 post-breakdown.  The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 50- and 200-hour MAs, which would gain credence if the cryptocurrency fails to pick up a strong bid in the next few hours.  Daily chart  A UTC close below $3,714 would validate both the downward sloping 100-day moving average (MA) and Sunday‚Äôs bearish outside day candle and confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. That could be followed by a drop to $3,531, a bullish higher low carved out on Feb. 14.  The probability of BTC witnessing a bearish close below $3,714 would rise if prices confirm a flag breakdown with a move below $3,764 in the next few hours.

42381649,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nd45,1551175251,"There's No Crypto Winter in Argentina, Where Startups Ramp Up to Meet Demand","While bitcoin advocates point to politically fraught Venezuela as a prime example of crypto adoption, they often overlook the more business-friendly hub a bit farther south. Since Argentina has a sordid history of banks restricting customer access, plus an inflation rate that hit 47 percent in 2018, bitcoin isn‚Äôt a hard sell these days.  ‚ÄúI was raised with my father telling me never trust the Argentine peso and my story was the story many Argentinians had,‚Äù Santiago Siri, founder of the blockchain startup Democracy Earth Foundation and investor in several Argentinian crypto startups, told CoinDesk.  Indeed, Argentinian usage of the peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins hit an all-time high of 9.4 million Argentine pesos in weekly volume in December 2018. Despite broader market dips, this growth has continued to surge in 2019 at a rate that dwarfs anything witnessed during the 2017 token boom, when the peak was 5.7 million Argentine pesos. That figure would currently represent a slow week in Argentina‚Äôs 2019 P2P market.  None of this is to say that Argentinian companies haven‚Äôt felt the strain of crypto volatility, but local demand and interest remains steady. Plus, a recent influx of Venezuelan immigrants has infused Buenos Aires with underbanked communities that need financial tools and remittance services.  ‚ÄúThe sector is growing, it‚Äôs growing very well. It‚Äôs providing a lot of jobs,‚Äù Siri said. ‚ÄúPeople are using these technologies for real survival needs and finding themselves in a better world than if they had to trust the government.‚Äù  All things considered, market dips have hardly decreased demand for bitcoin-related products and services in Argentina. To the contrary, bitcoin exchange CMO Manuel Beaudroit of Bitex told CoinDesk his company has seen increasing demand in 2019 for bitcoin-related services from Argentinian banks and brokerage firms.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitex will court such institutional customers across the region by launching bitcoin custody services in March.  Beaudroit said:  ‚ÄúThey are interested in offering their clients the ability to do cross-border payments and remittances with Bitex‚Äôs services.‚Äù  The bitcoin startup recently helped facilitate a purchase of pesticides and agricultural products by the government of Paraguay from Argentina, settling in bitcoin. With 250 institutional customers already facilitating the majority of the exchange‚Äôs $500,000 daily volume, Beaudroit said Bitex is posed to expand services across Latin America. The platform is already live in Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay.  This builds on Argentina‚Äôs unique role in Latin American commerce. Brazil is so large that its startups often focus purely on the domestic market, Siri said, while Mexico generally loses top-tier talent to northern migration.  Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency mining company Bitpatagonia, located in the chilly southern tip of the continent, closed its first deal in early February to house 1,000 miners from Miami, according to Bitpatagonia co-founder Walter Salama. Latinos around the world are turning to Argentina as a hub where bitcoin-savvy startups can bring user-led insights to the global ecosystem.  Lightning lessons  Since they are generally focused on retail use cases, a bitcoin scaling solution called the Lightning Network has captured the attention of Argentinian users.  The Buenos Aires-based bitcoin wallet startup Muun will be launching Lightning-enabled payments in March, followed by the launch of an iOS app.  ‚ÄúOur main strategy revolves around the lightning network,‚Äù Muun founder Dario Sneidermanis told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúThis is going to be the year of launching all those products.‚Äù  The bootstrapped startup with 10 employees has at least four people devoted entirely to Lightning, although the entire team works with this scaling solution in some aspect. In order to learn more about how nearly 1,000 Android downloads translates to real transactions, Muun COO Florencia Ravenna spent several weeks this winter conducting market research in Barrio 31, one of the largest slums in Argentina.  ‚ÄúMerchants are the key to these types of experiments,‚Äù Ravenna told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúIf you want people to be able to spend bitcoin, you need to work with merchants.‚Äù  One way that Ravenna found merchants in Barrio 31 have been able to work with bitcoin without relying on custody services or payment processors is by adding a markup for products paid for with crypto. This way, merchants can hedge against volatility and liquidity challenges. Underbanked Barrio 31 residents also used bitcoin for remittances as well.  ‚ÄúI was surprised by how interested people were in learning new solutions,‚Äù she said.  Global ties  Beyond local demand, another reason Argentinian startups are thriving in this bear market is they‚Äôve mastered the art of leveraging global networks.  For example, the digital notary startup Signatura has operated with just $450,000 in venture capital since it was founded in 2015. Now, with 3,000 monthly users and 5 percent of its customers paying in bitcoin, Signatura CEO Gonzalo Blouson told CoinDesk the startup is raising another modest round of $400,000 to expand its services across Latin America.  ‚ÄúWe have a couple of investors [abroad] that have invested in the company using bitcoin,‚Äù Blouson said. ‚ÄúAnd are also looking for local VCs.‚Äù  Unlike the previous dot-com boom, in 2019 Argentinians are equipped with the digital infrastructure for remote work and fundraising. Such was the case with RSK Labs and RIF Labs, two blockchain startups that recently merged to form IOV Labs, which raised 22,000 bitcoins in 2018. IOV Labs CEO Diego Guti√©rrez told CoinDesk most of the company‚Äôs funding and half of their contributors now come from abroad.  Likewise, the Buenos Aires-based CEO of the arbitration startup Kleros, Federico Ast, told CoinDesk in previous years it was difficult for crypto entrepreneurs to fundraise from Silicon Valley if the project hailed from a country like Argentina, with a history of banks defaulting on debts.  These days, he said, many Argentinians work remotely and garner direct investments from abroad. Along those lines, the stablecoin startup MakerDAO has up to seven Buenos Aires-based workers contributing to the project.  ‚ÄúIn Argentina, we‚Äôve had more than 100 years of really high inflation, so we are always looking for solutions,‚Äù Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO‚Äôs business development associate for Latin America, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs easier to do something here than in Venezuela.‚Äù  Through partnerships with companies like the crypto exchange startup Ripio, among several others, Alvarez has developed fiat on-ramps for unbanked stablecoin users with almost any Latin American currency.  Since more firms feel comfortable investing bitcoin in startups with small but growing user bases in inflation-riddled Latin America, the history of banking hardships has actually turned into an opportunity.  Speaking to over a decade of experience working with Argentinian startups, Democracy Earth‚Äôs Siri added:  ‚ÄúThe pace of innovation that we‚Äôre seeing, for the context of Latin America, has no precedent.‚Äù  Argentina image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/26/theres-no-crypto-winter-in-argentina-where-startups-ramp-up-to-meet-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7b8fa1145f2f40436df043686fb1afd9ec7e3fe-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm announced Tuesday that it has partnered with U.S.-based blockchain startup TBCASoft for the initiative and has created a working group within an existing blockchain consortium of telecom carriers, the Carrier Blockchain Study Group (CBSG).  SoftBank aims to utilize TBCASoft's application framework, the Cross-Carrier Identification System (CCIS), to enable blockchain-based identification and authentication services.  TBCASoft's CCIS system uses zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography and distributed ledger technology (DLT) that enables the issuing, storing and authentication of users‚Äô identification in a private and secure way, SoftBank said.  The effort aims to address the problems that users of current identification and verification services need to place trust in a centralized organization, and must disclose their personal data to multiple entities which is stored on different internet databases.  The CCIS system can give users ‚Äúfreedom from creating multiple accounts and remembering countless passwords to protect their personal information from identity theft,‚Äù the company said.  SoftBank vice president Takeshi Fukuizumi explained:  ""We envision that individuals should create encrypted digital identities, instead of using and storing multiple usernames and passwords on databases here and there with various qualities of privacy protection. We have been working with TBCASoft on solving identification and authentication problems, and have an answer with CCIS.""  TBCASoft and SoftBank are also looking to collaborate with other telecom operators under the CBSG consortium for the initiative.  The CBSG consortium was¬†launched¬†back in September 2017, with other major operators including U.S.-based carrier Sprint and one of Taiwan‚Äôs largest telecom operators FarEasTone. The consortium has already successfully tested blockchain systems for mobile payments and topping up prepaid phones across different carriers using TBCASoft's platform.

42381641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ncvH,1551167974,You Can Now Buy HTC‚Äôs Exodus Blockchain Phone Without Paying Crypto,"Taiwanese consumer electronics manufacturer HTC is making its blockchain phone more widely accessible.  Previously only available for purchase with bitcoin or ether, the HTC EXODUS 1 can now be bought with U.S. dollars and other fiat currencies.  Announced Tuesday during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the company has also expanded the range of cryptocurrencies accepted for the phone to include litecoin and the Binance exchange's BNB token.  Phil Chen, ""decentralized chief officer"" at HTC, told CoinDesk that ""this is more of a core launch"" after the phone's¬†early access period began last year.  For now, the $699 phone is still exclusively sold online. While Chen said HTC will work to potentially begin selling the device in carriers' stores, conversations with these carriers are still in the early stages.  He added:  ""We‚Äôve already had some conversation that‚Äôs preliminary but part of why we‚Äôre going to Mobile World Congress is to have those conversations.""  Building Web 3.0  HTC also announced today an integration of EXODUS with the Opera web browser, designed to streamline how customers use their cryptocurrencies.  For one thing, customers who load some crypto funds into the Zion mobile wallet app will be able to conduct micropayments on websites using Opera or decentralized applications (dapps) loaded onto the device itself.  EXODUS was built to support the Web 3.0 movement, Chen explained. At some point, he hopes to have 80 percent of the most popular dapps loaded onto the phone, with Opera just ""the beginning.""  In a statement, Opera Browser's head of crypto, Charles Hamel, said his company was ""proud to partner with EXODUS and together define a new standard for usability and security of crypto.""  ""We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo. HTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation,"" he added.  Security  To protect users' cryptocurrencies, the phone has a ""kind of walled-off area,"" typically known as a ""trusted execution environment,"" Chen said.  This trusted environment is not cold storage, as users can connect the wallet to the internet. However, the phone's operating system cannot interact with the wallet, giving it some protection from malicious actors able to compromise the phone itself, Chen said.  And should users lose their private keys, Chen said they can fall back on HTC's social key recovery system, which was announced last year.  Under the device's social key recovery settings, users can select a small number of their contacts to receive part of the device's private keys. Should the device be lost or otherwise inaccessible, the user can then recover a portion of the key from each contact.  ""Coming up with the solution of a social key recovery, I think that‚Äôs a big breakthrough too. What happens when you lose your phone?"" Chen asked, explaining:  ""That‚Äôs been a fundamental problem, if you lose your device or lose your private keys, in this case what happens if you lose your phone? Coming up with the solution of splitting up your keys ‚Ä¶ without us having access to your keys or storing them on a server ‚Ä¶ that was a big breakthrough for us.""  Stiff competition  Chen is setting an ambitious target for the HTC EXODUS.¬†He hopes to ship 1 million units by the end of 2019 (for comparison, HTC reportedly sold some 0.98¬†million smartphones overall in 2017. Numbers for 2018 were not immediately available).  Chen declined to say what sort of interest the phone saw during its early access period, though a press release said the expanded purchase option came after ""validation from the crypto community."" The product was¬†first announced during CoinDesk's Consensus 2018, last May.  The company will have stiff competition. Last week, Samsung¬†‚Äì the world's largest cell phone manufacturer ‚Äì announced that its new flagship, the Galaxy S10, would include support for secure storage of blockchain keys. Unlike the EXODUS, the device will be mass-marketed to consumers from the get-go.  However, the S10 will be significantly more expensive, with the base model costing $899.99. The cheapest variant, the S10e, sells for $749.99, still $50 more than the EXODUS.  Moreover, where the EXODUS has its unique distributed key recovery system, Samsung will back up the private keys saved on the device through the company's ""Find My Mobile"" service.  Blockchain startups are also selling their own devices, with Sirin Labs selling its Finney for $999 and Electroneum announcing the M1 smartphone at the Mobile World Congress on Monday, targeting developing regions with an $80 offering.
