42406759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8IuS,1625267283,New Report Places United States at Top of ‘Crypto-Ready’ Countries,"The United States is the world’s most “crypto-ready” country, according to new research published by crypto education platform Crypto Head.      Crypto Head’s 2021 Crypto Ready Index considered the number of crypto ATMs in each country and their accessibility, the legality of crypto and whether banks can use it, and the number of online searches for crypto-related terms in calculating a “crypto-ready” index for 200 countries and territories.      The United States ranked first, with a crypto-ready score of 7.13 out of 10. Cyprus ranked second and Singapore third, both scoring under 6.50. To be sure, the study is limited in scope, failing to touch on a number of factors that could shape a country's readiness for wider-spread usage of cryptocurrencies, including its tax laws and wider regulatory environment.      According to data collected by Crypto Head, the U.S. has 17,436 crypto ATMs – nearly 16,000 more than the second-ranked country in this category, Canada. That number is growing rapidly in the U.S. as bitcoin ATM companies like Coin Cloud rapidly expand installations nationwide. The rise underscores bitcoin's increasing popularity as a means of payment.    Read more: Dogecoin Bounds Onto 1,800 ATMs in the US    Alongside the number of ATMs, Crypto Head also looked at the number of people per ATM. The United States placed first here as well, with a crypto ATM for every 19,023 people, compared to Canada’s second-place ratio of one ATM for every 26,265 people. Japan ranked last with a single bitcoin ATM for its 126 million people, although 24 countries did not have a crypto ATM.      Crypto Head also awarded the U.S. and 39 other countries with particularly favorable legal environments for crypto a maximum two points – one point if crypto was legal to own and one point if it was allowed to be used in banks.      Lastly, Crypto Head also examined the number of cryptocurrency online searches compared to the previous year’s data to indicate rising interest among each country’s population.      Cyprus ranked first with nearly 34,000 crypto searches for every 100,000 people – an almost 137% increase from the year before. In many countries, interest in crypto is also growing rapidly. Romania saw the largest year-on-year increase in crypto searches at 331%, with countries like Greece, Canada, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia not far behind.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/02/new-report-places-united-states-at-top-of-crypto-ready-countries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/250728e2eabdd2dfdf9ba3b254834161657878a2-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8JBB,1625257928,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rangebound Into the Weekend, Lags Crypto Stocks","Bitcoin was mostly flat on Friday as buyers and sellers appear to be in a stalemate. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 6% over the past week and is expected to hold support above $30,000 into the weekend.      In traditional markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached all-time highs after a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday. For now, sentiment for risky assets appears to be alive as well as volatility declines in both traditional markets and bitcoin.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $33228, -0.1%  Ether (ETH) $2091, -0.59%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4352.4 +0.75%  Gold: $1786.97, 0.58%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.437%, compared with 1.463% on Thursday  Options volatility    Bitcoin’s implied volatility remains elevated despite rangebound trading since mid-May, according to options data provider Skew. This suggests traders are not complacent given the recent stabilization in price. There is still some uncertainty present in the options market at the beginning of July.      “$34,000 is a key level for accelerated moves to the up or downside with highest gamma exposure for both puts and calls,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “As spot trades lower, the market has yet to find its footing,” Balani wrote. “As long as players write upside exposure in size, a rangebound play with more downside risk seems likely.”    Bitcoin lags crypto stocks    Crypto related stocks such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) have outperformed bitcoin over the past few months, albeit within a tight range. Some traders are looking for a breakout or breakdown in stocks as a leading signal for bitcoin in the coming weeks.      COIN registered a downside exhaustion signal in June, confirmed by DeMark indicators. The stock will need to see a break above $260 to shift the downtrend since its April debut.    Cashing out of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust    The bitcoin market could get a boost this month from the expiration of investor restrictions on the sale of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund. Grayscale is owned by the Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.      Some digital asset analysts and investors say it’s possible some of these investors might need to enter the market to buy bitcoin in order to repay cryptocurrency loans they used to finance their original purchases of the GBTC shares.    Altcoin roundup  USDC on Tron: The circulating supply of USD coin (USDC) on the Tron blockchain has surpassed 108 million in less than a month, according to blockchain data. This could be another sign that crypto traders are increasingly turning to blockchains that provide cheaper transaction fees with faster speed than what’s found on Ethereum.  Grayscale buys ADA: Grayscale Investments added ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, to its Digital Large Cap Fund. The digital asset manager has sold some existing constituents of the fund and used the proceeds to purchase ADA.

42406774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8J8E,1625250414,USDC on Tron Blockchain Surpasses $100M 2 Days After Public Unveiling,"The circulating supply of USD coin (USDC) on the Tron blockchain has surpassed 108 million in less than a month, according to blockchain data. This could be another sign that crypto traders are increasingly turning to blockchains that provide cheaper transaction fees with faster speed than what's found on Ethereum.      The achievement came just a day after Circle, the crypto-native financial service firm behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin, said it added support for USDC on Tron. One of the stated goals of doing so is ""enabling [USDC] growth in Asia and around the globe,"" according to Circle's website.      Blockchain data shows that the first transfer of USDC on Tron was on June 11.      A stablecoin, USDC is pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar, with each token redeemable for an equal number of greenbacks.      Crypto influencer Justin Sun's Tron blockchain has already gained traction for the rapid growth of the largest stablecoin by asset cap, tether (USDT), on the network. As CoinDesk reported, there are more tether on Tron than on Ethereum, the blockchain of ether (ETH), as traders favor blockchains that provide faster and cheaper transactions.      While tether is the most traded crypto asset, there's been a fast growing adoption of USDC on decentralized finance (DeFi), according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, data from Glassnode indicates that nearly half of USDC supply is currently used in smart contracts.      The big difference from how USDC is used on Ethereum is that on Tron it's mostly used for inter-exchange transfers, said Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari. He noted that nearly all of the USDC supply on Tron is concentrated in the top 10 addresses.      Tether's and now USDC's growth on Tron could be an indicator that ""a lot of exchanges just move stablecoins over to Tron instead of Ethereum to avoid fees,"" Watkins said.      Tron's Sun told CoinDesk in a WeChat message that the USDC supply concentrated on the top addresses serves as a ""reserve"" for exchanges that will trade USDC on Ethereum for those on Tron soon.      ""We will burn those ERC-20 USDC that are sent to the Tron blockchain,"" Sun said, who pointed out that crypto exchange Poloniex already started supporting USDC on Tron.      By press time, Circle did not immediately respond to requests for comments about USDC's development on Tron. The article will be updated when a response is received.

42406775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8JAC,1625247942,Money Reimagined: United States of Stablecoin,"There’s not much nuance in the crypto community’s opinions about regulators. It’s all or nothing. If a policymaker “gets” the value proposition of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and if they embrace blockchain technology’s prospects for improving the financial system, the community will shower them with accolades. If not, they’re the enemy.      This week’s column is about the ramifications of a crypto-friendly speech by Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for Supervision. Among other things it has placed him squarely in the first category.      A couple of housekeeping notices:      First, with my co-host Sheila Warren on vacation, this and next week’s episodes of the “Money Reimagined” podcast will be lifted from the two CoinDesk TV shows we recorded during CoinDesk’s Consensus virtual conference in late May. Both are about the opportunities and challenges for crypto/blockchain technology to respond to the growing demand among investors and companies that businesses comply with environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) standards. The format is faster than the regular audio podcast, with multiple short segments. Have a listen after reading the newsletter.      Second, I, too, will be out over the next two weeks. In my place, CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein will write the weekly column while Features Editor Ben Schiller will shepherd the rest of the newsletter.    The stablecoin route to hyper-dollarization    Move over “Crypto Mom” Hester Peirce. The cryptocurrency community has fallen in love with a new U.S. regulator.      A speech this week by Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for Supervision, is being hailed by prominent crypto pundits as a manifesto for how the U.S. government could harness the power of cryptocurrency innovation to serve its international interests and establish an even wider “soft power” role for the dollar in the global economy.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    What caught their attention: Quarles’ argument that stablecoins “could encourage [international] use of the dollar by making cross-border payments faster and cheaper, and it potentially could be deployed much faster and with fewer downsides” than a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      It was music to the ears of many. Supporters of stablecoins argue an accommodative U.S. regulatory posture toward private issuers of these dollar-pegged tokens, which are typically built on open-source platforms such as Ethereum, would allow superior digital dollar innovation than would a formal CBDC. Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter said Quarles’ remarks will be “remembered as a landmark speech.” Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of Circle, which along with Coinbase issues the stablecoin USDC, essentially said the same.      It’s not at all clear that Quarles’ views are widely shared at the Fed. Just three days earlier, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren issued a warning that stablecoins, which he described as “new disruptors” to credit markets, posed a risk to financial stability. (The Boston Fed has been engaged in CBDC experiments with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.)      Still, that someone of Quarles’ influence is thinking along these lines is significant. If the U.S. were to follow his advice, it could mean that, rather than the dollar losing its world reserve currency status as some scholars of monetary and geopolitical trends foresee, it could expand its influence – something MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor recently predicted, as per last week’s newsletter.      In this scenario, the dollar would go beyond its current role as the unit of account for global trade and a key reserve asset for capital markets and become prevalent outside of the U.S. in everyday transactions.      Note: This would not be your grandfather’s reserve currency model. U.S. industry would derive great benefit from the ubiquity of dollar usage, but it might also ultimately diminish U.S. government control over the international monetary system – or at least radically change the nature of that control.      If so, that would be a good thing. Less hardline surveillance and less Wall Street gatekeeping of the world’s transactions is precisely what’s needed to boost monetary innovation and improve financial inclusion.    Permissionless innovation    The strongest argument for letting private stablecoin issuers drive the digital dollar’s development is summed up in the opening lines of Quarles’ speech. He cited “America's centuries-long enthusiasm for novelty,” which he argued has made “America the home of so many of the scientific and practical innovations that have transformed life in the 21st century from that of the 19th.”      Open blockchain platforms will enable far more inventiveness than closed-door CBDCs developed by central banks, which are hardly known as hotbeds of innovation. The reason there’s breakneck innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) is because it’s a permissionless environment. Developers don’t need the approval of a corporate board to build on a particular platform. And because users can freely move assets around within the DeFi ecosystem, without going through a bank-like intermediary, there’s a fluid movement of value and investment that helps incentivize and drive that innovation.      The question is, how far is the U.S. government willing to go to facilitate this freewheeling innovation?      If anything, U.S. regulatory trends are moving toward more, not less control. With U.S. blessing, the Financial Action Task Force last year extended its “travel rule” to custodial crypto exchanges, requiring they not only apply know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols but also track the identity of non-custodial wallet holders who transact with their customers. And while the non-custodial nature of DeFi platforms has left that field somewhat under regulated for the time being, many lawyers believe that tougher rules are coming for DeFi.      More specifically, a bill presented to the U.S. House of Representatives in December would require stablecoin issuers to apply for bank charters.      All this will put sand in the gears of progress. That may be a price worth paying if the regulation truly helps protect financial stability. Too much regulation, however, and we’ll fall short of the promise of enabling regular people to make fast and easy dollar-based payments around the world.      The ease of stablecoins stems from their bearer instrument character. They are a digital version of cash whose value is self-contained and can be automatically transferred peer to peer. If KYC and AML requirements are layered into those transactions, which would inherently require an entity such as a bank to police them, then the transaction loses that person-to-person feature. As such, stablecoins will essentially take on many of the same constraints that dog the current banking system, where cross-border payments remain expensive and cumbersome for billions of excluded people, especially in the developing world.    A fork in the road    As last week’s newsletter discussed in a different context, the U.S. now faces two alternative paths.      First, it could follow Quarles’ advice and foster an open, stablecoin-driven system that gives more people around the world access to the dollar as their preferred currency.      This would be a very different kind of reserve currency model from the current one. It would generate seigniorage for the U.S. government and deliver competitive advantages to U.S. producers. We can think of it as an advance of U.S. “soft power,” against which China’s authoritarian government, which is inevitably pursuing a centrally controlled model for its digital yuan, is powerless to compete.      There’s a cost to this model, though: Washington would need to give up on some of the “hard power” it currently wields, including the capacity to control movements of money around the world, seize assets and put pressure on its enemies.      The second alternative is to double down on the current system but in digital form.      While there are various models for CBDCs, including ones that incorporate some degree of privacy assurance for users, international transactions would almost certainly entail similar bank-based gatekeeping powers as the existing system.      In this case, competition with China would be more of a straightforward head-to-head conflict, with the two countries’ CBDCs competing directly with each other. In that world, there’s no guarantee a digital dollar would outperform a digital yuan.      What’s it going to be? The Quarles “novelty” manifesto, or the Rosengren crackdown on “new disruptors”?    Off the Charts: A Month of Red    There’s not much to say about today’s chart. It speaks for itself.      Compiled by the CoinDesk Research team, the chart shows the past month’s returns for 18 members of the CoinDesk 20 list of top cryptocurrency assets. (Two of the assets in that list, USDC and tether, are stablecoins and so excluded from this chart.)      It’s charts like this that make the case for a new Crypto Winter.    The conversation: ‘The father of Bitcoin toxicity’    If it were appropriate to celebrate “toxic Bitcoin maximalism,” then Mirceau Popescu would have won a lifetime award for service to that cause.      Popescu, who in 2012 founded MPEx, one of the first bitcoin exchanges, was the archetypal noxious maximalist: deeply passionate about Bitcoin to the point of embracing it as a life-defining ideology and dismissing all alternative perspectives; a libertarian who took his pursuits of freedom and property rights to the extremes of unapologetically hedonistic behavior and blatantly misogynist and racist commentary; a writer with an acerbic tongue who took down his critics and even threatened them with violence; and, yet, also a highly intelligent articulator of the radical proposition that Bitcoin represents to the established order.      Popescu, 41, was reported to have drowned off the coast of Costa Rica over the weekend. Crypto Twitter’s memorializing of the man captured the complex and uncomfortable aspects of his life and legacy.      Kraken and Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo (the former editor-in-chief of CoinDesk) laid out a selection of classic Popescu quotes in a tweet thread.      In a separate tweet thread started by Monero founder Riccardo Spagni (aka @Fluffypony), John Light answered a question about what made him “so unlikable.”      Meanwhile, Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito shared an example of Popescu’s unyielding approach to authority and of stance on the sovereignty of Bitcoin as he trolled an Securities and Exchange Commission official who was seeking information over MPEx’s listing of shares in Erik Voorhees’s Satoshi Dice. (The SEC ultimately deemed the Satoshi Dice shares to be unregistered securities.) Note: The link in Brito’s tweet is to Popescu’s Trilema blog – warning, some sections are NSFW – where instead of the regular year, the dates atop each post are listed in terms of years counted since Bitcoin began.

42406776,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8J9D,1625247028,Investors Cashing Out of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Might Bring Market Boost,"The bitcoin market could get a boost this month from the expiration of investor restrictions on the sale of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency fund.      Some digital-asset analysts and investors say it's possible some of these investors might need to enter the market to buy bitcoin – to repay cryptocurrency loans they used to finance their original purchases of the GBTC shares.      ""Lots of bearish chatter around GBTC unlocks whilst conveniently ignoring that in-kind subscriptions funded by debt will ultimately translate into spot buying,"" crypto services provider Amber Group tweeted.      The view contrasts with a forecast published last month by analysts at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, who argued the end of the lockup period would weigh on the GBTC shares and bitcoin.      “Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin,” the JPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote on June 24. The dynamic would lead to “downward pressure on GBTC prices and on bitcoin markets more generally.”      But with the pace of unlockings now poised to increase, crypto-native analysts are pushing back against the narrative. While the selling of GBTC shares could lead to a deeper discount and drive away fresh capital, its negative impact is likely to be mitigated by the repurchases of bitcoin in the spot market. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.)      ""The biggest unlocks are happening over the next two months, which could lead to heavy selling of GBTC on the open market,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the cryptocurrency-focused asset manager Arca, wrote this week in a newsletter.      ""As funds unwind this trade,"" he wrote, ""it could actually put BUY pressure on bitcoin, not sell pressure, as those who sell GBTC will have to buy back bitcoin to cover the short leg of the trade.""      The unwind could be a significant event partly because the trade itself has been so popular in recent years and into early 2021. According to JPMorgan, the trust saw record inflows of $2 billion in December, followed by $1.7 billion in January.      Here's how it worked: Accredited investors (mostly institutions and wealthy traders) could subscribe to GBTC shares directly at the fund's net asset value (NAV), which is linked closely to the spot price of bitcoin. They did so in daily private placements by depositing owned or borrowed bitcoin or U.S. dollars. After a six-month lockup, those shares could be sold in the secondary market – including to retail investors.      For a long time, and due to a variety of reasons, the GBTC shares traded at a premium of 40% or more to the spot bitcoin price. So for the big investors, it looked like a surefire way to profit – especially with market sentiment quite bullish. There was little fear of the premium falling sharply or flipping to a discount, reducing the net yield on the carry trade.      But the bitcoin market has soured in recent months and in February the GBTC premium flipped to a discount, leaving scant motivation for new investors to attempt the once-popular trade. As of Thursday, GBTC shares traded at a discount of 10.5%, per data provided by Skew.      But it's now been almost six months since the trade stopped being popular, so the unlocks are coming into play.      Investors who entered the trade by locking in borrowed coins might now need to repurchase those to repay the loan. Similarly, those who deposit their bitcoin holdings need to buy back coins to return to their base portfolio.      So assuming supply-side factors remain constant, the repurchases associated with Grayscale unlockings could end up putting upward pressure on bitcoin prices.      The January tranche of GBTC share unlocks is scheduled for this month and is likely to release nearly 40,000 GBTC shares, according to data source bybt.com.      The biggest single-day unlock is slated to happen on July 18, with the release of shares worth 16,000 BTC. Upon unlockings, carry traders could snap up bitcoin from the spot market to repay loans or return to the original portfolio position, lifting bitcoin higher.

Financial institutions, including banking majors, see the power of DeFi and the potential threat to existing business models. What they don’t see is the ability to carry out know-your-customer (KYC) checks in the realm of pseudonymous lending pools and automated market making.      “We believe that creating this kind of ability of whitelisting and blacklisting addresses regarding this institutional market makes it easier to scale in institutions, because it lowers the risk in general,” Kulechov said this week in a webinar called “Next Steps for Institutional DeFi.”      Also on the panel with Kulechov were Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz.      Kulechov said permissionless DeFi will always exist, but there will also be “layered and tailored” DeFi made up of private pools and whitelisted markets. Fireblocks is assisting Aave to explore how such markets can be deployed.      “We are able to basically operate within a network where we already know the participants,” said Shaulov. “We are able to basically validate and vet them into the network and essentially create this sort of gated community.”      This would be “phase one,” Shaulov said, leveraging the multi-party computation (MPC) used by Fireblocks. “We can basically then sort of whitelist them essentially, into those pools and allow them to interact with one another, while guaranteeing that they’re sort of isolated from the general pools,” he said.      Novogratz of Galaxy pointed to two options going forward: the “walled garden” approach being explored by Fireblocks and Aave, and what he called the “chain surveillance option” where enough work can be done to figure where transactions are coming from.      “I think both of those are going to work to give a prophylactic to the user,” Novogratz said, adding:    “The $64,000 question for anyone who’s running protocols is, are the regulators going to say, ‘Hey, we love you for being at 82% or 46% regulatory compliant, with your good customers, with your white labels. But we really don’t like the blacklist customers.’ So will businesses like Aave have to say, ‘We’re not going to be open and permissionless like we were.

42406768,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8J2K,1625243221,A Gamble Inside a Gamble: Robinhood's Wild Memestock IPO,"Yo, Dawg, I heard you liked gambling, so we put some gambling inside your gambling so you can gamble while you gamble.      I’m a very old man, so when I heard that Robinhood would offer a portion of its just-announced initial public offering (IPO) to users through its app, of course I thought of Xzibit, rapper and host of the weird 2000s-era relic ""Pimp My Ride."" Xzibit used to do fun and crazy stuff like putting a fish tank into an Escalade, and Robinhood is clearly taking inspiration when it puts risk inside of its customers’ risk.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist.    Think about it: When you buy the Robinhood IPO through the Robinhood app, you’re actively increasing the value of that stock twice. Not only are you pushing up demand for the stock, you’re also giving the company more of the trading data and price spreads from which it profits. It’s brilliant, or at least fascinating, like watching a snake eat its own tail.      The slight downside is you’re entering into a bet whose risks are equally arcane: What keeps Robinhood going is a stack of interdependent long-shot bets no less complicated than its own. About half of Robinhood users are first-time investors, yet complex options trading accounted for 38% of revenue according to Robinhood’s IPO filing. As we reported yesterday, the filing also revealed that Robinhood made 34% of its cryptocurrency-trading revenue, and about 6% of its total revenue, on dogecoin trades.      Those facts have led to at least one tragedy, the suicide of 20-year-old Alex Kearns. Kearns was dabbling with options trading in Robinhood when, thanks to problems with Robinhood’s user interface, he came to believe he was $750,000 in the red. Robinhood recently settled a civil suit with Kearns’ family, as well as paying $70 million – a very big fine! – to FINRA over flaws in its options data and other issues.      You can perhaps understand why legendary investor Charlie Munger this week told CNBC Robinhood is “beneath contempt” and “a gambling parlor masquerading as a respectable business.”      Because it is structured to profit from trade volume, the app encourages active, perhaps even manic, trading. Its gamification is designed to give the same kind of return-engagement high you get from Likes on social media apps. The bells and whistles are there for a reason.      “It’s not encouraging people to buy a very, very, very low-cost index fund and hold it for 50 years,” chimed in Warren Buffet, Munger’s longtime Berkshire Hathway partner, in the same interview. “I will guarantee you that you will not walk in there [and] get that advice.”      The insoluble problem for investors in Robinhood itself is not that this is a bad business to be in, because some individual investors really do know what these tools are, and want them, and social trading is going to be a big deal, no question. The problem for Robinhood investors isn’t even that training an entire generation of 20-year-olds to think their future hinges on long-shot bets could have negative social or financial impacts. (Because who gives a damn about that, amirite?)      No. The biggest risk to investors in Robinhood is that users will lose money in the trades Robinhood is structurally incentivized to promote, and then decide that they should stop doing that.      The timing of the IPO obscures this handily. Robinhood more than tripled revenue during a period when well-off Americans were trapped inside juggling stonks and crypto bought with government relief checks, while the stock market was also going up steadily and the very first high-velocity meme stock trades emerged. If you think that performance is going to be repeated in the near term, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.      Because eventually the stock market will dip or the meme trade will have a few big failures or amateur active traders will just finally accept that they’re losing money and it will never stop. When some or all of those happen, a lot of users, mostly the ones who aren’t susceptible to cheap serotonin highs, will stop using Robinhood. We’ve already got a leading indicator here in Coinbase, which IPO'd directly into the top of the crypto market. When that market slumped post-IPO, Coinbase stock dropped more than 25%.      Again, I don’t think this means Robinhood is a terrible business. Some individuals actually understand options and speculation and to them I say, go forth and secure the bag.      But your kind are few and far between, ronin, and that means Robinhood will be a much smaller business than any projections based on recent data would suggest.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42406773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8J7F,1625234454,Nigeria Is the Lion of Africa in Bitcoin P2P Trading,"Many young Nigerians are adopting bitcoin amid the crypto ban put in place by the Nigerian Central Bank. In fact, since the start of 2021, peer-to-peer bitcoin trading has grown to $204 million, the largest amount in Africa.      Data collated from Usefultulips, a Bitcoin analytic provider, shows Nigeria dwarfs the rest of Africa combined on the use of bitcoin for peer-to-peer transactions. For instance, in the last 180 days, its closest rival in P2P BTC transactions, Kenya, totaled $84.3 million. In Ghana, the total was $59.8 million.    Olumide Adesina is a Nigeria-based certified investment trader with more than a decade experience. He will appear at CoinDesk's Crypto State: Nigeria virtual event on July 8.    A significant number of young, internet-savvy Nigerians are using crypto to move capital, amid a period of great technological and sociological change in Africa’s largest country. A declining local currency and antagonistic government have made Nigeria into a proving ground for Bitcoin’s big ideals.      Chinedu Obidiegwu, business development lead in Nigeria for Luno, a P2P crypto platform (and CoinDesk sister company), spoke on the growing use of bitcoin amid its price volatility and the crypto ban put in place by Nigeria’s central bank:      “The restriction of banks by the Nigerian regulators in February 2021, came as a considerable shock to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Notwithstanding, Nigerians have rather increased their use and deepened knowledge as seen in the numbers across platforms offering alternative funding options even through a recent market switch from bullish to bearish,"" he said.      Data collated from Binance showed growth in the company's P2P users across Africa from January to April surged by a whopping 2,228.21%. Nigeria, of course, played a major role. Other top crypto brands like Paxful, FTX and Crypto.com are also entering the fold. P2P transactions have skyrocketed as the central bank has banned the country's banks from handling crypto transactions.      “We’ve experienced a 23% increase in our trading volumes since the new [central bank’s] policy,” Nena Nwachukwu, Nigeria’s regional manager for Paxful, said.      Bitcoin's ascent is rooted in a sharp fall in remittances through traditional channels during the pandemic. The World Bank said remittances to Nigeria declined by 27.7% in 2020.      The Nigerian local currency hasn't helped everyday people either. Rising inflation (17.93% in May) has eroded the purchasing power of many Nigerians who seek alternatives like bitcoin to preserve their wealth. The country has one of the highest youth poverty rates in the world.      These growing economic challenges help explain why the crypto industry is growing despite the government's efforts to stunt bitcoin adoption. Despite its benefits, bitcoin is not a magic pill.    Read more: ‘They’d Rather Buy Bitcoin and Take That Risk’: An Interview With Paxful’s Nena Nwachukwu    Luno’s Obidiegwu spoke to the premium costs and high-risk exposure to fraud many young Nigerians face when buying the crypto asset:      “The unfortunate effect, however, is that many Nigerians have had to depend on the less secure and transparent OTC (over the counter) channels, exposing many to a higher risk of being defrauded and reducing visibility to the financial activity which should be a bigger concern compared to the reasons given for the ban.”      Still,Enakirerhi Ejovwoke, the founder of Abokie.com and thebittle.com, spoke to the opportunities still in play, despite a government ban:      “I see the ban was received more as an opportunity rather than a hindrance to crypto advancement in Nigeria, and I believe that other countries facing similar situations now or in the future can use Nigeria as a model of hope.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,Olumide Adesina,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/02/nigeria-is-the-lion-of-africa-in-bitcoin-p2p-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed1cb8cd7d2bd244cc7ebb9c7d0e4e6503cc0610-1400x787.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bling’s platform currently consists of six games, as well as a software development kit (SDK) it will begin offering to other mobile game developers that includes a bitcoin rewards system, fraud detection and user value detection. Bling’s bitcoin rewards system uses Coinbase as a cash-out mechanism, and users must create a Coinbase wallet before they can earn any bitcoin rewards.      Amy Wan, Bling’s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk the strategic investment from Coinbase Ventures was less about money and more about formalizing the partnership between the two companies and ensuring an “open line of communication” between them.    Gaming on-ramp    Coinbase Ventures’ participation in Bling’s seed round is part of a growing trend of investment into companies that have a user base that is crypto-curious but not yet crypto-savvy.      As crypto exchanges compete for market share, newcomers to the space are a hot commodity. And for Coinbase, which derives most of its revenue through comparatively high trading fees, it needs to win the loyalty of new users to keep shareholders happy.    Bling growth plans    Bling will use the money generated from the seed round to grow its team and make more games.      Wan also told CoinDesk that Bling, which currently has over 5 million registered users, will also begin advertising its games for the first time.      In January 2020, Bling’s first game, Bitcoin Blast, was removed from the Google Play Store but reinstated after Wan and fans of the game took to Twitter.      “The third-party platforms continue to exercise a lot of influence in how crypto startups can or cannot take off,” Wan told CoinDesk. “With third-party platforms, there’s a lot of enclosed space, and there’s always risk. But so far we’ve been pretty much able to manage all that.”      Correction (July 2, 13:51 UTC): Coinbase Ventures invested in the round but did not lead it, as was previously reported.

42406764,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8IzN,1625229824,"US Jobs Report Shows Gain of 850K in June, Beating Estimates","Jobs in the U.S. rose by 850,000 in June, above the consensus estimate for a gain of 706,000, the Labor Department reported Friday.      The main question now for markets and economists is whether the positiveJune report could encourage the Federal Reserve to taper its monthly asset purchases – a form of monetary stimulus – more quickly. There's a raging debate over the matter currently ongoing within the central bank over whether the U.S. central bank needs to throttle back from the stimulus as the economy accelerates out of the pandemic, to keep inflation from getting too hot.      Bitcoin prices have risen over the past year as many investors bet that the cryptocurrency could work as a hedge against inflation. Assuming the tapering starts sooner, bitcoiners would no longer be able to count on the Fed bringing more liquidity to the markets through quantitative easing and giving investors the liquidity to invest more in riskier assets.      The early take was that the jobs report wasn't strong enough to change the Fed's trajectory.      ""In short, these data shouldn't change anyone's mind,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, wrote Friday in a note to clients.      Bitcoin was changing hands Friday around $33,373, down 1% in the past 24 hours and little changed in the hours after the jobs report was published at 8:30 a.m. ET.      According to the Labor Department's jobs report on Friday, the U.S. unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.9% from 5.8% in May.      The government revised the May jobs number to 583,000, up from the initially reported 559,000 jobs (which had missed the then estimate of 671,000 jobs).      On average, since January 2021 the U.S. has added about 500,000 jobs per month, and the employment trend has been strengthening but somewhat unpredictable, making it difficult for economists to use any one month’s data to extrapolate what the future might look like.      The labor force participation rate – the percentage of the American population that is either working or actively looking for work – was unchanged in June from 61.6% in May.      The employment-to-population ratio, or the number of people employed versus the total working-age population, changed little month to month at 58%.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/02/us-jobs-report-shows-gain-of-850k-in-june-beating-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10d102935f5c27d807e6fd1f0764244170f7607f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lower support is seen at $30,000, which could stabilize the current sell-off.      The downtrend since April has limited price recoveries and kept bitcoin in a tight range between $30,000 and $40,000 over the past month. However, momentum signals suggest selling pressure has weakened since the May correction, which could keep buyers active at support.      Bitcoin was trading around $32,000 at press time and is up about 4% over the past week.    The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart registered a series of higher lows since May 19. This indicates a bullish divergence which could stabilize the intermediate term downtrend in price.  Typically, a bullish divergence precedes a price bounce. It’s possible that bitcoin’s 20% price rise from the June 22 shakeout low around $29,000 completed the divergence signal.  Bitcoin will need to break above the 50-day moving average around $37,000 to encourage further upside beyond $40,000.

42406765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8IxP,1625224625,Bitcoin Remains Depressed as Dollar Rallies Ahead of US Nonfarm Payrolls,"Bitcoin is trading under pressure as currency markets price in prospects of an upbeat U.S. nonfarm payrolls release, which could amplify concerns of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Federal Reserve.      The leading cryptocurrency is changing hands near $33,000 at press time – down 1% on the day – having faced rejection above $36,000 earlier this week. The retreat has poured cold water over the optimism generated by the last week's rebound from $28,800 to $35,000.      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, clocked a three-month high of 92.60 shortly before press time.      The index has been rising ever since June 16, when the Fed unexpectedly brought forward the timing of the first interest-rate hike to 2023 and has rallied 100 pips this week alone, TradingView data shows.      According to the London-based FX and spread-betting provider City Index, the DXY's recent rise hints at a strong payrolls figure.      The payrolls data scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET) on Friday is expected to show the U.S. economy added 700,000 jobs in June, up from 559,000 in May. The unemployment rate is seen falling to 5.7% from 5.8%, while wage growth may have decelerated, according to FXStreet.      A higher-than-expected number would validate the Fed's recent hawkish turn, possibly bringing more pain for bitcoin and other asset prices in general.      Fed tightening, that is, higher interest rates or unwinding of liquidity-boosting asset purchases, makes the dollar more attractive and dilutes the appeal of inflation hedges like gold and bitcoin. As such, fears of Fed taper or gradual unwinding of stimulus tend to weigh on bitcoin and other risk assets. Equally, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid if the payrolls data falls short of estimates by a big margin, squashing Fed taper fears.      For example, bitcoin fell sharply to $30,000 in May after the U.S. reported a big rise in inflation, forcing investors to consider the possibility of the central bank closing the liquidity tap sooner than expected.      Before that, the cryptocurrency was on a solid upward trajectory, rallying from $10,000 to over $60,000 in seven months to April, mainly on the back of the central bank stimulus. The Fed began pumping unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the system in March 2020 to help the economy and markets absorb the shocks arising from the coronavirus pandemic.

The securities regulator filed the complaint with the Economic Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police (ECD), saying Binance had failed to meet a deadline for responding to an earlier warning , according to an announcement on the SEC's website Friday .  The SEC claims the exchange solicited the Thai public to use its services via its website or the ""Binance Thai Community"" page on Facebook.  That means Binance is operating an unlicensed digital-asset business, the regulator said.  ""Only providers who have obtained relevant licenses under the law are allowed to provide services related to digital asset trading, exchange, depository, transfer, withdrawal or any transactions related to digital assets,"" the SEC said.  The regulator said it issued a warning letter on April 5 this year requiring Binance to submit a written response. It failed to do so within the specified time, the SEC said.  The complaint comes at a turbulent period for the crypto exchange. It has received a warning over a similar matter from the regulator in Japan, been barred from conducting regulated activity in the U.K. and pulled out of operating in Ontario following regulatory action against fellow exchanges in the Canadian province.

42434714,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPss9h,1625219434,BIS Rules Out Distrust in Mainstream Finance as Crypto Driver,"Crypto investment in the U.S. is not driven by a distrust of the mainstream financial industry, but by the chance for a profit, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an organization that represents most of the world’s central banks.      Cryptocurrencies are ""not sought as an alternative to fiat currencies or regulated finance, but instead are a niche digital speculation project,"" the BIS said in a report released Thursday.      The paper, ""Distrust or speculation? The socioeconomic drivers of US cryptocurrency investments,"" explored whether crypto is popular because of distrust in mainstream finance.      The BIS said it could preliminarily rule out that idea, because it found there's no difference in the perceived security of cash and offline and online banking between crypto and non-crypto owners. People with more security concerns about fiat money may seek information about crypto, but ultimately decide not to invest, the paper suggested.      Crypto owners are more likely to find cash and traditional banking services less convenient, though that doesn't apply to online banking.      A higher level of education increases the likelihood of owning crypto, the BIS found. That's in line with wider financial markets, where participation increases by 2% with each extra year of education. Participation in crypto markets is consistent with that, the BIS said.      Crypto owners also have above-average household incomes.      Breaking down trends across different crypto assets, the paper finds that XRP and ether owners are likely to be the most educated, with litecoin owners the least. Bitcoin ranks in the middle. Owners of XRP and ETH, along with stellar, are also likely to be the wealthiest crypto owners.

BMC, which describes itself as a voluntary global forum of bitcoin mining companies and others in the industry, said in a press statement on Friday that the global industry's sustainable electricity mix had grown to 56% during the second quarter, based on its ""first-ever voluntary survey.""      That made cryptocurrency mining ""one of the most sustainable industries globally,"" the council said in its statement.      The council – which was established in May with support from U.S. crypto mining companies, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk – seeks to ""shape the narrative"" around bitcoin's energy use.      The survey focused on the mining industry's electricity consumption and sustainable power mix.      ""Results ... show that the members of the BMC and participants in the survey are currently utilizing electricity with a 67% sustainable power mix,"" the council members said in the statement.      Data collected by the council was based on sustainable energy use from over 32% of the current global Bitcoin network, according to the statement.      Asked by Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter how the BMC arrived at its figures for ascertaining its carbon emissions factor, Saylor said the council took an estimate of off-grid and unsustainable power.      ""Then we allocated another portion that we applied to our BMC sample to in order to get a blend,"" Saylor said during a live virtual briefing. ""The blend ended up being slightly more than the electricity grid.""      Saylor continued:      ""I think if you back into it and take the 56% and then look at the 67% or 68% that we don't have that's the out-of-sample and then you know that number is ... 50% sustainable ... so ... generally it works out that the out-of-sample mix is ... assumed to be about 50% sustainable power and we tested that with a variety of analysts.""      Some, however, are not convinced.      While the figures are debatable, the efforts by the mining council show a more concerted drive to reduce the impact the industry has on global greenhouse gas emissions – a major gripe and cause for Musk ending his love affair with bitcoin earlier this year.

The country's financial watchdog is expected to ""follow up"" with the company's local subsidiary Binance Asia Services Pte., Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The subsidiary has a grace period while it awaits a review of its license application.      In an email to CoinDesk, Binance said it takes its ""compliance obligations very seriously.""      ""Binance Asia Services (BAS) is a separate legal entity and does not offer any products or services via the Binance.com website or Binance Markets Limited (BML),"" a Binance spokesperson said. ""BAS is backed by Vertex Holdings and is solely focused on growing the Singapore blockchain ecosystem and servicing users in Singapore.""      The move comes on the heels of Binance's showdown last week with U.K. regulators over whether the exchange business had regulatory blessings to operate in the country. Japan had issued a similar notice the day before warning Binance wasn't registered to do business in the country.      In the U.K., sterling withdrawals from the crypto business' platform have been reactivated and users are once again able to buy digital coins with debit and credit cards.      Singapore, meanwhile, has some of the toughest cryptocurrency regulations in the world. In 2019, the city-state passed its Payment Services Act, which required digital asset service providers to get a license from the government.      MAS said it is applying ""robust standards"" in its review process, Bloomberg reported. The regulator considers qualifications such as an applicant's ability to prevent money laundering as well as its fitness and propriety of shareholders and key appointment holders.

According to a report on Thursday from blockchain analytics company Coinfirm, vendors have been selling the certificates and vaccines in exchange for a range of cryptos, including bitcoin, ether, dash, litecoin, tron, monero and zcash.      Coinfirm says those kinds of crypto are being chosen because of their ubiquity or the anonymity they offer as privacy coins.      One particular dark web vendor, known as the ""COVID-19 Vaccine Shop,"" appears to be selling vaccines in bulk from AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BionTech, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Sputnik V, Coinfirm reported.      The report also said fake COVID-19 certificates, which were part of a ""probable health sector corruption"" from multiple vendors in the U.S., Russia and other countries, were being sold.      Not only were fake certificates masquerading as proof of vaccination being sold to clients, but their details were being entered into national health systems wherein certain instances doctors' signatures were found.
