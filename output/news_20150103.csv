42426226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGETh,1420304067,Why Some Bitcoin Exchanges Might Die in 2015,"The recent levelling out of bitcoin’s price volatility might be good news for everyday bitcoin users, but could it send a bunch of exchanges off the cliff?  CoinDesk recently spoke to the CEO of a company whose fortune depends on the health of bitcoin exchanges. In the off-record conversation, the exec had something disturbing to say: bitcoin’s falling volatility is causing problems for exchanges, which rely on volatility for trading volume. Without trading volume, their revenues will fall, leading to a shakeout in 2015.  That’s scary stuff, but does it hold up? Let’s start with the link between volatility and volume.  Volatility means volume  “Volatility is positively correlated to trading volume in all markets, not just the bitcoin market,” said Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based exchange Coinsetter. “This is not a unique characteristic of our space, but rather a fundamental tendency of trading in general.”  Others have numbers to back that up. Joseph Lee, CEO of bitcoin derivatives platform BTC.sx, took daily highs and lows from Bitstamp’s trading data, and used it to calculate the variation from the day’s weighted price.  “What we see very transparently is the direct correlation between price movement (volatility) and trading volume. This remains true across all exchanges in this space,” he said.  Jeremy Glaros, CEO of Coinarch, which offers bitcoin-based derivatives, found similar results. He mapped intra-day price ranges at several exchanges against total market volumes and found a strong link.  He said:  “The statistical relationship looks quite strong, with an R-squared value of 75%. One hundred percent would imply that the volatility completely explains volume and 0% would say it has nothing to do with it at all.”  Volatility and exchanges  So, volatility does equal volume. But is volatility really shrinking? Over at the Bitcoin Volatility Index, we can see volatility at relative lows from May 2014, when compared to bitcoin’s history from late in 2010.  Eli Dourado  , a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, created the Volatility Index. He offered this theory as to why volatility has slipped:  “Bitcoin volatility has gone down because of the growing ecosystem. There are more sophisticated players who are doing more hedging and providing more liquidity to the market.”  Generally speaking, exchanges love volatility, said Gerald Cotten, CEO of Vancouver-based exchange QuadrigaCX. Conversely, things are harder for them when the prices paddle in the shallows.  “Large price swings in either direction typically result in higher trading volumes on exchanges, and therefore higher profits,” Cotten said. “When the price is flat, the total volume traded is definitely lower, which does have a negative impact on profits.”  Does this mean that revenue is going to plummet for exchanges if this continues?  That depends on a few factors, experts suggest. One of them is where the exchanges are based, according to BTC.SX’s Lee. Typically, exchanges that make their money from trading fees of between 0.1% and 0.6%, he said, making it relatively easy to calculate their profitability.  “The exchanges based out of China prefer a revenue model of 0% fees on trading volume, but instead charge on deposits and withdrawals,” he said. “The correlation in these cases may not be as direct. Profit figures in these cases would be more difficult to ascertain.”  Not all exchanges are equal  An exchange’s fortunes in the light of bitcoin volatility also depend on the services that it offers. Charles Hoskinson, former CEO of the Ethereum decentralised application platform and developer of an Udemy online course on bitcoin, argues that exchanges have recourse to many mitigation options.  “It depends on products that exchanges are offering,” he said. “What about bitcoin to ripple, or to litecoin, or doge? Those things exist still and there are value-added features in exchange models. You can diversify to stay relevant.”  Altcoins are a high-margin area of trade, Hoskinson suggested. There are some exchanges, such as Vault of Satoshi, that have been aggressive with altcoin trading services.  The diversification options don’t just stop with altcoins, though.  “We’ve noticed that stability brings the opportunity to increase profits in other areas of our business,” said QuadrigaCX’s Cotten. “For example, we offer merchant services that are basically like BitPay's, but more focused on the Canadian market. When volatility cools down, we usually see a higher volume of merchant transactions.”  The other option is to offer derivatives, which can increase the complexity and depth of the market and offer more hedging opportunities. However, Hoskinson points to a tight regulatory environment as a barrier here.  So, whether or not there’s a shakeout in exchanges depends on several factors. Clearly, how stable bitcoin’s prices remain in the future will be one of them. Secondly, how much they hedge risk by diversifying their revenue models will be another.  Natural selection  Perhaps some exchanges should go, suggests CoinArch’s Glaros. “Some competition is good to be sure, but a highly fragmented market like this risks more defaults and more bad actors, which is I think bad for users overall,” he said.  Hoskinson argues that too fragmented a market can damage intra-exchange liquidity by dividing too few traders among too many exchanges.  If there is a shakeout, then there may be some good to come of it, suggests Dourado.  “Even if the reduction in volatility is bad for bitcoin as a speculative asset, it’s good for bitcoin as a currency,” he concluded. “Exchanges might gain business because of wider bitcoin adoption, even though they’re losing business from speculative trading now.”  Bitcoin’s volatility could spike tomorrow, of course, which would give exchanges with narrowly focused service and revenue models a welcome shot in the arm.  In case it doesn’t, though, wouldn’t it be sensible to hedge the risk and create a broader portfolio of services?

42426220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEBh,1420300182,Crypto 2.0 in 2015: Turning Bitcoin Theory Into Big Business,"2014 may be remembered as the year the bitcoin protocol became unrealistically lauded as a magic cure-all to problems plaguing everything from cancer research to copyright law.  What may have been lost in this stream of sometimes sensational headlines is that, while bitcoin's distributed ledger technology is empowering a new wave of entrepreneurs to experiment with legal contracts, identity and ownership, the foundations for such solutions are, in reality, still being built.  Looking ahead, though, the crypto 2.0 community believes it will take sizeable strides toward these goals over the course of 2015, garnering increased investment and attention from the wider bitcoin industry as major projects finally hit market.  Fueling this presumption is the fact that the industry has seen an uptick in attention in 2014. In addition to the formal launch of pioneering projects like BitShares, Counterparty and NXT, the period was also marked by the emergence of Ethereum, Medici and Reddit Notes – projects that all garnered mainstream news coverage for their ambitious aims.  Jack Wang, CEO of decentralized application exchange Melotic, suggested that he sees the competition in the still-nascent ecosystem helping to push overall development forward in 2015. In a conversation with CoinDesk, however, he cautioned that hard work remains:  ""The industry is still building its foundation, and made great strides in 2014. There are still very few projects, bitcoin 1.0 or 2.0, that have really reached the mainstream consumer, so the challenge is to create applications that users want to use, and then convincing users to give it a try.""  Wang's comments come as part of a wide-ranging survey conducted by CoinDesk of the crypto 2.0 industry that sought to detail the hopes, fears and ideas that are defining what has become one of the bitcoin industry's most exciting and controversial sectors.  All eyes on Ethereum  Perhaps the most ambitious project in the wider bitcoin space, Ethereum raised more than $15m through a pre-sale of its native token, ether, in 2014.  Helmed by former co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum seeks to provide a platform that will inspire developers developers to build decentralized applications that seek to do for a wide range of products and services what bitcoin did for payments processing.  Ethereum, which will launch its own blockchain and smart contracts platform this spring, has been widely anticipated by a number of respondents, including DigitalTangible CEO Taariq Lewis, who believes its smart contracts platform will be important for the ecosystem at large.  Gideon Greenspan, CEO of Coin Sciences, the company that oversees asset-transfer service CoinSpark, agreed, saying:  ""Ethereum takes the capabilities of blockchains to the next level and it will be fascinating to see which applications will be built on top, and if any will become breakout successes.""  Indeed, many of the responses focused on foundational platforms that could in turn enable businesses to reap new levels of efficiency. These include decentralized record-keeping network Factom, Ripple's smart contract system Codius, distributed document storage platform Proof of Existence and digital contract verification system BlockSign.  There was also excitement for the projects that will seek to build on top of one or more blockchains or protocols in order to provide more complex consumer-facing products, including recently launched decentralized crowdfunding platform Swarm, decentralized social network Gems and decentralized application funding platform Koinify.  ""The impact of these projects could be quite significant to the crypto world as a whole, as we are starting to move from a currency-only ecosystem to projects that have more functionality and try to solve real-world issues,"" said a representative of Storj, a decentralized cloud storage platform.  Legal questions still loom  The crypto 2.0 community was perhaps unfairly caught up in a controversy earlier this year involving the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when bitcoin blog Coinfire now famously stated that a number of unnamed projects have been the recipient of communications from the government agency. The site claimed to have seen some of the letters.  While the community has strongly denounced these accusations, questions about whether digital tokens could be viewed as securities certainly remain top-of-mind for those who are seeking to profit from projects that issue such assets.  Swarm CEO Joel Dietz, whose company is grappling with many such concerns, echoed this belief, saying that the legal challenge for businesses like his own would be ""massive"" in 2015.  ""Thankfully, I find this aspect of the business immensely fun,"" he quipped.  CoinPrism  's Flavien Charlon was more blunt about the regulatory quandaries that still surround decentralized crowdfunding platforms.  ""A crowdsale is a crowdsale, and using the blockchain to run it doesn't really change anything as far as regulations are concerned,"" Charlon said. ""It is conceivable that authorities will investigate past crowdsales, especially given the sums of money moved during those.""  Greenspan echoed these concerns, adding:  ""There have been quite a few public stock offerings conducted over bitcoin 2.0 platforms, which violate securities laws in the US and Europe. I think it's just a matter of time before regulators sit up and pay attention.""  Still, others don't believe that there is any immediate threat to the industry. DigitalTangible's Lewis, for example, noted that US regulators tend to take action only when lawmakers or consumers demand it.  Most respondents voiced their belief that New York's proposed BitLicense will not affect the industry, given that New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Ben Lawsky has publicly suggested an exemption will be made for such projects.  Investors could flood market  Although disagreements about potential regulatory action were apparent, there was widespread consensus that 2015 will bring about a massive increase in investment in this segment of the bitcoin space. The principal factor behind this migration, some argued, would be the lack of returns provided by bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem.  ""We expect will see more investor interest as they seek returns outside of falling bitcoin price and the lack of quality altcoins in which to participate,"" Lewis said.  Greenspan added that entrepreneurs won't be so much pushed out of other markets, but will begin to pay attention to the opportunities presented by crypto 2.0:  ""Bitcoin has not yet found its killer application, and as a result is not breaking into the mainstream. Several candidates for this killer app can be found in the bitcoin 2.0 space.""  Others provided insight into where this funding will go. For example, Koinify CEO Tom Ding voiced his belief that most crypto 2.0 funding will go toward developing the ecosystem's technological infrastructure.  Still, Maidsafe COO Nick Lambert, whose decentralized Internet platform was at the center of one of 2014's biggest crypto 2.0 controversies, indicated that investors will likely be observing the market first, to see if projects such as will actually deliver the goods.  ""There are so many great and exciting ideas floating around at the moment, but the companies, MaidSafe very much included, need to demonstrate that they can turn their visions into reality and into businesses,"" Lambert said.  Philosophical battles to continue  As the crypto 2.0 community has also been one of the more theoretical parts of the bitcoin community, the sector is where some of the technology's toughest questions are being resolved in ways that could greatly influence the entire industry's future.  When asked which arguments are likely to impact 2015, a common response was the fight over 'bitcoin maximalism', whether the bitcoin blockchain provides the best and most secure platform for the ecosystem's continued experiments.  That mindset has been attacked by those seeking to build alternative blockchains as short-sighted, while defendants call the view practical in light of the bitcoin network's substantial security.  ""The reasons for sticking with bitcoin are myriad, the most important being simple, trustless interoperability with bitcoin itself,"" Adam Krellenstein, chief scientist at Counterparty, said.  More veteran projects such as NXT and BitShares will also to continue to build support for their dedicated blockchains. For example, community manager Bas Wisselink noted NXT is looking forward to the release of Monetary Systems, a project that seeks to do for the altcoin markets, what sidechains aims to do for bitcoin.  On a less technical note, Charlon also voiced his belief that smart contracts, while arguably one of the most impressive practical realizations of blockchain technology, will be influenced by those outside the community, most notably in courtrooms.  ""Contract law is complex, and until a precedent has been set by a judge, no one should assume such contracts are valid in court,"" he noted.  Greenspan, in turn, suggested that the biggest battle would be the argument that industry is seeking to wage through the sum total of its work, concluding:  ""To my mind the biggest philosophical question remains whether bitcoin is primarily a currency, or primary a platform for other decentralized applications.""
