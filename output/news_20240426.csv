26428002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605258,1714172417,Brace For Price Impact: Dogecoin Whales Move Massive 456 Million DOGE To Exchanges,"Recent on-chain data has shown a transfer of 456 million DOGE tokens into crypto exchange Coinbase amidst a flurry of Dogecoin whale transactions across various exchanges in the past 24 hours. The price of DOGE has majorly traded below the $0.165 price level in the past seven days despite the price uptick among other meme coins. These recent events of whale transfers, however, appear to be leading to a bearish view towards DOGE. Transfers of this nature into a crypto exchange point to the whales getting ready to sell off their bags, which risks crashing the DOGE price. Whales Move 456 Million DOGE To Crypto Exchange Whale Alerts, a crypto whale transaction tracker, has shown various instances of whale transactions in recent hours. Amidst these transactions is the transfer of 456.83 million DOGE tokens worth $68.7 million into popular crypto exchange Coinbase. Interestingly, the transfer of DOGE was made to Coinbase in two bouts of 228 million DOGE, each worth over $34 million.

This lends additional credibility to the idea that the transfers were made with the intention of selling off tokens. Notably, on-chain data shows that both addresses have been holding their DOGE tokens since last year, considering the last inflow of DOGE occurred on November 1, 2023. During this time, the price of Dogecoin was trading around $0.068. It is worth noting that DOGE has gone on an over 120% price increase since then, putting the holdings at a significant profit. What‚Äôs Next For Dogecoin? At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1511. The crypto is now on a correction path after failing to substantially break above $0.164 in the past week. The recent movement of nearly half a billion Dogecoin suggests major price volatility could be on the horizon. Furthermore, the recent DOGE rally seems to have stalled out as other altcoins and meme coins gain momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Risk Losing $7.2 Billion If BTC Price Reaches This Level While DOGE is currently down by 0.64% in the past seven days, Shiba Inu, PEPE, Dogwifhat, and FLOKI are up by 13.8%, 47.5%, and 32.5% in the same timeframe. The future of DOGE can be hard to predict. As with any meme coin, Dogecoin remains highly speculative. Its price continues to be volatile and heavily influenced by hype and social media. According to a crypto analyst, DOGE could continue to drop in the short term. Other analysts are bullish on DOGE, with analyst Ali Martinez even predicting a rally to the $1 price mark.

Taking to X, one analyst¬†notes that whales, which are large crypto holders, are actively accumulating the world‚Äôs largest coin by market cap. Bitcoin Whales Accumulating Despite Weakness By the time this data was shared, Bitcoin whales held over 5.1 million BTC worth a staggering $331 billion. That there is still demand when the coin moves in a narrow range flies in the face of recent market weakness and skeptics betting on even more price dumps. Related Reading: After WIF, BONK, BODEN: Top Crypto Trader Now Buys These 2 Memecoins Currently, Bitcoin is inside a range, with caps at $73,800 and $60,000. Despite overall market confidence, the coin has failed to pull higher, breaking above $70,000 even after Halving on April 20. Even though prices are firm, the absence of follow-through after April 21 and 22 hints at weakness. From the BTCUSDT price chart, the coin could explode should it break above the middle BB. If the leg up is accompanied by positive fundamental events, momentum could push the coin to all-time highs. On the flip side, BTC is likely to slip even lower should sellers flow back. The sharp rejection of bulls on April 24 is bearish. As such, this might set a wave of lower lows in motion, taking the coin below April 2023 lows. Traders Panicked Sold, Register Huge Losses Parallel market data¬†shows panic sellers on Binance and OKX, two major crypto exchanges by trading volumes, have dumped a combined 5,137 BTC at a loss over the past two weeks.

However, with the probability of this being an accelerated market cycle, Rekt Capital remarked that the duration for this uptrend could be cut in half. Crypto analysts like Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, predict that the flagship crypto will rise as high as $100,000 when that time comes. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,360, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin remained flat around $64,000 as some altcoins slid lower.  Intervention may follow soon if yen devaluation continues, Lekker Capital's Quinn Thompson said.  Cryptocurrencies, widely known for their often volatile nature, were a sea of calm Friday as the Japanese yen's tumble to a fresh 34-year low against the U.S. dollar left traditional market observers mulling over potential knock-on effects.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} continued its recent choppy action during the day within a tight range around $64,000, down 0.9% over the last 24 hours. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) fell slightly more with smart contract network tokens solana {{SOL}}, ICP and decentralized exchange Uniswap's UNI declining 2%-4%.  The Japanese yen (JPY) dove another 1.3% during the day ‚Äì a huge move for a major currency ‚Äì to its weakest level against the U.S. dollar since 1990 after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) held interest rates at near zero and didn't indicate much concern over the weakening currency. In the U.S., meanwhile, continuing solid economic growth and stubbornly high inflation are snuffing out hopes for perhaps any easing of monetary policy this year.  ""Moves of this size and speed in currencies is not normal so I expect some intervention or coordination fairly soon if it continues into the next few weeks,"" Quinn Thompson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk.  The yen's devaluation didn't impact crypto markets yet, but this could change if the BOJ steps in to prop up the currency, Noelle Acheson, analyst and author of the Crypto Is Macro Now reports, said in an email interview. A possible intervention would mean the BOJ selling U.S. dollar assets (U.S. Treasuries) to buy yen, and a weaker greenback could in theory help crypto prices, she added.  Another form of intervention could arrive from U.S. policymakers deciding to inject liquidity to the markets, which could support risk assets such as cryptos, Lekker's Thompson said.  Read more: The Key to Reviving Bitcoin Bull Run is the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs Refunding Announcement Zooming out, Acheson forecasted that the ""currency turmoil won't stop with the yen,"" as the recent jump in U.S. yields following sticky inflation reports will put a strain on other currencies, perhaps forcing other central banks to take action.  ""We could see a collective selling of U.S. treasuries to raise cash to support local currencies, adding further upside pressure to U.S. yields while adding to inflationary pressures elsewhere,"" Acheson said.

42408342,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaII4G,1714157904,Warren Rival for Senate Race John Deaton Argues for Coinbase in SEC Challenge,"A Republican lawyer and crypto defender who hopes to be Sen. Elizabeth Warren's opponent in the Massachusetts Senate race has filed a supporting brief in a Coinbase clash against the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Coinbase wants to get a higher court to decide whether tokens that trade on secondary markets with no obligations on the tokens' issuers should be considered securities.  Deaton is arguing in favor of the exchange's effort, saying the SEC is taking an unconstitutional shortcut in its accusations that certain token trading violates securities laws.  Lawyer-turned-politician John Deaton further reinforced his credentials as an outspoken crypto ally on Friday, filing a friend-of-the-court brief in Coinbase Inc.'s (COIN) effort to get a higher U.S. court to rule on a central question about when a digital token qualifies as a security.  Deaton, one of several Republican candidates vying for the chance to oppose Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), filed the amicus brief seeking to bolster Coinbase's argument in its fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange filed for a so-called interlocutory appeal earlier this month, seeking permission to get a separate ruling on a narrow legal argument ‚Äì whether a digital asset transaction that poses no obligation to the original issuer of the asset should be considered an SEC-regulated investment contract.  Deaton contended that the ""politically driven, compromised agency"" leans on its interpretations of the legal tool known as the Howey test to define tokens permanently as securities, which is beyond its authority.  ""The Howey test is a transaction-by-transaction analysis,"" Deaton argued. ""There are thousands of digital assets and thousands, sometimes millions, of transactions occurring on various blockchains. Because of this inconvenient reality, the SEC adopted an unconstitutional shortcut by effectively saying all transactions of the tokens violate securities laws.""  The lawyer had similarly weighed in during Ripple Labs' clash with the U.S. securities regulator, establishing his reputation in digital asset circles.  As a Senate candidate, he must still defeat a handful of Republican candidates in the September primaries before he can face Warren in the November general election. Even if he gets that chance, polling in the state suggests Warren is highly likely to retain her Senate seat.  Deaton is scheduled to be among the speakers next month at Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas.

26418965,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605212,1714156208,XRP Whales Are Active: Here‚Äôs Where They Are Sending Coins,"On-chain data shows the XRP whales have been active during the past day. Here are the destinations their moves have been heading to. XRP Whales Have Moved Around Big Amounts In Last 24 Hours According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large XRP transactions have been witnessed on the blockchain in the past day. More specifically, five transfers in total that are of scale often attributed to the whales have occurred on the network inside this window. Since whale transactions involve the transfer of a significant sum of capital, they can sometimes cause fluctuations in the market. Related Reading: 85% Of Altcoins In ‚ÄúOpportunity Zone,‚Äù Santiment Reveals The implications any whale transfers might have for the market depend on their intent. However, the exact purpose behind any transfer can be hard to ascertain. Nonetheless, the address details of the transaction may provide at least some hints about the context surrounding it. First, here are the details regarding the oldest XRP whale transfer from the past day: Looks like this massive move only required a minute fee of 0.000015 XRP to be possible | Source: Whale Alert As is visible above, this transaction involved the movement of 29.74 million XRP, worth $15.7 million at the time of the transfer. The sender was an unknown wallet, likely a whale‚Äôs address. On the other hand, the receiver was a wallet attached to a known centralized platform: the cryptocurrency exchange Bitso. Thus, the whale here made a deposit to the exchange from their personal address. Investors usually make such transactions whenever they want to use one of the services platforms like these provide, including selling. As such, exchange inflows can prove to be bearish for the price. The second-oldest whale transaction from the past 24 hours was also an exchange inflow, this one towards Bitstamp. Interestingly, the sending address for this one was the same as the Bitso deposit, so the same whale was probably behind both of these moves. The large investor shifted 27,430,000 XRP ($14.5 million) to the exchange in this second move. Naturally, if the whale has made these large moves for selling, they could be a bad sign for the asset‚Äôs price. Though, perhaps fortunately for the XRP investors, two exchange outflows have also occurred recently, which may cancel out these inflows. Below are the details of the two larger withdrawals. The addresses involved in the first of the whale exchange withdrawals today | Source: Whale Alert In this move, a whale took out around 26.67 million XRP ($14 million) from Binance. Today‚Äôs exchange outflow also involved Binance, with another 20.85 million tokens ($10.6 million) leaving the platform. The fifth and final transfer was the largest during the past day at a whopping 100 million XRP ($53 million), but this move involved unknown wallets on both sides so it‚Äôs impossible to say why the move would have been made.

Given the sheer volume of ETH withdrawn from these exchanges, it is prudent to try to understand what this could mean for the crypto‚Äôs price. 260,000 ETH Leaves Exchanges Amid the uncertainty that has plagued the crypto market, Ethereum investors are making moves to secure their positions for better price prospects. Pseudonymous crypto technical analyst Titan of Crypto took to X (formerly Twitter) to share what Ethereum investors are doing about their holdings right. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Risk Losing $7.2 Billion If BTC Price Reaches This Level The post revealed that these investors have been withdrawing large amounts of ETH from centralized exchanges. In the one week period that was tracked, the report found that a total of 260,000 ETH were withdrawn from exchanges, which was worth almost $800 million at the time. #Altcoins Crypto exchanges witnessed an outflow of over 260,000 #ETH equivalent to more than $781 million within the past 7 days. It‚Äôs time for #Ethereum shine. ‚ú®üåï pic.twitter.com/jT1aocjvbI ‚Äî Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) April 24, 2024 Now, exchange deposits and withdrawals are important for any cryptocurrency because it can often tell how investors are looking at that coin and what they are doing with their holdings. In the case of large deposits to centralized exchanges, it can be very bearish for the price because investors often deposit their coins in order to sell them as exchanges provide deep liquidity. In contrast, withdrawals from exchanges suggest that investors are not looking to sell their ETH. Rather, they are accumulating the coins to wait for better prices before selling. Naturally, this is bullish for the Ethereum price as a diminished selling pressure gives room for the price to recover. In this case, the withdrawals are bullish or the Ethereum price, as investors continue to accumulate. It also signals that investors are expecting a price breakout, and as the withdrawals ramp up, demand could surpass supply, leading to a surge in price. Ethereum Headwinds Still Negative Ethereum, while currently seeing some positive activity from investors, has still not turned completely bullish. For one, there has been a significant decline in its daily trading volume. According to data from Coinmarketcap, Ethereum‚Äôs trading volume is down approximately 20% in the last day. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Reveals What Will Happen If Bitcoin Can‚Äôt Hold $60,000 This decline in volume suggests a declining interest from investors to actually trade the coin. As such, its price may be negatively affected as attention begins to shift elsewhere, with investors looking for better prospects. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency still looks bullish for the long term. Ethereum continues to closely mirror the price performance of Bitcoin, which is expected to go on a bull run following the successful completion of its fourth halving event. For now, Ethereum continues to struggle to hold above $3,100 with small gains of 0.18% in the last day. Over the last month, it has suffered multiple crashes, registering a 12.36% loss in the last 30 days.

Short-term trend in BTC-USD is downward, but long-term trend is more favorable with strong support near $60,500. Momentum remains positive for BTC-USD, suggesting potential buying opportunities, but caution is advised with volatile asset. Over the last several weeks, most of the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs attention has been fully centered around this month‚Äôs halving event as traders look for clues to determine whether or not the latest bull rallies are likely to continue. In opposition with historical trends, market reactions might have surprised many investors, as price valuations in BTC-USD have shown a negative reaction during the sessions that have followed. As most of us understand, past performance does not always match with future results - and this certainly appears to be the case here, with BTC-USD falling to lows of $59,629 on April 24th. Interestingly, this does mark a sharp contrast when we gauge this reaction in comparison to the market reaction to previous halving events. Specifically, BTC-USD experienced maximum cyclical returns of 5,291% after the first halving event (which occurred on November 28th, 2012). In a similarly impressive fashion, BTC-USD experienced maximum cyclical gains of 1,263% following the second halving event (which occurred on July 9th, 2016). During the third halving event (which occurred on May 11th, 2020), the maximum returns were significantly lower but were still firmly positive at 619%. Post-Halving BTC-USD Price Action (Coin Metrics / CNBC) For active traders with current positions in BTC-USD, all of this activity should work as an excellent investment lesson due to the fact that expected historical trends in the market valuations of BTC-USD can be quite surprising and lead to trading losses when shorter-term positions are not properly managed. Typically, this means that it is important to identify important price levels that can be used to enter and exit positions in the event that market reactions appear to swing too far in one direction or the other. BTC-USD 4-hour Chart (Income Generator via TradingView) As a way of gauging the BTC-USD activity that has most recently been seen, we will first assess the 4-hour charts to define near-term trend direction. Here, we can see that BTC-USD is clearly caught in a downward parallel channel, posting lower highs at the top of its range and lower lows at the bottom of its range. Readings of the averages that can be found in the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) are still trending lower, which suggests that traders might want to exercise patience before entering into long positions (as better buying opportunities may become apparent in upcoming trading sessions). BTC-USD Daily Chart (Income Generator via TradingView) Longer-term, however, the trend direction in BTC-USD is looking quite a bit more favorable. Specifically, we can still see that lower highs define the upper end of the dominant range - but the central difference in this chart lies in the fact that triple-bottom support has clearly formed just below $60,500. Perhaps, this is not surprising given the proximity of this price level to important psychological levels at $60,000 - but the fact that cryptocurrency markets have managed to hold these levels after three consecutive tests is highly encouraging and suggests that we may see another bounce in this region near-term. Daily indicator readings are starting to flat-line near mid-point levels, and this is another suggestion that we might see a period of consolidation within this price zone that prevents BTC-USD valuations from falling much further. Given the weaknesses that we are seeing in the shorter-term time frames (4-hour charts), this suggests that a downward drift toward the lower end of the daily trading range could be the most likely outcome and we think buy orders slightly north of the $60,500 level present an attractive value for the cryptocurrency pairing. BTC-USD Weekly Chart (Income Generator via TradingView) Pulling out to the BTC-USD weekly charts also yields some useful information, as this will allow us to identify long-term Fibonacci retracement levels to watch in the event that the aforementioned support levels become invalidated through continued selling pressure. If we use the bullish price move from the September 2023 lows (coming in just below $25,400) and extend this move to the March 2024 highs (slightly below $73,800), we can see that the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level currently rests near $62,000. Interestingly, this marks a nice confluence when aligned with recent historical support levels - and this gives us another bullish argument that suggests that markets have a strong opportunity to avoid significant declines near-term. When looking at these longer-term time frames (weekly charts) we generally find it valuable to assess momentum readings so that we can determine whether the dominant trend remains viable. In this case, we can see that BTC-USD momentum remains positive (even with the post-halving declines) and this bodes well for bullish cryptocurrency investors that are interested in building long positions near current levels. All of that said, it is also important to prepare for the bullish outlook to fail - and this is especially true when we are dealing with a volatile asset like BTC-USD. Here, Fibonacci retracement levels can be quite valuable as they can give us an indication of the specific price zones which might hold as support levels if selling pressure starts to intensify. Below the $62,000 level, the next important Fibonacci retracement level can be found just above $54,900 (which marks the 38.2% retracement of the aforementioned bullish move). What might become noticeable here is that these price zones start to develop within very close proximity to large round-number psychological levels to the downside. As an additional example, the 50% retracement of this important bullish move can actually be found near the $50,000 level (at roughly $49,200). If nothing else, this will at least make it easy to remember which price levels are likely to attract a new round of buy order, in the event that near-term price support zones fail and renewed selling pressure puts the bearish side of the market back in control. Overall, we do see evidence on the price charts which suggests that continued declines in BTC-USD might be limited. Now that this important event risk is in the rearview mirror, it is time for cryptocurrency traders to begin identifying critical price zones that can be used to enter (or exit) market positions. On balance, most of the evidence appears to be centered in the positive direction, and this means that recent declines in BTC-USD could unveil new buying opportunities relatively soon.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4686729-bitcoin-future-results-not-past-performance-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26415682.jpeg

A federal judge ruled last month that the Kansas City Fed had the discretion to reject Custodia's bid for a master account. Custodia, according to the court, had not provided sufficient evidence to back up accusations that the Fed's Board of Governors was illegally leaning on the Kansas City branch to reject the bank's bid for the master account which, if granted, would let Custodia directly access the Fed and not need intermediary banks.  The ruling came years after Custodia first filed suit, alleging the Fed had taken too long to make a decision. The company helmed by Caitlin Long, who helped draft Wyoming's special purpose depository institution law, later refiled the suit after the Fed formally denied its master account application.  ""Unless Federal Reserve Banks possess discretion to deny or reject a master account application, state chartering laws would be the only layer of insulation for the U.S. financial system,"" Judge Scott Skavdahl wrote last month. ""And in that scenario, one can readily foresee a 'race to the bottom' among states and politicians to attract business by reducing state chartering burdens through lax legislation, allowing minimally regulated institutions to gain ready access to the central bank's balances and Federal Reserve services.""  At the time, a Custodia spokesperson said the company was reviewing the ruling. Custodia also filed an objection to the Fed's attempt at collecting legal fees, arguing both that the case was ongoing due to the appeal and that granting the fees might ""chill"" future lawsuits by companies against government or quasi-government entities.

Potential Declines For Bitcoin Martinez‚Äôs analysis delves into the potential for Bitcoin to experience possible dives on the downside in the short term. Considering the BTC‚Äôs chart in the 12-hour timeframe, the analyst noted that two signals have manifested signaling potential price declines. Related Reading: Analyst Points To Possible 30% Bitcoin Correction, Calls For Caution These include a red candlestick from the TD (Tom Demark) Sequential and a death cross between the 50 and 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA). As a result, Martinez believes that the development could trigger a price drop to $63,300. Additionally, he urged the community to be ready for further dips to around $61,000 and $59,000. Martinez previously highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator on the 12-hour chart has flashed a sell signal. This signal came in light of Bitcoin experiencing a mid-level resistance of a parallel channel. Given this, he underscores a cautious approach amidst times like this, given the history of this indication, especially in the event that the digital asset falls below the $65,500 support level. According to the expert, the trend score for the coin‚Äôs accumulation has fallen to zero. Specifically, this suggests that whales are either distributing or not hoarding BTC at the moment. It seems Martinez‚Äôs forecast has taken place as BTC is already trading below the aforementioned support level. Following the price decline, Bitcoin has also seen a notable drop in accumulation. Over the past few weeks, there has been consolidation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price as it has been unable to sustain its surge over its all-time high of $73,000 achieved in March. On Thursday, BTC witnessed a notable drop to around $63,000, which higher inflation and slower growth in the United States were considered to be a catalyst for the drop. BTC‚Äôs Path To $1 Million Even though there have been some short-term swings with Bitcoin, its long-term trend is still positive. Jack Mallers, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Strike has predicted a long-term growth for BTC to a whopping $1 million. Related Reading: Samson Mow Gives Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Could Reach $1 Million This Year Mallers shared his perspective on the digital asset‚Äôs future trajectory during an interview with David Lin. The financial instability in the bond markets, which significantly involves banks, is the foundation upon which Maller draws his projection. He asserts that significant liquidity infusions could result from the possible rescue needed to stabilize these markets, driving up the price of assets like Bitcoin. Mallers believes BTC‚Äôs value will rise, underlining the limited availability of BTC when paired with rising demand. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $64,207, indicating a 0.72% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite the crypto asset showing positive signs, its trading volume is down by over 8% in the past day.

42408362,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIbK,1714145593,"Warren Flags Crypto Ties to Child Sexual Abuse in Letter to DOJ, Homeland Security","The bipartisan pair of U.S. senators underlined crypto's history as a mainstay of transactions to purchase illegal pornography featuring children.  Their letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security noted the difficulties in heading off these crimes and asked the top law-enforcement officials what more can be done.  Leading crypto critic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland what tools the federal government needs to crack down on the use of digital assets to perpetrate child sexual exploitation, according to a letter she sent to the top U.S. law-enforcement official.  Warren and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) flagged cryptocurrencies as a significant tool supporting child sexual abuse materials in a letter the senators sent this week to Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, the chief of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Cryptocurrency has become ""the payment of choice for perpetrators of child sexual abuse and exploitation,"" the lawmakers noted, citing a February FinCEN Trend Analysis from transactions in 2020 and 2021 and a Chainalysis report from this past January. ""Existing anti-money laundering rules and law enforcement methods face challenges in effectively detecting and preventing these crimes ‚Äì and we seek to ensure that Congress and the administration are doing their part to address these challenges.""  The letter asked the agencies to detail the ""additional tools and resources"" they need to deal with the problem.  The use of digital tokens to fund the abuse of children rose to prominence years ago, such as in the 2019 bust of the Welcome to Video pornography site run by a South Korean national and, a year later, when authorities pursued a Dutch national who ran a rape and child porn site on the darkweb and made $1.6 million in bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Crypto became a favorite form of payment due to perceptions that it offered anonymity for the transactions, though analytic tools and law-enforcement strategies have since cast some doubt on that. Much of the data on crypto use cited by the lawmakers is several years old. Still, the Chainalysis review earlier this year noted it as ""a growing problem.""

The inherent volatility of the market and lingering regulatory uncertainties serve as sobering reminders of the risks associated with investing in XRP. While past performance may hint at future possibilities, it offers no guarantees in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets. Moreover, even in the event of a favorable verdict for Ripple, regulatory scrutiny could persist, casting a pall over XRP‚Äôs potential growth trajectory. Legal Battle: A Catalyst For Change?

42408347,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIEB,1714143122,DePIN for the Win: Spreading the Benefits of the Gig Economy,"As the crypto industry enters a new phase of adoption, many will be wondering which narratives will win this market cycle. Will it be meme coins, scene coins, or AI (vapor)ware? Or perhaps liquid re-staking, ordinals, or maybe doginals, or is it Base? The crypto space is swirling with hot narratives, and even hotter money.  With some luck, this cycle won‚Äôt be remembered for any of those narratives. Instead, it will be known for remaking what I will call the ‚Äúoperator economy‚Äù (what is more commonly called the ‚Äúgig‚Äù or ‚Äúsharing‚Äù economy). That would spell victory for anyone who has ever overpaid for an Uber or sacrificed health benefits to take on that freelancer gig. And it would be a vindication of crypto itself.  Ivo Entchev is a partner with Youbi Capital, a digital asset VC and accelerator since 2017.  Companies like Uber and Airbnb pioneered the operator economy when they started delivering valuable services using crowdsourced infrastructure and labor. In the process, they proved that this relatively decentralized business model could compete with, and even outperform, traditional businesses. Today, the United States is home to more operating platforms than anywhere in the world, with apps for food delivery, haircuts, babysitters, car sharing, and many more. The U.S. operator economy has produced a stable of unicorns and is on track to be valued in the trillions by 2031. In a sense, the operator economy is becoming The Economy.  From the standpoint of market efficiency and social fairness, the operator economy is a failed experiment. Operator ‚Äúecosystems‚Äù are rife with monopolistic platforms, predatory pricing (subsidized by venture funds) and supported by an expanding underclass of economically precarious ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers. Gig workers receive piecemeal wages and no overtime, are denied employee benefits like Social Security and health coverage, and must pay out-of-pocket to cover costs of doing their jobs. They are also subjected to various forms of wage theft or discrimination by opaque algorithms that orchestrate their work.  Building equity  Decentralized Physical Infrastructure, or DePIN, promises operator ecosystems that are both more efficient and more equitable. DePIN describes community-driven protocol networks that coordinate hardware-based services with tokens, and its underlying logic is as old as crypto itself. Bitcoin is the prototypical DePIN network allowing anyone in the world to contribute computing hardware towards securing an open distributed ledger in exchange for token rewards. This basic logic informs all subsequent DePIN networks.  Coming to Consensus? Make sure to check out the Gen C Demo Area to get hands-on experience with a selection of DePIN and emerging technology products.  Much like DeFi, DePIN‚Äôs leading economic benefit is that it dissolves rent-seeking intermediaries and re-distributes their rents to a range of stakeholders. Take Teleport, a DePIN ride hailing app. Teleport coordinates its ride hailing community using its protocol and token incentives, eliminating the need for any corporate, like Uber or Lyft. This returns extractive margins and fees back to drivers and riders in the form of higher wages and lower prices.  Another major improvement is that operators earn an economic stake in the network through the token they accumulate in wages and rewards. As the network expands, these tokens expose operators to pre-IPO venture returns, much like the early miners of the Bitcoin network. In contrast, today‚Äôs gig workers don‚Äôt receive even basic employee benefits. Tokenization separately benefits the network because it incentivizes early adopters and evangelists, helping to bootstrap the next wave of operators and users.  Read more: 'DePIN' Is Venture Capitalists' Latest Crypto Obsession. Can It Match the Hype?  There are other notable benefits. DePIN is permissionless, meaning that it reduces barriers to entry, draws in a broader range of participants, and expands geographic reach, making it ideal for edge cases. DePIN networks are also transparent and provide more protection against discrimination by algorithm. And because code is harder to halt or censor than a central actor, they can be more difficult to disrupt for political or other illegitimate reasons.  In this cycle, Web3 operators are emerging in a range of industries, signaling that DePIN is expanding and maturing. They include:  Computing operators. Computing operators provide essential processing and communication services. Projects like Aethir Cloud showcase the potential of decentralized cloud rendering networks, allowing developers to build a range of decentralized consumer applications and users to tap into a collective pool of computational power. Similarly, Akash offers a marketplace for cloud services, challenging traditional providers like AWS and GCP with a decentralized alternative.  Data operators. Data operators transform raw data into valuable assets. They deploy hardware to collect and process data, creating datasets and APIs for commercial use. Examples like DIMO and Hivemapper illustrate this trend, with operators gathering vehicle data for insurers or capturing street images for real-time street-level mapping. Beyond mere collection, these operators often enhance data before it‚Äôs wrapped into marketable products.  Storage operators. Storage operators ensure data permanence in the Web3 operator economy. Projects like Arweave and Filecoin are offering decentralized solutions for file storage. They ensure that data is not just saved but also remains accessible for future use. These platforms are crucial as they safeguard information against loss and obsolescence, enabling a reliable digital legacy.  Hardware operators. Hardware operators match physical assets with user demand. Take io.net, which connects companies needing AI processing power with a network of GPU providers. Helium operates similarly, linking small cell hardware owners with those requiring 5G connectivity. In the Web3 operator economy, hardware becomes a shared commodity while every participant plays the dual role of consumer and provider.  Growing pains  Despite its recent rise and immense potential, DePIN faces material challenges. Most notably, DePIN networks must navigate the complex regulatory landscape of the real world while remaining committed to decentralization. For example, the mapping service Hivemapper is required to juggle a patchwork of governance, data management, and safety regulations, each with its own set of stringent compliance requirements. These hurdles introduce significant friction, which slows progress towards the desired end state of autonomous protocols.  Finally, if they are to succeed, DePIN network must find ways to protect vulnerable operators from the token volatility and crashes that can accompany a bootstrapped network economy. Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin recently wrote of the moral imperative to protect vulnerable crypto users from token collapses and scams. But his argument is even stronger when applied to projects that purport to empower economically disenfranchised groups, such as gig workers, artists and users in the developing world.  DePIN is a natural place to begin stretching crypto‚Äôs social safety net. Assuming that DePIN can solve those challenges, it will revolutionize the operator economy and put crypto‚Äôs value, as well as its values, beyond doubt.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | AR,Ivo Entchev,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/26/depin-for-the-win-spreading-the-benefits-of-the-gig-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55f5267410862010e58e02d28022c466740961f6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We are increasing our upper target zone from $75,000 - $130,000 to $106,000 on the low end, and $190,000 on the high end. As long as the $42,750 support region holds on any on-going volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place. Bitcoin is an asset where the bulls pound the table to ‚Äúbuy, buy, buy,‚Äù and the bears relentlessly and stubbornly call it a scam. In reality, both are the wrong approach. This is because although Bitcoin is the highest performing asset in the past ten years, it‚Äôs also one of the most volatile. Consider that it was trading at $58,000 in March of 2022, and by December of 2022 had lost 72% of its value. That year, the loud and proud Bitcoin bulls were not your friends. Timing is everything. When it comes to timing, our firm has a proven track record of navigating The life-changing bull case that crypto offers while minimizing the volatility associated with different coins ‚Äì we achieve this via a unique approach combining technical and on-chain analysis to identify major lows and major tops in each cycle. For example, we diligently detailed to our readers in December of 2023, when Bitcoin was trading in the $16,000 region, that we are ‚ÄúBullish on Bitcoin‚Äù: Though we are in the 4 th bear cycle in Bitcoin's history, the prior 3 cycles suggest where we are is a rare buying opportunity. There is ample evidence to support the $15,500 level is either a major low or very close to a major low. Both the technical and on-chain analysis support this. As Bitcoin continues to integrate into the global economy, we expect both the volatility and epic returns to calm down. For now, we are content buying Bitcoin at these lows with a long-term mindset.‚Äù One year later, our most recent Bitcoin article stated that the coming pullback into the $39,000 - $35,000 region would likely be ‚Äúthe last great buying opportunity‚Äù in this bull cycle. At the time our upper targets were between $75,000 - $132,000. That correction bottomed around $38,500 then led to 90% rally, which topped less than 2% from our $75,000 target. If Bitcoin were in the Mag 7, it would be the second strongest performer both YTD and on a 1-year basis, edging out Meta at returns of 133% in 1-year and 52% YTD. Had you bought in the $16,000 region, the returns would be 300% in about 17 months‚Äô time. YCharts Looking forward, an important question to ask is, are we at the end of a bull cycle or do we have more room to run? We believe that there is more room within this uptrend. As a result, we are raising our upper Bitcoin targets, as the current volatility appears to be another correction within a much larger uptrend. In this article, we will support this thesis through on-chain analysis as well as technical analysis. We will also address how Bitcoin appears to be setting up for higher levels while equities look like they‚Äôre topping. The popular narrative is that crypto and stocks ‚Äì especially tech stocks -- are correlated. It‚Äôs our stance that these two investments are not as correlated as many believe, which lends credence to this potential divergence. Updated Bitcoin Game Plan We have remained steadfast on the long-term pattern for Bitcoin, which you can see was intact as far back as July of 2022 . While the 2022 drawdown went lower than we anticipated, once we got signs of a bottom, we maintained this pattern around the $15,000 lows. The implication was that 2022 was a correction within a much larger uptrend, and that we were going to see a new bull cycle into 2023 - 2024. As of today, we are more than halfway into the current bull cycle, which is the final 5 th wave in a very large 5 wave uptrend that started in late 2018. What this means is that as we approach our upper targets, our game plan will shift from accumulation to distribution. Tech Insider Network The current drawdown appears to be tracing a bull flag, which is a correction within an uptrend. The $57,000 region is very strong support, which is the upper range of our support zones that need to hold in order for us to push higher. This is over 25% lower than price currently is, which shows the level of strength still in Bitcoin. If we do see another drop, we can go as low as $42,750 without invalidating the larger uptrend in play. So, this ongoing pattern is comfortably intact and has ample room to drop, if we see more volatility. While the pattern appears to be corrective, and tracing a standard pattern we see within larger uptrends, the momentum oscillator below price is at a major support zone. Note how this support region acted as key lows, especially in the current uptrend that started in late 2022. Also, note how much higher price is compared to other instances where this support was tested. This suggests a low being put in, while also suggesting that we have ample room to push higher in the coming weeks to months. Because of this development, we are increasing our upper target zone from $75,000 - $130,000 to $106,000 on the low end, and $190,000 on the high end . As long as the $42,750 support region holds on any on-going volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place. That being said, we do not see the same upside within the equity markets, which begs the question ‚Äì is Bitcoin highly correlated to tech stocks? Bitcoin vs. Tech On April 18 th , we saw an escalation of the concerning geopolitical conflict between Iran and Israel. As a result, the NASDAQ-100 closed down over 2% the following day, with AI leaders like NVDA giving back 10% in a single day. There were not many areas of tech that were spared on that day of selling, as investors sought to de-risk at any price. One would think Bitcoin would follow tech on this day, but it was instead up nearly 1%. In fact, many alt-coins shrugged off this news and pushed higher. Granted this is only one day, but it is an intriguing development. This was the first instance of panic selling in over 6 months where we saw investors dumping high risk tech stocks, and Bitcoin not only did not participate, but saw buyers. If we look back at the long-term correlation to Bitcoin and the heavily focused NASDAQ-100, you will note that the majority of times, these two investments are closer to having minimal to no correlation. This is in contrast to being highly correlated, as many would believe. Tech Insider Network The above chart measures the correlation between these two investments. The best way to read the chart is when the line is moving up, it means the two are correlated and heading in the same direction, while the inverse indicates they are moving in opposite directions. Also, when the cumulative reading is above 0.5 (green), the two investments are highly correlated, between 0.5 and -0.5 (yellow) the two have minimal to no correlation, and when the reading is below -0.5 (red) they have an inverse correlation and are moving in the opposite direction. Considering the correlation is cumulative on a weekly scale, the two investments have to stay inversely correlated for some time in order to cross below 0. As you can see, there are significant periods where the two have been inversely correlated, which I‚Äôve marked with the gray vertical shades. For reference, the below chart shows the correlation between the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ-100 through the same period. While there are brief periods where the two indexes have diverged, the cumulative correlation rarely goes below 0.5% (green), and only briefly crossed the 0 line. Tech Insider Network The point is to show actual data in regard to the popular narrative that Bitcoin is just another tech equity play. The data shows that the cumulative correlation has periods where it is highly correlated to tech, but what is key to understand, is that it also has extended periods where it is inversely correlated. The norm is that the two investments have had a low to no correlation, which supports the inverse move that we saw between Bitcoin and tech stocks on April 19 th . This supports a probable scenario where equities could put in a top while Bitcoin continues to run higher. Equities Topping While Bitcoin Goes Higher In our March report , we showed how the current bull market leaders, the Magnificent 7, were topping, one at a time, while the broad market was continuing to push higher. At the time of the report, only 3 of the Mag 7 were making new highs with the broad market. We then saw the AI leaders within the semiconductor space, including Nvidia, top around early March, while the broad market pushed higher into April. Seeing the bull market leaders diverge from the broad market is usually a sign of coming weakness, not strength. More times than not, we will see the leaders top first when a meaningful change in trend is about to happen, which we warned our readers about. If we were going to push higher, these leaders needed to break out to new highs, and until then, we were at risk of a trend change. This lines up with the potential topping pattern we are seeing within the equity markets, compared to Bitcoin, which appears to have more room to run. Tech Insider Network The above chart shows the NASDAQ-100 has completed a mature 5 wave pattern off the 2022 low, and has broken the first of two major supports ‚Äì 17,265 and 17,000. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still in an incomplete 5 wave pattern, which is still tracing the 3 rd wave higher. Note the current correction is taking the shape of a bull flag, and is nearly 25% above the first critical support level. The reason for this could have several explanations. For one, it‚Äôs worth noting that the demand for Bitcoin has increased substantially, while its supply has remained the same. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have quickly become a popular investment vehicle, and have seen a surge in net inflows, surpassing more than $30B AUM in mid-April after amassing $17B in funds in less than two months after a launch in mid-January. For example, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin ETF recorded 71 consecutive days of net inflows. In addition, trading volume on the ETFs nearly tripled in March, reaching $111 billion ‚Äì for an asset class that launched only two months prior, that‚Äôs a significant figure. Another explanation is the fact that not all markets top and bottom at the same time. For example, small caps topped in 2021 while the NASDAQ-100 continued higher into 2024. Therefore, Bitcoin could be one of the last assets to put in a larger top, after the NASDAQ-100. This would lead to several lower highs within a large range for the NASDAQ-100, while Bitcoin makes its final series of higher highs. After which, they would align in a potential downtrend. Another answer could be something more fundamental. Bitcoin was created to answer a specific flaw within the centralized banking system. It is fundamentally different than a tech stock, and has the potential to provide a hedge against various banking and/or currency problems that tech stocks would not be able to address. In this case, Bitcoin could be picking up on some deeper issue within the system, which is causing the potential divergence. The other scenario is that I could be wrong, and the NASDAQ-100 holds this support region, the Mag 7 and AI Semis find more strength, and push higher with Bitcoin, or vice versa. I‚Äôm open to this, but until Bitcoin starts breaking critical support levels in a direct fashion, like most equity markets recently have, there is no reason to pivot away from a more bullish outcome in Bitcoin. On Chain Analysis For those that are not familiar with on-chain data, it is the unique fundamental analysis within crypto, and a relatively new field of study. We partnered with WealthUmbrella, a team of Machine Learning engineers and professors, to provide this level of analysis within the crypto space. According to WealthUmbrella, the underlying strength that our technical analysis is picking up on is also being supported within on-chain data. The below section was written by Vincent Duchaine, CEO of WealthUmbrella. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent move to $73,000 created some of the most overbought conditions we have seen throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history. One of the indicators used to gauge these overbought levels measures the value of Bitcoin‚Äôs network through the increase/decrease in active users. At the recent high in Bitcoin, this indicator, which only rose briefly to a historically high value, gave us a reading of 3.3. As you can see below, this reading represents an outlier in Bitcoin history. Tech Insider Network A reading this high historically leads to a top, of sorts. The good news is that the recent volatility has taken this indicator back to a reading of 0.84, which is in the lower range of what we have seen during a correction in a bull market over the last 6 years. This further confirms our long-standing outlook that the bull cycle in Bitcoin will likely move higher . Tech Insider Network This extreme overbought reading was also picked up by our SOPR Indicator, which stands for the Spent Output Profit Ratio. This indicator measures the daily transactions in Bitcoin and measures if the combined ratio has a profit or loss based on when they were bought. As the indicator moves up, it is signaling that all the majority of daily transactions in Bitcoin were sold for a profit. As you can see, this indicator also reached a historically high reading when Bitcoin first hit $73,000. However, it has greatly cooled down since and is now slowly curving to the right. Tech Insider Network These two metrics were warnings that a correction was likely coming due to being extremely overbought. However, since then, we have seen them cool off to a level that suggests we could be getting close to the bottom of the current correction and resume the uptrend. This thesis is being supported by other metrics that we track. For example, since the arrival of the new Bitcoin ETF, the amount of Bitcoin that hasn‚Äôt moved in more than a year was in a constant drop, implying that long-term holders (hodlers) were finally taking gains, which was increasing supply. This selling by the Bitcoin hodlers has since stopped since April 2 nd , which you can see in the chart below. Tech Insider Network Like any asset, Bitcoin's price movements are the result of supply and demand. We are now seeing long-term holders of Bitcoin cease the selling that started in late 2023. This is bullish as it creates a constraint on the supply side of the equation. Not only are hodlers not selling, but whales have also bought the recent dips in a notable way. The below chart measures large block trades within Bitcoin. The most recent spike happened last Thursday, April 18 th , when whales bought 19,700 BTC at an average price of $62.5k. Tech Insider Network Regarding the demand for Bitcoin, we have historically measured this through monitoring the number of newly created Bitcoin addresses with a non-$0 balance. As new addresses are created that actively buy Bitcoin, this implies that demand is increasing. However, this is likely not as relevant in light of the new Bitcoin ETFs. Before the creation of these ETFs, the predominant means to access Bitcoin was through the creation of wallets or personalized crypto exchange accounts. Now, an investor can simply buy an ETF on a public exchange and get access to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. This has now opened the door to institutional investors as well as investors who want diversification but did not want to deal with the hassle of dealing with crypto exchanges and the safety concerns that come with them. Regarding demand, this development is arguably the most important element in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, and we view as quite bullish in regards to the demand side of the price equation. Lead Tech Analyst Beth Kindig went on Fox Business News and discussed how Bitcoin has never had a more fundamentally bullish moment: Bitcoin has never had a more fundamental bullish moment (X.com) Bitcoin has never had a more fundamental bullish moment: Beth Kindig (X.com) In summary, the internals are supporting higher levels, as we are now seeing demand start to catch up with supply. We view the current state of Bitcoin‚Äôs pullback as a buying opportunity within a larger uptrend. This is confirmed by one of our most powerful tools, which we call the Kwiatkowski Indicator, named after its creator. This tool is designed to spot tops by looking at the profit of all market participants in an organized way. It is currently indicating a value of around 12, while we don‚Äôt expect a cyclical top until 35. Tech Insider Network Conclusion: We are seeing evidence that Bitcoin wants to go higher, while equities appear to be setting for a top. Bitcoin has a history of not being correlated with tech stocks, so this scenario is not as improbable as the popular narrative would suggest. Both technical and on-chain analysis support higher levels for Bitcoin, and as long as any further weakness holds $42,750, we view this dip as a buying opportunity.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4686669-we-are-raising-our-bitcoin-targets-to-106k-190k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26410929.jpeg

26409214,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605260,1714140020,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Rocked By Outflows, BTC Price Succumbs To Bears","The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen their demand drop since the start of this month, and this was again evident in the considerable outflows recorded on April 26. This poor run has had far-reaching effects on the broader crypto market as Bitcoin‚Äôs price has succumbed to unfavorable market conditions. Spot Bitcoin ETFS Record $217 Million Of Outflows Farside Investors revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $217 million of net outflows on April 25, one of their largest this month. Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) accounted for most of these outflows, with investors moving $139.4 million out of the fund. Related Reading: Why Is The Dogecoin Price Down Today? Some other funds also recorded individual outflows. Ark Invest‚Äôs Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $31.3 million in outflows, while Valkyrie and Bitwise‚Äôs ETFs saw $20 million and $6 million in daily outflows, respectively. Notably, Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) recorded a net daily outflow for the first time since these funds were approved, with $22.6 being moved out of the fund on Thursday. Meanwhile, BlackRock‚Äôs dry spell continued with its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recording zero inflows for the second consecutive day. Although the fund has yet to record net daily outflows since launching, this undoubtedly represents a setback, considering that it had, before April 24, recorded 71 consecutive days of daily inflows. These Spot Bitcoin ETFs‚Äô outflows have led to a wave of sell-offs from the fund issuers to fulfill redemptions. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has been rather unimpressive as of late, with the flagship crypto experiencing significant price declines due to the heightened selling pressure. This development has put the bears firmly in control, with data from Coinglass showing that more Bitcoin longs than shorts have been liquidated in the last 24 hours. Macro Economic Factors Also Affecting Bitcoin‚Äôs Price An initial estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on April 25 showed that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, which was way below expectations. This data report further diminishes hopes of rate cuts this year and looks to have played out in investors‚Äô minds as Bitcoin briefly dropped below $63,000 following the report‚Äôs release. Related Reading: HBAR Prices Crashes 35% As BlackRock Denies Any Ties To Hedera Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data is set to be released on April 26. This PCE report could come in higher than expectations, adding to the growing concerns about the unlikelihood of rate cuts this year. Interest rates have significant implications on risk assets, including crypto, and if the Federal Reserve decides to take a hawkish stance, it could negatively impact the crypto market.

HIVE's declining monthly BTC production must be offset by higher prices or revenue from transaction fees. After a nearly $29 million private placement, HIVE's financial position entering the halving appears stable. When I previously covered HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) for Seeking Alpha last July, I called the stock a ""sell"" and highlighted the company's marketing pivot from a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stock to an AI infrastructure company. From my July piece: As far as I can tell, the company's new-look website no longer appears to contain the words ""Bitcoin"" or ""blockchain"" on the homepage at all. Given the company's clear pivot to AI and HPC services last summer, I felt it notable that Bitcoin was no longer even mentioned on the HIVE Digital Technologies homepage. At the time, revenue from mining cryptocurrencies was still the only driver of HIVE's top-line performance. Fast forward to late-April 2024, and HIVE has ""Bitcoin mining"" on the homepage again: Homepage as of 4/25/24 (HIVE Digital Technologies) Since we apparently have the blessing to consider HIVE a Bitcoin mining company once more, let's take a look at the stock performance compared with mining peers since my article last July. I'm using the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) to express the peer group: Data by YCharts Since my last HIVE article, the stock is down over 40% while the sector ETF is about even. That said, HIVE is now quite a bit smaller than most of the top performers in the industry from a market capitalization standpoint. Last July, Bitfarms ( BITF ) and Iris Energy ( IREN ) had similar market caps as HIVE: Data by YCharts Here we can still see HIVE has been the clear laggard even among what were similarly sized companies last summer. In this update, we'll look at how the company's HPC revenue is taking form, recent mining production figures, and the state of the balance sheet at the end of December. Revenue Breakout Three months ended December 31st 2023 2022 Revenue from digital currency mining $30,115 $14,318 High performance computing hosting $1,137 - Total Quarterly Revenue $31,252 $14,318 Source: HIVE Digital Technologies , dollars in thousands In the quarter ended December 31st, HIVE reported $31.3 million in total revenue, 96% of which came from mining cryptocurrency. Mining revenue was more than double from same time period a year prior; however, revenue is actually down against the prior period when looking at nine months ended December: Nine months ended December 31st 2023 2022 Revenue from digital currency mining $75,973 $88,094 High performance computing hosting $1,611 - Total Quarterly Revenue $77,584 $88,094 Source: HIVE Digital Technologies , dollars in thousands Declining revenue from mining year over year is partially explainable by the end of proof-of-work mining on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) - which HIVE had previously been doing to a significant degree. The $1.1 million in HPC hosting revenue in the quarter accounted for over 70% of HIVE's HPC revenue for the nine months ended December 31st. So it's clear that while small compared to mining revenue, HPC revenue for HIVE is indeed growing. But for what it's worth, it's also clear that crypto mining is still the largest revenue source for HIVE Digital by far. Mining Production As far as raw production figures go, HIVE's monthly production trend is not terrific. We can see the broader trend in BTC reward declining over the last two years: HIVE Digital BTC production (Company filings) This is certainly not something that is unique to just HIVE Digital Technologies. As Bitcoin's global hash rate increases, competition for the block reward intensifies. Network hash rate has gone, frankly, parabolic over the last four years even as Bitcoin's block reward halving earlier this month loomed: Data by YCharts Since the block reward subsidy from new coin issuance is fixed and declines ever four years, miners either require ever-higher BTC prices or a larger share of revenue from transaction fees. Since the halving earlier this month, we've observed a rather large spike in those fees: Bitcoin Miner Revenue (IntoTheBlock) On April 20th - the day of the block reward halving - mining Bitcoin generated over $80 million in fees in a single day. This was about three times the reward from new coin issuance during that day. Since then, we've seen this trend in transaction fees normalize considerably. But even in the days since the halving, fees have continued to minimize the pain from the reduction in the block reward subsidy. This is a good sign for miners. And at the end of March 2024, HIVE was among the more efficient names in the space based on Q1-24 operations: BTC mining efficiency (Analyst's Calculations) At 52.9 BTC per exahash, only Iris Energy had a higher efficiency average than HIVE Digital Technologies in Q1 according to my back of the envelope calculations. Balance Sheet Positioning Glancing over at the balance sheet at the end of December, HIVE Digital Technologies could cover all liabilities with current assets: Data by YCharts $17.8 million of those current assets were cash and equivalents with an additional $71.9 million in cryptocurrencies - 99% of which are BTC with a very small portion of Ethereum Classic ( ETC-USD ) and ""other coins."" In late December, HIVE disclosed a $28.75 million private placement to expand mining capacity and focus on growing the company's Bitcoin ""HODL."" Data by YCharts Given the apparent bet on BTC's price appreciation as telegraphed by the HODL strategy, it's not surprising to see the company starting to dilute shareholders to a more significant degree than it has in the past three years. That said, certainly compared to similarly capitalized peers, HIVE Digital has been much less of a dilution offender. Risks There is no guarantee that transaction fees will continue to support miners long term to the degree that they have since the April 20th halving. To be clear, I'm of the personal viewpoint that transaction fees are necessary long term for network security. But to this point, revenue from fees is highly volatile and difficult to forecast. The current spike is primarily driven by the recent launch of the Runes protocol. In my view, it is unlikely that these transaction fees will sustain current levels. HIVE's HPC revenue, while growing, is very small compared to mining revenue and may never reach the level of revenue that HIVE currently derives from Bitcoin. Finally, there is a substantial amount of competition for HPC services and no guarantee that the AI reality will ever live up to the hype. Closing Summary In my opinion, HIVE's stock price underperformance over the last nine months has been largely justified. That said, I do wonder if the worst has been priced in for HIVE at this point. Consider HIVE's Q1-24 BTC per exahash figure of 52.9. We can take that metric and build an annualized revenue table based on 5.5 EH/s: BTC Price $60,000 $70,000 $80,000 $90,000 $100,000 Yearly Revenue $104,400,000 $121,800,000 $139,200,000 $156,600,000 $174,000,000 FWD P/S 3.15 2.70 2.36 2.10 1.89 Source: Analyst's calculations Adjusted for the halving and assuming no revenue from transaction fees or HPC going forward, HIVE's $329 million market cap gives the company a 3.2x forward price to sales multiple at $60k BTC. At $70k, HIVE is priced in line with the info tech sector median. At $100k BTC, HIVE is probably cheap. I'm still not long the stock personally, but I will upgrade HIVE from ""sell"" to ""hold.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4686632-hive-digital-technologies-post-halving-prospects?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26407326.jpeg

Notably, ‚Äúpaulo.sol did not buy WIF and BODEN when they first went online, but paid attention to and bought heavily when they first rose sharply,‚Äù Lookonchain observes. As of now, paulo.sol continues to hold 12.87 million BODEN tokens valued at approximately $7.6 million and 1.87 million WIF tokens worth around $5.7 million.

DOGE could decline heavily if it settles below the $0.140 support. DOGE is facing many hurdles near the $0.1650 and $0.170 levels against the US dollar. The price is trading below the $0.1620 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1620 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.170 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge. Dogecoin Price Signals Downturn After a major decline, Dogecoin price started a recovery wave from the $0.1280 zone. A low was formed at $0.1283 and DOGE climbed above $0.1350, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.1385 and $0.140 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2092 swing high to the $0.1283 low. However, the bears protected more gains above the $0.170 resistance. The price failed to test the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2092 swing high to the $0.1283 low. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1620 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin is also below the $0.160 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.160 level. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $0.1680 level. The main hurdle is at $0.170. A close above the $0.170 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.20 level. More Losses in DOGE? If DOGE‚Äôs price fails to gain pace above the $0.160 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1475 level. The next major support is near the $0.1400 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.1400 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.120 level.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $64K even as outflows from bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) picked up. Market data shows that the U.S.-listed ETFs had a daily total net outflow of $217 million. This brings the total outflow this week to $244.49 million. In comparison, bitcoin is up around 3.7% in the past seven days. According to JPMorgan, the correlation between bitcoin ETF prices and inflows has weakened, dropping from a high of 0.84 in January to 0.60 in recent assessments.  Cathie Wood's ARK Invest offloaded the last of its shares in ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) on Thursday. The investment firm sold 237,983 BITO shares worth $6.7 million at Thursday's closing price of $28.22 from its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). ARK bought over 4 million of the shares late last year as a short-term play in anticipation of the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., with plans to swap them once the approval came. Following consistent sales in January, ARK has sold the rest of its BITO shares in the past week.  The European Parliament voted to adopt a new package of laws tightening money laundering and terrorist financing measures across the EU. The laws target large cash payments, crypto firms and football clubs, among others. In addition to creating a single rulebook for the 27 nations that make up the European Union, the package approved on Thursday sets up an anti-money laundering authority based in Frankfurt to oversee the implementation of the relevant frameworks ‚Äì particularly those the bloc deems as the ""riskiest entities."" The new laws include ""enhanced due diligence measures and checks on customers‚Äô identity, after which so-called obliged entities (e.g. banks, assets and crypto assets managers or real and virtual estate agents) have to report suspicious activities to [Financial Intelligence Units] and other competent authorities,"" a press statement on the vote said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that the crypto exchange Deribit's bitcoin volatility index (DVOL), an options-based measure of expected price volatility over the next 30 days, has collapsed from an annualized 72% to 55% in five days.  ""This is the result of spot [price] being stuck in a tight range and the basis yield drying up. The desk has seen many customers pivot to option selling strategies,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market update.  Selling or writing options represent a bearish view of volatility or a degree of price turbulence.  Source: TradingView.

OpenDelta will plant itself in the newest greenfield for decentralized finance (DeFi) atop the newest trend in Bitcoin, Runes.  During the Bitcoin halving on April 19, developer Casey Rodarmor created Runes, a way for people to etch fungible tokens onto satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin {{BTC}}. The DeFi-enabling novelty has since exploded into a behemoth for Bitcoin transactions, per a Dune dashboard from Crypto Koryo.  OpenDelta‚Äôs flagship token, USDO, will retain its dollar value by hedging bitcoin {{BTC}} deposited by users as collateral. The token won‚Äôt go live till May, and even then, it will only be open to waitlisters in a closed beta. But the company behind it plans to bring Runes to other Bitcoin layers as well.  The product will be yield-bearing for its holders, W√ºnscher said. It will generate this upside from the funding rates in derivatives markets that it trades in to retain its dollar value. To mint USDO, users will deposit bitcoin as collateral into a wallet that will be controlled by ""institutional-grade custodians,‚Äù according to a press release.  OpenDelta is among the first companies building the new face of DeFi for Bitcoin in the Runes era. As W√ºnscher sees it, the kind of people who are deeply into Bitcoin (he counts himself as one) aren‚Äôt necessarily attuned to the norms and nonsense of Ethereum DeFi, he said.  ‚ÄúWe can create new experiences on Bitcoin because people have not been pre-exposed to any other things than Bitcoin,‚Äù he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/26/bitcoin-linked-stablecoin-firm-opendelta-raises-25m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdabc55bd8ed9a56fbf5732e20ac786e7aeaf112-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ‚ÄúThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeks to regulate ETH as a security, even though ETH bears none of the attributes of a security ‚Äì and even though the SEC has previously told the world that ETH is not a security, and not within the SEC‚Äôs statutory jurisdiction,‚Äù according to the lawsuit filed in a Texas court on Thursday.  Over-and-above Consensys‚Äô lawsuit is the growing trend of U.S. crypto companies and organizations willing to fight back against what they see as overzealous regulation. There are many unsettled questions regarding crypto law, and going on the offensive ‚Äì possibly even bringing a case before the Supreme Court ‚Äì would be one way to get answers.  See also: Consensys Sues SEC Over ‚ÄòUnlawful Seizure Of Authority‚Äô Over Ethereum  Coinbase, for instance, is spending big to challenge a case brought by the SEC, and itself went to the courts to sue the agency seeking to get clarity on key questions of crypto law. Kraken and Uniswap, also facing SEC suits, vowed to fight back ‚Äì and LBRY, now defunct, literally fought until the end.  Then there are the lobbyist organizations like the Blockchain Association, which this week sued the SEC over a narrow point of law, the definition of a ‚Äúbroker‚Äù that, if the agency had its way, would have broad impact over the crypto industry. In 2022, Coin Center sued the U.S. Treasury Department (and lost) for sanctioning crypto mixer Tornado Cash.  ‚ÄúConsensys is joining some of the leading companies in the space in a broad industry pushback against regulation by enforcement that is destructive to the future of the internet. This is the responsibility of every Web3 company that has the capital and expertise to navigate the U.S. power structures,‚Äù Lex Sokolin, founder of Generative Ventures and a former Consensys employee, told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""It's invigorating to witness top actors in our field engaging with regulators to seek clarity in our exponentially growing industry,‚Äù CEO of the dYdX Foundation and former Consensys lawyer Charles d'Haussy told CoinDesk.  About face  A key argument of Consensys‚Äô suit is that the SEC had already declared that ETH is not a security, all the way back in 2018 when then SEC Director William Hinman gave a speech stating as much. It confirmed this position in 2021, when the first ETH futures launched in the U.S., putting the asset under the purview of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  There‚Äôs an argument to be made that the SEC had a fresh start to reevaluate Ethereum after it dropped mining for proof-of-stake. However, some experts note the SEC approved additional futures products after that happened, again dampening the argument that ETH is a security.  When news first dropped that the SEC was possibly investigating the non-profit Ethereum Foundation and subpoenaing firms for information related to Ethereum‚Äôs development, many experts interviewed by CoinDesk agreed that it would be illegal to reverse course after so much time. An entire multi-billion dollar industry has already been built on the understanding that ETH is a commodity.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe whole ‚Äòyou can't just arbitrarily change your mind and damage people for hundreds of billions of dollars after a decade‚Äô and also by the way the CFTC will likely fight back‚Äù argument, Austin Campbell, a Columbia Business School assistant professor and former adviser to stablecoin issuer Paxos, told CoinDesk in an interview at the time.  See also: Why the SEC Shouldn't Classify ETH as a Security  ""The case we have filed today is intended to preserve access for the thousands of developers, market participants, and institutions who have a stake in the world's second largest blockchain,"" Joe Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, said in a statement. ""The SEC cannot be allowed to arbitrarily expand its jurisdiction.‚Äù  According to the complaint, Consensys is looking to clarify three particular points: first, that ETH is a commodity; second, that the most popular Ethereum wallet, developed by Consensys, is not a broker; and lastly to get an injunction to leave developers alone and preemptively prevent the SEC from suing the company.  In addition to receiving multiple subpoenas in 2023 and in recent weeks, Consensys‚Äô court filing also disclosed that the company received a Wells Notice on April 10, or an indication that the SEC is working to build a case. According to Consensys Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Bill Hughes the company complied with the ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù requests for information.  Notably, the SEC asked for information not only about Consensys itself ‚Äì including questions about its ETH holdings and treasury sales, and whether it contributed to the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) that led to Ethereum‚Äôs switch to proof-of-stake ‚Äì but also questions about open source developers.  ‚ÄúThe fact that they're looking at open source protocol developers, certainly with an eye on building a case to enforce, really struck us as way out of bounds,‚Äù Hughes said, adding that Consensys was asked to provide lists of coders and their GitHub repositories. ‚ÄúTo some degree, they are redefining their regulatory purview and becoming an internet regulator.  ‚ÄúThis is not something we necessarily enjoy doing or want to do. But to a large extent it's necessary to defend the use of and building upon Ethereum and really all programmable blockchains in the United States,‚Äù he added.  ‚ÄòRemarkable acceleration‚Äô  While standing up for open source development may be motivating factor, Hughes suggested that the company was forced to move by what they saw as a ‚Äúremarkable acceleration in their aggressiveness with respect to Ethereum‚Äù and their interactions with the agency that ‚Äúmade it clear that they viewed [Consensys] as the target for an Ethereum enforcement action.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShould they be left unopposed they could do meaningful harm to our company in particular and the broader ecosystem. It comes to a point where you just can't wait any longer,‚Äù he said.  In particular, the SEC appears to be building a case that MetaMask Swaps, a decentralized exchange aggregator for swapping tokens that charges a 0.875% transaction fee, and MetaMask Staking, a relatively recent product essentially limited to users with 32 ETH to spare to become an Ethereum validator that takes a 10% cut of staking rewards, are in violation of securities or brokerage laws. (Several state regulators have also challenged the legal ground of staking.)  ‚ÄúThe end goal of the suit is to get the judge to agree and issue an order finding that Ethereum is a commodity, that the SEC has been acting beyond its statutory authority and in violation of procedures it's required to comply with, and that peer to peer software that people use to read and transact with themselves on the blockchain is not a broker,‚Äù Hughes said.  But other experts CoinDesk spoke to say the case may have an even loftier vision.  ‚ÄúThis Consensys lawsuit is a really big deal. They‚Äôre positioning themselves to challenge the SEC‚Äôs authority to regulate crypto,‚Äù University of Kentucky law professor Brian Frye said in an interview, noting the case was filed it in the 5th Circuit ‚Äî which is ‚Äúnotoriously anti-government and anti-regulatory.‚Äù  See also: ‚ÄòIt Can Be Said With Confidence the SEC Is Investigating Ethereum‚Äô: Consensys‚Äô Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law  In other words, Consensys may be trying to build a case worthy of taking before the Supreme Court. Frye noted that this particular SCOTUS would likely be willing to ‚Äúrevisit and narrow‚Äù the scope of the Howey test, one of the ways the SEC determines whether something is a security, and the basis for the majority of its litigation against crypto firms.  ‚ÄúConsensys hired Wachtell, which is the most expensive law firm in the world. That means they are really, really serious,‚Äù Frye said. It‚Äôs worth noting that Consensys recently relocated to Texas (its new listed address is a WeWork) from New York, which would make establishing jurisdiction in the 5th Circuit easier. ‚ÄúIf that happens, there‚Äôs just no way SCOTUS doesn‚Äôt take the case,‚Äù Frye added.  For his part, Hughes denied the claim, saying that Texas is business-friendly and home to a burgeoning crypto scene. (CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus 2024 conference will be held in Austin in May, for instance.) ‚ÄúBy contrast, New York was getting a little chillier,‚Äù he said.  In any case, Consensys‚Äô legal maneuver certainly changes the dynamic between the firm and would-be regulator. Its lawsuit doesn‚Äôt necessarily preclude the SEC from filing its own case, or unilaterally declaring ETH a security (which it has been reluctant to do so far), which would essentially make it illegal to spend ETH in the U.S.  But the situation is ‚Äúmeaningfully different‚Äù now that Consensys is a plaintiff rather than just a target. At the very least it‚Äôs one way to show the world that the SEC‚Äôs Enforcement Division, and likely leadership, ‚Äúconsiders Ethereum security‚Äù without having the gall to state it directly.  ‚ÄúWe think our action is appropriate because we think that the right answer needs to be gotten to and we're happy to call the question,‚Äù Hughes said.

The short-term outlook is bleak, despite some analysts‚Äô continued optimism on the market‚Äôs long-term prospects. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can Meme Coin Hit $0.001 This Year? Investor Makes Daring Call Halving Hype Fades Even the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), hasn‚Äôt been immune to the market downturn. Currently trading around $63,400, BTC is down 5% in the past day and a staggering 13% from its all-time high of over $73,000. This sluggish performance follows the recent Bitcoin halving event, which some enthusiasts believed would trigger a price surge. However, market experts had predicted otherwise, and it seems their forecasts were on point. The halving, which cuts the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation in half every four years, is intended to control inflation and theoretically increase scarcity over time. However, its impact on short-term price movements appears minimal. SUI Ecosystem Feels The Squeeze One cryptocurrency experiencing a particularly harsh beating is Sui (SUI), the native token of the Sui blockchain ecosystem. SUI has been on a downward trajectory for the past week, plummeting a staggering 30% from its all-time high of $2.20. This week alone, SUI has dipped as low as $1.15 before experiencing a brief uptick, only to fall again. The current price sits around $1.18, reflecting a 10% loss in the past 24 hours. SUI 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko SUI‚Äôs TVL Tumbles Adding to Sui‚Äôs woes is the significant decline in its total value locked. TVL refers to the total amount of cryptocurrency locked in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols within a particular blockchain ecosystem. Source: Defillama A high TVL indicates strong user activity and locked funds, which are seen as positive indicators for the health of the ecosystem. Unfortunately for Sui, its TVL has tumbled 30% from its record high earlier this year, currently sitting at around $535 million according to DefiLlama data. This drop in TVL suggests a decrease in user engagement and locked funds within the Sui ecosystem, mirroring the broader negative sentiment. SUIUSD trading at $1.18 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Broader Market Correction Or Underlying Issues? The current market slump isn‚Äôt limited to Sui or even Bitcoin. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Curve DAO have also seen losses ranging from 4% to 6% over the past week. This suggests a broader market correction rather than an issue specific to Sui.

Prominent Bitcoin investor Armando Pantoja has thrown down the gauntlet, predicting a price surge for SHIB, potentially reaching $0.001 by the end of 2025. This ambitious target has reignited discussions about SHIB‚Äôs potential and its ability to carve a niche beyond its meme-coin origins. Related Reading: Stellar The New Star: XLM On Tear As Analyst Predicts $0.47 Price Target SHIB‚Äôs past is a story of remarkable growth. In 2021, the meme coin defied expectations, experiencing a meteoric rise of over 800,000%. This phenomenal journey minted crypto millionaires and captured the imagination of retail investors. However, unlike established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, SHIB‚Äôs initial value proposition was primarily driven by its meme status and community enthusiasm.

Recognizing the need for more than just viral appeal, the Shiba Inu team has been actively developing its ecosystem. A central initiative in this effort is the upcoming Shibarium hardfork, scheduled for launch on May 2nd. This upgrade aims to introduce Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution designed to address scalability concerns and enhance user experience. Shibarium: A Potential Ethereum Killer? The potential impact of Shibarium is drawing comparisons to the highly anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has long grappled with scalability issues, leading to high transaction fees and network congestion. Ethereum 2.0 promises to address these challenges by transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, offering faster processing times and lower fees. However, its development has faced delays, leaving a gap in the market for user-friendly alternatives. SHIB market cap currently at $15 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Shibarium‚Äôs success could position SHIB as a more attractive option for developers seeking to build decentralized applications (dApps). By offering faster and cheaper transactions, Shibarium could potentially lure developers away from Ethereum, especially those focused on projects requiring frequent interactions and lower costs. This scenario could mirror the way Ethereum itself disrupted the dominance of Bitcoin in the early days of decentralized finance (DeFi). üßµ 1/ SHIBARMY, we are on the brink of a transformative upgrade for Shibarium. Through an upcoming hard fork expected to go live on May 2nd, we‚Äôre introducing a suite of new features designed to enhance user experience and empower our community of innovators and developers. ‚Äî Shib (@Shibtoken) April 25, 2024 A Major Obstacle Despite the optimism surrounding Shibarium, reaching $0.001 by 2025 remains a significant hurdle. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and unforeseen events can drastically impact prices. Widespread adoption of Shibarium is crucial for long-term growth, and its success hinges on attracting developers and users to build a robust ecosystem. As of the time of publication, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002459, indicating a decrease of 9% over the previous day. For Shiba Inu to potentially reach a price higher than $0.001 this year, it needs to increase by nearly 4,000%. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Skyrockets $11 Billion As Price Jumps 17% ‚Äì Details Meanwhile, some analysts remain cautious. While acknowledging SHIB‚Äôs past gains, they point to the dominance of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and the overall market conditions.

42408365,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaIIvA,1714117497,The Key to Reviving Bitcoin Bull Run Is the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs Refunding Announcement,"U.S. Treasury‚Äôs refinancing announcement, detailing the three-month borrowing needs and the balance to be held in the Treasury General Account, is due on May 1.  The gross issuance of bonds is likely to decline for the first in two years, offering relief to markets.  Risk assets will likely rally if the TGA target is maintained at or lowered from the current $750 billion.  The past few weeks have been quite boring for crypto traders as bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has been primarily range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000.  The broader uptrend, however, could soon resume as analysts expect next week‚Äôs quarterly refinancing announcement (QRA) from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to offer relief to riskier assets.  The announcement, detailing the three-month borrowing needs of the U.S. government, has become pivotal in the post-coronavirus world of record debt, elevated inflation and interest rates. The announcement also discloses the size and duration of the bond issuance, as well as the balance to be held in the Treasury General Account (TGA).  The debt issuance plan impacts markets through the yield channel. Higher bond issuance or supply pushes down bond prices and lifts yields, the so-called risk-free rate, disincentivizing risk-taking in financial markets. Reduced issuance has the opposite effect.  In its previous announcement dated January 29, the Treasury predicted net borrowing of $202 billion in net marketable debt in the second quarter with a TGA cash balance of $750 billion. That‚Äôs down significantly from the first quarter‚Äôs net borrowing of $760 billion. Financing needs are typically lower in the second quarter as tax payments fill government coffers.  According to Saxo Bank, the upcoming QRA is likely to offer relief, with quarterly gross issuance set to decline from its peak of $7.2 trillion for the first time in two years.  ‚ÄúFactoring in upcoming bills and coupon redemptions, and the latest Treasury financing estimates, the total gross issuance of U.S. Marketable Treasury securities is projected to decline for the first time since the second quarter of 2022,‚Äù Althea Spinozzi, head of fixed income strategy, said in a QRA preview.  ‚ÄúTherefore, the big focus for markets shifts towards announcement concerning the Treasury General Account (TGA) level,"" Spinozzi added.  The TGA is the U.S. government‚Äôs operating account maintained at the Federal Reserve to collect tax revenue, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, public debt receipts and meet government payments.  The TGA is a liability on the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet and must be matched by assets. When the Treasury drains the TGA balance, money moves from the TGA account to bank accounts of individuals and businesses, boosting reserves available with commercial banks. That, in turn, boosts lending, leading to monetary easing in markets and the wider economy. An increase in the TGA balance has the opposite effect.  During the debt ceiling drama of early 2023, the Treasury drained the TGA balance as part of extraordinary measures implemented to keep the government functioning. That kept risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, in a bullish trajectory.  Per Spinozzi, risk assets will likely rally if the QRA maintains the TGA target at $750 billion or lowers it.  ‚ÄúIf the TGA is maintained at its current level of $750 billion or lower, it implies no change or the potential release of more funds into the economy, providing a boost to economic activity. This might lead to bullish sentiment in risky assets such as stocks and lower-rated corporate bonds,"" Spinozzi noted.  On the other hand, if the debt announcement matches estimates but raises the TGA target, it would mean the government intends to hold more cash. Such an outcome may not bode well for risk assets.  Arthur Hayes, a co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and the chief investment officer at Maelstrom, who predicted bitcoin's pre-halving weakness, echoed similar sentiments on X.  Hayes explained that the Treasury may stop issuing long-term Treasuries, draining the TGA balance, currently $1 trillion, or issue more short-term bills, unlocking liquidity through the RRP [reverse repurchase agreement] facility. Yellen could also combine both, leading to a liquidity deluge.  ""If any of these three options happen, expect a rally in stonks and, most importantly, a re-acceleration of the #crypto bull market,"" Hayes said.  The outstanding overnight (ON) reverse repurchase agreements represent the excess cash parked with the Federal Reserve. The balance has been drained rapidly since 2022 from over $2 trillion to under $500 billion, according to data source MacroMicro.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/26/the-key-to-reviving-bitcoin-bull-run-is-the-us-treasurys-refunding-announcement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc6fae1e113076da8c008af4d83f97936f9d449f-1474x829.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The correlation between ETF outflows and BTC‚Äôs price is weakening.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is trading above $64K in the early afternoon of East Asia‚Äôs trading day, even as outflows from bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) pick up significantly.  Market data shows that the U.S.-listed ETFs had a daily total net outflow of $217 million. This brings the total outflow so far this week to $244.49 million.  In comparison, bitcoin is up around 3.7% in the last week.  According to JPMorgan, the correlation between bitcoin ETF prices and inflows has weakened, dropping from a high of 0.84 in January to 0.60 in recent assessments. This indicates a decrease in the alignment between BTC prices and spot ETF flows, CoinDesk reported in February.  Given its size, the outflow from Grayscale‚Äôs converted bitcoin ETF (GBTC) is of particular interest to traders. Data from SoSoValue shows that since Monday, GBTC has experienced an outflow of $417 million during the last week‚Äîyet BTC prices still increased in the face of it.  Liquidation data is also fairly flat, according to GoinGlass, with $60 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours. Of this $60 million, BTC made up $13.48 million worth, and $6.17 million longs were liquidated against roughly $7 million in shorts.

26394796,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605185,1714114818,"Crypto Bull Run Set To Return Next Week, Predicts Arthur Hayes","Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, took to X to provide a detailed analysis of the US economic landscape and its potential effects on the crypto market. With a reputation for incisive commentary and a deep understanding of both traditional and digital finance, Hayes‚Äôs insights are closely watched by industry participants. Why The Crypto Bull Run Will Return As Soon As Monday In a post, Hayes noted a significant increase in the Treasury General Account (TGA), which he attributed to an influx of approximately $200 billion from tax receipts. ‚ÄúAs expected tax receipts added roughly $200bn to TGA,‚Äù Hayes stated, setting the stage for a broader discussion on potential implications for financial markets. Hayes then shifted focus to upcoming decisions by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen concerning the management of the TGA. With a tone mixing respect and sternness, he outlined several potential scenarios, each with profound implications for market liquidity. ‚ÄúForget about the May Fed meeting. The 2Q24 refunding announcement comes out next week. What games will [Janet] Yellen play, here are some options,‚Äù Hayes remarked. Related Reading: Vertex AI Price Forecast: Bitcoin Has 60% Chance Of Hitting $100,000, Key Predictions Unveiled Firstly, he suggested that by ‚Äústopping issuing treasuries by running down the TGA to zero,‚Äù Yellen could unleash a $1 trillion liquidity injection into the economy. This strategy would involve using the accumulated funds in the TGA for federal spending without issuing new debt, thus directly boosting the money supply. Secondly, Hayes speculated about ‚Äúshifting more borrowing to T-bills, which removes money from RRP,‚Äù resulting in a $400 billion liquidity boost. This maneuver would involve the Treasury opting for shorter-duration debt instruments, which typically carry lower interest rates but increase the turnover of government securities. This could potentially draw funds away from the overnight reverse repo market, where financial institutions temporarily park their excess cash. Combining these two approaches, according to Hayes, could lead to ‚Äúa $1.4 trillion injection of liquidity‚Äù if Yellen decides to both cease long-term bond issuance and ramp up the issuance of bills while depleting both TGA and RRP accounts. Hayes emphatically noted, ‚ÄúThe Fed is irrelevant, Yellen is a bad bitch, you best respect her.‚Äù This statement underscores his belief in the significant impact of Treasury actions over Federal Reserve policies in the current economic setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue Buying, Now Hold 25.16% Of All Supply Hayes predicted that these actions could lead to a bullish response in the stock market and, more crucially, a rapid acceleration in the crypto market. ‚ÄúIf any of these three options happen, expect a rally in stonks and most importantly a re-acceleration of the crypto bull market,‚Äù he explained. The implications of such fiscal strategies are significant. Increased liquidity typically diminishes the appeal of low-yield investments like bonds and encourages the pursuit of higher returns in riskier assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, a shift in market sentiment toward ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô could see substantial capital flows into the crypto space, perceived as a high-growth, albeit volatile, investment frontier. In conclusion, Hayes‚Äô analysis suggests that the coming week ‚Äì the refunding announcement comes on Monday, April 29 ‚Äì could be critical for market watchers. His perspective, drawing from deep financial expertise, points to a possible pivotal shift in US fiscal policy that could ripple through global markets. For crypto investors, these developments could signal important movements, underlining the need for vigilance and readiness to respond to new economic signals. At press time, BTC traded at $64,483.

The ‚ÄúMarket Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio‚Äù is a popular on-chain indicator that compares the market cap of Bitcoin against its realized cap. The market cap here is the usual total valuation of the asset‚Äôs circulating supply based on the current spot price. At the same time, the latter is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the asset‚Äôs value by assuming the ‚Äútrue‚Äù value of any coin in circulation is the last price at which it is transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Death Cross & TD-9 Sell Signal: Brace For Impact? Given that the last transaction of any coin would have likely been the last time it changed hands, the price at its time would act as its current cost basis. As such, the realized cap essentially sums up the cost basis of every token in the circulating supply. Therefore, one way to view the model is as a measure of the total amount of capital the investors have put into the asset. In contrast, the market cap measures the value holders are carrying. Since the MVRV ratio compares these two models, its value can tell whether Bitcoin investors hold more or less than their total initial investment. Historically, when investors have been in high profits, tops have become probable to form, as the risk of profit-taking can spike in such periods. On the other hand, a dominance of losses could lead to bottom formations as selling pressure runs out in the market. Based on these facts, Santiment has defined an ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù and ‚Äúdanger‚Äù zone model for altcoins. The chart below shows how the market currently looks from the perspective of this MVRV model. The data for the MVRV divergence for the various altcoins | Source: Santiment on X Under this model, when the MVRV divergence for any asset on some timeframe is higher than 1, the coin is considered to be inside the bullish opportunity zone. Similarly, if it is less than -1, it suggests it‚Äôs in the bearish danger zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue Buying, Now Hold 25.16% Of All Supply The chart shows that MVRV divergence for a large part of the market is in the opportunity zone right now. As the analytics firm explains, Over 85% of assets we track are in a historic opportunity zone when calculating the market value to realized value (MVRV) of wallets‚Äô collective returns over 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month cycles. Thus, if the model is to go by, now may be the time to go around altcoin shopping.

Their latest report provides valuable insights into the leading cryptocurrency‚Äôs short-, medium-, and long-term outlook. Bitcoin Price Forecasts According to Spot On Chain‚Äôs report, Bitcoin prices are expected to fluctuate between $56,000 and $70,000 during May, June, and July 2024. This projected range indicates the potential for market volatility, with a 48% probability assigned to the scenario where BTC prices may dip below $60,000. Moreover, the report advises a cautious approach, acknowledging the possibility of short-term fluctuations or corrections in the price. Related Reading: SEC Anticipated To Reject Spot Ethereum ETFs In Upcoming Decision, ETH Price Takes 5% Hit Spot On Chain‚Äôs analysis reveals a significant movement in the latter half of 2024, with a compelling 63% probability of Bitcoin reaching $100,000. This mid-term projection reflects a prevailing bullish sentiment in the market, further fueled by anticipated rate cuts after the Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs (FOMC) December 2023 meeting. These rate cuts aim to bring the federal funds rate down to 4.6% and are expected to boost demand for risk-on assets such as stocks and Bitcoin. Looking ahead to the first half of 2025, Spot On Chain‚Äôs modeling indicates a strong probability that Bitcoin will cross the $150,000 threshold. Specifically, a 42% probability is assigned to this scenario, indicating a bullish outlook for Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. What‚Äôs more, looking at the entire year of 2025, the probability of Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 rises to an eye-popping 70%. Based on historical data and patterns in previous cycles, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high approximately 6 to 12 months after the Halving event. Price Consolidation On The Horizon? Crypto analyst Retk Capital has also provided insights into the current Bitcoin price action, shedding light on key resistance levels and the potential for a consolidation phase before an anticipated parabolic upside. According to Retk Capital‚Äôs analysis, Bitcoin has consistently been rejected from the $65,600 resistance level, failing to regain it as a support level. This resistance zone has significantly impeded Bitcoin‚Äôs upward movement in recent days, as seen on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs daily BTC/USD chart below. Related Reading: HBAR Prices Crashes 35% As BlackRock Denies Any Ties To Hedera Retk Capital further highlights that Bitcoin has been witnessing downside wicks into a pool of liquidity at approximately $60,600. This occurrence has been observed over multiple weeks, indicating the presence of buyers in that price range. If Bitcoin experiences further downward movement, the analyst believes that there is a possibility that it may approach this area once again. The analyst further notes: Price dropping without context can be emotionally challenging. However, understanding that this downside is part of the consolation within a technical range-bound structure that will precede Parabolic Upside makes this experience much more comforting.

26382128,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605138,1714093228,Uniswap On Arbitrum Nears $150 Billion In Swap Volume,"Uniswap, one of the world‚Äôs largest decentralized exchanges (DEX) by total value locked (TVL), is approaching a major milestone on Arbitrum, the largest layer-2 by TVL on Ethereum. According to data from Dune Analytics¬†shared¬†by Uniswap Labs, Uniswap on Arbitrum is on the cusp of surpassing a staggering $150 billion in total swap volume. Riding The DeFi Boom As of April 25, Uniswap had facilitated over $146 billion in cumulative swap volume on Arbitrum alone. The number has gradually increased over the past three years since June 2021, when it was deployed on Arbitrum, looking at on-chain data. By August 2021, Uniswap was processing less than $5,000 in swap volume. After that, they steadily picked up momentum throughout the crypto bear run of 2022. Notably, a sharp uptick from October 2023 coincided with the start of the crypto boom that eventually propelled Ethereum to over $4,000 in Q1 2024. Related Reading: HBAR Prices Crashes 35% As BlackRock Denies Any Ties To Hedera The rising swap volume on Arbitrum reflects the increasing preference for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) solutions. As Uniswap on Arbitrum nears $150 billion, more users are increasingly turning to the popular DEX to trade, all without giving up control of their assets. The surging popularity of Uniswap on Arbitrum can be partly attributed to significantly lower transaction fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Through Arbitrum, the optimistic roll-up solution, swappers enjoy low transaction fees. They can also trade from a scalable environment secured by the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum developers recently implemented Dencun, introducing a new transaction format called ‚Äúblobs.‚Äù Because of this, layer-2 solutions can store large chunks of data off-chain, reducing the mainnet bloat. Subsequently, fees have been lowered, drastically enhancing the user experience for Arbitrum and other layer-2 users like Base and Optimism. Uniswap V4 And United States Wells Notice Following Dencun‚Äôs activation, Uniswap Labs plans to deploy v4. This iteration introduces features like Hooks that developers say will make the DEX even more efficient and flexible. The launch is set for this year. Though Uniswap V4 is huge for the DEX and DeFi as a whole, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‚Äòs decision to issue a Wells notice is a setback.

As highlighted in a recent report by Messari, Binance Smart Chain has surged in market cap, revenue, average daily active addresses, decentralized finance (DeFi), total value locked (TVL), and average daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. BNB Outperforms Bitcoin In Q1 2024 During Q1 2024, BNB Smart Chain demonstrated notable market cap growth, soaring by 89% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). It reached a market cap of $92.5 billion, securing the third position among all tokens, excluding stablecoins. Only Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed BNB in market cap. Interestingly, the report notes that BNB‚Äôs performance surpassed that of Bitcoin, which saw a 65% increase in outstanding market capitalization over the same period. Related Reading: SEC Anticipated To Reject Spot Ethereum ETFs In Upcoming Decision, ETH Price Takes 5% Hit Revenue generated by the Binance Smart Chain experienced a substantial boost in Q1. The network collected $66.8 million in revenue, marking a 70% QoQ increase. According to Messari, this surge in revenue was primarily driven by the appreciation of BNB‚Äôs price. Notably, Q1‚Äôs revenue exceeded that of any quarter in 2023. DeFi transactions, particularly gas fees, were significant in revenue contributions, accounting for 46% of the total. Despite a slight decrease in average daily transactions, BNB Smart Chain experienced a 27% year-over-year (YoY) increase, demonstrating sustained growth in network activity. Average daily active addresses surged by 26% QoQ, reaching 1.3 million. Several protocols on the BNB Smart Chain witnessed increased transaction volumes and active addresses, with Tether‚Äôs USDT and decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap leading the way. DEX Trading Volume Explodes BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs DeFi TVL, denominated in USD, experienced a 67% QoQ surge, reaching $7.2 billion. This growth positioned the Binance Smart Chain as the third-highest chain regarding DeFi TVL, denominated in USD. However, when denominated in BNB, TVL decreased slightly by 12%. This indicates that the surge in USD value was primarily driven by BNB price appreciation and capital inflows. Decentralized exchanges on the Binance Smart Chain witnessed a staggering 193% QoQ increase in average daily trading volume. The total DEX volume for Q1 reached $1.1 billion, with PancakeSwap emerging as the dominant DEX on the platform. PancakeSwap‚Äôs average daily DEX volume surged by 140% QoQ, surpassing other competitors and solidifying its position as the preferred DEX on the BNB Smart Chain. Related Reading: HBAR Prices Crashes 35% As BlackRock Denies Any Ties To Hedera Overall, Binance Smart Chain‚Äôs performance in the first quarter of 2024 showed significant growth across various parameters, reinforcing its position as an important blockchain platform. The exchange‚Äôs native token, Binance Coin, is currently trading at $607, reflecting a 2% price increase over the past 24 hours and a 10% increase over the past 7 days.
