42425941,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBrh,1406397630,The Case for Merging Mexico's Peso With Block Chain Technology,"A developing plan in Mexico to create a digital peso could demonstrate the potential of bitcoin technology to the rest of the world, if it's successful.  After all, digitizing the currency would be just one part of a greater endeavor to adopt block chain technology into what the project’s leader hopes might become a more transparent and trustful bureaucracy and democracy.  The plans could have many far-reaching implications for the country’s economic and political problems; namely, the remittances market, the tax process and the country’s unbanked population.  ""I’m sure there will be a day where many countries will have their own block chain,"" Luis Daniel Beltrán, Peso Digital head and chief executive of Microbit, told CoinDesk. ""It’s the natural evolution of trusted systems.""  Beltrán said he met with members of the Bank of México (BdM) in March to talk about the technology's potential and how they can implement it into existing government operations. José Rodriguez, partner in Mexican and Argentinan Exchange Unisend and chief executive of ALTIS: Altcoins Investment Services, was also at the meeting and is largely involved in the project.  A second meeting was held on 4th July; another is set for early September.  Lorenza Martínez Trigueros, BdM managing director of corporate payment systems and services, denied that it would take on the project in an interview with 24 Horas. However, she indicated that the proposal had been considered:  ""[We analyze how] technology can be used for other purposes such as voting or other kinds of civic involvement, as you mentioned. We are analyzing, but definitely not from the point of view of independent assets, but rather to take advantage of this technology in national currency, as the 'peso', and it is where it becomes a subject of analysis and research rather than a specific project.""  CoinDesk began seeking comment from Bank of Mexico in April, but has not received comment on the meetings.  Block chain integration  Peso Digital would be the digital version of the country’s fiat currency, using block chain technology. Instead of one block chain, three would back the digital peso, each to fulfill a different need. It would be controlled by the Mexican central bank – making block chain technology legal technology – to strengthen the country’s democracy and transparency.  Beltrán said:  “We have the opportunity to replace the trusted entities with logical and mathematical algorithms.”  The first block chain would be modeled off of bitcoin’s, allowing anonymous, transparent and irreversible transactions of the peso between two people without any intermediaries.  The second would be integrated with the BdM’s Interbanking Electronic Payment System (SPEI) – an open protocol ""large-value funds transfer system in which participants can make transfers among themselves on behalf of themselves or their customers – for a monthly service fee. Beltrán said that applying the block chain to SPEI could be the project’s most complex element.  Each digital wallet, he suggested, could be linked to users’ bank accounts or SPEI addresses. This would give the advantage of cash distribution and round-the-clock transaction availability. The level of implementation of this block chain is, perhaps, the most complex element.  The third could automate the tax process by fully integrating with the second as well as the private key and the FIEL (Firma Electrónica Avanzada), a secure and encrypted digital electronic signature.  Beltrán said:  “If the government adopts this technology and gives it a legal value they will be creating an incredible platform of efficiency and a granular democracy … we may get to a point where we no longer vote for people – we will vote for projects.”  Tax transparency  The main goal of the Peso Digital project is to implement the block chain as a resource of trust for Mexicans.  Beltrán said:  “Banco de México is already checked. We are now planning to go further with other institutions like SAT – IRS in the US – and other institutions in order to complete all our goals. […] If the digital peso succeeds and and it’s well implemented we could have an incredible transparency tool for management of resources.”  Figures from 2011 data show that of the OECD’s 34 member countries, Mexico has the lowest total tax revenue – 19.7% of GDP, compared to the US' 24% and the UK's 35.7%.  And in a report titled “Mexico: Illicit Financial Flows, Macroeconomic Imbalances, and the Underground Economy”, its authors at non-profit research and advocacy group Global Financial Integrity found that the country lost $872bn in financial flows between 1970 and 2010.  Pablo Gonzalez, CEO of Mexico-based bitcoin exchange Bitso, said that Mexican authorities have pushed to reduce cash use and increase bank transactions over the last decade, for two reasons: “as an anti-money laundering precaution and to reduce tax evasion”.  He added:  “A more robust and effective back-end infrastructure for the national currency would substantially reduce the tax evasion. Not only that, it would reduce the high costs for detecting tax evasion.”  Government corruption  Mexico is recognized domestically and abroad for its rampant government corruption. It rates 106 out of 177 countries and territories in Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index.  Government corruption has a significant impact on the structure of government expenditures, the GFI report indicated. For example: large telecommunications companies like Telmex – who controls 80% of the landline market and whose parent company América Móvil 70% of the mobile market – are likely to offer public officials better kickback opportunities than smaller, more competitive firms with lower profit margins.  The opacity regarding this kind of beneficial ownership in Mexico is what allows multinational and domestic corporations, their subsidiaries and high net worth individuals “to transfer profits abroad in order to reduce tax liability or to circumvent local tax and exchange regulations (or capital controls) in developing countries,” the GFI report said.  Gonzalez said:  “Transparency is one of the best weapons for battling corruption. The digital peso can offer full transparency in how exactly the money is being spent by the government at a low cost. Furthermore, accounting is the first step in transparency to battle corruption.”  He added that the digital peso “system” could be used for elections, passing bills through congress and other democratic purposes.  Banking and remittances  Gonzalez emphasized that with the digital peso system anyone can have access to the currency because the technology is open source.  “It would be one step closer to a truly global economy, in which you can enable people to do their own FX trading and you don’t have to have $7m in the bank to do that – the person sending two dollars will get the same rate as the person sending a million dollars.”  Bitcoin’s potential in the remittances market has been one of the more compelling cases for digital currency.  Last year, Mexico was the fourth largest receiver of remittances in the world, a Pew Research study showed. However, a World Bank report said that 57% of all municipalities in the country lack access to any bank or microfinance instituion.  Further, 98% of remittances to Mexico come from the US, but Quartz reported earlier this month that many US banks are getting out of that business, citing Bank of America as saying that it retired its cheap money transfer service to Mexico for reasons of “limited demand”, and another World Bank report that presents banks' reporting discrepancies.  Gonzalez said:  “The word ‘remittance’ is going to fade away in some years because you wont have to go through a special process to send money [...] That's the idea: you’re just transacting with somebody.”  Digital currency in Mexico  This March, the BdM issued its first statement on digital currency use via its website, in which it restricted the use of digital currencies, including bitcoin, by financial institutions regulated in Mexico, translations suggest.  Like central bank advisories issued in other countries the restrictions seemed to be more cautionary than discouraging. The BdM has remained open to bitcoin dialogue.  In the month following the warning, Mexico became the site of the Bitcoin Foundation’s third international chapter, Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto. The founders created the group to learn more about the bitcoin technology, and have since identified the main players in the bitcoin ecosystem that will help move their organisation forward.  The group has already created a broader understanding of the digital currency’s advantages for consumers, media outlets and regulators.  “What I can tell you,” said Beltrán, “is that they [the BdM] are looking to the bitcoin phenomenon very closely (more than I imagined) and they are very interested in searching and adopting the best technology and adapting it to the country.”  Méxican peso image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/26/the-case-for-merging-mexicos-peso-with-block-chain-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c666fb3738d1fb84cc3dd60fe5a76459c6f2930-1287x557.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhC1h,1406380854,Bitcoin Shop CEO: We Plan to Be a Universal Bitcoin Solution,"Charles Allen is the CEO of Bitcoin Shop, a publicly traded US bitcoin company that leverages Amazon's affiliate program to sell a wide selection of e-commerce products for bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.  Bitcoin Shop is now seeking to expand its industry goals, recently making strategic investments in key partners, including California-based bitcoin buying service expresscoin and digital currency processor GoCoin, with the goal of using e-commerce to build a universal bitcoin company.  Allen recently spoke about his company's ambitions at The North American Bitcoin Conference, held last weekend at Chicago's McCormick Place convention center. CoinDesk sat down with Allen to learn more about his company, the pressures of being public and why he believes Bitcoin Shop is the most misunderstood company in the space.  CoinDesk: You've said that Bitcoin Shop is one of the more misunderstood companies in the bitcoin industry, and that you're not simply an e-commerce play. Can you introduce us to your vision for Bitcoin Shop and its goals?  Charles Allen: Yeah, that's not what we're building. Just to give you an idea where we started, the company was founded by two engineers from NASA in June last year. We launched our initial website in September and basically realized that there are bitcoins, but nowhere to spend them. That's not a business, that's a short-term solution to a problem. No one accepts bitcoins, now there's someone to do it. That's not sustainable. I joined in January and have shifted the direction of the company.  In February, we were a lead investor in GoCoin, and we use them as a payment processor, so we now accept bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. We also just invested in expresscoin. What we want to do is use digital currency as an onramp to digital currency adoption, and the first step in that is redoing the website. Everyone was part-time until February and we haven't touched the website since going public.  We need to be able to take bitcoin out of the equation and that e-commerce model needs to be a standalone business.  No one's ever done this before [...] Conceptually you could shop from all the big-box retailers you trust and we would find you the best price and they would ship it to you.  We believe if we create a solution where we connected to all these people, there's a good reason people should shop on our site as opposed to [just] bitcoin.  Do you see Bitcoin Shop evolving to become more of a traditional e-commerce company, and less focused on bitcoin, over time?  You're still thinking about e-commerce as the core of the business, and it is now, but we want to tie all the other service offerings in. If you think about it, it doesn't make sense to have a wallet that isn't integrated with a payment processor or that isn't integrated with a merchant. It's not all tied together. You need a universal solution, then a customer can have one point of access and do all their transactions.  If you have a wallet, now you have to connect your wallet to your exchange or your payment processor. You have all these different usernames and passwords and logins, and you're building this ecosystem of different providers that you have to manage and deal with.  We believe that we can create a unified solution through partnerships, where you can do everything in one stop, where you can shop and exchange, and you could buy products, you can get bitcoin, collecting all of the pieces, but e-commerce is the onramp.  The nice thing about e-commerce: business models are unproven at bitcoin companies. If you're a wallet, how are you going to make money? Should a wallet be a free service that's offered by a company?  If you start thinking about all these pieces its very difficult to transact and work in bitcoin, because no one has come out with a very elegant solution. Coinbase has done a very good job, and the fact that they have an ACH [Automated Clearing House] relationship, so they can connect to your bank account, is a great lead, but it's not a long-term competitive advantage.  E-commerce is nice because no one is going to complain about us getting affiliate fees from the merchants we purchase from, whereas people may complain about paying for a wallet service, so a lot of the models that are being built are just untested. What is a consumer willing to pay for versus what are they not willing to pay for?  So you see Bitcoin Shop and its partner ecosystem becoming like a Coinbase, Circle-type consumer solution?  Yes, our investing in expresscoin is the step in that direction. They don't have the ACH connection, but they're connected to ATMs, they can wire money in, they have agents. But to be able to seamlessly offer that for our website is where I want to go.  We've raised just under $2m, so we're partnering with other companies in the space that we believe we can connect with to offer a seamless solution over time. Right now the core team is putting the new website out the door and once that's done we're going to work to integrate expresscoin.  Our competitive advantage today is that we're the only public company in this space.  I know you've said that an advantage to investing in Bitcoin Shop is the exposure investors get to companies like expresscoin and GoCoin. Do you see Bitcoin Shop becoming almost like an exchange-traded fund for investors?  I would say it's more like a public private equity fund or like a BT6 [equity fund]. So right now, you're right. For investors in our company, we trade anywhere from $400,000-$500,000 a day in stock. So, if you bought $10,000 worth of stock you could sell that quite easily at current volumes. When you think about for the general public, if you want to be exposed to bitcoin, you can buy bitcoin or you can buy my stock.  If you buy my stock, you get exposed to GoCoin and expresscoin, and we have an option to invest $1m in expresscoin at its current valuation. I'm not looking to be a publically traded fund; the investments I've made to date are strategic because I want to integrate with these companies.  For now, Bitcoin Shop is still an e-commerce company. How affected are you by new merchants that enter the bitcoin ecosystem? Is good merchant news for bitcoin bad for Bitcoin Shop?  I think it's a positive in that the more big merchants come on, the more people want bitcoin. I think most of the merchants coming online are doing it because it's free PR.  Dell  accepts bitcoin. I'm sure they'll talk to you or be on Bloomberg. They can be in the media to drive awareness and their customer acquisition [costs] are lower, which is great. The more adoption there is, the more its going to force regulators to make decisions.  Do you feel like Bitcoin Shop will need to rebrand in order to better communicate its goals of becoming a universal bitcoin company?  You'll notice we bought BTCS.com. That's our stock ticker, so there may be a point where we'll think about rebranding when the time is right. Right now, I think it needs to be reflective of the business model we have in place.

42425959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhCJh,1406370326,7 Dumb (and Visionary) Things People Said About the Internet,"Bitcoin is often likened to the Internet, and arguably for good reason. The currency is a new, permissionless technology, championed by a small group of computer experts that say it will change the world in ways we can’t yet even imagine. That’s just how people talked about the Internet in the early nineties.  However, as with bitcoin, the hype has been accompanied by doom-mongering and naysaying.  Here are seven smart and stupid things people said about the Internet that have relevance for how we think about bitcoin today.  Let’s start with the stupid, because, hey, they are more fun.  1) Newsweek: 'The Internet won't change anything'  ""The truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.""  Clifford Stoll’s infamous 1995 Newsweek piece might be the most myopic article ever published. The article, which you can read yourself if you’d like a laugh, takes aim at every potential use for the Internet people had suggested and dismisses it out of hand. Sound familiar?  To his credit, Stoll later, and with good grace, admitted the article was a pile of trash, saying “of my many mistakes, flubs, and howlers, few have been as public as my 1995 howler.”  But he did add something that’s worth keeping in mind when people mindlessly repeat phrases like the dogecoiners' slogan “straight to the moon”.  “At the time, I was trying to speak against the tide of futuristic commentary on how The Internet Will Solve Our Problems.”  Perhaps, though, the most interesting part of his piece is a reference to there being no trustworthy way of sending money over the Internet. Depending on your opinion of the banking system, you might say it took until 2008 to solve that problem.  2) 'What is the Internet anyway? … What do you write to it, like mail?'  The video above is an unaired segment from NBC's 'Today Show' in 1994 and exemplifies perfectly the bemusement and confusion people felt towards the Internet.  People didn’t know what it was, what they would use it for, or even how to use it (lots of people still don’t know how to use it, if we’re totally honest).  Bitcoin today is the same, much of the confusion stemming from a focus on mining in initial mainstream discussions of the technology. Instead of being seen as a platform for permissionless innovation, as this Vox video eloquently put it, it’s thought of as a get-rich-quick scheme.  No doubt, most people reading this will have heard some variation of “what is bitcoin anyway? … Do you just make money with your computer?”  3) 'I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse'  In 1995, the same year Clifford Stoll offered his analysis of the future of the Internet, Robert Metcalfe, who invented Ethernet, declared in an InfoWorld column that the Internet was totally screwed.  To be fair to Metcalfe, he did offer a list of reasons, which ironically includes, in a sense, the non-existence of bitcoin:  ˝As if to make up for the shortage of real money to finance Internet commerce, several companies have been trying to mint digital money. They have, however, failed to streamline financial activity – there are now more, not fewer, middlepersons. Therefore, transaction costs, at 50 cents each or more, remain way too high. Without efficient micropayments, there will be little Internet commerce, except, maybe, but probably not, some advertising.˝  Of course, in 1996, the Internet didn’t collapse and, in 1997, Metcalfe, admitting his error, blended a copy of his column and drank it.  4) 'The Internet, with its open, distributed structure, was designed to withstand a nuclear attack. If it can do that, it can withstand corporate America'  This is less of a stupid prediction than a poignant one, from science writer Barry Shell in 1995. As net neutrality dies in the United States, it seems that the Internet can’t in fact withstand corporate America.  A similar battle for the soul of bitcoin is going on at the moment. With 'BitLicenses' being issued in New York, centralized mining continuing to be a threat, and mainstream bitcoin businesses popping up, the idea of bitcoin as a weapon against governments and corporations is fading.  Of course, bitcoin’s proponents have varying motivations. Some see no problem with government regulation, others are at ease with corporate power, while some are continuing to build radical tools to prevent bitcoin becoming tamed.  5) 'If you change the way you make wealth, you inevitably change the way you make war'  The longer form of futurist Alvin Toffler’s 1993 quote during an interview with Wired basically predicts cyberwarfare, warning people to “think in terms of the very, very smart hacker sitting in Tehran”. Although perhaps today we would think in terms of whole teams of very smart hackers sitting in Beijing.  Although it’s not often heard, some of bitcoin’s proponents, Roger Ver for example, see bitcoin in terms of changing the way government’s make war. That is, taking control of currency away from government (specifically the US government) reduces the amount of money they have to wage war.  “If you change the way you make wealth, you inevitably change the way you make war,” was said in 1993, but it wouldn’t sound out of place in a discussion about bitcoin today.  6) 'Any future information network will help unhappy people secede, at least mentally, from institutions they do not like, much as the interstate highway system allowed the affluent to flee the cities for the suburbs and exurbs'  Few quotes describe more eloquently the glorious escapism the Internet provides than historian Edward Tenner's comments in 1994. If you don’t like the circumstances that immediately confront you, the Internet provides a connection to other worlds, ideas and communities.  Bitcoin, as originally envisioned, was escapism of a different sort: escapism from a banking system that had just catastrophically crashed. 'Be your own bank', was the clarion call to those unhappy with the current financial system.  Libertarian backers of bitcoin, unhappy with government-controlled money, see it as means of creating a new discussion about the nature of money. For them the idea of digital money, created according to algorithmic rules, forces people to 'secede mentally' from the rigid orthodoxy that money must come from government.  7) 'We have to resist media imperialism – the tendency to colonize, to define new technologies in terms of the old ... Redefine, don't repackage'  Over $250m-worth  of venture-capital funding has been thrown at various bitcoin businesses, all of which, if one were to be critical, look entirely the same as the payment and finance companies that came before.  At the extreme end, Circle is upfront about its disguising the bitcoin part of its business as completely as possible from its users.  In 1995, Barry Diller, who is Chairman of Expedia, which recently began accepting bitcoin payments for hotel bookings, warned against using the past as a model for the future when thinking about, and creating products with, new, revolutionary technologies.  “We will fall short if we impose our own familiar business models on the coming convergence. Telephones were not just telegraphs with voice. Computers weren't just calculators with keyboards. And in the future, no one will call your product 'magazines with sound and moving pictures.'”  And perhaps bitcoin isn’t just 'digital cash'.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/26/7-dumb-and-visionary-things-people-said-about-the-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da095a6a6b56a9fe4b9d6820b11a0c35f8a280be-625x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
