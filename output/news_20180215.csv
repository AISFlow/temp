Posting on the Coinbase subreddit, customers indicated that previous, legitimate withdrawals from their bank accounts were wrongly duplicated multiple times.  ""My bank account went from very comfortable to negative balance, not to mention extra $5 charges, and overdraft fees,"" wrote one user.

My landlord is not a nice person and is on my CASE and I have nothing to offer him. I am FREAKING OUT.""

An update of the post from 9:37am PST read:  ""We can confirm that the unexpected charges are originating from our payment processing network, and are related to charges from previous purchases. To the best of our knowledge, these unexpected charges are not permanent and are in the process of being refunded.

As part of the effort, Atari acquired a 15% stake in a Gibraltar-based company, Infinity Networks, Ltd and has licensed its brand to the firm. The partnership – which was previously hinted at in a December statement – will see the development of a digital entertainment platform underpinned by the so-called Atari Token. The game maker noted that its investment was ""made without cash disbursement by Atari.""  ""Our aim is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to best create value with the assets and the Atari brand,"" Atari chairman and CEO Frederic Chesnais said in a statement.  The name selection is a notable one, given that Atari had previously created an Atari Token to serve as a currency for making in-game purchases. Whether the newly-announced Atari Token will serve that purpose remains to be seen.  Additionally, Atari said that it plans to integrate cryptocurrencies via its branding partnership with Pariplay, Ltd, which offers online games using Atari games and characters as part of their design. Last week's statement also notably hints at the creation of a second token, which would be used in conjunction with the online casino plan.  ""To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites. The details of this launch of crypto-casinos will be announced soon,"" the statement (loosely translated) reads.  As might be expected, the announcement has drawn comparisons – and not entirely favorable – to Kodak, the one-time photo giant that has licensed out its brand for the creation of a KodakCoin. The project was announced in January, with plans to hold an initial coin offering at the end of that month. That token sale was later delayed, and no launch date has since been released.  As Bloomberg notes, Atari's stock price saw a noticeable jump after the announcement was made.

Christopher Giancarlo, issued before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, came days after he and Securities and Exchange Commission chief Jay Clayton testified before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on the topic of cryptocurrency oversight.  The two notably spoke to what they said were gaps in the state-by-state system for licensing cryptocurrency businesses, with Clayton suggesting at the time that ""we may be back with our friends from the U.S. Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation.""  Giancarlo told lawmakers on Thursday that federal regulation around exchanges ought to be ""carefully tailored, going on to say:  ""Any proposed Federal regulation of virtual currency platforms should be carefully tailored to the risks posed by relevant trading activity and enhancing efforts to prosecute fraud and manipulation. Appropriate Federal oversight may include: data reporting, capital requirements, cyber security standards, measures to prevent fraud and price manipulation and anti-money laundering and 'know your customer' protections.""  ""Overall, a rationalized federal framework may be more effective and efficient in ensuring the integrity of the underlying market,"" he concluded.  The comments come after Giancarlo – who arguably won over segments of the cryptocurrency community by declaring that, without bitcoin, ""there would be no distributed ledger technology"" – urged for a balanced approach to regulation when speaking before the Senate committee last week.  ""We owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm for virtual currencies, with a thoughtful and balanced response, and not a dismissive one,"" he remarked at the time.

Since the Feb. 6 low around $6,116 (as per CoinMarketCap) – a correction that saw bitcoin lose 69.5 percent of its value from the all-time high – the cryptocurrency has slowly gained altitude despite media headlines and prominent figures in finance calling the correction a bubble in collapse.  As of press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at $10,037.51, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Overall, the price of bitcoin has risen more than $500 since the day's open.  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin opened the session today at $9,477 and climbed steadily through the day, bar a brief drop around 10:00 UTC. The $10,000 mark was reached at around 17:25 UTC.  Market data indicates that price action on exchanges like GDAX saw the push above $10,000, with a notable green candle emerging.

According to Bloomberg, the investigation that is underway is focused on a firm called Optioment, which reportedly promised investors returns of up to four percent per week on bitcoin deposits through arbitrage trading. The scheme was previously discussed on the Bitcoin Talk forum last fall, which raised concerns about the pitch being made to would-be investors.  According to Die Presse, the fund ceased operating late last year and was reported to prosecutors by the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) at the end of January due to suspicions that it was a pyramid scheme.  Victims, which may include investors from Poland, Germany and several other Eastern European countries in addition to Austria, have potentially incurred losses of up to 12,000 bitcoin, or approximately $115 million dollars.  Police have identified two Austrian suspects and are in pursuit of others in Denmark, Latvia and Germany, an official told Bloomberg. That said, no arrests have yet been made during the investigation.  Scams and thefts involving cryptocurrency and blockchain have become more common as mainstream investors have looked to enter the market.

The release  , published Thursday, marks the latest investor warning from the U.S. commodities and derivatives regulator. Earlier this month, the agency put out an advisory that urged caution around investing in cryptocurrency retirement accounts.  Other regulators, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission, have also sounded the alarm on pump-and-dump schemes, particularly around initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The latest advisory focuses in part on a key avenue for cryptocurrency promotion: social media. It's a notable topic, given that major platforms such as Facebook have moved to ban advertisements for cryptocurrencies and ICOs amid a spate of such marketing pushes.  In its statement, the agency said that investors should do their research before potentially buying a cryptocurrency.  ""Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins, or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes. Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts,"" it wrote.  Describing the environment as ""old scam, new technology,"" the CFTC warned that ""same basic fraud is now occurring using little known virtual currencies and digital coins or tokens.""  The agency also detailed some of the methods by which the pump groups manipulate members to drive prices – often to the benefit of the organizers themselves.  The CFTC wrote:  ""Some pump and dumps use false news reports, typically about a famous high-tech business leader or investor who plans to pour millions of dollars into a small, lesser known virtual currency or coin. Other fake news stories have featured major retailers, banks, or credit card companies, announcing plans to partner with one virtual currency or another. Links to the phony stories are also accompanied by posts that create false urgency and tell readers to buy now.""  The CFTC also hinted that it could seek enforcement actions against those who organize such groups.  ""While its regulatory oversight authority over commodity cash markets is limited, the CFTC maintains general anti-fraud and manipulation enforcement authority over virtual currency cash markets as a commodity in interstate commerce.""

42428561,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL90vh,1518700512,Surging Litecoin Is Leading the Crypto Price Recovery,"The crypto market recovery is looking stronger by the day, and litecoin is leading the way.  As of writing, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies stands at $466 billion – its highest level since Feb. 2, and a 68 percent rise from the low of $276 billion seen on Feb. 6.  The sharp recovery could be associated with chart factors (oversold conditions) and the U.S. Senate's cautiously optimistic response to calls for stricter regulations, or it could indicate the markets have digested the negative news flow out of China and South Korea.  Either way, with bitcoin now eyeing a break above $10,000, the broad-based recovery could gain further traction.  Amid the rebound, names like litecoin, ripple, and neo have put on a good show since Feb. 6.  Litecoin (LTC), in particular, has had a stellar run in the last couple of days and is up 54 percent week-on-week. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 112.27 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $106.94 and is leading the recovery in top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  The lure of making quick money on an upcoming hard fork seems to have boosted demand for LTC, although the legitimacy of the project is under question. As of writing, LTC is seen changing hands at $227, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the impressive performance of late, LTC is reporting a 2 percent drop on a year-to-date basis.  Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token has strengthened 90 percent from the Feb. 6 low of $0.58 and now ranks second on the list of biggest gainers among the top 10. XRP was last seen trading at $1.12 – still down 51 percent from the Dec. 31 close of $2.30.  Meanwhile, neo has appreciated by 86.50 percent from Feb. 6 low of $64.88 and is the reporting 59 percent year-to-date gains – the highest in the top 10. That said, the project will likely explore the downside against bitcoin as suggested by the recent head-and-shoulders pattern.  At press time, its price was $121.

42428568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL917h,1518696039,IBM Wants You to Know Blockchain Can Go Wrong,"As enterprise blockchains inch closer to live launches, a group of cybersecurity experts within IBM is out to make sure clients take every step to keep their new investments secure.  Adewale Omoniyi, a senior managing consultant in the biometrics and cybersecurity for IBM Global Business Services, is one such professional, and on Wednesday, he sought to get the word out about his team and its mission at an event hosted by tech educator Decoded.  There, Omoniyi gave a broad overview of how his team has worked with dozens of IBM's enterprise clients, all of whom are building distributed ledgers with Hyperledger's suite of codebases.  Most notably, he discussed emerging best practices for what he sees as a coming generation of business tools that will sit on top of the technology, sparing no detail about why he believes controls must be built into smart contracts and ""on-chain"" versus ""off-chain"" design considerations.  Already, Omoniyi said he has worked on building blockchain-based cybersecurity assurance applications for use cases such as supply chain and digital identity, and what he's learned is that just because blockchains are difficult to hack, this doesn't mean they can't be compromised.  ""Fundamentally, we keep saying that blockchain isn't a panacea,"" he said, adding:  ""Security is often always an afterthought, but because of the foundational basis of the technology, there needs to be a depth of defense and building controls in every layer of the application.""  No Fort Knox  Both Omoniyi and the host of the event, Amadeus Stevenson, CTO of Decoded, mentioned several of the hacks that have happened involving the technology to date, albeit with a heavy focus on cryptocurrencies.  From Mt. Gox to The DAO hack, to the Parity frozen funds, to a BitPay executive getting phished, the session saw discussion of how many layers of complexity there are in blockchain systems, and how it would be easy to overlook one of the other.  ""There isn't a one size fits all. It's not just about using one tool, but multiple layers,"" Omoniyi said.  For instance, one of tools the IBM team uses is threat modeling, where enterprises are asked to consider who a would-be hacker would be and why they'd want to exploit the system.  On top of that, the team scans smart contracts and blockchain endpoints, applies traditional cybersecurity hygiene to this new industry, shapes key management strategies and perhaps most importantly, continues to monitor systems even after they've passed security assessments.  In conversation with CoinDesk after the event, Omoniyi said:  ""You're never going to build a Fort Knox, but [all those processes] give you a fighting chance to build better defenses.""  And, according to Omoniyi, these security discussions with enterprise clients are typically not hard conversations, since the security of their customer's data is of utmost importance. In this way, those clients are usually happy to amend their processes based on the suggestions made by the team.  ""With enterprises, we're talking about real assets, real credentials,"" Omoniyi said. ""This isn't proofs-of-concept and it's not cryptocurrencies; enterprises take [security] more seriously because they're working with really sensitive information.""  Profound use cases  Having said that, Omoniyi and his team have yet to find a serious exploit in the enterprise-grade distributed ledgers they have assessed so far. But, he admits, it's early days.  And thinking about enterprise blockchains going live, and any potential hack that could result, Omoniyi worries that if security controls aren't built into these systems now and continuously monitored, a hack could stall the huge potential blockchain provides.  Omoniyi kept bringing it back to that potential, striking an optimistic tone about the profound use cases for the tech.  He pointed to the collaboration between IBM and a handful of food suppliers, including Walmart, to test a blockchain for more quickly pinpointing the source of a food-borne illness.  Stevenson had also previously mentioned Walmart's blockchain work, saying that the employees were able to identify where a food product came from in about 2.5 seconds – down from six days before its history was tracked on a blockchain.  In this way, Omoniyi said, food suppliers could save lives by determining exactly where a tainted product came from. They can also cut down on waste, since being able to track exactly where a food product came from would mean they wouldn't have to throw out the same food products from other suppliers.  Wrapping up his excitement for the technology, Omoniyi said:  ""Change is constant. You can't fear technology.""

Named EIP 867, the proposal defines a method to better facilitate the return of lost funds on the platform.  Speaking on GitHub, the developer wrote:  ""Some EIP editors look nonchalant about legal consequences of this draft, but I have warned them, and I have no capacities to do anything more than warn them … I resign from the post of an EIP editor.""  Writing his comments yesterday, Hirai said that the EIP may be in violation of a Japanese law named the ""Unauthorized Creation of Electromagnetic Records,"" stating ""I have a doubt that, if the proposal is followed in practice, the process might constitute a crime.""  The law in question deals with cases of computer-based fraud, in particular the unlawful creation of data ""with the intent to bring about improper administration of the matters of another person,"" a legal document states.  Last week, Hirai blocked the proposal due to its failure to align with the ""ethereum philosophy,"" a requirement based on the code acceptance process, as detailed in EIP-1. The developer has since retracted those statements, writing: ""I was able to ignore my interpretation of 'the ethereum philosophy' but I cannot ignore the penal code.""  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the proposal is led by developer Dan Philfer from Musiconomi, an ICO issuer that saw 16,475 ether lost in the Parity fund freeze last year.  Philfer's proposal has sparked controversy among developers, with some urging the public to get involved with the debate. The proposal is also said to have accelerated efforts to improve the platform's process for accepting code changes.  Prior to his resignation, Hirai was one of six ethereum developers with the rights to accept software changes onto the platform.  According to data on GitHub, Hirai was prolific in this role, with 5,219 contributions in the last year – a figure that tops the sum of all other editor contributions combined.

42401104,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiXF,1518687015,"Bitcoin Looks Above $10K, But Resistance May Await","Having hit two-week highs, bitcoin is now aiming for the $10,000 mark and beyond, but further gains may be transient, the charts indicate.  Bitcoin (BTC) picked up bid yesterday following a bullish breakout on charts and rose above $9,000 in a convincing manner. The cryptocurrency moved higher to $9,961 today – the highest level since Feb. 1, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of writing, BTC is up more than 60 percent from the Feb. 6 low below $6,000. Furthermore, in the last 24 hours, BTC has appreciated by nearly 12 percent.  The price rise should put to rest the fears that bitcoin may take a beating or move in a sideways manner during the Chinese holiday lull. Besides, as discussed yesterday, February has been a good month for bitcoin since 2015.  Still, the chart analysis suggests that a continued rally above $10,000 may not have legs.  Meanwhile, the broader markets are also solidly bid, currently. Litecoin has appreciated by 28 percent in the last 24 hours and is the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Meanwhile, ethereum's ether token, Ripple's XRP, Stellar and NEO are up at least 8 percent each.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC has moved above the resistance at $9,181.48 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from record highs).  Momentum studies: 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  The relative strength index (RSI) is on the rise, indicating a potential for a further rally in prices.  So, BTC looks set to test $10,000 and may extend gains to $11,000 as suggested by the inverse head and shoulders breakout.  However, gains above $10,000 are to be viewed with caution, the weekly chart indicates.  Weekly chart  View  While a rally to $11,000 is likely, the sustainability of gains above the $10,000 mark is under question.

42401097,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiPN,1518685239,Bitcoin Isn't the Only Crypto Adding Lightning Tech Now,"Lightning is spreading across the cryptocurrency landscape.  Originally designed  for use on bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market size was also the first to implement the concept, touted as a way to make transactions faster and cheaper by moving them to a layer above the blockchain. But with scalability emerging as a pressing issue across the industry, developers of other cryptocurrencies aren't letting the once-novel idea go to waste.  Entering 2018, litecoin, zcash, ethereum and ripple are just a few of the many cryptocurrencies planning to implement or test some form of the lightning network.  Known as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold,"" it's perhaps not a surprise that litecoin is one of the furthest along, working closely with startup Lightning Labs to launch its version at the same time as bitcoin's.  But others are close behind, with developers taking formal steps to add the concept to their outlooks. The most recent project to embrace the idea is stellar, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, which added lightning to its 2018 roadmap in January.  And its developers there see a similar potential in unlocking lightning's advances.  Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin, who's leading development of stellar's lightning network, went so far as to call the tech a necessity for any platform that would like to remain efficient for payments.  Rubin told CoinDesk:  ""Lightning is perhaps the most important protocol innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space right now. When bitcoin's lightning network comes online fully, any community not preparing scalable off-chain solutions is going to get left in the payments dust.""  Like lightning  That said, not all blockchain projects are interested in lightning exactly as its described for bitcoin.  For instance, ethereum developers are working on an off-chain scaling technology called raiden, while neo has its own version called trinity. While working from different code, both projects take the same concept, seeking to create a top-level network with which users can move transactions.  Other crypto networks simply recognize that a lighting-like system will be needed to scale in the future, although they don't have time to focus on actual implementations right now.  Several cryptographers working on the privacy-minded cryptocurrency zcash, as an example, have proposed BOLT, a new type of lightning-style micropayments tech that also preserves the network's anonymity. And project developers have hinted the technology is being worked on, even though it's not clear when it will launch.  Likewise, monero, another privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, also plans to add a second-layer scaling technology, although its developers say getting its core privacy tech right is a priority.  Still, there are some who believe that are trying to scale blockchains at the base layer.  Grin, which is expected to launch later this year, uses clever cryptography to construct a blockchain that eats up old, unneeded data as it grows larger, so it requires much less space in the long term. And IOTA, claims to have created a ""blockchain-less blockchain,"" which allows the system to scale (though the project has seen a fair share of skepticism).  Good to better  Yet, other developers see it as part of a multi-faceted approach to scaling, one that's perhaps best approached with a number of potential options.  Indeed, developers of some blockchain projects, such as stellar and ripple, believe their protocols are ready for scale, but are nonetheless looking at technologies similar to lightning as a kind of insurance policy.  Stellar's roadmap states specifically that the cryptocurrency doesn't need lightning, but that the tech would have a ""huge[ly] positive effect on stellar’s long-term scalability and security.""  ""Of course, unlike bitcoin, stellar doesn't need 'saving.' We're just going from a good place to an even better one,"" it reads.  Ripple CTO and Interledger co-founder Stefan Thomas argues much the same thing – saying the XRP ledger is already more scalable than bitcoin's blockchain. Still, despite the claims, it's worth noting the team is still exploring layer-two payment channel technologies in an effort to prepare for future users.  Puzzle pieces  There's even some talk about the possibilities that could be enabled when multiple lightning networks could be interconnected, though that possibility appears far off.  Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Labs, just one of a number of startups globally working on the idea, contends that, outside bitcoin and litecoin, she hasn't seen the technology adopted in ""any meaningful way.""  ""Some communities are interested in it or working on it in the early stages, but it'll take time,"" she said.  That's not to say there wouldn't be far-reaching effects if and when all these cryptocurrencies successfully absorb lightning's technology. Developers are already beginning to envision how today's dominant exchanges could be replaced with technologies that would allow users to trade various assets between blockchains, and many see connected lightning networks as a key enabler.  ""My sense is a lot of other cryptocurrencies are interested in cross-chain swaps and decentralized exchange tech,"" Stark said, adding:  ""Lightning is an obvious way to get there.""

42401089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiLR,1518678042,Cisco: Bitcoin Phishing Scam Bagged $50 Million Over 3 Years,"Security researchers at Cisco have released new information about a bitcoin phishing scam that involves websites masquerading as Blockchain.info, the popular online wallet service.  In a blog post published Wednesday, Dave Maynor and Jeremiah O'Connor detailed the Coinhoarder phishing scam, which they said Cisco has been investigating in the past six months in partnership with the Ukrainian Cyberpolice. All in all, they said that those behind the scam had netted $50 million in cryptocurrency over a three-year period.  ""The campaign was very simple and after initial setup the attackers needed only to continue purchasing Google AdWords to ensure a steady stream of victims,"" they wrote. ""This campaign targeted specific geographic regions and allowed the attackers to amass millions in revenue through the theft of cryptocurrency from victims. This campaign demonstrates just how lucrative these sorts of malicious attacks can be for cybercriminals.""  As shown in the blog, those behind the attack would create websites similar to Blockchain but with different domain names – ""block-clain.info"" and ""blockchien.info"" among them – that the casual user may not notice. They then ""leveraged Google Adwords to poison user search results in order to steal users' wallets,"" thereby directing more traffic to those pages.  Cisco traced the group's activity back to as early as 2015 and estimated that ""tens of millions of dollars"" in cryptocurrency had been stolen since that year. They indicated that as much as $50 million had been stolen, including $2 million in less than 4 weeks during one period last year.  ""What is clear from the COINHOARDER campaign is that cryptocurrency phishing via Google Adwords is a lucrative attack on users worldwide,"" the firm concluded.

42401094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiOO,1518670832,Magic Solution? 'Fellowship' of Coders Embark on Ethereum Quest,"Ethereum's world computer is in need of a magic touch.  As developers continue to clash over yet another controversial software update, some of ethereum's top minds are working together to conjure up a solution for what has been a troubling absence of late — community consensus.  Recent discussions concerning the return of lost funds — and a type of code fix that necessitates an ""irregular state change,"" or platform-wide software revision — has led to internal conflict, with developers questioning their authority to make contentious changes while appealing to the public for opinions on the matter.  Strung up in the aftermath of the Parity fund freeze, a new developer collective is seeking to better organize such debates to achieve the kind of global consensus they believe the project requires to move forward.  Led by developer Greg Colvin and the Ethereum Foundation's Jamie Pitts, the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians hopes to provide a structured working group where ethereum coders can coordinate in line with existing best practices for open-source development.  ""We're talking about, 'Gee, you know, there's many, many millions of dollars just stranded out there for no good reason that we technically could fix, and should we?' And again, we don't have the forums to come to community consensus on these things,"" Colvin told CoinDesk.  Often occurring as a result of faulty code, some developers see the return of lost funds as an obligation, while others feel that such actions could be potentially criminal — a polarization that has led to bitter infighting.  ""I think having that level of collegiality among the researchers and developers makes it easier for those conversations to take place and stay civil,"" Colvin said.  Worsening the state of the situation is that, in the case of decentralized protocols, any disagreement could lead to competing versions of the software – as occurred following the DAO hack of 2016, which led to the creation of a rivaling cryptocurrency code base called ethereum classic.  ""I think the DAO is an example of making a big move without an adequate consensus,"" Colvin said, adding:  ""The fellowship would be the community standing up and saying well, let's get ourselves organized to form consensus around these things.""  Scaling governance  To Colvin's point, the recent dispute has revealed fault lines in the platform's development process overall.  Originally proposed to simplify the process for implementing fund returns, EIP 867 was criticized by some, with EIP editor Yoichi Hirai flatly refusing to even merge the proposal at first. Hirai's decision, along with the proposal itself, has pushed the community to rethink how much changes should be implemented — with some arguing that the process is too centralized.  ""I don't want to be part of the ethereum community anymore if only one entity can singlehandedly block any proposal,"" Parity’s Afri Schoedon wrote on Twitter.  According to Colvin, such struggles hinge on how quickly the community has grown.  ""The core developers initially were a pretty small group who all knew each other,"" Colvin said. While in these early stages, technical decisions could occur more easily, at this point he said, ""It's a much larger group, it's spread all around the world.""  Having first publicized the call for participation on reddit, the fellowship is set to begin with a workshop at the upcoming ethereum community conference, EthCC, next month in Paris. From there, Colvin hopes this will expand into a dedicated council by July.  And Colvin maintains that these in-person meetings can do a lot for resolving technical conflicts that can persist online for years.  ""Sometimes you need to sit down in person and actually get to know somebody and establish a level of communication that wasn't there before,"" Colvin said.  Rough consensus  In this way, the fellowship models its structure off the Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF, an international collective of technicians devoted to the upkeep of the internet.  ""I saw the IETF is probably the most relevant example of a success in that domain,"" Colvin said. Having ""kept the internet running for many years,"" according to Colvin, the IEFT is built to cope with large numbers and does this by combining larger assemblies with smaller, more specialized groups.  ""Each group does its thing, and it would be a rare nerd who would be interested in lots of these groups,"" Colvin continued.  Like the IEFT, the fellowship's governance process advocates what is called ""rough consensus and running code,"" meaning that the dominant majority within a given discussion will be given precedence, dependent of course on its technical proficiency – the key criteria of judgement for any position held within the group.  Crucially for Colvin, the IEFT achieves this without any kind of corporate funding or any other sponsorship body that could in some way influence the activity of the collective.  Colvin summarized:  ""We don't want it to be any sort of top-down imposition on the community. It has to be a forum, a consensus building forum for the community.""  Bigger questions  By combining an open process, an informal membership structure and an emphasis on technical responsibility, Colvin hopes that the fellowship can finally provide an adequate platform for the community to resolve its more sensitive topics.  Indeed, the question of lost funds isn’t the only technical crossroads ethereum is facing today — and arguably, it's a trivial discussion compared to the changes that are due to be implemented down the line.  ""We're talking about moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, when we're still designing proof-of-stake, when it's still not totally clear it will work. We're talking about moving into sharding, with two or three different designs in flux. We're talking really big changes to the protocol,"" Colvin said.  According to him, it's crucial that the wider development community, and not just the core developers, have a voice in these fundamental changes.  ""Do we move to proof-of-stake? There's more than a small number of people who care about that and who know about that and have something to contribute,"" Colvin continued, concluding:  ""So, that's the idea, it's just an offer to the community.""

42401093,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLiNP,1518666327,The Hard Thing About Crypto Price Valuation,"Tom Goldenberg is chief technology officer at Commandiv, a combined stock and crypto trading platform providing investors with automated trade recommendations and rebalancing tools.    The New York Times economist Paul Krugman keeps bashing bitcoin. Why would you trade such a volatile asset, he asks, if it lacks fundamentals?      ""So, bitcoin just lost half its value. Where does it now stand relative to its fundamentals? Hard to say, because there aren’t any fundamentals. More than ever, this looks like a pure bubble.""              Let's take a step back. How important are fundamentals to investing? When dealing with public stocks, we have access to a broad array of company data – revenue growth, price-to-earnings ratio, etc.      From my own observation, I’ve seen that while fundamentals can be useful, they usually aren’t enough to decide which stocks to trade.      A few months ago, I saw that a trader asked the quant community on the investment-algorithm platform Quantopian to build a successful trading strategy with only fundamental data. The results were disappointing.      The resultant strategy underperformed the S&P 500 by 155 percent, prompting feedback from a moderator:      ""Purely fundamental-based strategies tend to have long predictive horizons on the factors. Their infrequent nature makes them hard to evaluate as you’d have to wait years to develop enough sample points.""              In other words, fundamentals are good, and there are surely some good strategies that use them. But many professional traders are looking beyond fundamentals to make trading decisions. So, the absence of traditional fundamentals from crypto shouldn't by itself be a deal-breaker.    Pricing data    Another way of assessing an asset's risk and potential reward is by looking at historical price data. We can do this with stocks as well as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.      A key term when it comes to assessing price data is the Sharpe ratio. This is a score of the asset's return on investment over its volatility. The goal is to maximize this value. A good Sharpe ratio should be above 1.0, usually.      Because all of the cryptocurrencies have seen such massive returns, their Sharpe ratios will also be above 1.0, generally. However, some are more volatile than others. Using the Sharpe ratio as a tipping point, we can determine what the best blend of crypto assets is for a preferred level of volatility.      This is similar to how portfolio managers determine how to divide a portfolio into buckets of U.S. equity, foreign equity, and bonds. The right blend will minimize volatility for a desired return rate.      My business partner and I performed this type of analysis on a group of crypto assets, and found target allocations for each of the assets. If you're interested in doing this, there is a pretty good explanation here.                  ""Efficient frontier"" of volatility for crypto assets      However, what we realized when we talked to more experts is that our research had some gaping holes.      For one, most cryptocurrencies don't have a very long history, meaning that the data is likely to be inconsistent.      Also, we noticed that all crypto assets were highly correlated with one another, something that was seen again in the latest crypto dip. Because of the high correlation, it would be hard to advise a particular allocation of assets.    Alternative ways of valuing crypto    Leaders in the crypto space are seeking alternative means of assessing a cryptocurrency's fundamental value.      Fred Wilson, a prominent crypto investor, says this:    ""You need to have some fundamental theory of value and then apply it rigorously.""    Some current fundamentals being proposed for crypto assets are:      Network value-to-transaction ratio (NVT) – this measures the amount of traded volume as an indicator of how actively used it is  Daily active users (alternatively, daily active addresses, or DAA) – how many users use the crypto asset in transactions on a monthly basis?  Supply-demand economics applied to crypto assets via monetary theory    Qualitative analysis    Finally, when we think about longstanding cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or newer initial coin offerings (ICOs) and altcoins, there is always qualitative assessment. This means different things for different people.      Some avid crypto traders claim that they have the key traits to look for. These can include:      Looking at the core team behind the project and assessing their suitability to solving the particular problem  Looking at the white paper behind the token or crypto asset and assessing whether the proposed problem and solution make sense  Seeing how other blockchain enthusiasts speak about the project, including crypto experts      Ultimately, these are not foolproof, though. Some crypto influencers have started offering ""white paper as a service"" to companies, and many shill endorsements in exchange for some kickback.      My partner and I were even approached by someone who thought we should do an ICO. In his explanation, he explained how to present all of these aspects in the right way. Then he closed, ""The blockchain part is not that hard. I can show you info."" Caveat emptor.
