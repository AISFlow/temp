This comes on the heels of the Binance listing , which sent the asset on an uphill climb. Thena claims to be an innovative decentralized liquidity layer deployed on the BNB network and has garnered steam this week. The trader used 698 BNB worth approximately $429K to purchase 416,897 $THE. As a result of the price rally, the asset soared in value to over $1 million, making the trader net a whopping $596K. This 196% growth in a short period sparked positive conversations within the community on the state of bull cycles. Crypto users pointed to the importance of alerts for centralized exchange listings to stay ahead of others in the market. Recently, the industry has recorded several token moves, resulting in high profits. Meme coins make up most of these assets due to their high volatility and community traction upon launch. Binance Listing Sends $THE To Impressive Heights Binance listings were at the center of the surge, and profits were made by several traders. Within 24 hours, the asset surged to a $233 million market cap as bulls set gaze for gains. The exchange also announced airdrops for users interacting with the Simple Earn product. Analysts posit that the listings will enable the asset to reach its potential, achieving a wider adoption with a better shot at strategic partnerships. X user @cryptokaduna wrote: “ Yesterday CZ tweeted: “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting “a little” weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain. Then Binance listed $THE (a project on BSC). Will they continue to list more real applications on BSC? It seems like people are betting on $NMT.” Crypto Bulls Maintain Pressure Despite the price correction recorded earlier this week, a bullish presence in the market has taken the prices of assets upwards. This trajectory has seen Bitcoin price hit $96,470, a 5% rise in the last 24 hours. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana gained 9% and 4.4% respectively with ETF flows notching high spikes.

Bitcoin dominance, which measures the market capitalization of Bitcoin influence in the cryptocurrency market, has dropped to 56% or shrunk from 60% in the past month, according to the data from TradingView . Analysts also projected that Bitcoin seems to dip below its long-standing support trend line, which refers to the key technical levels that record Bitcoin domination falling below a certain threshold. “Bitcoin dominance looks so ready to break down through its multi-year support trend line,” analyst says on his X post on Dec. 02. Ethereum domination also falls into 12.9% of the domination level, following the Bitcoin shrink. At the same time, the other’s crypto domination has surged to 31.5% or an increase from 28.1% in the past month. The drop in biggest crypto dominance has significantly brought market sentiment, which indicates that the Altcoin season, also known as Altseason, is in here, an analyst says . It is indicated by the dominations that have broken 2-year support. Altseason is a market situation in which Altcoins surged higher than Bitcoin as a prominent crypto in the world, as one of them indicated by Bitcoin’s drop in dominance.

37110221,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98208,1733097184,Cross-border Transactions Need More Non-USD Stablecoins: Report,"A new report suggests the low rate of non-USD-backed stablecoins is affecting wider digital asset adoption. Global trade has been a recurring bison for the crypto market but has performed poorly over the years due to regulatory and industry-related factors. The report, “From Digital Currency to Legal Tender: The Role of Regulated Stablecoins in Driving Real-World Payments,” drafted by Quinlan & Associates and IDA, shows limitations in present stablecoin utility, a possible pathway to asset adoption, and regulations. Per the release, stablecoins can transform cross-border payments and domestic trade through speed and security. Another major factor for stablecoin adoption is the ability to process transactions within 24 hours and make it more efficient. Several countries have also tried to make their stablecoin replica in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) backed with local assets. “ In the case of domestic payments, users can leverage programmable features to set self-executed scheduled top-ups, conditioned payments, and instant settlements. For cross-border payments, stablecoins can support faster, cheaper, and more transparent user experiences. In these two realms, stablecoins will play a critical role in supporting Hong Kong’s ambition to become a leading global Web3 hub.” Non-USD Stablecoin Can Raise Adoption At the moment, stablecoins account for 0.02% of global trades, a low figure compared to the level projected by maker participants. Two major reasons for this are regulation and the absence of non-USD stablecoins. According to the report, 83% of countries globally are not using USD as their main or substitute currency. Although USD remains the most popular asset, about 40% of global trade is in non-USD currencies creating a need for similar stablecoins. The absence of this creates scarcity in the market that could easily be filled boosting the total industry’s numbers. Lack of Regulation Stalls Adoption The stablecoin market cap stands at $200 billion, with USD-based assets making up the majority. Another factor responsible for the slow adoption is regulation. At the moment, some countries have yet to pass comprehensive crypto laws, creating a vacuum. This leads to regulatory uncertainty, plunging investor sentiments as they avoid such markets. The report states that 81% of global merchants cite the lack of proper regulations as a major barrier to the adoption of stablecoins. Adding to the complexities are frequent lawsuits filed by regulators due to an absence of rules. A notable example is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach in the last two years.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cross-border-transactions-need-more-non-usd-stablecoins-report/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This puts Pump.fun’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) at $1.5 billion. Token Launch and New Trading Features The stake can be purchased on SecondLane’s web app and through its Telegram channel, where new offerings are regularly announced. Pump.fun, which has yet to launch a native token, is a Solana-based platform built around the meme coin trading frenzy. It has attracted a significant user base and boasts considerable transaction volume. According to DefiLlama data , Pump.fun is currently the eighth highest-earning blockchain protocol, just below key players such as Circle and Uniswap. Over the past 30 days, it has generated $86 million in fees, and its cumulative fee revenue exceeds $225 million. PitchBook shows that it has also raised funds from notable investors, including Alliance DAO, Big Brain Holdings, and 6th Man Ventures. In October 2024, the Pump.fun team hinted at a future token launch, although they did not provide a specific timeline for the event. They also shared plans for an upgraded trading terminal called “Pump Advance,” which is expected to introduce mini-charts, data on top holders, and social indicators to help traders navigate the increasingly crowded meme coin market. Incentives Amidst High Token Failure Rate Despite its popularity, Pump.fun is facing quite a few challenges. Data from Dune Analytics shows that about 98% of meme coins listed on the platform have failed. To address this, the team behind the project introduced an $80 incentive in August 2024 to encourage token creators to complete the bonding curve and successfully list their tokens on Raydium. The platform has also slashed its token launch fee from $2 to zero. The platform was also recently forced to press pause on its livestream feature following increased cases of inappropriate content. Some users had resorted to streaming acts of self-harm, threats of self-harm, or other disturbing or violent acts to pump their tokens. Meme coins, which are Pump.fun’s bread and butter have also caused mixed reactions within the crypto community. Prominent figures like former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have criticized the growing number of these assets, suggesting that developers should focus on creating more useful blockchain applications. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also called for crypto builders to stop copying and pasting meme coins and instead make them into more exciting blockchain games.

Van Code has an interesting take on the transaction, attributing this activity to institutional investors. A very larger order of 2.1M #XRP just executed on #Binance . These are not whales. They are institutions buying. pic.twitter.com/hdR7x0Dl5P — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 1, 2024 This sentiment comes as XRP reaches a major milestone, recently crossing the $2 price point for the first time since 2018. The price movement reflects heightened interest in XRP, particularly as institutional players begin to recognize its potential as both an investment and a tool for blockchain-based financial services. When asked by a community member why the institutions waited this long to invest in XRP, Van Code remarked that institutions are now stepping in due to increased regulatory clarity, stating they feel safe from potential actions by Gary Gensler and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Shifting Regulatory Landscape XRP has been smashing through milestones since Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. This rally intensified when Gensler, the SEC’s current Chair, hinted at a resignation. Gensler has led an anti-crypto war in the U.S. for years, and this caused institutions to stay away from cryptocurrencies like XRP and slowed the advancement of the U.S. crypto space. However, Trump supports the crypto market and has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Gensler has revealed that he will step down from his role on January 20, and anticipation of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies and potential crypto-friendly SEC Chair is already sending the market to new heights.

These developments show a growing appetite for XRP among institutional investors, who view it as a versatile asset with long-term potential. The institutional interest is expected to intensify as the old administration transitions out of office. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also been key in driving adoption through its blockchain-powered solutions. By partnering with financial institutions globally, Ripple is positioning XRP as a practical tool for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments. This dual utility as a trading asset and a payment solution has made XRP increasingly attractive to institutional players, and this transaction might just be the first of many as XRP rises.

With so many options on the market, it’s not always easy to figure out which projects deserve your attention. Fortunately, some cryptos have already proven their value over time. Bitcoin, as the original cryptocurrency, continues to reign supreme, holding its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.Similarly, Stellar has emerged as a powerhouse in the world of cross-border payments. However, if you’re looking to step into something with massive potential and ground-breaking technology, then Qubetics might be exactly what you’re looking for. Qubetics is currently in the presale phase, selling $TICS tokens at a low price of $0.025, with analysts predicting that the token price could reach $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. With over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5000 holders, it’s clear that the momentum around Qubetics is building, and the presale stage is quickly becoming a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who want to invest early before the price skyrockets. Qubetics: Innovation at the Forefront with the QubeQode IDE When it comes to blockchain innovation, Qubetics is taking things to the next level. One of the standout features of the project is its QubeQode IDE, a tool designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying smart contracts. For anyone who’s ever tried to create a smart contract or build a blockchain application, you know how complicated and technical the process can be. That’s where Qubetics comes in, offering an intuitive, easy-to-use platform that eliminates the complexity. Developers no longer need to be experts in blockchain code to get started with building decentralized applications—QubeQode IDE takes care of much of the heavy lifting. This can radically expand the number of people who can participate in the blockchain revolution, from solo developers to large-scale enterprise teams. But the real magic happens when you think about the real-world applications of Qubetics. Imagine businesses that need to handle secure, automated transactions but are put off by the steep learning curve of blockchain development. With QubeQode, these businesses can quickly deploy smart contracts and integrate blockchain technology into their operations. In fact, Qubetics could solve major pain points for industries such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Additionally, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet ensures that users maintain control over their own funds without the risk of third-party hacks or restrictions. As the market for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a major player in the space, offering tools that can simplify and secure the blockchain experience for everyone. Qubetics’ Presale: A Window of Opportunity for Early Investors If you’re wondering when to jump in on Qubetics, the presale stage is currently in full swing, and it’s one of the best crypto to invest in right now . As of now, Qubetics has raised over $3.9 million and sold more than 251 million tokens. The presale price is currently at $0.025 per token, which is incredibly affordable compared to the price forecasted after the mainnet launch. With analysts predicting that the price could surge to anywhere between $10-$15 per token after the mainnet goes live, the presale represents a unique chance to get in early on a project with huge growth potential. To date, more than 5300 holders have already invested in the presale, indicating strong confidence in the project and its future success. Investing in a presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before the general public gets access. But it’s not just about the potential for high returns—it’s also about timing. As Qubetics continues to build out its infrastructure and gain traction, the value of $TICS tokens is only expected to rise. With the QubeQode IDE set to launch and the mainnet coming soon, this is the perfect time to consider getting involved in Qubetics. Whether you’re an experienced crypto investor or new to the scene, Qubetics’ presale represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of a project that’s poised to reshape the blockchain landscape. Bitcoin: The King of Cryptos No discussion of the best crypto to invest in would be complete without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market. It is the digital gold of the space, widely seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Despite the volatility in the markets, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook continues to be strong. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be a reliable investment, weathering downturns and emerging stronger each time. It is the benchmark cryptocurrency, and for many, Bitcoin remains the ultimate choice for anyone looking for stability in the unpredictable world of digital assets. Stellar: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In the world of cross-border payments, Stellar is making a name for itself. The Stellar network is designed to allow quick and low-cost transfers of value across borders, which is a critical problem in today’s global economy. Whether it’s remittances, international trade, or micropayments, Stellar’s fast and cost-effective solution has garnered attention from financial institutions worldwide. With partnerships with large organizations like IBM, Stellar is cementing its place as one of the most important players in the crypto space. Its ability to streamline cross-border payments in ways traditional systems can’t make it a top contender for the best crypto to invest in. As the world continues to move toward a more digital, decentralized economy, Stellar’s potential to disrupt the financial system is only growing. Conclusion If you’re searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2024, it’s clear that both Bitcoin and Stellar offer stability and proven value. However, for those looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. With its QubeQode IDE, presale excitement, and strong analyst predictions, Qubetics is setting itself up to disrupt the blockchain industry and offer incredible returns for early investors.

The Democratic Party (DP), the largest party in the National Assembly, had threatened to thwart the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP)’s plans to postpone the launch. But the DP’s late bid to amend existing law in favor of its own proposal to instead raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders has failed. Crypto Tax Launch Delayed Yet Again Money Today reported that Park Chan-dae, the DP’s floor leader, said the party had agreed to the government’s plan. Park was speaking at a press conference at the National Assembly on December 1. DP Floor Leader Park Chan-dae, speaking about crypto tax launch plans at a press conference at the South Korean National Assembly on December 1. (Source: MBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) Park said the decision had been made “after in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets.” He agreed that “more institutional preparation” was “needed” before tax bodies started trying to tax crypto traders. This appears to echo the sentiments recently voiced by the DP leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee argued that crypto tax was not yet “systematically possible.” “We will process the government’s income tax law amendment bill to defer taxation on virtual assets at the National Assembly plenary session on December 2.” Park Chan-dae, lawmaker and DP Floor Leader It appears that the DP is making the concession so it can focus its attention on bills on the separate taxation of dividend income and the easing of inheritance tax, both of which it opposes. A South Korean crypto trader surnamed Kim told Cryptonews.com on December 1: “This whole situation about crypto tax is a complete mess. And politicians are squarely to blame for all of this. As a crypto investor, of course, I am happy not to pay tax. But this situation has been badly mishandled by the government, the opposition, and everyone else.” People Power Party Rep.

This bill proposed launching crypto tax per the existing schedule (January 2025). But the bill also proposed raising the annual threshold to 50 million won (around $36,000). This would have given crypto investors parity with stock market trading. The party reportedly claimed: “Most investors, except for a very small number of large-scale traders, will not end up being subject to taxation [under our proposal].” However, the PPP appears to have rebuffed the DP’s various attempts to force its bill through National Assembly subcommittees last week.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-solana-memecoin-will-explode-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

It is about an approach where every nuance is important: genetics, lifestyle, even the microcosm inside us. All this helps to create a treatment that works specifically for you. I wonder, how such approaches can change your health? Read on to learn about the latest advances in personalized medicine. Nanotechnology in medicine Nanomaterials have become widespread in medicine. This is understandable: the small size of the particles allows them to easily penetrate the skin and tissue. The main task of a person is to learn to control them. After all, uncontrolled nanoparticles in the human body can cause harm, not benefit. Let’s take, for example, particles of mineral dust – why not a nanomaterial? When inhaled, the particles firmly stick to the walls of the bronchi with sharp edges, causing severe lung disease. Scientists have solved this problem, learned how to model nanoparticles of the required size with specified properties. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Now nanomaterials and nano-devices are widely used in diagnostics and treatment. Their importance is hard to overestimate. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Source: iopscience.iop.org Targeted drug delivery systems have been created based on nanocapsules. Such capsules are made of a material neutral to the body, in which drugs are placed. The well-known drug ABRAXANE® for cancer treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (USA) was created according to the same principle. Nanocapsules are also used for targeted delivery of drugs for skin diseases and as part of nanogels for the transfer of stem cells. Pinpoint drug delivery reduces the toxic impact on healthy tissues, increases the effectiveness of the drug and accelerates recovery. Nanotechnology has made a real breakthrough in diagnostics. Thanks to nanoparticles, doctors can determine the disease at a lower molecular level, diagnosing the disease at the earliest stage. This is especially important for cancer. Nanoparticles are designed so that they bind to tumor biomarkers and become visible during examination. Thus, the disease is detected at the earliest stage. Nanosensors are successfully used in express tests for the early and rapid diagnosis of diabetes, heart attack and infectious diseases.

Holography is the process of recording and restoring three-dimensional images that are effectively used in minimally invasive surgeries and detailed examination of internal organs. This technology allows you to create and visualize volumetric holograms in space. One of the developers of such methods is RealView Imaging, an Israeli startup that develops applications for medical imaging. The system allows you to create online interactive three-dimensional images based on angiography and ultrasound data. RealView Imaging technology receives ultrasound, CT or MRI data and reconstructs this data in three-dimensional space, creating a hologram that a specialist can work with. Holographic technologies are successfully used in volumetric surgery . They reduce the rehabilitation period after interventions, improve the quality of treatment and the effectiveness of procedures. Virtual reality Due to the effect of full immersion, metaverses create the feeling that everything is happening in reality – this is exactly what is needed for medicine. Source: ourmetaversetimes.com The emergence of #metaverses can take medical practice to a new level. Telemedicine is one of the most promising areas for the use of virtual reality technologies, where extended consultations can be carried out. Metaverses are able to create the impression of reality due to the effect of deep immersion, which makes them ideal for such purposes. Doctors and patients can meet in a virtual office, using digital doubles for diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) by Lado Okhotnikov for medicine and healthy lifestyle Lado Okhotnikov, CEO of Holiversе, the creator of the #Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) metaverse did not stop at creating virtual reality. The company develops unique DNA-based avatars — digital models created by analyzing the human genome. The process begins with obtaining a sample of the user’s genetic material. This is usually done by swabbing the inside of the cheek. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. The lab sequences the entire genome. The genome consists of 3.5 billion base pairs, which represent the code for #DNA. This data is analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithms to compare the user’s unique genetic profile with databases of how the human body works at a molecular level. This reveals individual characteristics of the user, including their metabolism, potential susceptibility to various diseases, and even aging patterns. This information is used in conjunction with photos provided by the user to create a personalized digital avatar. A digital avatar is a mathematical model with many variables that predict how the body will respond to various life conditions, including diet, exercise, supplements, and medical interventions. The avatar will also be able to display changes in the user’s appearance over time, taking into account the impact of lifestyle on aging and health. Lado Okhotnikov continues to explore the possibilities of the virtual world in interaction with reality. He believes that investments in this area will benefit humanity: the technology for creating digital avatars will help avoid fatal errors during clinical drug trials and surgical interventions. According to him, these avatars are designed, among other things, to help the user better understand their body and make the right decision about treatment. Fundamental Surgery by FundamentalVR for surgical modeling and training An example of a successful combination of virtual and real is the Fundamental Surgery platform from the British company FundamentalVR, which specializes in VR technologies. The platform allows you to perform various operations in a safe environment, using haptic system and interactive elements. This helps surgeons improve their skills and prepare for real operating conditions without risk to patients. The company provides training and support to doctors in more than 30 countries. Fundamental Surgery allows doctors from all over the world to meet, consult patients, teach and learn new medical technologies. Brain — computer interface Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology developed at the beginning of the 21st century, which has received a new impetus for development along with #VR, #AI and other computer technologies. BCI allows you to control electronic devices with your thoughts. This field of science explores the possibilities of direct communication between the human brain and external devices, such as computers, robots and medical equipment. The development of this technology will open up new opportunities in medicine, entertainment and everyday life, providing people with alternative ways of interacting with the world around them. This tool is especially promising for people with disabilities. With the help of thought, people will be able to control objects, devices and communicate with other people. Health and longevity are one of the main priorities of our society. We have considered only a small part of the technologies that will help a person to prevent and treat diseases. But we must not forget that technologies are just tools in the hands of a person and they must be treated wisely and responsibly.

Last around $97,800, Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic that the world’s largest crypto may be about to vault above $100,000. The macro backdrop remains unbelievably strong for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and the incoming Republican-held Congress, are expected to herald in a new era of pro-crypto policy in the US, including the possibility of the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve . Institutions are racing to accumulate, as seen in the massive Bitcoin ETF inflows since the election. And more companies may soon follow Microstrategy’s lead. The largest corporate holder of BTC’s executive chairman of Microsoft Michael Saylor gave a short presentation on the pros of adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy to Microsoft’s board on Sunday. Why Microsoft can't afford NOT to buy #Bitcoin . Michael Saylor's 3 minute presentation FINALLY Revealed pic.twitter.com/qqQDVYepqa — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) December 1, 2024 Is Altcoin Season Officially On? Whilst all of this is great for Bitcoin, it’s arguably even better for altcoin markets, hence the recent decline in Bitcoin dominance. Altcoin markets were suppressed by a strongly anti-crypto Biden administration and SEC over the past three years. Crypto’s arch-enemy Gary Gensler will step down as SEC chair when Trump is inaugurated in January, and altcoin bulls are hoping this will herald the start of a new golden age for the US crypto industry. Whilst it remains to early to definitively say altcoin season is here – at 57%, Bitcoin dominance has only so far dropped back to its summer 2024 levels and CoinMarketCap’s altcoin index was last at 74 (75 means altcoin season) – a new alt season seems all but inevitable. XRP (XRP) has raced a staggering 322% higher in the past 30 days, adding a staggering more than $80 billion in value to cryptocurrency markets and taking the fourth largest crypto by market cap. Solana (SOL) recently hit new record highs in the $260s, Cardano (ADA) is up over 200% in 30 days, and Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing a retest of $4,000. But chart analysis suggests altcoin season could be about to accelerate, with Bitcoin dominance set to dive. X user Mikybull Crypto pointed out a pattern that Bitcoin dominance tends to remain at elevated levels until roughly 240 days after each halving, only to then dive spectacularly over the course of the next 6 or so months. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A closer look at the Bitcoin dominance chart also suggests a rising risk that the recent drop could accelerate. Bitcoin dominance has been trending higher within the confines of an upwards trend channel since mid-2023. But that trend channel is under threat of being broken imminently. If this trend line does break, chart analysis suggests a drop back towards a Bitcoin dominance percentage of 50% is likely. How Low Could Bitcoin Dominance Go? Back in January 2018, Bitcoin dominance fell as low as 35% during the first altcoin season before then bottoming out around 39% in 2021 through to late 2022 following the second altcoin season. One might assume then that altcoin season three might send Bitcoin dominance eventually as low as around 40%. Readers should understand, this isn’t to suggest that Bitcoin will do badly, only that altcoins will do better. And there are plenty of narratives to support the case for altcoin outperformance. In recent years, Bitcoin was insulated from SEC attacks and received Blackrock’s support, which culminated in the launch spot ETF launch in January. The same cannot be said for most of the rest of the altcoin market – the last few years has seen the SEC embark on a legal rampage called “regulation by enforcement” against major US crypto firms, which also saw them label dozens of major cryptos as digital securities. Admittedly, Ethereum was able to secure an ETF launch earlier this year, but initial enthusiasm was muted amid the ongoing altcoin market overhang. However, the prospect of a 180-degree shift towards pro-crypto policy has up until recently beaten down coins like XRP and ADA charging higher. All eyes are now on whether Ethereum can follow suit and break above its 2021 record highs about $1000 above current levels. Risks seem strongly tilted in favor of an upside breakout of the largest altcoin by market cap, and a further rapid decline in Bitcoin dominance. Smaller Coin to Consider As Altcoin Season Beacons Major altcoins are set to pump hard in the coming months. But the coins that will perform best are likely to be new, still relatively unknown but massively high-potential projects. There is a lot of chatter about micro-cap coins in the AI space, but traders shouldn’t overlook new meme coins . One name that has been getting a lot of attention in web3 circles in recent weeks has been Pepe Unchained (PEPU) . Pepe Unchained, an innovative meme-themed Ethereum layer-2 protocol that is busily building one of the most promising ecosystems in the crypto space, has raised over $60 million from early backers in its presale. Its huge presale success combined with rapid community growth sets up PEPU to potentially be the most explosive token launch of 2024. cryptonews.com ‘s in-house analyst Crypto Arjay outlines why the project has so much upside potential in the video below.

Three days ago, Charles Gasparino, a Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, released a tweet highlighting the potential implications of Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. New US President Equals New SEC Chairman Gasparino cited the Commission’s decision to drop the appeal once a new administration takes over, likely once Trump is in the White House. Noteworthy, the Republican politician promised to oust Gary Gensler, the current agency chairman, on his first day in office. This means the SEC would get a new chairman, a position Robinhood CLO Dan Gallagher recently rejected . In addition, Gasparino quoted former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo, who also holds the same stance. SEC Has no Case Against Ripple Popular crypto lawyer Bill Morgan responded to Gasparino’s tweet, further emphasizing the possibility of having the SEC drop the appeal. He claimed that the appeal would be dropped because “there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost,” not because of political dynamics. In his opinion, the Commission’s move with the appeal is a political motive for continuing a near-hopeless appeal. Unfortunately, Gensler’s potential dethronement, tentatively scheduled for 20 January 2025, will also erase this political motive. This is the date of the official inauguration of the new US president. These comments have sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community, and many crypto enthusiasts are still looking forward to the case’s eventual outcome. Judge Torres Rules in Partial Favor of Ripple For background on the Ripple-SEC case, Federal judge Analisa Torres differentiated between institutional and programmatic sales of XRP in July 2023. She categorized the first group as securities, while programmatic sales to retail investors were termed non-securities. As this verdict marked a partial victory for Ripple , the SEC contested it. In the meantime, trial dates for the unresolved appeals and claims in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit are scheduled for January 2025.

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle,"As Bitcoin leads the charge for crypto this cycle, with its price teasing the $100k level, many analysts offer predictions on top altcoins. One token that’s widely seen to surge in this cycle is Cardano (ADA), a popular proof-of-stake blockchain that supports dApps. If one crypto analyst is to be believed, Cardano can hit $10 in this current bull cycle. According to Lark Davis, the token’s 213% monthly surge only scratches the surface of its full potential. Cardano has been one of the top-performing digital assets in the last few weeks. With its over 200% gain in one month, Cardano’s market cap is nearing that of USDC. And for Davis, he expects that this “Ethereum killer” will reach an all-time high of $10 this cycle. Can Cardano Surge To $10? If Davis’ predictions hold, Cardano’s price will grow by 800%. The popular crypto commentator suggests that it’s never too late to invest in the asset. Davis’ assertion is based on observations that Cardano still has room for growth. BREAKING: Lark Davis says “ #Cardano ‘s getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA .” pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Davis explains that strong macroeconomic indicators back Cardano, and there’s still hype on its use cases and ecosystem. He mentioned that the attention and favorable market conditions would let the token “run real hard and real fast”. Davis expects Cardano to continue its run in the short term, and its price will hit $3.16. From this price point, the token can increase by 332%, at the back of a 1.618 Fibonacci level, with a price of $4.80. He expects more price action for Cardano, and when the Fibonacci level reaches 2.618, the token’s price can hit $7.70. Finally, Davis sees Caradno making another push to $10 behind a Fibonacci level score of 3.618. Cardano’s Market Dominance According to Davis, Cardano had 4% market dominance in the last cycle. He analyzed that the token’s market cap can increase 10x in the current market valuation, pushing its valuation to roughly $370 billion. This 10-fold increase in market valuation will be reflected in its price, pushing Cardano past the $10 level. In short, the prediction of its Fibonacci price level matches the analyst’s expectations of its market cap. Other market analysts also echo Davis’ price assessment for Cardano. For example. Dan Gambardello shared that the token can hit $5 up to $10 after consolidating above the $1 level. On-Chain Data Suggests A Cardano Surge According to on-chain data, ADA is ready for another price run. Information from CoinMarketCap tells us that the token has already exceeded Binance in terms of 24-hour volume. A surging market volume suggests increased attention and interest in the asset.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS.

37106246,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372557,1733089176,How Crypto is Changing the Mortgage Game for Low-Income Households?,"Economists at the United States Treasury analyzed IRS data from households reporting cryptocurrency holdings on their annual tax returns and found that crypto ownership nearly tripled between 2020 and 2021, the most recent year with available tax data. The areas with the highest levels of crypto exposure in 2021 also experienced significant increases in both mortgage and auto loan origination and balance figures in the following years. Crypto Gains and Larger Mortgages The report revealed that for low-income households in areas with high crypto exposure, the mortgage rate jumped from 4.1% in January 2020 to 15.4% in January 2024, almost four times higher. The average mortgage balance increased by over 150%, from almost $172K to a little over $443K, indicating that profits from crypto sales may have helped with larger down payments. Low-income households in high-crypto areas earn an average of $40,664, which results in a mortgage debt-to-income ratio of 0.53, well above the recommended 0.36 and the 0.43 required for some standard loans. The report suggests that this high ratio is concerning because it’s linked to a greater risk of default, particularly during financial crises. On the other hand, in low-crypto areas, low-income households have a much lower debt-to-income ratio of 0.19, with an average mortgage balance of $136,481 and income of $35,950. This suggests that the rise in mortgage debt in recent years may be mainly happening in high-crypto areas, which might increase financial instability. From 2020 to 2024, mortgage delinquency rates dropped across the board, particularly among low-income households. The decline in delinquency was similar across areas with high and low crypto exposure. For example, delinquency fell by 4.2% in high-crypto areas and 3.8% in low-crypto areas for low-income groups. High-crypto areas had lower delinquency rates in 2020, so the percentage drop was bigger there. For high-income households, delinquency rates showed little change. As of Q1 2024, delinquency rates are at their lowest in 15 years, around 1.7%, with no signs of “distress” in high-crypto areas. Auto Loan Debt Hits $1.6T, Crypto Areas See Largest Increases Auto loan debt has surged to over $1.6 trillion as of early 2024, with notable increases among low-income households, particularly in high-crypto exposure areas. Between 2020 and 2024, average auto loan balances for low-income households grew by 52% in high-crypto areas compared to a 38% rise in low-crypto areas. This could potentially suggest that crypto earnings or windfalls may have enabled more vehicle purchases. On the other hand, middle- and high-income households saw decreases in their average auto loan balances during the same period, though those in high-crypto areas experienced smaller declines or even slight increases. Despite these shifts in borrowing, delinquency rates on auto loans remained relatively stable for middle- and high-income groups, indicating that the rise in auto debt has not yet translated into widespread financial distress.

The enthusiasm around BTFD Coin is palpable, and it’s clear that this project is poised for greatness. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, it’s designed to engage a wide audience and encourage community involvement through various incentives like staking rewards and gaming features. In contrast, we’ll also look at established players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which have solidified their positions as top contenders in the meme coin arena. These projects have been around for a while, yet they continue to attract attention and investment, serving as alternative assets in a volatile market. Understanding their journey can provide valuable insights into what makes a meme coin successful and how new entries like BTFD Coin can learn from their strategies. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon that’s capturing the hearts and wallets of investors. With its presale hitting the ground running, BTFD Coin has sold over 10 billion coins, attracting over 1000 holders, raising more than $420,000 in the process. But what truly sets it apart? For starters, the presale is currently in its 5th stage, with the 6th stage set to unlock once 15 billion coins are sold. The current price of $0.00005 is a bargain compared to the projected presale end price of $0.0006, suggesting a 14900% ROI for early investors. What’s more, BTFD Coin has a unique Play2Earn game that encourages user engagement and offers real rewards. Imagine playing a fun game while earning coins—sounds like a win-win, right? This gamification aspect appeals particularly to younger audiences, who are increasingly drawn to interactive investment opportunities. The staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness, allowing holders to earn passive income simply by holding their coins. Community engagement is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s strategy. For instance, the project allocates 17% of its maximum supply to Rage Bull Gaming Rewards, which not only incentivises participation but also helps in building a robust community around the coin. This creates a sense of belonging, turning casual investors into dedicated supporters Cat in a Dog’s World: A New Contender Next up, we have Cat in a Dog’s World, a fresh face in the meme coin scene that’s generating buzz for its innovative approach. This project is all about breaking the norms and offering something different. It taps into the playful rivalry between cats and dogs, creating a narrative that resonates with pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike. What sets Cat in a Dog’s World apart is its community-driven ethos. It encourages holders to participate in various activities, from social media campaigns to local meet-ups, fostering a sense of camaraderie among its users. This approach not only builds a loyal following but also increases visibility in the crowded crypto market. Moreover, Cat in a Dog’s World has implemented features that allow holders to earn rewards through participation in community events and initiatives. This engagement helps to create a vibrant ecosystem where users feel valued and involved. Imagine being part of a community where your love for pets translates into tangible rewards—it’s an enticing proposition for many. As we look at the broader market, it’s clear that Cat in a Dog’s World is vying for a spot alongside the heavyweights. Its unique branding and community focus may just be the ticket to establishing itself as one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Act I: The AI Prophecy: Blending Technology with Meme Culture Lastly, let’s dive into Act I: The AI Prophecy. This project uniquely combines cutting-edge AI technology with the playful energy of meme culture. It’s an ambitious undertaking that seeks to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and engagement within the crypto space. Act I offers a distinctive proposition: it uses AI algorithms to analyse market trends and user behaviour, providing invaluable insights to its community. This not only empowers investors but also helps them make informed decisions as they navigate the often unpredictable crypto landscape.

The project also emphasises community engagement, similar to what we see with BTFD Coin and Cat in a Dog’s World. Holders are encouraged to participate in governance, influencing the direction of the project and its features.

37105976,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620788,1733088034,Lack of oversight crashed crypto once. Will Trump’s deregulation do it again?,"The last crypto crash didn’t happen because there were too many rules. It happened because there were barely any. Back in 2022, crypto giants treated the market like a game board. Risky bets, shady leverage, and zero accountability made them billions until it all fell apart. Companies like Terraform, FTX, and Celsius went down in flames, leaving ordinary investors broke. Fast forward to today. Trump’s win has the crypto industry popping champagne. Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 40%, brushing against $100,000. The market cap has jumped by over $1 trillion. The president, once a critic of crypto, is now its loudest cheerleader. He’s promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” But with promises of deregulation and industry-friendly policies, skeptics can’t help but wonder if Trump’s crypto revolution is setting the stage for another collapse. The push for less regulation The industry spent over $100 million on the election—almost half of all corporate political spending. It seems to be paying off. Reports say Trump is letting crypto insiders pick the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair and a proud crypto hater, plans to step down before Trump takes office. The president had said publicly he’d fire Gensler on day one. Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and crypto enthusiast, has joined the fight for deregulation. He took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to call for the “deletion” of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency designed to protect consumers from financial scams. According to Elon, the U.S. has “too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” His comment got cheers from crypto fans who see government oversight as the enemy of innovation. Of course, the billionaire’s influence in the crypto industry doesn’t stop with tweets. Dogecoin, the meme coin he’s championed, has skyrocketed 150% since Trump’s election victory. Why? Because “DOGE” is now shorthand for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” Elon’s new agency. Trump’s personal ties to crypto Trump’s sons are involved in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that stands to benefit from favorable regulations. Critics say this creates a conflict of interest. Trump’s policies could directly enrich his family while manipulating the market. And it’s not just his family. Crypto titans are backing Trump with both money and influence. The $100 million they funneled into the election wasn’t charity. They want a return on their investment, starting with lenient rules and friendlier regulators. If Trump delivers, it could turn the U.S. into a haven for crypto innovation—or a playground for unchecked greed. The stakes are higher now than in 2021. Back then, crypto was largely isolated from traditional finance. Its crashes didn’t get far beyond the market. That’s not the case anymore. The SEC’s recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has tethered crypto to the global financial system. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has already attracted $48 billion, drawing in hedge funds, retirement accounts, and institutional investors. This integration makes the market more vulnerable. A crypto collapse today would likely affect banks, pensions, and the global economy itself.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lack-of-oversight-crashed-crypto-once-will-trumps-deregulation-do-it-again/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37105976.jpeg

Five digital coins are poised for potential explosive growth, offering the chance for remarkable returns. This article delves into these promising assets that could deliver astonishing gains by Christmas. CYBRO Presale Soars Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million NeoBank Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge NeoBank offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final opportunity to acquire CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, time is running out to invest before the Token Generation Event (TGE), where prices are expected to skyrocket. Experts are forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%, solidifying CYBRO’s status as a transformative opportunity in the DeFi and NeoBank sectors. In addition to tokens, CYBRO introduces special Points, offering even more opportunities for investors. Holders of these Points will automatically participate in the CYBRO Airdrop, where the more Points you hold, the more tokens you will receive. CYBRO distributes up to 1 million Points weekly, which can be earned by investing in DeFi Vaults in the CYBRO app. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 80 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Blockchain Offering Speed and Customization Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that provides eco-friendly operations, low transaction fees, and high-speed processing with a capacity of 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets for tailored blockchain deployments. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that manage various functions like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by covering transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and facilitating the operation of multiple Subnets, supporting payments, staking, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Polkadot's DOT: Enhancing Blockchain Connectivity and Scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It allows value and data to be shared without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in the protocol's development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. Introducing POL: Powering the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is a utility token at the core of the Polygon network. It facilitates a range of operations and services across the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, participating in network security and consensus, and earn additional tokens based on the amount staked. POL also enables governance, giving holders the right to vote on proposals that influence the development and direction of the network. Additionally, it grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, unlocking special features and applications. With its wide array of use cases, POL plays a crucial role in the growth and functionality of the Polygon ecosystem. Conclusion In conclusion, while SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term prospects seem limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as an advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to boost earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features like generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from major crypto investors and influencers, marking it as a promising project in the current bull run.

With its impressive performance, it seems likely that the bulls will carry this rally until it reaches the $3 mark. Will the XRP Price Rally Continue? Following XRP’s latest achievement, participation from whales and investors has skyrocketed and is raising one common question – Will this rally continue, or is there a chance of a price correction in the coming days? $256M of XRP Inflow, Sell-off Incoming? The on-chain analytics firm Coinglass recently reported that amid the ongoing bull rally, whales and institutions have been consistently dumping millions of dollars worth of XRP onto exchanges. According to Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed a significant inflow of $256.30 million in the past three days. Source: Coinglass This substantial inflow suggests that whales and institutions have transferred their holdings to exchanges. In the cryptocurrency landscape, such inflows typically indicate a potential sell-off and an impending price decline. Traders Strong Bests on Long Side In addition to whale participation, traders appear more optimistic, strongly betting on long positions, as indicated by Coinglass. At press time, the XRP Long/Short ratio on the four-hour timeframe stands at 1.98, indicating a strong bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, 66.5% of top traders across exchanges hold long positions, while 33.5% hold short positions. This data indicates that, in the short term, bulls are dominating the altcoin, which could support XRP in continuing its rally toward $3. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level An analysis of these on-chain metrics suggests that bulls are currently in control, potentially supporting XRP’s price and ongoing rally. However, the activity of whales and institutions, along with the $256.30 million worth of XRP offloaded, signals a potential price correction in the coming days. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP has broken through the highly anticipated resistance level of $2. Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that it could soar to $3.15 in the coming days. However, the price could experience a minor correction or a breakout retest before the rally continues toward the $3 mark. Source: Trading View Currently, XRP is trading near $2.17 and has registered a price gain of over 15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume decreased by 14%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-2-2024-amid-256m-of-inflow/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a new interview on the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel, Mark Yusko names his top token picks, including prominent smart contract platforms Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Other digital assets on the executive’s list include XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs, meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and layer-1 blockchain Hedera ( HBAR ). “I’ve become pretty partial to Solana, I got to say it. I mean, the guys have done a good job convincing me and you know, thankfully we didn’t sell our last bag and it’s gone from $13 to $240 or whatever so it’s pretty good.” Yusko goes on to say that if he had “money to lose,” he’d bet on ADA, XRP, and HBAR as some firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world may eventually adopt the crypto assets to not get left behind. “If I had money that I was willing to lose – because I think you could literally lose it – I might actually own a little bit of [ADA, HBAR, and XRP] because… Depending on how this ‘czar’ position and all that stuff plays out, could I see a world in which, as a bridge to the future – meaning the incumbents don’t want to be displaced tomorrow – they say ‘You know what? Fine we’ll use XRP or we’ll use some Hedera thing and we’ll be crypto.'” Concluding with DOGE, Yusko says not owning the top meme token is a bet against billionaire Elon Musk. “Don’t bet against Elon, obviously. DOGE probably is not the dumbest thing in the world. I thought it was pretty dumb all the way from $0 to $60 billion so jokes on me, I’m the dumb one, but anyway, that’s probably it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The crypto space is busy, as DTX Exchange (DTX) and Cardano (ADA) show bullish signs right now. ADA has soared nearly 200% in the past month, while the phase five presale star DTX has surged over 400% so far. This rookie may close the divide between CEX and DEX forever, making experts hint at a potential 3x surge for DTX in 2025. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) also turns heads as one of the best cryptos. It also shows some green price charts, which an expert Altcoin Scholar noted. He predicts a potential new ATH for this altcoin soon. DTX Exchange rides a bullish wave with a 400% value surge Due to its great presale performance, DTX Exchange (DTX) is quickly becoming a favorite in the crypto market. This altcoin has seen a price jump of 400% so far, and the presale is still in phase five, which means more price growth will come. Furthermore, the recent listing on CoinMarketCap has exposed it to millions of new investors. The DTX token will be the main currency on the DTX Exchange – a hybrid trading platform that combines the best of CEX and DEX. Therefore, people will trade over 120K asset classes like gold and crypto coins at 1,000x leverage. With this development, people will also easily enter the $18T gold market and many more. By holding DTX, traders will get: Governance voting rights: Ability to have a say in developing the DTX Exchange. Less fees: Reduced fees for trading. Passive income: A part of the trading fee revenue earned through the platform. Currently, one DTX is worth only $0.10. However, once phase six begins, this altcoin price will reach $0.12. Additionally, DTX Exchange announced that the price may be $0.20 after a Tier-1 crypto exchange lists this token. In other words, this could be a 100% return for all those who buy it now.

According to his X post, now that this altcoin has passed $1, it will enter a consolidation and redistribution phase. Afterward, the Cardano crypto will focus on going to $5 or even $10. The technicals support this Cardano price prediction. TradingView shows that this crypto coin is valued above its 10-day EMA ($0.95) and its 20-day EMA ($0.83). Moreover, its momentum indicator sits at 0.31, which is in the buy zone and suggests that this bullish trend is continuing. Altcoin scholar: The price of Solana could surge soon Solana is among the best cryptos right now, and its value is on the rise. On the one-month chart, the Solana price surged nearly 35%, as per CoinMarketCap. At one point during that rise, it even reached a new ATH of $263. TradingView data suggests this uptrend may continue. Currently, Solana is trading above its 20-day EMA ($229) and its 30-day EMA ($219). Furthermore, the momentum indicator’s 0.83 value shows that this bullish movement will not end anytime soon. Market expert Altcoin Scholar also made a bold Solana price prediction. In a new X post, he told his followers that once it breaks past its ATH of $263, the Solana coin value could jump to $379 or even $478 in the long run. DTX Exchange vs. Cardano vs. Solana – Which altcoin could see the fastest price growth? Thanks to altcoins like DTX Exchange, Cardano, and Solana, the crypto market will have many opportunities for growth. However, experts are focusing on DTX Exchange the most. Since its market cap will be lower, DTX may need less money for its price to surge. As a result, experts predict a potential 3x pump for this altcoin in 2025.

37104982,https://thecoinrise.com/peter-brandt-warns-bitcoin-might-let-down-gen-z-investors/,1733086412,Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin Might “Let Down” Gen Z Investors,"Peter Brandt , a renowned commodity trader, has made a bold statement to young investors in the cryptocurrency space. Brandt warned young investors that Bitcoin’s future growth trajectory might not make them rich. He stated this in an X post regarding its historical bull cycles and expectations. Declining Magnitude of Bitcoin Bull Markets According to Brandt, Bitcoin’s bull cycles have “exponentially degenerated in magnitude.” He suggests that while Bitcoin has experienced significant price increases in the past, more is needed to sustain the momentum. From the chart, Brandt showed that successive bull markets have been less dramatic in terms of percentage gains. The prominent trader has implied that as Bitcoin matures, its growth potential may slow down. Some factors that trigger this include market saturation, increased adoption, or the law of diminishing returns. Is Bitcoin Still a “Road to Financial Glory?” Despite this note of caution, Brandt maintains that Bitcoin is still a “great hedge vs. fiat busts. That is, he still believes Bitcoin can serve as a way to preserve wealth, particularly during economic instability. Brandt’s post implies that Bitcoin currently functions better as a store of value than a tool for rapid wealth accumulation. He, therefore, warned Millennials and Gen Z not to see Bitcoin as a “road to financial glory” or else they might suffer disappointment. This highlights that Bitcoin’s exponential growth in the early years might have passed. Hence, younger investors need to exercise caution and not get lured by quick profit narratives. Bitcoin’s Current Market Outlook Brandt drove home his point by stating, “But, the bloom is off the rose.” The phrase indicates that Bitcoin’s initial attraction and promise as an explosive investment opportunity might have faded. Despite this alluded diminished potential, Bitcoin remains the leading digital currency in the market. As of this writing, investors and traders anticipate the coin will flip the psychological $100,000 mark. Bitcoin repeatedly tested the resistance level in November but could not breach it. Stakeholders have shifted their expectations to December as market dynamics favor the coin. Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,443.09, a 0.51% increase. On the last day of December, the coin plunged to a low of $95,819 before rebounding to its current price on the first trading day of December.

37105034,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620755,1733086241,Cate Blanchett warns AI is incredibly destructive,"Cate Blanchett expresses concern that AI could replace jobs and deepen inequality, stressing the need for careful use of AI to benefit society. She calls for thoughtful integration of technology to avoid negative impacts on humanity, with the recent Hollywood writers’ strike bringing AI into the spotlight as a real issue. Australian actress Cate Blanchett has warned about artificial intelligence (AI). While promoting her new film Rumours , a comedy about world leaders stranded in a forest, Blanchett expressed her concerns in a BBC interview. Blanchett warns AI could replace jobs and impact society Blanchett described AI as a technology that can “totally replace anyone,” stressing its ability to replicate voices, likenesses, and performances. As an actor, Blanchett’s remarks show fears that AI could take over jobs in filmmaking, customer service, and so on. But her main concern is its impact on society as a whole. “I’m less worried about my job prospects than I am about its impact on average people,” Blanchett stated. She also mentioned the vulnerable class, including pensioners and individuals working multiple jobs to survive. AI could worsen inequalities that already exist, and leave these groups behind, she added. Hollywood strike The Hollywood writers’ strike made people talk more about AI, which turned it from a theory into a real issue. Blanchett pointed out that AI can now copy voices from just a few seconds of audio and replicate as it is This strike brought attention to people’s problems with work rights and technology and made society think about how new tech could affect one’s jobs and creativity. Blanchett sees both the creative and the risks of AI. She said that sometimes new technology, like robots and driverless (automatic) cars, seems more like pointless experiments. These kinds of innovations might seem exciting to tech enthusiasts, but she questions whether these technologies are really helping ordinary people. She went on to ask if AI makes life better or just creates more problems and divides society. The entertainment industry is already feeling the effects of AI, with AI-generated scripts and realistic avatars, the line between human and machine is very thin. Blanchett worries that this could take away the human touch in storytelling. Her upcoming movie Rumours is a satirical take on world leaders facing ridiculous situations, but it also reflects real-world problems about AI. Blanchett called it “a light-hearted documentary” compared to the chaos happening in the world, showing how fiction can’t keep up with the chaos of real life. In the movie, Blanchett plays a German chancellor at a G7 summit that goes wrong. Although the characters have political themes, she makes sure they aren’t based on real politicians. The film shows how people act when they lose power and they must face who they really are, which relates to the changes in AI. Calls for careful AI integration Blanchett’s concerns are not only about entertainment, but she is also urging policymakers to think about AI and its impact on society, especially how it could worsen inequality. She asks, “What will this do to us as a species?” As AI continues to grow many jobs could be replaced by machines and there will be ethical issues. Blanchett believes society should carefully guide technological progress to ensure it benefits everyone, rather than letting it develop without our knowledge. Blanchett argues that if machines start to imitate human creativity there will be no difference between both. So, if AI can bring new opportunities, it should be used carefully and responsibly.

37104877,https://coinpaprika.com/news/base-network-thrives-without-token,1733086227,Base Network Thrives Without Token,"The Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain Base, created by Coinbase, has confirmed it will not launch its own token. Instead, the network is focused on supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and solving practical challenges, a strategy that has helped it achieve significant milestones. Jesse Pollak, Base’s lead developer, emphasized this approach in a post on November 30. He stated that the team prioritizes building tools for developers to create innovative solutions. Base’s open-source framework, adherence to open standards, and commitment to open markets are driving creativity and progress. Pollak reaffirmed there are no plans for a network-specific token, despite rumors fueled by the platform's rapid growth. Recent data highlights Base’s success without token incentives. On November 26, the network achieved a record-breaking average of 132.50 daily transactions per second (TPS), surpassing its previous peak of 106.86 TPS. Analytics platform Nansen also reported that Base reached 11.4 million transactions on November 28, marking a fiftyfold increase compared to the previous year. Base now holds the second-highest Total Value Locked ( TVL ) among Ethereum Layer-2 networks, with $12.54 billion. It trails only Arbitrum in this category. This strong performance has been attributed to Base’s thriving ecosystem, which actively supports gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like Uniswap and Aerodrome. The success of viral projects such as Clanker and Virtuals Protocol memes has further enhanced its popularity. As a Coinbase-backed initiative, Base benefits from the resources and user base of its $73 billion parent company. This connection simplifies dApp interaction and enhances scalability, making the network a leader in the Ethereum Layer-2 space. Observers note that Base’s developer-friendly environment and commitment to solving real-world issues position it as a top contender against rivals like Optimism.

37104693,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311032,1733085818,"Man Loses £75,000 To Deepfake Elon Musk Investment Scheme: Report","A man says he’s lost his entire life savings and incurred extensive debt after falling for a fraudulent investment scheme featuring celebrity deepfakes. Kitchen builder Des Healey saw a fraudulent ad on Facebook featuring money-saving expert Martin Lewis and billionaire Elon Musk promoting a non-existent Bitcoin investment strategy, BBC reports . Healey replied to the ad by filling out his contact details, and was instructed to transfer £5,000 ($6,363) into an account with digital banking app Revolut – which was the entirety of his life savings. That’s when he began speaking with someone named “Carl” who promised “profitable months” ahead. Says Healey, “To get the £5,000 back, you had to invest £10,000… I wasn’t allowed to withdraw anything until the day that he tells me I can”. The money was then transferred out of the Revolut account under the guise that it was being “invested” in the alleged Bitcoin scheme. Not realizing his money was being siphoned away forever, Healey began taking out loans from several different providers totaling £ 70,000 ($89,090), and transferred the borrowed funds into the Revolut account to invest more with the unknown man. Healey decided to get his son to listen in on one of his phone calls with “Carl.” During the phone call, Healey’s son noticed rap music was playing in the background, and began to wonder what kind of bank or call center would be doing that while speaking with customers. That was when Healey decided to go to the police and it became clear he was being scammed. It turned out that the video featuring Musk and Lewis was simply a deepfake video created by scammers. A spokesperson for Revolut told the BBC it was sorry to hear that “customers are targeted by ruthless and highly sophisticated criminals”. “Revolut works hard and invests heavily to protect our customers as best we can through our fraud prevention technologies, analyzing over half a billion transactions a month.” In a recent announcement, Revolut said that it has saved its customers from roughly $621 million in scams involving crypto and fiat currencies, but the company did not reveal how much its users had lost from the same illegal activity. “In 2023, we saved customers an estimated £475 million [or $621,880,000] in potentially fraudulent crypto and fiat transactions – we mean it when we say we take security seriously. That’s why we have protections in place, from monitoring patterns of suspicious activity to using two-factor authentication.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/sheikh-musk-shemusk-solana-memecoin-to-surge-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

XRP allows quick, borderless transactions without a central authority or bank account. Transactions are secure and can't be reversed or censored. When it launched, 100 billion XRP were created, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple to improve the currency and its network. XRP has the potential to change how money moves around the world. Its technology enables instant transfers across different currencies, making it easier to send money anywhere. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP offers faster and cheaper transactions. Ripple has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply. In the current market, XRP stands out for focusing on seamless global payments. As the crypto market evolves, coins that provide real-world solutions like XRP may become more attractive to investors. First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) A new Shiba Inu named Neiro has been adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu, the dog behind the famous Doge meme. To honor Neiro, a new cryptocurrency token called NEIRO has been launched on the Ethereum network. This is the first NEIRO token, and it's 100% owned and managed with love by its community. In the world of cryptocurrencies, community-driven tokens are making waves. NEIRO stands out by connecting to the beloved Doge legacy. With a strong community backing it, NEIRO has the potential to grow and attract more enthusiasts. In the current market, tokens that bring people together and have a story resonate well. NEIRO might just be the next big thing to watch in the crypto space. Starknet (STRK) Starknet is shaking up the Ethereum world with a fresh approach to make transactions faster and more affordable. It's a layer-2 solution that uses a special technology called ""STARK"" to handle transactions off the main Ethereum network. This means it can process lots of transactions quickly without clogging up the main network. Developers can easily build on Starknet using its own friendly programming language, Cairo. With the introduction of the STRK token, users can pay fees, participate in staking, and have a say in how the network is run. In today's market, STRK looks promising. It officially launched its own token in February 2024, stepping into a space where everyone is looking for better and cheaper ways to use blockchain. Starknet's unique method of using sequencers and provers to batch transactions makes it stand out from other coins. As more people seek efficient and cost-effective solutions, STRK could become a favorite. Compared to other tokens, its focus on speed and low costs aligns well with current trends in the crypto world. With strong backing and a team that knows the ins and outs of blockchain technology, STRK might just be the next big thing to watch. cat in a dogs world (MEW) In the crowded world of cryptocurrencies, dog-themed coins have dominated the scene. But now, MEW, the cat coin, is making a bold entrance. MEW is a feline hero ready to save the world from the swarm of dog coins. This playful approach sets MEW apart, capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts seeking something fresh and unique. Beyond its fun theme, MEW aims to bring value through innovative features and strong community engagement. With the crypto market constantly evolving, MEW offers a breath of fresh air. Its potential lies in standing out in a market filled with similar themes. While dog coins have had their time in the spotlight, MEW could be the next big thing, offering novelty and a new narrative. Investors looking for promising opportunities in the current market might find MEW attractive, especially as interest shifts towards distinctive projects. As the appetite for unique coins grows, MEW's position as ""a cat in a dog's world"" might give it the edge to capture attention and drive growth. Conclusion XRP, NEIRO, STRK, and MEW are promising, but XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth with its unique sports-meme blend, offering early adopters a community-driven, sustainable opportunity.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but has carved out its own path. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem, setting it apart from other memecoins. Ryoshi began with a quadrillion tokens, sending half to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burning of 40% of the total supply put SHIB in the spotlight. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for more than just trading. It has enabled developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens without intermediaries. Plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system show SHIB's ambition to be more than a meme. In the current market, where utility and innovation are key, SHIB's potential is intriguing. While Dogecoin remains popular as the original memecoin, SHIB's technological foundation on Ethereum could give it an edge. As the crypto market evolves, SHIB's blend of community appeal and platform capabilities makes it a coin to watch. Floki Inu (FLOKI) When Elon Musk tweeted about naming his Shiba Inu ""Floki"" in June 2021, it sparked the birth of the Floki Inu coin. But this token is more than just a meme. Now known simply as Floki, it aims to make a difference in the world. Floki is using its growing community and resources to build schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to watch in 2023, Floki is expanding its reach and influence. Floki isn't just about charity; it's creating real value for its users. With projects like the Valhalla NFT metaverse game and FlokiFi, its decentralized finance platform, Floki offers more ways to engage and benefit from the ecosystem. Partnerships with companies like NOWPayments and the introduction of the Floki Card mean that you can use FLOKI tokens for everyday transactions. By venturing into areas like NFTs, DeFi, and real-world utilities, Floki sets itself apart from other meme coins. In the current market, where utility and real-world application matter more than ever, Floki looks like a promising player to watch. Conclusion Shiba Inu and Floki Inu are still notable, but XYZVerse offers a unique sports memecoin with huge growth potential, uniting fans and aiming to become the GOAT of all memecoins.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is not just another cryptocurrency; it's a pioneering platform that has reshaped the blockchain world. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). The network's shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made it more efficient and eco-friendly. Upcoming upgrades like sharding aim to boost scalability and cut costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, powering transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking ahead, Ethereum shows promising potential. Based on past price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, experts predict ETH could reach up to $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, the yearly low is estimated at $2,700.31. Compared to other coins, Ethereum's strong dApp ecosystem and ongoing upgrades make it stand out. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance transaction efficiency, addressing scalability issues. In the current market, Ethereum's focus on decentralization and innovation makes it an attractive option for those interested in the future of blockchain technology. XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency supported by the XRP Ledger. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows quick, borderless transactions without a central authority or bank account. Transactions are secure and can't be reversed or censored.

In the current market, XRP stands out for focusing on seamless global payments. As the crypto market evolves, coins that provide real-world solutions like XRP may become more attractive to investors. Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It lays the groundwork for decentralized applications, competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its architecture designed for faster transactions. It also offers developers flexible options across multiple programming languages. At the heart of Solana's ecosystem is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL fuels transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The SOL coin holds promise due to its role in the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and grants users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some others, Solana doesn't rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale. This makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network that can handle high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL looks appealing as the demand for scalable solutions grows. With its speed and flexibility, Solana could stand out among other cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its mascot. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to produce 10,000 new coins every minute, making it abundant. What began as a fun project quickly gained a dedicated community. In 2021, Dogecoin's value skyrocketed, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap with a total value exceeding $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk, showing how online communities can impact financial markets. Dogecoin's potential lies in its strong community and widespread recognition. Its technology is based on blockchain, securing transactions like other cryptocurrencies. Its plentiful supply makes it ideal for small transactions and tipping. In the current market, Dogecoin stands out as an alternative to established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some see it as a fun entry point into crypto, while others believe in its growing acceptance. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin's journey from a meme to a mainstream player highlights the unpredictable and exciting nature of digital currencies. Conclusion ETH, XRP, SOL, and DOGE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique blend of sports and meme culture in a community-driven ecosystem with ambitious growth goals.

The move aims to address the unique role of these entities, such as gaming apps or self-hosted wallets that provide access to third-party crypto services, without subjecting them to the heavier regulations designed for crypto exchanges. Japan has been a global leader in cryptocurrency regulation since 2017, following the Mt. Gox hacks in 2011 and 2014. Its laws for crypto-asset exchange service providers (CAESPs) cover services such as buying, selling, brokering, and storing crypto assets. However, entities that act as introducers connecting users to third-party crypto services without directly handling funds often find the current regulatory requirements burdensome and inappropriate for their limited role. Last week, the FSA outlined the need for a lighter regulatory approach for these intermediaries, presenting its recommendations to the Financial System Council's Payment Services Working Group. Related News: One Trader Makes 2580x Profit on Surprise Memecoin - Here Are His Trades Under the proposed legislation, entities acting as intermediaries will be required to register, but they will face less stringent requirements than traditional exchanges. Key provisions of the framework include: Transparency Obligations: Intermediaries must provide clear and accurate information to users. Advertising Restrictions: These organizations will be subject to limitations on their promotional activities to ensure fair practices. Liability for Damages: Intermediaries may be held liable for damages suffered by users. The FSA gave the example of a gaming app or self-hosted wallet that facilitates access to third-party crypto trading services. These entities can be classified as CAESPs under current regulations even if they do not handle user funds; the FSA accepts that this requirement is too burdensome for their limited role. By considering this lighter regulatory approach, Japan aims to strike a balance between encouraging innovation in blockchain applications and ensuring consumer protection. The framework will allow intermediaries to operate with greater flexibility while maintaining accountability, potentially paving the way for wider adoption of crypto-related services in Japan. *This is not investment advice.

Speaking on CNN’s Inside Politics Sunday , Wood opened up about what she sees as the suffocating impact of current regulations. She blamed outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler for nearly knocking the U.S. off the global crypto map, saying, “The U.S. almost lost our footing in the cryptocurrency world.” Wood believes a Trump-led administration would slash regulations holding back blockchain technology and AI. She called this shift vital for the U.S. to reclaim leadership in technology, comparing the potential transformation to the early days of the internet. “A change in the regulatory system, with both crypto and AI as prime focuses, is going to be quite meaningful,” Wood said. Crypto, AI, and the regulatory reset Wood didn’t stop at crypto. She expanded her view to include robotics, energy storage, and multiomic sequencing as sectors primed for a boost under Trump. The past few years, she argued, have favored only a small handful of mega-cap companies. “In the last four years, we saw massive concentration toward very few stocks,” she explained. But with Trump at the helm, Wood predicts a broadening of market gains, especially for companies pushing the envelope on innovation. The regulatory burden, she said, has been especially damaging to crypto. Gensler’s approach to the SEC has created an environment where innovation struggles to breathe. With deregulation, Wood believes small and medium-sized businesses in emerging industries could finally have their moment. AI, another centerpiece of Wood’s outlook, has faced its own hurdles under restrictive policies. She described it as a platform that needs to be “seized and harnessed” before other countries take the lead. A Trump administration, she suggested, could prioritize this. Markets gear up for change Wood also addressed concerns about Trump’s trade policies, including his tariff threats. She acknowledged that while tariffs might sound aggressive, they “make sense” if paired with tax cuts that allow U.S. businesses to stay competitive globally. This mix, she said, could drive innovation across sectors. The markets seem to agree. Wood noted signs of a shift, with investors moving beyond the tech giants to support smaller, high-growth companies. She sees this as a sign that markets are already anticipating Trump’s impact. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has completely stolen the show, becoming the best-performing asset this year as it looks dead set on crushing past $100,000.

As such, it briefly re-entered the top 10 altcoins by market cap, but the subsequent retracement pushed it back to 11th spot after Avalanche. SHIBUSD. Source: TradingView Shiba Inu, alongside the rest of the crypto market, benefited substantially of Donald Trump’s landslide win in the November US presidential elections. It stood below $0.000017 at the time but quickly soared past $0.00003. However, it slipped in the following weeks to $0.000025, where it stood from November 12 to earlier today. In a somewhat surprising move during the weekend, the second-biggest meme coin shot up by more than 22% and soared past $0.000033 for the first time since March this year. Although it has retraced slightly, it still trades above $0.00003 and its gains on a 24-hour scale sit at 15%.

This resurgence of BTC is fueling a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out), not just for the leading cryptocurrency but also for emerging altcoins promising massive returns. Among these rising stars, one altcoin stands out, PropiChain , eyeing an incredible 44,090% rally by the next bull run. With the Bitcoin price dominance creating ripple effects across the market, this could be the perfect moment to explore untapped opportunities and maximize your crypto investments. The Bitcoin Price’s Road to $100k The Bitcoin Price is once again the centerpiece of the cryptocurrency market, with analysts predicting its rebound to the iconic $100,000 mark. After experiencing some volatility earlier this year, the king of crypto is making a strong comeback, driven by a broader crypto market recovery. The psychological allure of $100,000 is undeniable. As the Bitcoin price moves closer to this milestone, it doesn’t just attract investors; it creates a ripple effect of FOMO (fear of missing out) across altcoin markets. Everyone is rushing to secure their slice of the pie in other promising projects, especially altcoins like PropiChain , which are set for exponential growth. The entire market is watching the Bitcoin price, and the opportunities are endless. PropiChain: The Altcoin Getting Attention Amid BTC’s Rally PropiChain has become the standout pick as investors look beyond the Bitcoin price to altcoins with untapped potential. Its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization in real estate is great, particularly with features like fractional ownership, AI-driven analytics, metaverse integration, and smart contracts. These are practical solutions addressing longstanding barriers in real estate investment. Take fractional ownership, for example. Now, you can own a piece of a luxury property in New York without needing millions in capital. PropiChain’s blockchain-based system converts these properties to tokens and allows you to buy, sell, and trade them seamlessly. It’s a game-changer, especially for those looking to diversify their portfolio with tangible, income-generating assets. Also, the platform’s AI-driven analytics take the guesswork out of investing. PropiChain helps investors make informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell by analyzing market trends and property data. This is particularly appealing during the Bitcoin price surge, as investors seek to maximize returns across different asset classes. Moreover, PropiChain’s integration with the metaverse opens up a new frontier for property exploration and ownership. It allows you to tour a digital version of a property and meet with potential stakeholders before committing to buy. The endless possibilities make it a compelling choice for anyone looking to ride the wave of crypto adoption fueled by the Bitcoin price rally. PropiChain’s Presale Presents a Rare Opportunity for 44,090% Gains At just $0.004 per token in its presale stage, PropiChain offers an unparalleled opportunity for early investors to secure significant returns. The presale is structured in tiers, with prices gradually increasing as each stage fills. This means the earlier you invest, the higher your potential ROI. In perspective, a $1,000 investment at the current presale price could yield $444,090 if PropiChain achieves its projected 44,090% growth by the next major bull run. Adding to its appeal, PropiChain has undergone a robust security audit and is already listed on platforms like CoinMarketCap , signaling growing market confidence. As the Bitcoin price intensifies interest in altcoins, PropiChain’s presale is quickly gaining traction in the crypto market. Conclusion With the Bitcoin price rally sparking widespread FOMO, PropiChain stands out as the altcoin with unmatched growth potential. Its innovative features and the ongoing presale opportunity make it a must-watch for anyone looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. Don’t wait for the price to climb; secure your stake in PropiChain now and position yourself for explosive gains.

Analysts are buzzing about select assets poised for impressive growth. Investors are eager to identify these opportunities before they surge. With market momentum building, the spotlight is on altcoins that may lead the next wave of gains. Speculation grows around which tokens will outperform the rest. Among these is XYZVerse (XYZ), a memecoin targeting huge growth by blending meme culture with sports fandoms. Analysts suggest it could surpass tokens that saw thousand-percent gains. Score Big with XYZ: The New Meme Coin Heavyweight The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 14,900% growth, XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. 💰 Own the field, earn while the crowd plays 💰 XYZ is more than just a benchwarmer in the meme coin game; it’s creating the ultimate playing field with XYZVerse, where the thrill of sports meets the energy of meme culture. With a roadmap equipped with entertainment dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting options, XYZ is poised to draw in millions of gamblers ready to join the action. Remember Polymarket's massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. 💥 Missed meme coin supercycle? 💥 By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins. BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 14,900% after the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! 🥇 Rallying the community, securing the win 🥇 XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem's direction. Active contributors will receive airdropped XYZ tokens as a reward for their dedication. With rock-solid tokenomics and plans for both CEX/DEX listings, XYZ is positioned for a championship run, ensuring a steady revenue flow and consistent token burns to keep the scoreboard in favor of a strong price and a thriving community. >>The XYZ presale is live – don’t miss out on this knockout 14,900% opportunity! Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance combines the stability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain. By tokenizing income-generating assets like US Treasuries and bank deposits, it opens up access to high-quality financial products. The company has two main parts: an asset management team creating tokenized products, and a tech team building DeFi protocols. Together, they enhance the functionality and scalability of Ondo's offerings. In a volatile crypto market, Ondo stands out by partnering with trusted names like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure custody. Its commitment to transparency and compliance sets it apart. Products like USDY offer stablecoin convenience with yields from secure assets. For non-US investors seeking regulated, transparent products, Ondo is appealing. As the crypto market evolves, Ondo's blend of traditional finance and blockchain tech positions it well, especially compared to platforms lacking strong foundations. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum is making waves in the crypto world. Created by Offchain Labs, it's a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. This means it helps Ethereum work faster and smoother. By using optimistic rollups, Arbitrum boosts transaction speed and cuts costs. It also adds an extra layer of privacy. At the heart of this system is the ARB token. Holders can vote on network decisions and help shape the future of the ecosystem. With an initial supply of 10 billion tokens and a cap on yearly inflation, ARB aims for steady growth. Its distribution is spread among investors, DAOs, individual users, and a DAO Treasury. The Arbitrum DAO oversees changes, ensuring the community drives development. In today's market, where scalability is key, ARB stands out. Compared to other tokens, its focus on enhancing Ethereum's performance gives it an edge. As more projects seek faster and cheaper solutions, Arbitrum's technology could make ARB an attractive option for many. POL ex-MATIC (POL) The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is the fuel of the Polygon network. It powers various operations in this expansive ecosystem. POL holders can stake their tokens, locking them up to support network security and earning rewards in return. They also have a say in the network's future by voting on proposals, influencing development and growth. Additionally, POL unlocks exclusive services, giving access to special features and opportunities within the Polygon network. POL's potential is tied to the growth of the Polygon ecosystem. As more services and applications join, demand for POL may rise, possibly boosting its value. Compared to other tokens, POL offers multiple utilities, making it appealing in the current crypto market. With the rapid advancement of blockchain technology, tokens like POL that serve many purposes within a strong ecosystem could stand out. But as the crypto market is volatile, it's important to stay informed and consider broader trends when exploring tokens like POL. Starknet (STRK) Starknet is shaking up the Ethereum world with a fresh approach to make transactions faster and more affordable. It's a layer-2 solution that uses a special technology called ""STARK"" to handle transactions off the main Ethereum network. This means it can process lots of transactions quickly without clogging up the main network. Developers can easily build on Starknet using its own friendly programming language, Cairo. With the introduction of the STRK token, users can pay fees, participate in staking, and have a say in how the network is run. In today's market, STRK looks promising. It officially launched its own token in February 2024, stepping into a space where everyone is looking for better and cheaper ways to use blockchain. Starknet's unique method of using sequencers and provers to batch transactions makes it stand out from other coins. As more people seek efficient and cost-effective solutions, STRK could become a favorite. Compared to other tokens, its focus on speed and low costs aligns well with current trends in the crypto world. With strong backing and a team that knows the ins and outs of blockchain technology, STRK might just be the next big thing to watch. Conclusion ONDO, ARB, POL, and STRK are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans during the current bull run.

Not only that, but the coin has managed to overtake Solana as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which used to be considered this cycle’s top performer. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett marked the occasion with a post on X, saying: “Wow. Pre-lawsuit, XRP was the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. When the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, the price fell from around $0.50 to $0.17, taking out with it more than $15B in market value. While the price recovered, XRP spent the next four years at the #7 spot. It’s now risen back to the #4 spot and reached $2, up nearly 300% this month.” XRP first made its comeback after President Donald Trump’s win on November 5th, along with the rest of the crypto market. Then came SEC chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement, and the XRP Army lost it. The bears were flipped into bulls in a blink of an eye. The market has been on fire ever since. It’s only a matter of time until XRP smashes through it’s all-time high of $3.84, which was reached nearly seven years ago. Meanwhile, its case with the SEC continues. But get this, institutions are rushing to launch XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States right now, evidently undeterred.

In the process, XRP has surpassed SOL to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The entire crypto market started to chart impressive gains after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential elections nearly a month ago. At first, though, XRP was sort of sluggish and trailed behind, losing ground to other assets like DOGE. However, once rumors started to circulate that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down once Trump takes office, Ripple’s token began its mindblowing rally. It was only solidified last week when Gensler officially announced that he will vacate his position as the Chairman of the US regulator that has been in a legal battle against Ripple for roughly four years. XRP shot above $1 and kept climbing. It was stopped at $1.65 last week, but the bulls returned and pushed its price by 50% on a weekly scale. As such, the token soared to $2.09 earlier today for the first time since January 2018. XRPUSD.

Consequently, it managed to overtake several altcoins in the process, such as Binance Coin, and Solana as of minutes ago. With a market cap of $116 billion as of writing these lines, XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Next in line is Tether with $134 billion, according to CoinGecko.

During a news conference in Hong Kong last week, the crypto billionaire ate the fruit displayed in the controversial artwork by Italian visual artist and art prankster Maurizio Cattelan. Entitled Comedian, the piece consists of a fresh banana affixed to a wall by silver duct tape. The artwork, described by Cattelan as a “sincere commentary and a reflection on what we value,” drew criticism when it debuted at Art Basel Miami Beach in December 2019. Two out of three art pieces in the Comedian limited edition were purchased for $120,000 each. On November 21st, Sun bought the number two edition of Comedian from a Sotheby’s auction in New York for a much higher price: $6.24 million. According to the auction house, the winning bidder of the work will reportedly receive one banana, a roll of duct tape and a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist along with instructions for installing the piece. After getting himself filmed eating the edible artwork, Sun describes the experience and the taste of the viral banana. “Many friends have asked me about the taste of the banana. To be honest, for a banana with such a back story, the taste is naturally different from an ordinary one. I could discern a hint of what Big Mike bananas from 100 years ago might have tasted like.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37104068,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-predicts-next-trend-in-corporate-bitcoin-adoption/,1733082331,Michael Saylor Predicts Next Trend in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption,"Corporate America is at a crossroads when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) adoption. While Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s Chairman continues to champion the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset for corporations, the broader market remains hesitant. In a recent X post, he made a bold call for 60 public companies to issue equity to buy Bitcoin. This statement has raised both eyebrows and questions about the sustainability of this high-stakes gamble. MicroStrategy: The King of Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy has solidified its dominance as the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin , amassing nearly 389,000 BTC. The Virginia-based software intelligence firm has made the asset central to its identity, transforming its financial strategy in unprecedented ways. The firm’s bold approach has not only redefined its balance sheet but also set a benchmark for corporate crypto adoption. MicroStrategy’s impressive 2024 performance has sparked interest from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Following MicroStrategy are Marathon Digital and Galaxy Digital , with holdings of 34,794 and 15,449 coins respectively. Despite selling much of its Bitcoin, Tesla remains a top 10 corporate holder, showcasing its early adoption of the asset. Saylor’s Bitcoin Bet: Visionary Move or Risky Gamble? Michael Saylor has taken a daring approach by making Bitcoin central to the company’s strategy. However, this move has not been free of controversy. To acquire its vast Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy has borrowed heavily, which some view as a risky financial gamble. While many praise Saylor for leading the way in corporate crypto investment, others fear that such an aggressive approach could backfire. Critics warned that MicroStrategy’s dominant, debt-driven Bitcoin strategy could deter other businesses from adopting similar approaches. The perceived risks of such heavy leveraging might make companies more cautious about embracing cryptocurrency. Corporate Bitcoin adoption remains slow, despite MicroStrategy’s bold example. Few public companies have embraced Bitcoin in their financial strategies. In fact, even some crypto-native firms, like 12 Bitcoin mining companies , hold none on their balance sheets. Critics like Peter Schiff argued that Saylor’s efforts to drive corporate adoption aim to artificially boost Bitcoin’s value. He dismissed Bitcoin as a “worthless digital token.” Corporate Bitcoin: Opportunity or Risk? The corporate Bitcoin landscape is still in its early stages . While MicroStrategy’s success has set a precedent, it also highlights the risks of such a volatile asset. Saylor’s goal is clear: to make Bitcoin a key part of modern finance. However, for many companies, concerns over volatility, regulation, and Bitcoin’s speculative nature remain significant obstacles. Whether Bitcoin becomes a trusted store of value or fades as a risky investment depends on how it evolves. For now, corporate Bitcoin adoption is a story of both opportunity and risk, reflecting the uncertain future of crypto asset.

As part of this new strategy, the company plans to invest up to $20 million in BTC, with purchases made at its discretion. Rumble Approves Bitcoin Investment Strategy According to the official press release , Rumble said that this move demonstrates the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a valuable tool for strategic planning and is expected to accelerate the platform’s expansion into cryptocurrency. Chris Pavlovski, CEO and chairman of Rumble, cited the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and a “crypto-friendly” US presidential administration as significant reasons behind the latest decision. The exec added, “Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. We are also excited to strengthen our ties with crypto and to bolster our efforts to become the leading video and cloud services platform for the crypto community. Rumble said that the timing and amount of Bitcoin purchases under the strategy will be determined by its management. This will depend on several factors such as market conditions, the price of Bitcoin, and the company’s future cash requirements. The allocation strategy is subject to change, suspension, or termination at management’s discretion for any reason.

XRP Attracts New Demand XRP has surged over 50% this week, riding a wave of fresh demand that continues to propel its price toward new supply levels. The bullish momentum has sparked significant interest among investors and analysts, with many speculating on the token’s next move. Top analyst and investor Dark Defender shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting XRP’s evolving market structure on the 4-hour chart. According to his insights, XRP is likely to touch $2.13 soon before facing a potential correction. Dark Defender’s analysis also identifies key resistance levels on the 4-hour time frame. Notably, resistances at $4.11 and $6.42 align with his secondary price target of $5.85, which follows a support retest at $1.88. These levels suggest a roadmap for XRP’s price action if the current rally sustains its momentum. As XRP approaches these critical price zones, the coming weeks will be pivotal in determining its trajectory. While the bullish sentiment dominates, the possibility of corrections or consolidations remains. A decisive break above $2.13 could open the door to new highs, but failure to hold key levels might invite short-term volatility. For now, XRP’s impressive performance and emerging demand position it as one of the most closely watched assets in the crypto market. Reaching Multi-Year Highs XRP is currently trading at $1.88 following an impressive run since November 5, marking a staggering 285% increase in less than 30 days. The price recently tagged $1.95, a critical level, and has since entered a consolidation phase as it gathers momentum to push past the pivotal $2 mark. This consolidation suggests that XRP is building the necessary fuel for a potential breakout. The price action remains decisively bullish, supported by strong market sentiment and increasing demand. Analysts are closely watching the cycle’s top at $1.97, as breaking above this level would likely signal the start of a new leg higher. A confirmed breakout past $1.97 would not only reinforce the bullish structure but could also propel XRP to uncharted highs, aligning with predictions of a parabolic rally. However, consolidation near these levels indicates that XRP is facing temporary resistance. Market participants are now eyeing key support zones to ensure the current bullish momentum remains intact. If the upward pressure continues, XRP’s next targets could quickly surpass historical levels, solidifying its position as one of the leading assets in the crypto space. For now, XRP remains a focal point for traders and investors as it inches closer to the $2 threshold.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀 Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a playful alternative to more traditional coins. It uses the image of a Shiba Inu dog from a popular internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and adds 10,000 new coins every minute, making it plentiful. In 2021, Dogecoin's value surged, placing it among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was driven by social media influence and support from figures like Elon Musk. The coin's strong community and widespread recognition suggest potential for growth. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on adoption rates and developments in the crypto market. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. It was launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi with an initial supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. 50% of these tokens were sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated some to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, reducing the supply. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows the creation of applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for an NFT platform and a governance system. This gives SHIB potential for broader use in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB's utility and active development may make it an attractive option for some investors. Conclusion As DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a standout meme token designed for those seeking luxury and success. Following the path of successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

Solana (SOL): A Scalable Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, providing a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a central role in the ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana's architecture focuses on handling high transaction volumes without using sharding or second-layer solutions, making it attractive for developers who require fast and efficient networks. The SOL coin holds value as it underpins the operation of the platform and grants access to various projects on Solana. In the current market cycle, Solana's emphasis on scalability and flexible development options highlights its potential in the blockchain space. AVAX: Fast and Scalable Blockchain with Customizable Subnets AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and fast transactions. Avalanche processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizes transactions in less than 2 seconds. It uses a hybrid consensus mechanism combining classical and Nakamoto methods. The platform includes three chains: X-Chain for asset transactions, C-Chain for smart contracts, and P-Chain for managing Subnets. Users can create custom Subnets to meet specific needs. AVAX is essential for transaction fees, staking for network security, and operating Subnets. With its scalability and eco-friendly design, Avalanche's technology shows potential in the blockchain space. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Faster Transactions Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used within the network for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and scalability potential may make it attractive in the evolving blockchain landscape. Polygon (POL): Enhancing Ethereum with Fast Transactions and Lower Fees Polygon (POL) is a layer two scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, designed to facilitate fast transactions and lower fees. It operates alongside Ethereum, enabling users to bridge assets and access a wide range of applications at reduced costs. POL, Polygon's native cryptocurrency, is used for network fees, staking, and governance. The platform employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, allowing users to earn through staking. Validators secure the network and process transactions, while delegators can stake their POL through trusted validators. Originally known as Matic Network, it was rebranded to Polygon in 2021. Polygon's efficiency and low fee structure enhance the scalability and accessibility of the Ethereum ecosystem, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it's expected to grow 700% by presale's end, with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering exclusive perks for early adopters.

37102297,https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-presale-crosses-expectations-while-ripple-and-celestia-expand-blockchain-horizons/,1733080506,Qubetics Presale Crosses Expectations While Ripple and Celestia Expand Blockchain Horizons,"The cryptocurrency market is on fire, and three standout names are shaking things up: Qubetics ($TICS) , Ripple (XRP), and Celestia (CEL). Ripple is riding high after recent legal victories and continued adoption in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, Celestia is redefining blockchain scalability with its modular network. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics, which has raised over $3.9 million in its presale and is revolutionising the market with its innovative asset tokenisation feature. While Ripple and Celestia are making waves in their respective niches, Qubetics is solving broader blockchain challenges, making it one of the best crypto investments in 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Investments with Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. Its asset tokenisation platform enables users to convert tangible and intangible assets into tradable tokens, unlocking liquidity and opening up new investment opportunities. Imagine tokenising a luxury apartment or a rare piece of art. With Qubetics, these once-illiquid assets become accessible to investors worldwide. For instance, a small business could tokenise its commercial property to raise funds or an artist could tokenise their digital creations for fractional ownership. The platform’s multi-chain compatibility ensures these tokens can be traded seamlessly across networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), giving users unmatched flexibility. Now, let’s talk numbers. At $0.025 in its 10th presale stage, a $750 investment in $TICS could grow to $6,532 if the token hits $0.25 by presale’s end. Analysts predict even greater potential, with $TICS potentially reaching $15 post-mainnet launch, transforming that $750 into an astounding $435,975. With over 251 million tokens sold, Qubetics isn’t just one of the best crypto investments—it’s a revolution waiting to happen. Ripple (XRP): Dominating Cross-Border Payments Ripple continues to solidify its position as a leader in cross-border payment solutions. Following its legal victory against the SEC, XRP has seen renewed interest from institutional and retail investors alike. Ripple’s partnerships with global financial institutions highlight its utility in streamlining international transactions. Picture a small business owner sending payments to suppliers overseas. Traditional methods are slow and expensive, but Ripple’s technology enables near-instant, low-cost transfers. This real-world utility sets XRP apart in the crowded crypto space. Ripple offers a steady growth opportunity for investors. A $750 investment in XRP could yield decent returns as adoption increases. However, while Ripple excels in its niche, it lacks the multi-faceted innovation of Qubetics . Compared to $TICS’ transformative potential and high ROI projections, XRP feels like a safer but less dynamic choice. While Ripple dominates in payments, it doesn’t offer the broad appeal that makes $TICS a standout among the best crypto investments in 2024. Celestia (CEL): Pioneering Modular Blockchain Solutions Celestia is making waves as the first modular blockchain network, separating consensus and data availability layers to enhance scalability. This architecture allows developers to customise their blockchains without compromising performance, making Celestia a favourite among those building specialised applications. Imagine a DeFi project needing high throughput without the burden of building an entire blockchain from scratch. Celestia’s modular design offers an efficient, scalable solution. This flexibility has attracted developers looking to innovate without the limitations of traditional monolithic blockchains. Celestia offers a promising opportunity for those betting on next-gen blockchain infrastructure. A $750 investment in CEL might yield respectable returns as its ecosystem grows. However, compared to Qubetics’ broader application and explosive growth potential, Celestia’s appeal feels more niche. While CEL excels in scalability, it lacks the comprehensive solutions and ROI potential that make $TICS one of the best crypto investments in 2024. Conclusion: Qubetics Takes the Lead In the competition between Qubetics, Ripple, and Celestia, Qubetics emerges as the clear winner. Its asset tokenisation platform, multi-chain wallet, and unparalleled ROI potential set it apart from the crowd. While Ripple excels in cross-border payments and Celestia leads in modular scalability, neither offers the comprehensive innovation or growth potential of $TICS. With $TICS priced at $0.025 and a 10% price hike imminent, now is the time to act. Analysts are projecting life-changing returns that could transform even modest investments into substantial wealth. Don’t miss your chance to secure $TICS tokens and be part of the blockchain revolution. Act now before the presale ends and the price surges.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

BONK: Solana's Community Memecoin with Rapid Growth BONK is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by shifting influence from venture capital tokens to users. After a significant surge following its listing on Coinbase, BONK established itself as a community coin, distributing half of its supply to participants in Solana's projects. By December 2023, it became the third-largest memecoin by market value, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in applications like BonkSwap suggest potential for further growth. BONK's performance indicates it may be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano's ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain with High Potential Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, offering scalability, sustainability, and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than traditional proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts, potentially processing up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano's technology shows significant potential in decentralized finance, token creation, and gaming. In the current market cycle, ADA's sustainable approach and scalability features may make it an attractive option for those interested in blockchain innovations. Conclusion While BONK and ADA show potential for growth, DOGEN stands out as a token designed for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and WIF.

LunexNetwork is one of the hot contenders on investors’ radar. Positioned as an innovative blockchain solution, Lunex Network could see substantial value appreciation alongside the market leaders. Lunex Network’s cross-chain ability and unprecedented presale success make it appealing to investors searching for opportunities in the next wave of crypto development. Trump’s Rumored National Bitcoin Reserve Could Boost Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Bitcoin faced heavy selling pressure at the $99,000 level as long-term holders began taking profits at this significant psychological milestone. Achieving $100,000 has been a huge target after the previous cycle however Bitcoin might just need a breather after its substantial climb from the previous all-time high of $73,000. Now, Bitcoin is supported at $95,000, which might trigger a V-shaped recovery in the coming days. Speculation that Donald Trump will establish a strategic National Bitcoin Reserve has led other nations to create their own Bitcoin acquisition strategies. This may spark a worldwide race to accumulate Bitcoin throughout 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Could Reach $10,000 Soon Ethereum (ETH) is drawing attention following record inflows reported recently concerning Ethereum ETFs. Over $515 million flowed into Ethereum-focused ETFs last week, marking a significant step in institutional adoption. The iShares Ethereum Trust by BlackRock alone recorded $287 million in net inflows. This increase reflects increasing trust in Ethereum as an investment option. These developments solidify Ethereum as a top cryptocurrency. Analysts think the momentum from Ethereum ETF news might push Ethereum past $4,000, an important resistance level. Some predict it could even reach $10,000. Increased adoption and active participation from whales support this optimism, driving Ethereum’s bullish sentiment in the market. Why Lunex Network Could Outperform Major Cryptos The Lunex crypto presale is gaining attention as a promising opportunity for investors to secure $LNEX tokens, which are positioned to revolutionize decentralized finance. Investors chasing profits in Ethereum and Bitcoin are shifting focus to Lunex Network for several compelling reasons. One of these reasons is Lunex Network’s elimination of KYC requirements, allowing traders to maintain anonymity. Lunex Network also supports multi-chain transactions, giving users the freedom to send and work with a wide range of coins. Lunex Network’s revenue-sharing model offers stable passive income. Staking $LNEX tokens provides returns of up to 18% APY. The platform uses deflationary tokenomics to increase its long-term value, positioning $LNEX as a strong competitor to Ethereum and Bitcoin. The platform’s advanced trading features appeal to traders who value security, efficiency, and profitability. Early buyers who acquired $LNEX at $0.0012 have already seen a 158% gain as the token’s price rose to $0.0033 during its seventh presale stage. Rising interest from Bitcoin investors highlights Lunex Network’s potential for significant price growth. While Ethereum struggles to sustain its bullish momentum and Bitcoin investors look for fresh opportunities, Lunex Network is reshaping market sentiment. Experts predict it could become a leading DeFi platform capable of achieving its ambitious goals. Investors may want to act quickly before prices rise further.

As these digital assets capture market attention, speculation grows about whether their upward momentum will continue, and which tokens may be next in line for significant growth. CYBRO Presale Climbs Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge multichain DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize their earnings across various blockchains in any market condition. The presale is currently in its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final chance for investors to buy CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, the window of opportunity is closing quickly. The Token Generation Event (TGE) is just around the corner, and prices are expected to skyrocket, with experts forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Fetch.ai: Connecting AI and Blockchain for Decentralized Data Solutions Fetch.ai is an AI lab founded in 2017 that builds an open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network within a crypto economy. Launched through an IEO on Binance in March 2019, it allows anyone to access secure datasets and use autonomous AI to execute tasks across its global data network. The platform focuses on use cases like optimizing DeFi trading services, improving transportation networks such as parking and micromobility, enhancing smart energy grids, and streamlining travel systems. By democratizing access to AI technology, Fetch.ai aims to make complex digital systems that rely on large-scale datasets more efficient through its decentralized approach. Render Token Powers Decentralized GPU Rendering for Creators Render Token (RENDER) is the utility token of The Render Network. This network offers decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. It helps creators get GPU power for rendering tasks more efficiently and at lower costs. Artists and developers can access a network of GPUs for their rendering needs. Node operators contribute their spare GPU capacity to the network. They receive RENDER tokens in return for their services. This system supports the production of animation, motion graphics, and visual effects. By leveraging a distributed network, it makes processing power more accessible. This can benefit many in the fields that require heavy rendering. Render Token connects those who need GPU power with those who have it to spare. Conclusion Despite the recent rallies of tokens like FET and RENDER, their short-term potential seems limited. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO ensures a superior user experience characterized by seamless deposits and withdrawals.

Considered to be cryptocurrency royalty by some, Litecoin is unlikely to produce the kind of exponential returns most ambitious investors are seeking. Contrastingly, Rollblock is a trailblazing gem with parabolic potential. Within the play-to-earn iGaming sector, analysts proclaim that Rollblock is unmatched during its presale phase, and that Rollblock could deliver 10-20x profits by the end of the year. Here’s the rundown. Whale Activity Spearheads Litecoin’s Positive Short-Term Trajectory While Litecoin is often touted as being ancient in cryptocurrency years, Litecoin is showing signs of a potential comeback in 2024. Notably, Litecoin is experiencing significant whale accumulation over a 3 month period, which is reducing Litecoin’s exchange supply and bolstering its price potential ahead of the bull run. After reaching a high of $105 following Bitcoin’s near rally to $100k, Litecoin experienced a pullback to $87, subsequently rebounding to $97 and gaining 11% on the weekly charts. Some analysts predict that another temporary pullback could be the required catalyst to spark a renewed rally, to which Litecoin could soar past the resistance price zone at $101. Can Litecoin Shock The Cryptocurrency Space In Its Third Bull Run? Optimism surrounding Litecoin has been fueled by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s planned resignation in January 2025, propagating speculation about a possible Litecoin ETF approval. This has partially driven the aforementioned whale activity and Litecoin’s 7-day 31% surge, with the recent formation of a golden cross technical pattern further bolstering renewed bullish sentiment for Litecoin. Litecoin’s playful embrace of meme culture has boosted its visibility at a time when memes are more popular than ever. The Solana-based meme token “Litecoin Mascot” (LESTER) surged 700% in value within 24 hours, achieving a $120 million market cap in record time. While unrelated to LTC’s fundamentals, the cultural impact has driven increased trading activity and interest in Litecoin. Litecoin’s fundamentals remain strong, harnessing faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Bitcoin, a major reason why Litecoin was considered to be “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold"" back in the day. Despite this, Litecoin’s valuation significantly trails Bitcoin and even Ethereum, and analysts concur that Litecoin’s gains are likely limited below 10x for this cycle.

37101495,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620731,1733079003,Elon Musk takes legal action to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit,"Elon Musk wants OpenAI to hit pause. He’s asking a federal court to stop the AI giant from switching into full-for-profit mode. Elon’s lawyers, joined by his AI company xAI and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis, filed for a preliminary injunction on Friday. The filing accuses OpenAI of playing dirty, allegedly pressuring its investors to avoid backing competitors like xAI. Elon says this isn’t just unfair—it’s illegal. He first sued the company in March 2024 in San Francisco state court. That case was dropped and refiled later in federal court. Now, Elon’s legal team, led by Marc Toberoff out of Los Angeles, is turning up the heat. They say OpenAI’s actions violate federal racketeering (RICO) laws and antitrust regulations. OpenAI’s alleged investor blockade At the core of Elon’s case is the claim that OpenAI and its backer Microsoft have created a “group boycott” to block funding for competitors. According to the complaint, OpenAI has required its investors to sign agreements that prevent them from supporting rivals, including xAI. Elon’s lawyers call this an antitrust violation, accusing OpenAI of cutting off essential capital for up-and-coming AI startups. “Microsoft and OpenAI now seek to cement this dominance by cutting off competitors’ access to investment capital,” Elon’s team argued. The filing also claims OpenAI is benefiting from sensitive information shared during its earlier years, giving it an unfair edge while shutting out competition. An OpenAI spokesperson dismissed Elon’s efforts, calling the claims “recycled complaints” that lack merit. The bigger picture OpenAI wasn’t always the tech juggernaut it is today. The company launched in 2015 as a non-profit, promising to advance AI for the benefit of humanity. That mission took a turn in 2019 when OpenAI adopted a capped-profit model. Under this structure, its non-profit arm oversees a for-profit subsidiary, allowing OpenAI to attract investment while maintaining some ties to its original mission. Now, OpenAI is going even further, transitioning into a fully for-profit public benefit corporation. This, according to Elon’s legal team, is all about boosting its appeal to investors while consolidating its power. Reports indicate that OpenAI’s valuation hit $157 billion in October, with Thrive Capital leading a major funding round that also included Microsoft and Nvidia. Microsoft, which has poured nearly $14 billion into OpenAI, has played a critical role in its rise. The tech giant, however, revealed a $1.5 billion loss in its fiscal first quarter, largely tied to its partnership with OpenAI. While it gave up its observer seat on OpenAI’s board in July, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is still keeping a close eye on the relationship. FTC Chair Lina Khan announced a probe earlier this year into partnerships between AI developers and cloud service providers. Companies like OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Anthropic are all under scrutiny.

ETH Whales Are Hedging With This Ethereum-Based Crypto Titan,"Cryptocurrency is an inherently volatile asset class, and corrections are par for the course as momentum waxes and wanes. After nearly touching the $100,000 price point earlier this month, Bitcoin has since experienced a sharp yet minimal decline. Some alt-coins like Ethereum have fallen victim to similar declines, closely following the path of cryptocurrencies' crown jewel. While these cryptocurrencies are already changing trajectory, Rollblock has been the talk of the town within the private circles of smart money buyers. With its all-encompassing iGaming platform set to take advantage of the renewed hype within this sector, Rollblock exudes strong potential to become the most lucrative presale in 2024-2025. Here’s the rundown. Opinions Remain Divided Over Bitcoin’s Recent Diminishment Short-term declines can appear to be disastrous on a day-to-day basis, but when zoomed out, these inevitable corrections are just small blips in the grand scheme of things. Such is the case with Bitcoin right now, as Bitcoin declines from the tantalizing $98,000 price down to $90,000. This recent diminishment has shocked a large contingent of Bitcoin investors unfamiliar with Bitcoin's 4 year cycle. Bitcoin’s peak isn’t due until at least Q2 2025 according to this well-established theory of cryptocurrency cycles, though Bitcoin whales remain divided over how Bitcoin will perform from here. Some believe that Bitcoin will decline further to $80,000, or even $65,000 before Bitcoin sees $100,000. With Bitcoin already recovering as BTC hits $93,000, this corroborates the bullish sentiment that Bitcoin will surpass $120,000 by the end of the year. Ethereum Retains Firm Footing: Still Yet To Reach Yearly High In This Bull Cycle Throughout this market cycle, Ethereum has succumbed to waning hype amid the rising popularity of technologically superior options like Solana and Sui. While Ethereum is staunchly in the green on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, Ethereum is yet to reach a new yearly high following Q2’s bullish market phase. Some Ethereum bulls believe that Ethereum could reach $4000 prior to Bitcoin hitting $100,000, an event that would likely trigger a monumental alt-coin rally. Others purport that Bitcoin will showcase its supremacy and hamper the potential of alts like Ethereum, though previous cycles and Ethereum’s relative overperformance in November heavily debunk this notion. Why Rollbock Is One Of The Bets For Rampant Returns According To Smart Money Buyers As the bull run progresses, Rollblock’s rapid expansion positions it as a standout in the iGaming industry. Bullish analysts predict a remarkable 55% rise for Rollblock this quarter, with gains potentially soaring beyond 20x in Q1 2025. Soon to launch sports betting services, Rollblock will build on its catalog of over 7,000 games in the upcoming months to deliver an all-encompassing entertainment experience. Key partnerships with major players in the blockchain entertainment industry enable continuous platform enhancements, with new updates scheduled to roll out as ordained through community user polls and other feedback mechanisms. Rollblock’s fast-growing community of over 20,000 members has numerous ways to make a profit beyond speculation, including RBLK token staking for passive income and play-to-earn rewards for active gameplay. Rollblock’s token-burning mechanism also restricts supply, increasing RBLK’s value, deterring sell-offs, and encouraging sustained engagement. Priced at $0.037, RBLK offers a prime entry point for those seeking high returns during its 8th presale stage. Experts foresee up to 10x gains by early 2025 and as much as 25-100x at the bull run’s peak. Act fast before Bitcoin fully recovers!

37101022,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620648,1733077815,"Tom Lee of Fundstrat predicts Bitcoin will reach $250,000 in a year.","Tom Lee is positive about Bitcoin, predicting it could hit $100,000 soon and $250,000 within a year. He believes factors like the halving cycle, more support from institutions, and the U.S. government’s positive attitude will push its price up. Lee also sees Bitcoin as a way to protect against inflation, like gold, and advises investors to stick with it, even as other cryptocurrencies grow. In a recent discussion with Anthony Scaramucci, Tom Lee, Chief Investment Officer of FundStrat, outlined a future where Bitcoin not only reaches $100,000 but climbs to $250,000. He says Bitcoin will stay as the leader in the crypto market. Tom Lee’s bullish Bitcoin predictions Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin’s price will rise because of the halving cycle, He also predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 soon due to this supply-demand effect, which has happened in the past. In the long term, he thinks Bitcoin could go as high as $250,000 within a year, considering not just the halving cycle, but also the current economic conditions. The FundStrat’s CIO Lee is positive about Bitcoin’s future because the incoming U.S. government is promising more support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He believes that this shift makes Bitcoin more legitimate and could lead to more institutions adopting it. He went on to highlight Bitcoin’s increasing usage by companies like MicroStrategy, in this case, as part of its financial strategy. Lee thinks if more companies do the same there will be an increasing demand for Bitcoin, further raising its price. Tom Lee also believes that if the U.S. government starts buying a lot of Bitcoin, it will make Bitcoin more trustworthy among people and big investors. While he focuses on Bitcoin, he also sees other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche becoming more important. Lee thinks there could be a “season” next year where their prices also rise more. Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin is becoming the best way to protect against inflation, similar to real estate and gold. With the rising global inflation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a safe place to store value. Also, he advises investors to stick with Bitcoin, even though other cryptocurrencies are growing.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, alleging that XRP was being sold as an unregistered security. However, in a landmark decision in July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a mixed verdict. She determined that XRP sold to individual investors through exchanges did not constitute a security, while XRP sold in institutional offerings did. The SEC sought a $2 billion penalty from Ripple, but the court imposed a reduced penalty of $125 million. Following the ruling, the SEC attempted to appeal, arguing that the decision was inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. In October 2024, Judge Torres denied the appeal, stating that the regulator failed to demonstrate a significant difference of opinion. The SEC has since taken the case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Related News: One Trader Makes 2580x Profit on Surprise Memecoin - Here Are His Trades When asked if the SEC would drop the case, Giancarlo said: “I think they should quit… I'm willing to bet they will.” He called the court's decisions a significant setback for the SEC and urged regulators to reconsider pursuing cases where they face losses at trial. Giancarlo also noted the potential for a pro-crypto shift under President-elect Donald Trump that could impact the SEC’s stance on crypto regulation. He argued that such a political environment could encourage regulatory clarity and a lighter touch approach to digital assets, including XRP. Giancarlo, who previously penned a legal analysis arguing that XRP is not a security, has become a leading advocate for clearer and more balanced cryptocurrency regulation. He said the Ripple case was a turning point for the industry and tested the limits of U.S. securities laws. *This is not investment advice.

This release is the standard operation carried out by the San Francisco-based crypto company. Customarily, every first day of a new month, Ripple releases 1 billion tokens to open the market. Ripple’s Escrow Strategy and Market Stability The original XRPL novel, Ripple will unlock a total of 55 billion tokens all from its escrow account. This account holds approximately 55% of the total XRP supply. This approach makes the supply of XRP more predictable in the market and prevents a crash in price due to excess supply. As per estimate, Ripple has less than 38 billion tokens left in its accounts. At the moment, the exact tokens remaining will become known when Ripple relocks all unclaimed tokens. When this has happened, the value can be estimated using the prevailing market price. XRP’s Price and Market Performance Ripple’s XRP has made significant gains in the broader cryptocurrency market and will not want to undo the price gains it has recorded. Ripple will remain cautious so as not to trigger market volatility or spread panic among investors and traders. XRP hit a seven-year high with a gain of about 283.9% in the month of November. So, the release of one billion tokens might cause unease in the market, particularly among new traders and investors. However, among seasoned stakeholders, this release is standard protocol for Ripple. Anticipation for the Week Ahead Although XRP witnessed a drawdown on the first day of trading in December, experts maintain it was mild. The analysis lies on the bullish run XRP had in November. Hence, the 2.4% drawdown has been waved off as insignificant for the token . As of this writing, XRP is exchanging hands at $1.90, a 1.98% increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, market volume has dropped by 36.23% or $10.64 billion. On the last day of November, XRP hit $1.95 with many anticipating it to breach the $2 mark. However, XRP could not break the resistance level. Nevertheless, there is high anticipation that when active trading commences on Monday, XRP might register an uptick.

37100370,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620714,1733076803,Americans are more bullish than they’ve ever been on the stock market,"A record-breaking 56.4% of Americans think the stock market will rise over the next 12 months, according to the latest Conference Board Consumer Survey. This figure has doubled in just two years, signaling the highest level of optimism ever recorded. In November, the gap between those expecting stock prices to climb and those predicting declines hit a historic 35%. This is happening while the S&P 500 approaches a massive milestone: its first annual gain of over 30% since 1997. Trump’s return could shake up everything President Donald Trump is set to reclaim the White House, and Wall Street is already holding its breath. His return could upend the balance between emerging-market stocks and bonds, which have been a heated battleground under Joe Biden. During Biden’s first three years, dollar-denominated emerging-market bonds outperformed stocks. This year, they’re neck and neck: bonds have gained 8.4%, while stocks have delivered 9%. But bonds have managed all this with half the volatility of equities. High-yield sovereign bonds? Up a stunning 15%. Trump’s trade policies are the wildcard. Jeff Grills, head of US cross-asset and emerging-markets debt at Aegon Asset Management, says Trump’s tariffs could be a game-changer. “If he imposes tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, stocks will take a hit, while bonds could shine,” Grills explained . But if Trump’s tariff strategy is more about negotiating leverage, it could push equities ahead of bonds. The market is already showing signs of a split. Since early November, the Bloomberg Emerging Market Dollar Debt Index has been climbing, while the MSCI Emerging Market Equity Index has dropped 3.7%. Chinese stocks, a major part of the equity index, have plunged 8% since Trump’s win, dragging down the entire sector. Meanwhile, bonds have stayed steady, offering a refuge for nervous investors. Emerging markets caught in the crossfire Emerging-market stocks started the year on a high. Everyone expected Federal Reserve rate cuts and Chinese economic stimulus. But since October, it’s been a different story. Stocks in this category have dropped nearly 10% as traders brace for Trump’s potential tariffs. The stakes are high for countries like China, South Korea, India, and Taiwan, which make up 73% of the emerging-market equity index. In simpler terms, people want safe bets, and emerging-market bonds have been delivering just that. Unlike the equity index, which is heavily exposed to China, the bond gauge is more balanced. China accounts for only 10% of the bond index, compared to its heavy weighting in stocks. Emerging-market debt has gained steady traction, thanks to solid yields and less exposure to geopolitical drama. High-yield bonds, especially those from riskier sovereigns, are up 15%—a major win for investors who stuck with fixed income. The dollar’s strength and investor exodus The strong dollar is creating headaches for emerging-market equities. While it might help Asian exporters compete globally, it’s putting pressure on equity valuations. Investors yanked $1.8 billion out of emerging-market equity funds in the week ending November 27. That was seven straight weeks of outflows, according to data from Bank of America and EPFR Global. Here’s the thing: the yield premium on emerging-market bonds over US Treasuries has narrowed to more than 100 basis points below its five-year average. To put it plainly, there’s less room for bonds to grow. And sure, the S&P 500 may be soaring, but the bigger picture tells a different story. Investors are watching Trump’s next moves closely. Will tariffs derail stocks completely? Will bonds continue to be the safer option? No one can tell you for sure.

37099886,https://crypto.news/?p=14315265,1733076190,"Cutoshi price projection 2024, 2025, 2026: CUTO poised to reach $1","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cutoshi, a hybrid DeFi and meme coin, is gaining traction and nearing a sellout in its third presale stage. Table of Contents How to work out how high a coin could go Cutoshi price prediction for 2024 Cutoshi price prediction for 2025 Cutoshi price prediction for 2026 Hybrid DeFi and meme coin Cutoshi (CUTO) has been on a tear recently and is on the verge of selling out of the third stage of the presale. The mixture of meme and DeFi ecosystem makes it a coin that has the potential for long-term sustainability, like Shiba Inu. How high could Cutoshi go and can it reach $1? How to work out how high a coin could go Many people tease that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could reach $1, but that’s highly unlikely because the coin is already worth so much. Step 1 – Find out the market cap Take the current price of a token and multiply it by the total supply of coins – that will give you current market cap. For Shiba Inu, that’s $0.00002591 x 589,258,953,249,304, which equals $15,357,557,015 For Cutoshi, that’s $0.0259 x 440,000,000, which equals $11,396,000. You might also like: 5 reasons Cutoshi trends number 1 globally in the meme coin space Step 2 – Find out the percentage difference We need the difference between the price now and what is wanted or hope it to be. Let’s use a percentage calculator for this: SHIB – 3,859,410% CUTO – 3,761% Now we can see how that’s a huge jump for Shiba Inu and not too much for Cutoshi. Step 3 – Working out the potential market cap The market cap figures need to be multiplied by the percentages above. SHIB – $15,357,557,015 x 3,859,410% = $592 trillion As the total market cap for the entirety of crypto is at around $3.2 trillion currently, we can now see how unlikely this is to happen. CUTO – $11,396,000 x 3,751 = $428 Million. Step 4 – Compare this to other cryptos Given that DOGE ’s current market cap is around $68 billion and Shiba Inu’s is about $15 billion, we can see that CUTO’s $428 million is easily achievable. So with that knowledge in mind, here are some price predictions for Cutoshi. Cutoshi price prediction for 2024 By the end of 2024, Cutoshi could see significant growth as it progresses from its presale stages to broader market availability. With the planned launch of its cross-chain DEX, utility-driven NFTs and staking options, the project has tangible features that could attract both DeFi enthusiasts and meme coin investors. If the team secures listings on tier-1 exchanges as anticipated, the price could rise to $0.12 to $0.15, representing a 463% to 579% increase from its current presale price of $0.0259. A $0.15 price would place the market cap at $66 million, which remains modest compared to established meme coins. Cutoshi price prediction for 2025 By 2025, Cutoshi could benefit from the maturing DeFi market and growing demand for hybrid projects that combine community appeal with practical features. If adoption continues and the platform’s ecosystem delivers on its promises, CUTO could climb to $0.30 to $0.45. At these levels, the market cap would reach $132 million to $198 million. This range aligns with mid-cap tokens, suggesting steady, achievable growth. Cutoshi price prediction for 2026 By 2026, Cutoshi could be far more than just a trending meme coin. If the project expands its ecosystem with new DeFi features, deepens its community engagement and secures additional exchange listings, CUTO could climb to $2 to $2.50. At $2, Cutoshi’s market cap would sit at $880 million and at $2.50, it would push to $1.1 billion, a level that, while ambitious, remains achievable given the growth trajectory of similar projects. The combination of its DeFi ecosystem and the loyal community behind it could drive sustained demand, especially if the project introduces compelling staking rewards or NFT utilities that attract both retail and institutional interest.

37099782,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656190,1733076021,Dogecoin To $3? Expert Says The Countdown Has Begun – Details,"Crypto experts are confident that positive market sentiment on digital assets would also drive the price of a popular meme coin to an all-time high. Analysts see that the meme-based Dogecoin is gaining momentum for a potential bull run that propels the crypto to $3 per coin. Dogecoin: A Potential Bull Run A well-known analyst believes that it was only a matter of time before Dogecoin attained the $3 mark. Crypto Scofield claimed that the meme coin right now is gathering steam for a potential bull run that would push the token to that desired price. Reports said that the meme-based currency can capitalize on the price surge of Bitcoin which already surpassed $97,000, and the crypto analyst sees the BTC surge could be a driver in Dogecoin’s own price rally. Just a matter of time before $FET to $10 $FTM to $5 $VET to $0,25 $COTI to $1 $INJ to $150 $ROSE to $0,80 $DOGE to $3 $XRP to $5 — Scofield (@Crypto_Scofield) November 28, 2024 Despite the recent slump experienced by the meme coin, Crypto Scofield is confident that Dogecoin’s bull run could reemerge any time soon which will pave the way for the token to reach $3. Experts explained that for Dogecoin to hit this unprecedented level, it would need to stage a massive run wherein its price would have to increase by 624% from its current price. The 624% surge is not far-fetched considering that in the last 12 months, DOGE has already experienced over 400% in price increase, further strengthening the possibility that meme coins could have a bull run to reach $3. Target Hittable In A Year Several crypto analysts suggested that Dogecoin could reach the $3 level anywhere from six months to one year, projecting that the meme coin’s peak could be the $3 mark. The market commentators also said that the ongoing bull run is predicted to end within the same timeline. However, some crypto observers do not concur with the $3 projection, saying that DOGE is forecasted to hit $11 or even reach above $20 per coin. A TradingView analyst examined the historical performance of Dogecoin within a Gaussian channel which resulted in a projection that the meme coin’s peak could be at $11. Another analyst, Ali Martinez, also predicted a higher than $3 per coin forecast for DOGE. Martinez analyzed the DOGE’s previous performance and concluded that the peak would be $18 per DOGE. A Market Cap Of $440 Billion? Analysts said that if Dogecoin would attain $3 per coin, it would also propel the meme coin’s market capitalization which they project to be around $440 billion. Once DOGE hits that market cap level, it will surpass the current market capitalization of another popular crypto, Ethereum, with $439 billion. Market commentators also explained that the projected $440 billion valuation of DOGE would put it among the most valuable assets and companies worldwide, surpassing industry leaders such as Netflix and Bank of America in the global ranking. As of press time, DOGE is being traded at $0.4219 per coin, up by 2.1% in the last 24 hours with a total market cap of over $62 billion.

These meme-driven cryptocurrencies are proving their resilience in the market as traders look to capitalize on their recent upward trends. Pepe Price Hits ATH Pepe Coin (PEPE) reached a staggering all-time high of $0.00002524 on November 14th, marking a historic milestone for the token. Over the last month, Pepe has delivered a 113% gain, while its yearly performance is nothing short of a 1,802% increase. At press time, Pepe Coin price stands at $0.0000000039, showing a 12.77% decline in the past 24 hours. While short-term volatility has impacted its current momentum, Pepe's ATH has mainly been a result of the community's strong support and the potential for another rally. With its max supply of 420.69 trillion coins, Pepe continues to leverage its meme appeal to attract both retail traders and crypto enthusiasts. Dogecoin News: DOGE Eyes A 100% Rally Dogecoin (DOGE), the pioneer of meme coins, is also experiencing a resurgence. Currently trading at $0.426815, Dogecoin Price is up 3.71% in the past 24 hours and has shown remarkable strength over the last month, gaining by 143%. Ranked 7th by market cap, Dogecoin boasts a market valuation of $62.74 billion, with a circulating supply of 147 billion DOGE coins. The recent price surge is attributed to the win of Trump, who promises to create an administration that is pro-crypto. Furthermore, Elon Musk's endorsement of the coin and random comments usually rocket the coin to great heights. As Trump is expected to be sworn in January, the current bullish sentiment may continue. This could easily push the prices up by 100% if not more. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): New MemeFi Sensation Adding to the meme coin excitement is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), an emerging MemeFi space, which combines the fun of meme culture with decentralized finance (DeFi) utility. Yeti Ouro has quickly gained popularity, thanks to its innovative ecosystem, community-driven tokenomics, and deflationary mechanics designed to reward long-term holders. Investors are flocking to Yeti Ouro presale which has pushed the raised amount to over $840K in its presale. Right now the offer is even better after the 20% bonus this Cyber Monday that is expected to push the presale even further. Yeti Ouro offers Play-to-Earn gaming, staking opportunities, and community rewards, making it more than just a meme coin, it’s a utility-focused asset in the crypto space. With a dedicated team and an active community, Yeti Ouro is well-positioned for a significant rally, with many traders predicting a 100% gain as stage 1 of presale looks to be complete soon.

According to a new report by Fox Business, anonymous people familiar with the matter say the state’s top regulator – the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) – has signaled to Ripple that it will approve the product, possibly before its launch date on December 4th. News of the potential approval sent XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple, flying as it went from a November 28th low of $1.45 to its current price of $1.88, a nearly 30% increase. Last month, Ripple announced exchange partnerships for its stablecoin, including popular crypto firms such as Bitstamp and MoonPay. As stated by Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay, to Fox Business, “For another well-capitalized, highly regulated player to enter into the global stablecoin marketplace – especially as MiCA (markets in crypto assets) regulation in Europe is about to be implemented – is a win-win and MoonPay is proud to provide access to RLUSD for our partners and customers on day one of Ripple’s launch.” Ripple Labs was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December 2020 for allegedly selling unregistered securities. However, the judge in the case ruled that retail sales of XRP do not qualify as securities. Furthermore, in May, the regulatory agency made a court filing declaring that RLUSD qualifies as an “unregistered crypto asset.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-trumprus-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37099539,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620697,1733075387,Analysts say Bitcoin is poised for $100k now that long-term holders have stopped selling,"Crypto analyst James Van Straten believes that Bitcoin will cross $100,000 as long the demand for the flagship continues to outstrip supply. Van Straten shared this view in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noting a net accumulation of 87,000 BTC over the last 30 days. According to the analyst, the return to accumulation is a great sign, showing that long-term holders (LTHs) selling off the flagship that has been taking profits have finally slowed down. Based on his analysis, this sell-off has been the reason behind Bitcoin’s struggle to reach $100,000. Bitcoin saw 87k net accumulation in the last 30 days (Source: X/James Van Straten) He said : “Any LTH that wanted to take profit near 100k has pretty much done so. On top of all the STHs that capitulated on that 10% correction. If demand continues to outstrip supply, I don’t see what stops $BTC going through 100k.” Van Straten’s view is shared by several market experts, including technical analyst Ali Martinez, who noted that the Bitcoin LTHs have booked profits on the flagship asset’s price increase. However, he observed that this is standard behavior in every bull market and warned against getting bearish or shorting Bitcoin based on that alone. This cohort of holders’ selloff in November was the highest since April. According to CryptoQuant , LTHs offloaded 728,000 Bitcoin in November. Whales back to accumulation mode With the sell-offs now over, accumulation has returned, particularly among whales. Whales reportedly bought around $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin during the last dip, taking advantage of the panic sell-offs by short-term holders (STHs) who sent almost $4 billion worth of BTC to exchanges, selling at losses. STHs, who are likely resellers, have been selling off Bitcoin (BTC), possibly in anticipation of a price dip. However, several analysts, including Martinez , have observed that Bitcoin tends to move against market expectations. Signs of a return to accumulation are evident in the outflows of BTC from exchanges, with Binance seeing historically low BTC inflows from other exchanges and Coinbase Prime recording the highest Bitcoin inflow since July 31. CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno also observed that Bitcoin demand growth is accelerating again, noting that demand expansion will boost Bitcoin’s price. Historical data shows Bitcoin will cross $100k before the year ends Meanwhile, current sentiments suggest market participants are very bullish on the asset. The Fear & Greed index is currently at Extreme Greed, the same sentiment as during the last bull market, where Bitcoin went from $15,000 to $57,000. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at Extreme Greed – Ali Martinez via glassnode Additionally, Bitcoin’s historical performance in the last two Decembers after the US elections has been positive, gaining 30% and 46% in 2016 and 2020, respectively. If the same happens now, Bitcoin could finish 2024 trading between $125,000 and $140,000. Despite the flagship asset gaining over 35% in November, on-chain data suggest it still has much room to run. Santiment data shows that Bitcoin’s Mean Dollar Invested Age has been dropping, with the average age of Bitcoin sitting in wallets now down to 466 days per coin. The Santiment analysts claim that continuous decline in this metric is evidence that we are still in the bull market. Meanwhile, Cryptoquant analysts also believe the current bull market is nowhere near the top. They point to the Bitcoin value held by new investors, which is currently around 50%, far lower than the previous market, which tops at over 90% in 2017 and over 80% in 2021. The analysts wrote: “Bitcoin price tops typically occur when new investors enter the market to buy at extremely high prices, which causes them to hold a large proportion of the total value invested.” Additionally, retail activity in this cycle has been relatively low. Retailers have actually reduced their holdings by 41,000 BTC since October, even as whales increased theirs by 130,000 BTC during the same period. This absence of high retail activity means there is no fear of missing out (FOMO), as the market top comes when retail starts buying aggressively. Beyond that, the Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator is currently in the bull phase and has not crossed to the overheated bull phase, which usually signifies a top. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin top price target based on realized price valuation is currently at $146,000. Historically, this metric has marked the top of the previous Bitcoin cycles.

37099343,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387783,1733075100,Best Bet Altcoin To Turn $10 To $100 In December!,"The post Best Bet Altcoin To Turn $10 To $100 In December! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has displayed a strong bullish price action over the past few days. This has resulted in the crypto space achieving a new ATH. Moreover, with Bitcoin price hovering above the $97k mark, the altcoin market is gaining momentum. Planning on investing in undervalued altcoins but concerned about their prospects? In this article, we have covered the top 3 cryptocurrencies that have the potential to outperform top projects during the last month of the year 2024. Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Built on the Ethereum chain, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) (DOGE-Killer) is the ShibaSwap (DEX) governance token. It allows its users to vote on proposals, submit proposals, and access NFTs. However, SHIB is considered to be the “Dogecoin (DOGE) killer” and the second-largest memecoin. TradingView: BONE/USDT The Bone ShiabSwap has experienced major growth in its community over the past few days. This has resulted in this meme coin achieving a market capitalization of ~146 million. With this, the BONE token is currently listed at 381st position in the crypto market. If the cryptocurrency market experiences an altcoin season, this could push the price of this memecoin toward its high of $2 by the year-end. Conversely, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its crucial low of $0.3128. Aethir (ATH) This altcoin is revolutionizing “DePIN” with its advanced and distributed infrastructure tailored for AI and gaming. Moreover, Aethir aims to serve enterprise “AI clients” who need the world’s most powerful AI chips around the world. All of this is accomplished by bringing the GPU cloud to the community and making it accessible to all. TradingView: ATH/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surpassed the overbought range. Moreover, its SMA indicator constantly supports the Aethir price chart, indicating a bullish outlook in the upcoming time. Suppose, the bullish sentiment, the ATH price may prepare to retest its all-time high this year. On the flip side, if the bears regain power, this altcoin may retest its lower support level of $0.050. Decred (DCR) Decred is considered as evolved money. Notably, by combining battle-tested PoW with an innovative application of PoS, Decred is able to adapt to challenges. Moreover, its security, privacy, scalability, and decentralized treasury provide the tools to enhance financial sovereignty. TradingView: DCR/USDT The Decerd price is currently valued at $17.02 with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.123 million. Moreover, with a market capitalization of $284.73 million, it has secured the 263rd position in the global cryptocurrency market. With increased price volatility, the Decerd price may retest its multi-year high. Conversely, if the bears gain momentum, this altcoin could retest its crucial low of $10.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/best-bet-altcoin-to-turn-10-to-100-in-december/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The upward momentum marks the highest Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) reached since April 1. Source: CoinGecko Multiple media reports suggest the rally is due to a massive burn rate spike — over 7,400% — and a reduced supply. Whether this momentum will be sustained remains to be seen. You might also like: Bitcoin to crash? Robert Kiyosaki predicts BTC plunges to $60k In a Nov. 21 X post , Analyst Ali Martinez predicted that SHIB could climb to $0.000037— 54% above its price at the time. Another analyst, Javon Marks, anticipated a potential rally to $0.000081, representing an increase of over 200%.

Shiba Inu tokens keep burning On Sunday, Shiburn data revealed a 984.26% spike in Shiba Inu token burns over the past seven days, with the circulating supply now at around 589.2 trillion. Crypto.news previously reported that Shibarium , its layer-2 blockchain, processed more than 541 million transactions in recent months. Observers note that the network growth is bullish for SHIB, as transaction fees — collected in BONE tokens — are partially converted into SHIB and burned, further lowering supply.

It is essential for the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain, where it is used to pay gas fees and incentivize validators and delegators. Its role highlights Shiba Inu’s transition from a meme token to a broader blockchain project with decentralized governance and utility. SHIB whale accumulation is also a trend. Per IntoTheBlock , large holder netflow surged by 256% on Nov. 21 . Whales accumulated 393.48 billion SHIB tokens worth over $9.8 million, compared to the $6 million sell-off recorded the previous day. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) anticipated surge to $100,000 could also prople the Shiba Inu rally. Shiba Inu began as an experiment in community-driven cryptocurrency and was heavily inspired by Dogecoin ( DOGE ), branding itself as the “Dogecoin Killer.” Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu emphasized decentralization and a grassroots approach, relying on its community, the “Shib Army,” for growth and adoption. The token’s creator, known only as “Ryoshi,” has maintained anonymity and described themselves as unimportant, stating the project belongs entirely to its community.

37099552,179771,1733074098,BYDFi Adds CHILLGUY to Platform as Market Cap Exceeds $600M,"Victoria, Seychelles, December 1st, 2024, Chainwire Bitget , the leading cryptocurrency exchange, and Web3 company, has announced starting pre-market trading for GOATS (GOATS), allowing users to engage in transactions prior to its official spot market listing.

37098764,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372858,1733073927,Bitcoin’s Hedge Narrative Gains Strength as Volatility Hits Record Lows,"Bitcoin is making another push toward the coveted six-figure milestone. On November 22, it came within $200 of the $100,000 mark after hitting $99,800, fueling analyst expectations of an imminent breakthrough. However, the subsequent corrections raised concerns. A catalyst for Bitcoin could be the growing narrative as a hedge against global macroeconomic risks and a trusted store of value. Bitcoin’s Maturing Market According to IntoTheBlock’s latest analysis , as governments explore the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves, the risks of not holding the asset are becoming more evident. A common counterargument is Bitcoin’s historically high volatility, which some view as a barrier to its status as a store of value. However, the on-chain analytic platform’s data shows that Bitcoin’s volatility has consistently decreased over time, even with occasional spikes. In fact, Bitcoin’s volatility now stands lower than that of stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). This trend indicates a maturing market, with institutional and national capital flows contributing to the asset’s stabilization. As volatility continues to decline and adoption grows, Bitcoin’s role as a wealth preservation tool is likely to strengthen further. Bitcoin Stalls Below $100K, What’s Next? In a statement to CryptoPotato, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at crypto trading platform Derive.xyz, said that while Bitcoin reaching $100K by December 1 remains unlikely, with only a 22.4% probability, the odds improve significantly over time. There is a 76.8% chance of BTC hitting $100K by January 2025, though the likelihood of maintaining this level by December 27 has dipped slightly to 40%, reflecting recent market fluctuations. By January 2025, the probability of crossing $100K rises to 44%, with a potential boost expected around Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Looking further ahead, the chance of Bitcoin exceeding $200K is 4% by late March but will climb to 14% by September. Meanwhile, Ecoinometrics’s latest analysis revealed that Bitcoin’s current pause below the $100,000 mark coincided with a slowdown in ETF inflows this week. Despite the deceleration, overall momentum remains strong, reflecting institutional interest, the platform added. The observed lull is likely tied to the natural reallocation phase following significant Q4 investments by institutions. According to Ecoinometrics, a resurgence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory may require either the start of a new quarter or a surge of FOMO-driven buying. Additionally, the timing of this slowdown aligns with the Thanksgiving holiday, which could temporarily impact trading activity. Next week will be pivotal in determining whether the trend resumes or if Q4’s strong momentum begins to taper off.

This was a peak in the platform’s month-over-month growth, which has seen revenue increase nearly 400% since early November. However, that changed drastically when the platform shut down its livestream feature on Nov. 25 after reports of harmful user content. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, Pump.fun raked in only $11.31 million in weekly revenue-a whopping 66% drop. While the suspension of livestreams was an effort to appease community concerns, it greatly affected the course of the platform’s earnings. Livestream Content Sparks Backlash The controversy began as Pump.fun’s livestream feature, designed to promote new token launches, was misused by some users to broadcast harmful and alarming content. Reports emerged of individuals making violent threats to gain attention and drive token activity. On Nov. 25, a Pudgy Penguins’ security manager, Beau, flagged an incident where a user threatened to commit suicide unless their token reached a certain market cap. Other alarming reports included threats of animal cruelty and possible acts of mass violence, shared by concerned users on X. The crypto community was fast to condemn such inappropriate use of the live stream feature. As more incidents of this nature came to the fore, calls for immediate action started to mount. Pump.fun’s Swift Action and Future Challenges Faced with growing criticism, Pump.fun’s team shut off the livestream feature indefinitely. In a public statement, the platform acknowledged “disturbing events” and announced plans to develop stricter moderation tools before reinstating the feature. Experts weighed in on the situation, and Yuriy Brisov from Digital and Analogue Partners pointed out that there could be several legal consequences, including investigations and civil lawsuits. At the same time, co-founder of Trading Strategy Mikko Ohtamaa thinks that the platform could either be shut down through regulatory intervention immediately or a bit later when authorities understand what happens. Pump.fun is finally responding-a critical juncture for the platform amidst growing challenges, rebuilding community trust, softening regulatory scrutiny, while addressing revenue consequences of the disabling of the problematic livestream feature.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/pump-fun-revenue-controversial-livestream-shutdown/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
37098628,https://finbold.com/?p=216216,1733073646,Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market continues to showcase its dynamic nature, with shifting trends and emerging opportunities capturing the attention of traders and investors. As the global market cap sees a slight dip of 0.3% to $3.61 trillion, the focus shifts to altcoins that demonstrate robust momentum despite the broader market’s consolidation. The average weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 60.03, reflecting steady but controlled bullish sentiment over a longer timeframe. Meanwhile, the 12-hour RSI has climbed to 68.09, signaling intensified short-term momentum. Against this backdrop, certain altcoins are standing out, supported by strong technical indicators and presenting promising buy opportunities. Finbold turned to the RSI heatmap from CoinGlass on December 1, to identify altcoins poised for growth, presenting attractive opportunities for traders and investors in the current market climate. Stellar (XLM) Stellar ( XLM ) is currently flashing strong buy signals across key technical indicators, presenting a compelling opportunity for traders and investors. While the average 12-hour RSI for the market stands at 68.09, approaching overbought conditions, XLM’s 12-hour RSI is slightly lower at 64.97. This indicates bullish momentum without entering the overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. Additionally, the recent 6.06% price correction provides an attractive entry point, as XLM shows potential for recovery. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: XLM. Source: CoinGlass The technical indicators strongly support a bullish outlook for XLM. The Moving Averages dashboard is overwhelmingly positive, with 13 out of 15 key metrics, including EMAs and SMAs across all major time frames, signaling a buy. These indicators highlight sustained upward momentum and strong support levels, suggesting the recent pullback is temporary. Moreover, the MACD level confirms a buy signal, reflecting increasing bullish momentum, while other oscillators remain neutral, signaling stability in the broader trend. For traders and investors, XLM offers an attractive risk-reward ratio. The temporary price pullback, combined with strong support from moving averages and RSI levels that suggest further upside potential, indicates that Stellar is poised for a rebound. Tron (TRX) Tron ( TRX ) is currently offering a compelling buy opportunity, backed by a combination of bullish technical indicators and stable price action, making it a solid pick for traders and investors. The 12-hour RSI stands at 60.23, below the market average RSI of 68.09, signaling that TRX is still in a position of strength with room for further growth before reaching overbought levels. Despite a minimal 12-hour price change of 0.07%, this stability reflects resilience, providing an attractive entry point for buyers anticipating a breakout. The moving averages provide a particularly strong bullish signal, with all key EMAs and SMAs across short- and long-term timeframes showing a buy recommendation. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: TRX. Source: CoinGlass This highlights sustained upward momentum and robust price support across multiple trading horizons. Additionally, momentum oscillators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum confirm growing bullish sentiment, suggesting that the current price action is building toward a potential upward rally. For traders and investors, TRX’s combination of stable RSI levels, strong moving average signals, and supportive momentum indicators position it as a good buy. The technical setup suggests that TRX is well-poised to capitalize on market momentum, offering both short-term gains and medium-term growth potential. While these cryptocurrencies demonstrate strong momentum and robust technical support, it’s important to acknowledge that short-term market fluctuations could influence their trajectories. Investors are encouraged to approach these opportunities with caution, perform comprehensive research, and ensure their investment strategies align with their risk tolerance and long-term financial objectives.

37098740,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620701,1733073544,US Bitcoin ETFs now hold 5% of total supply: How far are we from the Wall Street takeover?,"Bitcoin, the once-rebellious digital asset born to disrupt traditional finance, is slowly becoming a trophy in the hands of institutions. US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now hold more than 1 million Bitcoin, which equals 5% of the total supply. That’s nearly the same amount reportedly sitting in the untouched wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the crypto’s own creator. With Wall Street increasing its grip on Bitcoin and talks of a US government Bitcoin stockpile gaining traction, the crypto community is teetering on the edge of a new era—one that looks eerily like the financial systems Bitcoin was meant to free us from. US ETFs aren’t the only players though. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy continues to relentlessly hoard Bitcoin too, with its holdings valued at $38 billion. Meanwhile, Senator Cynthia Lummis is pushing legislation that proposes selling some of the Federal Reserve’s gold to buy 1 million Bitcoin, creating a national cryptocurrency reserve. If passed, this would make the US government one of Bitcoin’s largest whales. Wall Street, Trump’s agenda, and a shrinking supply Bitcoin ETFs were an impossible dream a decade ago. Now, they’re scooping up Bitcoin faster than miners can produce it. This institutional gold rush means Bitcoin is no longer a playground for tech libertarians and crypto-anarchists. It’s a hunting ground for financial giants. Enter Donald Trump. The president-elect wants to create a US Bitcoin stockpile. The government already holds over 200,000 Bitcoin, seized from criminals. Polymarket, a crypto-based predictions platform, gives it a 28% chance of happening in Trump’s first 100 days. If it passes, the market could become more volatile. A change in administration or policy could trigger massive sell-offs, crashing the price of Bitcoin and wiping out value for holders. Now Lummis’ plan is simple but controversial. The Federal Reserve would sell gold (about $690 billion worth at today’s prices) and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. On paper, this is feasible. The proposed purchase of 1 million Bitcoin would cost about $100 billion at current prices. But that will also destabilize markets. Selling large amounts of gold could drive its price down, while the mere announcement of such a Bitcoin purchase could send crypto prices skyrocketing. Mark Connors, founder of Risk Dimensions, warns of concentration risk. “Will this be a risk of being concentrated by existing G-10, G-20 countries, or institutions like BlackRock?” he asked. This is a bitter pill for Bitcoin’s early adopters to swallow. Dangers of the growing influence According to research from Glassnode, 65% of all Bitcoin in circulation hasn’t moved in over a year. This includes coins in ETFs, corporate treasuries, and even forgotten wallets. Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary 1.1 million Bitcoin, likely to be untouched forever, adds to this immobile supply. Bitcoin’s supply problem is hardwired. Miners produce about 164,250 Bitcoin annually, far less than what ETFs and institutional buyers demand. This creates a perfect storm of shrinking supply and skyrocketing demand. Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital, explained it best: “Add buyers coming through ETFs, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investors, and there just won’t be enough Bitcoin to meet demand unless prices rise significantly.” What this means for Bitcoin’s price Analysts now see $500,000 as a conservative target. Some even suggest $1 million, especially if governments start buying in bulk. Chin believes Bitcoin could become part of the global monetary base, much like gold. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, has noticed a surge in interest from institutional investors. “Starting in early October, 40% of the meetings I had with registered investment advisers and institutions resulted in allocations,” he said. This is a sharp increase from just 10% earlier in the year. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel shares this sentiment, saying that RIAs are scrambling to include Bitcoin in their portfolios. At press time, Bitcoin was worth $97,219 and is believed to currently be in correction after hitting a high of over $99,000 some days ago.

37099805,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51127,1733073459,$18 Billion XRP In 24 Hours. Here’s What Happened,"XRP has witnessed a sharp increase in trading volume , hitting $16.69 billion in the past 24 hours. This sudden spike coincides with several large-scale transactions involving major holders, often called whales, suggesting strategic positioning in the market. Whale Movements Signal Market Activity Data from Whale Alert , a blockchain monitoring service, shows that approximately 292.7 million XRP have changed hands across multiple transactions in the past day. These significant movements hint at possible preparations for a market shift or a redistribution of XRP holdings by large investors. One of the largest transactions recorded involved the transfer of 120 million XRP, valued at around $228.7 million, from the Bithumb exchange to an unidentified wallet. Additionally, Binance saw 13.46 million XRP worth $25.9 million transferred off its platform. Upbit also reported the movement of 20 million XRP, worth nearly $36 million, to an unknown wallet. Two other transactions involved 109.4 million XRP, further emphasizing the heightened activity. Analysts speculate that these transfers are a sign of whales anticipating a potential price rally or preparing for market volatility. XRP Road to $2 Over the past 24 hours, the asset’s price has surged by 9.73%, reaching $1.90. Weekly gains have totaled 28%, propelling the token’s market capitalization to $108.26 billion. This increase has allowed it to surpass Binance Coin (BNB), solidifying its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. The $2 mark is now seen as a critical resistance level. If the token can break through this price point, it could open the door to further gains, showing the possibility of sustained upward momentum in the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory and Technological Developments Drive Optimism Positive regulatory developments have also contributed to the recent enthusiasm for the token. Reports suggest that the RLUSD stablecoin , a dollar-pegged asset, could receive approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as early as December 4. Such an approval would likely enhance the asset’s role in the broader financial ecosystem. On the technological front, the Ledger is set to benefit from a new security proposal known as “XLS-86 Firewall.” This proposed feature aims to safeguard users by preventing large, unauthorized withdrawals where account keys may be compromised, adding an extra layer of security for XRP holders. With trading volumes soaring and key whale movements signaling potential market shifts, the token appears poised for further gains. As market participants watch for a breakthrough at the $2 level, the asset’s momentum continues to build, positioning it for future success.

Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence sector appears early to the party. While BTC consolidated around $96K in the past few days, Theta Network’s (THETA) price climbed to 12-month peaks. Further, the AI experiment iDEGEN continues to grab the crypto community’s attention with its unique approach. The one-of-a-kind project joins the digital space with zero data and relies on X, formerly Twitter, crypto community to learn everything. According to iDEGEN’s official website : Every time someone tweets at iDEGEN, its AI absorbs the data, using it to learn, adapt, and then tweet every hour with no moderation or trading guardrails. It will also respond to every Tweet. iDEGEN virility comes as the crypto market awaits a massive bullish wave, especially in the altcoin market.

Theta Network price rallied to a 1-year peak of $3.08 within the past day after claiming a solid support zone at the $2.28 mark. The uptrend propelled TETHA’s market cap to $3.10 billion – a 35% surge – whereas its daily trading volume jumped 4500% to $680 million. The token trades at $2.88, up 25% on its daily chart. Meanwhile, the robust trading volume signals amplified trader activity, suggesting continued uptrends. The 50% price surge within the past week saw THETA surpassing crucial resistances at the $2.40 – $2.50 range, suggesting a colossal uptrend. Source – Coinmarketcap Moreover, derivatives markets show more traders are executing THETA positions, with the Open Interest up 76% to $109 million. Analysts forecast continued upswings for Theta Network. World of Charts highlighted a potential descending triangle breakout, which could trigger surges to $9. That would translate to a 213% gain from current prices. Why consider iDEGEN? IDEGEN could be the perfect project for individuals looking for the hottest segments in the cryptocurrency market.

37100421,https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-presale-reaches-new-heights-while-avalanche-and-terra-make-waves/,1733073355,Qubetics Presale Reaches New Heights While Avalanche and Terra Make Waves,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and three standout projects are catching everyone’s attention: Qubetics ($TICS) , Avalanche (AVAX), and Terra (LUNA). Avalanche has made strides in enhancing decentralised finance (DeFi) capabilities, while Terra’s revival efforts are keeping it in the spotlight. But Qubetics has emerged as the talk of the town, thanks to its groundbreaking decentralised VPN (dVPN) and a presale that’s already raised over $3.9 million. What makes Qubetics unique is its ability to solve real-world problems that many other blockchain projects overlook. With multi-chain compatibility and innovative features, $TICS is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024, offering unparalleled growth potential for businesses and individual investors alike. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Privacy with Decentralised VPN Qubetics is rewriting the rules of blockchain with its decentralised VPN (dVPN) , designed to offer unmatched privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which centralise user data, Qubetics’ dVPN disperses it across a blockchain network, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to access sensitive information. For example, imagine a journalist bypassing government censorship or a business safeguarding its communications from corporate espionage. Qubetics’ dVPN delivers freedom and security on a whole new level. Adding to its appeal is Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet, a tool that allows users to manage assets across Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) seamlessly. Whether it’s a freelancer accepting payments from global clients or an investor consolidating assets, Qubetics makes life easier for everyone. Businesses can even tokenise their assets to unlock liquidity, opening new doors for innovation and investment. The numbers are just as impressive as the technology. At $0.025 in its 10th presale stage, a $100 investment in $TICS could grow to $871 if it reaches $0.25 by presale’s end. Analysts predict $TICS could skyrocket to $15 after its mainnet launch, turning that same $100 into $58,213. With 251 million tokens already sold, Qubetics is clearly one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024 . Avalanche (AVAX): Redefining DeFi Speed and Scalability Avalanche has solidified its position as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains, making it a favourite for DeFi developers. Recent upgrades to its Subnets feature allow developers to create customised blockchains tailored to specific use cases, further enhancing its appeal. This flexibility makes Avalanche a go-to choice for decentralised finance platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming ecosystems. Imagine a DeFi platform offering instant loans without the hefty fees or delays associated with traditional finance. Avalanche’s high throughput ensures seamless transactions, which has attracted projects like Aave and Curve to its ecosystem. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second without compromising security is a game-changer. Avalanche offers steady growth potential for investors. A $100 investment in AVAX could deliver respectable returns as its ecosystem continues to expand. However, compared to Qubetics’ multifaceted approach and explosive ROI predictions, Avalanche feels more like a safe, slow-growth option. While AVAX excels in speed and scalability, it doesn’t offer the comprehensive solutions or massive growth potential that make $TICS one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024. Terra (LUNA): A Comeback Story in Progress Terra has had its ups and downs, but recent efforts to revitalise its ecosystem have shown promise. Focused on stabilising its network and rebuilding trust, Terra has introduced new DeFi protocols and expanded partnerships. Its unique algorithmic stablecoins continue to attract users seeking decentralised financial solutions. Picture a small business owner in a developing country using Terra’s blockchain for cross-border payments. The network’s low fees and fast transaction speeds make it a practical choice. Terra’s focus on financial inclusion sets it apart, though its past challenges still cast a shadow over its growth prospects. Terra is an affordable entry point for investors willing to bet on a recovery. A $100 investment in LUNA might yield decent returns as the ecosystem stabilises and adoption grows. However, it lacks the innovation and explosive potential of Qubetics. While Terra’s comeback is noteworthy, it’s not yet in the same league as $TICS, which stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024 . Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Pack In the race between Qubetics , Avalanche, and Terra, Qubetics emerges as the clear winner. Its decentralised VPN and multi-chain wallet are game-changing innovations, offering practical solutions for businesses, professionals, and everyday users. While Avalanche shines in DeFi and Terra makes strides in recovery, neither can match the breadth of innovation and explosive ROI potential of $TICS. With $TICS priced at $0.025 and a 10% price hike just days away, now is the time to act. Analysts predict returns that could turn even modest investments into substantial wealth. Don’t miss your chance to secure $TICS tokens and be part of the blockchain revolution. Act now before the presale ends and the price surges.

The token has made strides with a 20.97% rally today, putting SHIB back on the radar and setting high hopes for December, topping off the past months gains at 84.81%. Indeed, Shiba Inu has been propelled to the forefront of the meme coin space , with today’s 325% increase in trading volume, nearing $6.5 billion. SHIB Price Analysis: Could Shiba Inu Lose Another Zero By 2025? The 400% SHIB burn increase and $0.00003 valuation is just the beginning, according to a recent X post by popular analyst Oscar Ramos. The analyst emphasizes that market conditions are aligning favorably for SHIB. He noted that the token has maintained strong support levels despite recent market fluctuations. SHIB / USDT 4H chart, flag pattern breakout. Source: Binance. These supports have formed a bullish flag pattern, with today’s breakout being the climax. Fully materialized, the pattern sets a near-term price target of $0.000035, an 8.76% increase from current prices. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 80, signaling overbought conditions, does raise the potential for a correction. Looking wider, Ramos notes that while Dogecoin maintains a $22 billion market cap, SHIB’s $10 billion valuation suggests room for potential growth based on historical patterns. For the remainder of 2024, he cautions against expectations of breaking another zero within the next 60 days. The analyst considers this a more realistic target for 2025. However, technical strength, combined with upcoming market catalysts, including the FOMC meetings and CPI data releases, lays the grounds that another rally may be imminent. This Early Opportunity Could Be the Better Play While another SHIB price rally is certainly appealing, it is new meme coins that are leading gains this cycle. As “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $ACT and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, strategic investors are looking to newer, high-potential low cap meme coins . Among them, Catslap ($SLAP) stands out as a credible contender to the likes of Popcat, Mogcat, and Mew. Catslap is far beyond a mere meme coin; it’s an addictive gamified experience that calls its holders into competition, clicking to increase their country’s score and move up the Slapometer.

As digital collectibles regain their momentum, the $562 million recorded in sales marks a significant improvement over October’s figures . This upward trend represents the highest monthly sales volume since May 2024, when NFTs hit $599 million in sales. Though still shy of the peak reached earlier in the year, the market shows promising signs of revival after a prolonged slump. CryptoPunks Lead NFT Revival After reaching a staggering $1.6 billion in sales back in March, the NFT market entered a period of decline, hitting its lowest point in seven months. Each subsequent month saw a drop in sales volume until November’s impressive rebound . The resurgence of digital collectibles reflects the broader recovery in the crypto market. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in the NFT space. Among the standout performers in November, CryptoPunks shone brightly. The iconic collection saw a dramatic rise in its floor price throughout November. It climbed from 26.3 Ethereum, valued at $73,000 on November 1, to 39.7 Ethereum, which was around $147,000 by the end of the month. This 50% jump in price was accompanied by a remarkable 392% increase in sales volume, reaching over $49 million. The number of transactions also saw a significant rise, up by 213% compared to October, with 388 sales recorded during the month. Another collection capturing attention in November was Pudgy Penguins, which saw its monthly sales volume soar by 262%, reaching $16 million. The floor price of the collection also rose significantly. It increased by 49%, from 8.7 Ethereum on November 1 to 13 Ethereum totaling $48,000 by November 30. This surge highlights the growing demand for rare and unique digital assets in the NFT market. Ethereum Leads, Bitcoin Booms Ethereum continued to dominate the NFT landscape in November, with a total sales volume of $216 million, up 12% from October. However, it was Bitcoin that saw the most impressive growth among the top blockchains. It recorded a staggering 99.44% increase in sales volume to reach $186 million. This marks a notable shift as Bitcoin becomes an increasingly popular network for NFT transactions. The Broader Blockchain Landscape Drive Surge Beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin, other blockchains like Solana, Mythos Chain, Immutable, Polygon, and BNB Chain collectively contributed $162.9 million in NFT sales. These networks show that, while Ethereum remains the leader, the NFT market is diversifying, with several blockchains experiencing notable gains. As the NFT market continues to recover and expand, these figures demonstrate that digital collectibles are far from fading. With impressive price increases, rising sales volumes, and growing interest from both collectors and investors , the future of NFTs looks brighter than ever.

Targets and Timeline Venturefounder projected Ether’s first price target at $5,349, followed by $6,457, with a third target of $7,238 expected by the end of Q1 2025. This represents a potential 97% increase from Ether’s current price of $3,669, as reported by CoinMarketCap at the time of publication. Market Factors Despite a 47% price spike since Nov. 1, Venturefounder noted that Ether’s price has not “exploded” yet due to the U.S. dollar index (DXY) holding strong. “DXY has been trending between 100-106 this cycle, but it is about to have a bigger breakdown than past cycles; ETH will explode,” they explained.

Initially launched with the goal of revolutionizing global finance, Libra faced significant resistance from lawmakers and regulators worldwide.

He claimed that despite support from some Federal Reserve governors, including Chair Jay Powell, Yellen’s resistance marked the project’s turning point. “Janet Yellen warned Powell against allowing the project to continue, fearing political backlash,” Marcus wrote. “This effectively became the moment Libra was killed.” He also described how the Federal Reserve subsequently organized calls with participating banks, discouraging them from supporting the initiative. How Libra Was Killed. I never shared this publicly before, but since @pmarca opened the floodgates on @joerogan ’s pod, it feels appropriate to shed more light on this. As a reminder, Libra (then Diem) was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain paired with a… — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) November 30, 2024 The broader regulatory landscape also added pressure. Politico reported that Facebook’s dual role as a stablecoin issuer and a commercial entity alarmed regulators, who warned of potential economic power concentration. In a November 2021 report, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets stressed that this combination could pose significant risks to the financial system. The fallout from Libra’s collapse saw many of its former staff move on to other blockchain ventures. Key team members joined projects like Aptos and Sui, two Layer 1 blockchains utilizing the Move programming language developed by Facebook for Libra. Marcus himself has since launched Lightspark, a startup focused on enhancing Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. The story of Libra highlights the challenges of introducing disruptive technologies within a heavily regulated financial ecosystem. While its vision of a stablecoin transforming global finance may have ended prematurely, its legacy continues to influence new blockchain projects. US Crypto Owners Expect More Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players.

Robert Kiyosaki predicts BTC plunges to $60k,"Financial author Robert Kiyosaki has suggested that the BTC price could crash to $60,000 as it struggles to breach the $100,000 milestone. The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author’s analysis comes amid increasing market speculation about Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) next major price movement. Kiyosaki shared his market perspective through X and stated that any potential downturn would represent a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern.

At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 However, he maintained an optimistic long-term outlook. Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin could reach approximately $250,000 by 2025. He stated that his investment strategy is focused on accumulation rather than price speculation. In a previous statement from Nov. 30, Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, it could become increasingly inaccessible to middle-class and lower-income investors. He suggests that institutional investors, including corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds, would then dominate Bitcoin acquisition.

Lee also added that the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a U.S. strategic reserve asset could fundamentally alter its market position. Drawing parallels with MicroStrategy’s successful implementation of Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset, Lee suggests that government adoption could similarly validate and legitimize cryptocurrency investments. Lee mentioned that this institutional adoption could potentially drive Bitcoin’s value beyond current predictions. This is especially true if the U.S. government proceeds with plans to acquire a significant Bitcoin position.

37097742,https://finbold.com/?p=216209,1733071809,R. Kiyosaki warns ‘Bitcoin to crash’ as $100k push stalls,"Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has cautioned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will likely crash as the asset’s push toward the $100,000 milestone appears to have stalled. According to Kiyosaki, if the leading cryptocurrency fails to break into new record highs, investors should anticipate a possible plunge to the $60,000 level, he said in a post on X on December 1. Interestingly, Kiyosaki, a Bitcoin bull , does not view this potential crash as a setback. Instead, he considers it an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset. He emphasized that the current price, just below the $100,000 mark, is less significant than an individual’s total amount of Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more,” he said. Kiyosaki Bitcoin prediction Overall, Kiyosaki maintained a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, projecting it will see significant upside in the coming months, with a predicted high of $250,000 in 2025. This optimistic forecast adds to his varied past predictions for the asset. As reported by Finbold, the financial educator previously predicted Bitcoin would trade at $500,000 in 2024 based on an analysis by an unnamed artificial intelligence (AI) tool. However, some of his forecasts may fall short, as he had also expected Bitcoin to reach $300,000 in 2024—a now seemingly unlikely target. Meanwhile, Kiyosaki’s prediction of a potential crash comes alongside his urging investors to take advantage of the current valuations. He warned that once the cryptocurrency surpasses the $100,000 mark, it may become too expensive for the average investor, with ownership likely dominated by the ultra-wealthy. To this end, he encouraged investors to embrace a ‘Fear of Missing Out’ ( FOMO ) strategy and acquire Bitcoin before it’s too late. However, investors should be reminded that FOMO carries risks, as this approach can lead to financial losses if it causes individuals to spend beyond their means. Despite these warnings, Kiyosaki remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential role in the financial world. He has praised its ability to protect wealth amid his long-standing projection of a broader market crash and believes Bitcoin will play this role alongside gold and silver. While Kiyosaki advocates for Bitcoin accumulation, legendary trader Peter Brandt has suggested that expectations of BTC’s potential to deliver financial freedom might be overstated. According to Brandt, Bitcoin’s bull cycles have significantly ‘degenerated in magnitude,’ indicating the asset’s potential for significant profits may be waning. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $97,359, with consolidation below $100,000 persisting. The asset has gained 0.7% and 1% on the daily and weekly charts, respectively.

Who is Next?,"The altcoin sector continues to register massive gains, with Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Brett (BRETT) making substantial movements. With Bitcoin’s dominance declining, the market prepares for the altcoin season to move in. Bitcoin’s dominance is declining after recently reaching its peak, indicating investors are turning their focus to smaller alternative projects in hopes of finding the next big gainer. Let’s look at altcoin projects that are currently making waves for their impressive gains and potential for future growth. Ripple (XRP) Revival Continues Ripple (XRP) has witnessed one of its most profitable months in a long while after news of Gary Gensler’s imminent resignation emerged. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” XRP gained a whopping 265% in the past month, surging 41% in the past week. XRP currently trades at $1.89 . Brett (BRETT) Gains Over 50% in the Past Week Base Network memecoins recently uprooted the memecoin market, which has primarily been dominated by Solana-based memecoins. Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 chain, is becoming an increasingly popular platform to launch memecoins, and BRETT is the chain’s most successful coin with a market cap of $2.3 billion. BRETT gained over 51% in the past week and a whopping 500% in the past year. While the Base Chain’s ecosystem rapidly expands, it provides the foundation for BRETT’s success by allowing it to leverage the expertise and resources of other projects on the chain. BRETT is expected to surge exponentially as the Base Chain grows. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surges Amid Updates to Shibarium Bridge Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained an impressive 20% in the 24-hour charts as developers successfully rolled out enhanced security upgrades to Shiba Inu’s Shibarium bridge. Shibarium is Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, which enables seamless and secure token transfers between Ethereum and Shibarium. The bridge will also undergo a hard fork next week to optimize network performance, improve transaction speeds and address scalability concerns. SHIB, the native token of Shiba Inu, is one of the top-selling memecoins by market cap. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 225%. SHIB is one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins, which quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 10th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB surged in popularity thanks to its dedicated community of investors, its charm, and the support of industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Nears Fundraising Target Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $590,000 and will soon reach fundraising goals. Husky Inu’s presale success is powered by its unique qualities and future plans, aiming to its own Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the projects and completing minor tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. Husky Inu’s Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and, in doing so, will improve the utility and value of HINU for its holders.

37118683,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387797,1733071380,"2025’s Under-the-Radar Millionaire Makers? Pepe Coin, Toncoin or Emerging Blockchain Las Vegas","The post 2025’s Under-the-Radar Millionaire Makers? Pepe Coin, Toncoin or Emerging Blockchain Las Vegas appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The surging crypto market has all eyes on the big rallies of the current top altcoins. However, analysts are pointing to three under-the-radar millionaire makers that are on track to generate even bigger returns in 2025: Pepe coin (PEPE), Toncoin (TON) and GambleFi protocol Rollblock (RBLK). Rollblock’s growth is looking particularly promising, with a 10,000% rally forecasted for when its crypto presale ends. Pepe’s Meme Coin Momentum on Course for 2025 Rally The Pepe coin price is already rallying hard this month, but analysts are projecting even more growth to come. Pepe coin is up almost 100% this month after a small 8% drop for the week. The Pepe coin price took off in March of this year, and it has rarely paused its rally since. Pepe is now up 1,600% in 2024. This incredible momentum makes it a top-performing meme coin and the sector’s best candidate for continued growth in 2025. Toncoin to Rally on 2025 GameFi Resurgence Toncoin was a top altcoin earlier in 2024 before the GameFi rally faded last month. Now the Toncoin price is trailing the market with only 25% growth this month. However, analysts are predicting a resurgence in the GameFi rally that will take the Toncoin price to new all-time highs in 2025. Toncoin remains the largest GameFi platform by far, with access to almost one billion Telegram users from around the world. If Toncoin can crack GameFi’s monetization issues in 2025, then it could see over 1,000% growth. Rollblock Dubbed ‘Blockchain Las Vegas’ for Community Approach to Crypto Gambling Rollblock’s potential is even bigger than those of Pepe coin and Toncoin. This top altcoin is known as the ‘Blockchain Las Vegas’ for the way that it has recreated that real, live casino feel from the comfort and convenience of the home and phone. The secret to Rollblock’s success is how it has integrated its vibrant social media ecosystem directly into its casino platform of 7,000 provably fair games. This creates a real sense of community and excitement, where users never feel like they are playing alone. Rollblock enhances this experience with fresh events and giveaways every week. Rollblock’s ongoing sports prediction league is an example that is going viral for all the fun and profit the community is enjoying. Rollblock also has a community ownership model that sees up to 30% of the platform’s weekly revenue returned to holders through a system of buybacks. The value of RBLK is increased by burning 60% of these buybacks, and income is created by employing the rest of the buybacks as staking rewards. Rollblock’s rapid expansion in the $500 billion gambling industry is driving these price predictions of over 10,000% growth from its current price of $0.037 when its crypto presale ends. With only four stages left to go in its presale, this could occur as early as January of 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

37097492,https://crypto.news/?p=14315031,1733071160,How layer 1 blockchains are leading the 2024 bull run – and who’s winning,"What makes Layer 1 blockchains the centerpiece of the current bull run, and can they prove their utility beyond speculation? Layer 1s hit $2.8 trillion Layer 1 blockchains have emerged as the focal point of the ongoing crypto bull run. According to data from CoinGecko, these foundational platforms have surged an astonishing 7,000% in value since January 2024. This milestone comes on the heels of Donald Trump’s election victory, which appears to have reignited enthusiasm within the crypto space. As of Nov. 29, L1 blockchains collectively command a market cap exceeding $2.8 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ), the dominant L1, accounts for nearly 70% of this market share. Trading at $98,300, BTC recently set a new all-time high of $99,600 on Nov. 22. Ethereum ( ETH ), often hailed as the backbone of decentralized applications, has also seen significant gains. Up by over 34%, ETH is currently trading at $3,630. Other L1 platforms are riding the bullish wave as well. Solana ( SOL ), a key competitor to Ethereum, reached an all-time high of $263.83 on Nov. 23 before pulling back slightly to $244, marking a 40% monthly gain. Cardano ( ADA ) has taken the market by surprise with an impressive 200% surge over the past month, now trading at $1.09. Emerging platforms like Hedera ( HBAR ) and Mantra ( OM ) have also shown exceptional performance, posting gains of 220% and 138%, respectively. Mantra has been particularly remarkable, soaring over 6,000% since January. It peaked at $4.45 on Nov. 18 before retreating by 19.3%, currently trading at $3.54. In contrast, Binance Coin ( BNB ), another major L1 platform, has lagged behind its peers. Despite trading at $658, it has delivered only a modest 10% gain over the past 30 days, making it a notable underperformer in this rally. Are these gains a reflection of genuine growth in blockchain adoption and utility, or are they primarily speculative? Let’s dive deeper. Ethereum’s TVL leadership To gauge the performance of L1 blockchains beyond mere price action, it’s essential to consider their total value locked. Essentially, total value locked ( TVL ) serves as a barometer of trust and activity within a blockchain ecosystem. High TVL typically signals robust adoption of DeFi applications such as lending, borrowing, and staking Low TVL may indicate diminished usage or waning interest. Ethereum remains the unchallenged leader in this space, boasting over $70 billion in TVL as of Nov. 29 — an impressive 44% increase from $47.5 billion on Nov. 5. ETH 3-month TVL chart | Source: DeFi LIama A substantial portion of Ethereum’s growth stems from Lido ( LDO ), Ethereum’s premier liquid staking platform, which now accounts for nearly $35 billion of the network’s TVL. Liquid staking allows users to stake their ETH while maintaining liquidity via derivative tokens, enabling further participation in DeFi activities. Solana has also shown notable progress, with its TVL climbing over 50% to $9.17 billion, bringing it tantalizingly close to its all-time high of $10 billion, last achieved in November 2021. SOL 3-month TVL chart | Source: DeFi LIama In contrast, Binance Smart Chain ( BSC ) has seen more modest growth. Its TVL increased by 17% over the past 30 days to $5.57 billion. However, this figure is still significantly lower than its November 2021 peak of over $22 billion. BNB 3-month TVL chart | Source: DeFi LIama Meanwhile, Cardano has reached a milestone with its TVL hitting an all-time high of approximately $619 million. This marks a dramatic improvement from its sub-$1 million TVL levels in January 2022. ADA lifetime TVL chart | Source: DeFi LIama The fee race: Who’s winning? Blockchain fees have long been a vital metric for assessing the activity, utility, and adoption of L1 platforms. They represent not only the cost users are willing to pay to transact but also the demand for block space and the overall health of the ecosystem. During the bull run of 2020 and 2021, Ethereum dominated this space. Its fee revenue highlighted its position as the premier blockchain for dApps and DeFi. In late 2020, Ethereum consistently generated over $1 million in daily fees, leaving competitors like Tron ( TRX ), which managed only a few thousand dollars a day, far behind. At that time, Binance Smart Chain and Solana had yet to emerge as key players in this metric. By 2021, Ethereum’s fee revenue averaged between $20 million and $50 million daily during the second-half of the year. Meanwhile, BSC generated $3 million to $10 million in daily fees, while Tron followed with a more modest $300,000 to $800,000. Solana, still in its infancy as a competitor, collected a relatively minor $100,000 to $200,000 daily in fees. Fast forward to November 2024; Solana consistently outperformed Ethereum in daily fees throughout the month—a gigantic milestone reflecting its growing adoption and increasing network activity. As of Nov. 28: Solana recorded $7.4 million in daily fees. Ethereum hovered around $6.19 million. Tron came in third with $2 million. BSC lagged behind at $680,000. Ethereum’s relative decline in fee dominance is perhaps the most revealing shift. While it remains a powerhouse, several factors have contributed to its reduced share of the fee market. The growing adoption of layer 2 and layer 3 scaling solutions has starkly lowered the fee burden on Ethereum’s mainnet. Additionally, waning interest from retail investors in recent months has further dampened activity. What was once high fees justified by Ethereum’s unparalleled DeFi ecosystem are now being bypassed as users seek alternatives that offer comparable utility at a fraction of the cost. The current state of the dApp ecosystem The dApp ecosystem serves as the ultimate proving ground for L1 platforms, showcasing their ability to drive activity and engage users. By analyzing transaction volumes and key contributors, we can uncover what fuels these networks and how they stack up. The data is as of Nov. 29. Ethereum: Dominating volume, not value Ethereum remains the heavyweight in DeFi, generating $175 billion in transaction volume across 4,844 dApps in the past month. Two standout platforms, Uniswap ( UNI ) V3 and 1inch, account for the majority of this activity. Uniswap V3 alone processed $85 billion, solidifying its position as the cornerstone of liquidity provision and token swaps. Meanwhile, 1inch ( 1INCH ) contributed $11 billion, attracting users with its efficient aggregation across multiple liquidity pools. The data suggests that Ethereum continues to appeal to institutional and high-net-worth users who value its reliability and deep liquidity. However, with only 1.76 million unique active wallets, it’s evident that high fees and scalability limitations are driving smaller users toward L2 solutions or alternative L1 platforms. Ethereum remains the ecosystem for “big money,” but its retail appeal is diminishing as users seek more affordable options. BNB Chain: The retail hub BNB Chain has cemented its reputation as a retail-friendly ecosystem, processing $38.2 billion in volume from 5,555 dApps. With 2.41 million unique active wallets—surpassing Ethereum—it’s clear that BNB Chain resonates with everyday users who prioritize low costs and ease of use. PancakeSwap V2 is the standout performer, generating $11 billion in volume, nearly 29% of the chain’s total. BNB Chain also recorded 14.73 million transactions over the past month, highlighting its capacity for high-frequency, small-value interactions. While these figures are impressive, the average transaction size is far smaller than Ethereum’s, reflecting BNB Chain’s role as a hub for casual traders rather than institutional players. Moreover, regulatory scrutiny and government probes on Binance have also hindered its progress. To regain momentum, BNB Chain will need to attract more high-value projects. Solana: Growing engagement Solana dominates in raw activity, boasting 113.66 million unique active wallets and 594.7 million transactions over the past month. These figures far surpass its competitors in sheer engagement. However, its $8.6 billion transaction volume indicates that the average transaction value remains modest. The largest contributor to Solana’s volume is Pump.fun , a meme-driven platform responsible for $3.1 billion—about 36% of the chain’s total. Solana’s focus on high-frequency, low-cost interactions makes it a hub for speculative and experimental dApps. Despite its impressive user engagement, Solana’s relatively low total transaction volume highlights its limited penetration into high-value DeFi markets. Even so, its rapid growth suggests it’s becoming the go-to platform for speculative, retail-friendly dApps. Tron: The stablecoin workhorse Tron processed $5.45 billion in volume from 63,660 unique active wallets and 953,220 transactions last month. While modest compared to Ethereum and BNB Chain, Tron’s strength lies in its specialization. As the preferred blockchain for USDT transactions, Tron benefits directly from Tether’s massive daily trading volumes. This focus on stablecoin transfers has ensured Tron’s relevance, but it also reveals a potential vulnerability. Without diversification into areas like gaming or broader DeFi applications, Tron risks being pigeonholed as the “stablecoin chain.” Cardano: Slowly finding its feet Cardano’s dApp ecosystem remains in its infancy but is beginning to show promise. With just 60 dApps, it generated $29 million in transaction volume from 40,250 unique active wallets in the past month. While these numbers are modest compared to its peers, they reflect meaningful progress for a blockchain often criticized for its slow pace of development. Cardano’s focus on security and sustainability could attract developers and users over time. However, it still has a long way to go before competing with platforms like Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Solana. Its future success hinges on expanding its dApp ecosystem and adapting to the evolving demands of the market. The road ahead The current bull market has thrust L1 blockchains into the limelight, highlighting both their strengths and their vulnerabilities. Ethereum’s dominance in high-value transactions, Solana’s retail-driven activity, BNB Chain’s accessibility, Tron’s stablecoin specialization, and Cardano’s measured progress collectively illustrate a dynamic and evolving ecosystem. However, the path forward will hinge on how these platforms tackle key challenges. Scalability remains a critical issue, as does the ability to attract and retain developers while steering off intensifying competition. As prices continue to climb and adoption broadens, the true test for L1s will be sustaining this momentum. Proving their utility beyond speculative cycles will be crucial in cementing their place in the crypto space. Whether this bull run signals the dawn of a transformative era or simply another chapter in crypto’s unpredictable journey depends on how these platforms adapt to meet the demands of an ever-growing global audience. The stage is set, but the story remains unwritten.

37097272,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620687,1733070717,"Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong calls AML regulations a U.S. policy failure, believes Elon Musk can fix it","Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has branded America’s current Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations an economic disaster. He said these rules bleed $213 billion from the global economy every year while failing miserably to curb criminal activity. Brian cited a report from the United Nations, revealing that just 0.2% of illicit transactions are intercepted. “Sounds like a job for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E),” Brian quipped. He laid bare the root cause of the widespread “debanking” phenomenon: regulators have handed the job of enforcing money-laundering laws to financial institutions. Banks risk nine- or ten-figure fines if they slip up. This has made them hyper-cautious, driving legitimate businesses and individuals out of the banking system entirely. Crypto industry stands together against US debanking As we reported just a day earlier, Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano and Ethereum, has also spoken out against the coordinated assault on crypto. He took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn the community that the crackdown is actually worse than anyone thought. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons,” he wrote. “It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” Charles linked the current situation to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a modern iteration of the controversial Obama-era program that cut off banking for industries deemed high-risk. Back then, it was payday lenders and firearms dealers. Today, it’s blockchain companies. While Operation Chokepoint officially ended in 2017, crypto insiders claim it was revived in 2021, this time with a focus on strangling the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). Gabriel Abed, a chairman at Binance, shared his own horror story. His accounts at First Citizens Caribbean Bank—accounts he had maintained for more than a decade—were abruptly shut down. The reason? He had received a Bitcoin-related deposit. Abed said the bank’s CEO admitted they were afraid of damaging their relationships with American correspondent banks. Global banks are severing ties with crypto firms to comply with “standards” set by their U.S. counterparts. Charles urged the community to unite and push for legislative change. “We have a small window of time to get a law passed,” he warned.

37097183,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656168,1733070620,Dogecoin Ready To Hit $1 – Price Struggles To Break Above Major Resistance,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading below a key resistance level, signaling the potential for a bullish breakout. However, the price has struggled to surpass this critical barrier, creating uncertainty about the next major move. For Dogecoin to achieve new highs and rekindle investor enthusiasm, breaking this resistance is essential. Top crypto analyst Scofield recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s readiness to test the psychological $1 mark. According to Scofield, DOGE’s recent price action shows consolidation near resistance, which often precedes a decisive move. He emphasized that a breakout above this level could ignite a rally, pushing the price toward its long-awaited milestone. Despite this optimism, traders should approach with caution. The struggle to clear resistance indicates that the market may require stronger buying pressure or a catalyst to trigger the next leg up. If Dogecoin fails to break through, it risks a retrace to lower levels, potentially dampening current bullish sentiment. As the broader market shows signs of recovery, Dogecoin remains a focal point for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. The coming days will likely determine whether DOGE can reclaim its momentum and make a serious run toward the $1 level. Dogecoin Pushes Above Key Levels Dogecoin has surged past critical supply levels, positioning itself for a potential rally that could push prices significantly higher. Currently, DOGE is eyeing the last major resistance zone that must be breached to confirm the start of a new bullish cycle. This level represents a decisive point, and a successful breakout would likely attract substantial buying pressure. Top analyst Scofield, known for his accurate technical predictions , recently shared insights on X regarding Dogecoin’s current setup. His analysis highlights a bullish triangle pattern forming on DOGE’s chart, a structure often indicative of an imminent breakout. According to Scofield, the pattern’s apex suggests that Dogecoin is nearing a decisive move, with the psychological $1 mark set as the next major target if the breakout materializes. Scofield’s technical analysis underscores key support levels that DOGE has successfully defended, reinforcing the asset’s bullish potential. The triangle pattern also reflects reduced selling pressure, aligning with growing optimism among traders. However, Scofield cautions that any failure to break above the resistance could lead to a retest of lower levels, delaying the anticipated rally. As Dogecoin captures increasing attention in the crypto market, all eyes remain on this pivotal resistance zone. Breaking above it would signal a renewed bullish momentum, setting the stage for DOGE to test and potentially surpass the $1 milestone. Technical Details: DOGE Ready To Rally Again Dogecoin is at $0.426 following an 18% surge to test local supply at $0.43. This critical resistance level has proven challenging for DOGE, as the price has struggled to break above it for over two weeks. Despite the recent upward momentum, the market remains cautious, with analysts highlighting the significance of a decisive breakout above $0.43. A successful push past this resistance could set the stage for a massive rally, attracting renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors. Historically, such breakouts in Dogecoin’s price action have triggered significant upward movements, making this level a key focus for market participants. However, the inability to breach $0.43 could lead to further consolidation below this level, frustrating bullish sentiment. Adding to the uncertainty is the risk of a potential correction. If DOGE fails to maintain its current levels or faces increased selling pressure, it could revisit lower price points, possibly retesting supports around $0.38 or lower. Analysts emphasize the need for patience, as Dogecoin’s next major move will likely hinge on breaking the $0.43 resistance. For now, DOGE’s trajectory remains uncertain, but the potential for a breakout keeps it on the radar of traders and investors alike.

According to onchain data provided by Lookonchain, a crypto whale made a huge profit from a trade by spending just 1 SOL token. According to the data, this crypto whale spent 1 SOL, or about $169 at the time, to buy a memecoin called Mundi. Following the rise in the Mundi token, this lucky whale's assets increased by 2,580x to $435,000. However, it is important to note that most memecoin investors are losing money and this whale may also be an insider trader for the token in question. These tokens are usually created only for pump and dump schemes. Related News: Good News About Cryptocurrencies from South Korea - It was a Source of Concern According to the data, before this purchase by the whale, another memecoin called Ban emerged and became the subject of a huge FOMO. The whale wallet did not succumb to this FOMO and instead turned to Mundi, an older memecoin. When the whale wallet made the purchase, the market value of this altcoin was around $8,500. He bought 19.79 million Mundi for 1 SOL and held on to his tokens for a while without selling them. Four days ago, after the rise, he started to sell his assets and sold 18.19 million Mundi tokens for 1,428 SOL, or around $336,000. The whale currently has 1.6 million Mundi tokens, or approximately $99,000 worth of tokens. *This is not investment advice.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK.

37096392,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620680,1733068862,America has a debt disaster – Just how far has it spiraled?,"America’s national debt is a monster that keeps growing. At $36 trillion, it’s the highest in history, with no signs of slowing down. In 16 years, the debt-to-GDP ratio has doubled, now sitting at 121%. Compare that to World War II, when it maxed out at 119%. Back then, the country was fighting global tyranny. Now? The debt is ballooning because of poor fiscal planning and relentless spending. Since 2008, the federal debt has skyrocketed by $26.6 trillion, nearly tripling, while the economy only grew by $14.6 trillion. That’s a $12 trillion shortfall. Economists predict even worse to come. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says the debt-to-GDP ratio could hit 131% by 2034, assuming the economy avoids a recession. Debt is eating America’s budget alive Debt servicing is bleeding America dry. Every single day, the government spends over $1 billion just on interest payments. This year, the cost is expected to top $1 trillion, more than what the nation spends on defense. Think about that. America is putting more money into its debt interest than into securing its borders or upgrading its military. The situation’s even worse thanks to high interest rates. Since the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has increased rates, making borrowing more expensive. This is pushing up costs everywhere, from mortgages to groceries. Right now, the debt-to-GDP ratio is at 125%. Experts think it could hit 200% in a few years. That would mean the debt is twice the size of the entire economy. When that happens, the government will spend more on interest payments than on things people actually need, like infrastructure and education. On average, every American owes $108,000. That’s money being sucked away from investments that could build a better future. Instead of funding new roads, schools, or tech, the cash is going to creditors. Trump’s second term faces a storm President Donald Trump is walking into his second term with an economic time bomb. His administration is scrambling to control spending. Enter the Department of Government Efficiency, a new initiative led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Elon says they can slash billions from the budget. Proposed cuts include slashing public broadcasting and pulling funding from advocacy groups tied to abortion rights. But here’s the issue: Trump still wants more tax cuts. His new plan includes slashing corporate taxes to 15%. Critics are already sharpening their knives. They say it’ll blow up the deficit even more. Jessica Fulton from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies says these cuts would favor the wealthy and leave the country in a deeper financial hole. Even some Republican lawmakers are uneasy, calling the plan reckless when the deficit has already tripled. High interest rates are also creating roadblocks. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, a key benchmark for borrowing, has jumped from 0.6% in 2020 to 4.4% recently. This means the government’s borrowing costs are through the roof. The same applies to everyday Americans. The administration isn’t out of ideas, though. One controversial plan involves refusing to spend money already approved by Congress. Another proposal targets funding cuts for energy and environmental projects tied to the Inflation Reduction Act. Both ideas could face legal challenges, but desperate times do call for desperate measures. The debt spiral threatens long-term growth The pandemic made everything worse. America’s debt jumped by $16 trillion during COVID-19, a surge unlike anything seen before. Over the past year, the debt has grown by $6.3 billion a day. That’s over $262 million an hour. Let that sink in. The debt isn’t just a domestic issue. It’s affecting America’s role on the global stage. Investors are starting to worry about the dollar’s stability. If confidence in the U.S. economy weakens, it definitely will affect global markets, causing chaos everywhere. From equities to crypto, everything will shake. And the global economy itself might tumble.

According to Delphi Digital’s latest report shared with CryptoPotato , in 2024 alone, daily transactions on Base have soared by 1,600%, climbing from 372,000 at the start of January to over 6.63 million in October. This makes Base a standout performer across several key metrics, including total value locked (TVL), active users, and transaction activity, where it has grown faster than the overall on-chain economy. Surge in Base’s Adoption Base’s TVL rose from $439 million in January 2024 to $2.51 billion by October, reflecting a 470% increase. Its share of the global on-chain TVL also expanded significantly, from 1.07% to 3.59%. While Base’s on-chain activity has been fueled by a rise in active addresses and stablecoin usage, its relatively modest TVL compared to larger networks highlighted its unique focus on non-monetary applications. The network’s usage boost is notably linked to the popularity of Aerodrome, which currently accounts for more than 40% of the network’s total TVL. Base’s growth in active addresses has been extraordinary, with weekly active addresses rising from 300,000 in January to 6.61 million at the end of October, a surge of 2,100%. This increase has significantly boosted Base’s share of all on-chain weekly active addresses, jumping from 1.6% to 11%. The figures for the number of new daily active addresses on Base surged by 5,300%, rising from 8,320 in January to 450,000 by October. This has resulted in the Layer 2 network’s market share of new daily active addresses growing from 1.2% to 6.5%. From January to October, Base’s daily transactions have skyrocketed from 2.1 million to 42.34 million, an increase of more than 1,900%. This growth has expanded Base’s market share in daily transaction volume from 0.67% to 9%. Delphi Digital said that the uptick not only signals Base’s increasing adoption and affordability but also depicts its ability to thrive alongside the success of other networks, such as those in the Superchain framework. Base’s Stablecoin Adoption Base has also seen a rapid acceleration in stablecoin adoption . As of November 11, its cumulative weekly stablecoin volume had grown from $620 million in January to $55 billion, representing a staggering over 8,800% increase. This growth has propelled the Layer 2 network’s stablecoin market share from 0.7% at the beginning of the year to 18% by November. “This increase in Base stablecoin volume is representative of Base’s efforts to increase network capacity while driving down costs. As a result, Base is well positioned to process mass payments between consumers and merchants utilizing stablecoins as a universal medium of exchange.” The post Base’s Rapid Expansion: 1,600% Growth in Daily TX Defines Ethereum Layer 2’s Breakout Year appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bases-rapid-expansion-1600-growth-in-daily-tx-defines-ethereum-layer-2s-breakout-year/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37095801.jpeg

Serious crypto investors should pay attention now as the presale phase reaches its final stages. Record-Breaking Exchange Support Artemis (ARTMS) has achieved something remarkable in the crypto presale world by securing deals with seven major cryptocurrency exchanges before its ICO phase ends. Seven Major Exchange Partnerships The partnerships show a balanced mix of Tier 1 and Tier 2 exchanges that serve different markets worldwide: Exchange Tier Market Focus Latoken Tier 1 Global CoinW Tier 1 Asian Markets Biconomy Tier 2 International Weex Tier 2 Emerging Markets Deepcoin Tier 1 Global FameEx Tier 2 European Focus UZX Tier 1 Cross-Regional Price Performance During Presale The presale phase has shown impressive results with Artemis collecting $920,000 . Early investors have seen their investments grow by 180% , making ARTMS one of the year’s best presale opportunities. Market Impact and Trading Volume Projections The multi-exchange strategy brings several benefits to the market: Bigger liquidity pools spread across platforms Better market access through various trading pairs More stable prices through spread-out trading Easier entry points for new investors globally The platform will burn 14 billion tokens and cut supply by 30% within two weeks of launch. This combination of smart tokenomics and ready multi-exchange liquidity should lead to strong trading volumes after launch. Investment Analysis and ROI Potential The Artemis (ARTMS) presale shows impressive investment metrics that need immediate attention. Market confidence remains high as the project secured $920,000 in funding. This makes it one of the best crypto presales of 2024. Historical Presale Performance Metrics The project’s community has grown remarkably with 60,000 active members in platforms of all types. Such member involvement exceeds typical presale metrics and shows strong market interest. Key performance indicators reveal: Community growth rate: 37% month-over-month Average investor commitment: Substantially above industry standard Platform involvement: Top 10% among 2024 presales Early investor returns: 158% from the original price Post-Launch Price Predictions Multiple price forecasts and complete market research point to substantial growth potential through 2030: Year Conservative Average Optimistic 2024 $0.09 $0.14 $0.21 2025 $0.13 $0.18 $0.25 2030 $2.80 $3.33 $3.85 Artemis’s deflationary mechanism supports these projections. The mechanism will burn 14 billion tokens and reduce total supply by 30% within two weeks of launch. This critical factor could stimulate value appreciation, especially with the project’s multiple revenue streams and practical e-commerce utility. Technical Infrastructure Deep Dive A peek under Artemis’s technical hood shows why this presale crypto project has got so much attention. We analyzed the platform’s sophisticated blockchain architecture and security protocols to get a full picture. Security Measures and Audits Our security analysis shows multiple protection layers: Advanced Encryption : Implementation of AES-256 for stored data and TLS/SSL for transmission Smart Contract Verification : Professional audits by Infinity Blockchain Solutions with zero critical vulnerabilities Decentralized Storage : IPFS implementation ensuring data integrity and accessibility Multi-factor Authentication : Improved account protection protocols Artemis’s security infrastructure has earned a ‘secured’ rating, making it one of the most reliable crypto presale opportunities in 2024. Recent audit reports confirm zero critical vulnerabilities, showing its steadfast dedication to user asset protection. Strategic Token Economics Artemis (ARTMS) showcases a smart and practical approach to value creation and sustainability. Our analysis of the project’s tokenomics structure reveals a well-balanced distribution strategy that aims for long-term development. Distribution Framework and Allocations The token distribution analysis shows a strategic allocation of 100 billion ARTMS tokens: Purpose Allocation Amount Marketing Initiatives 25% 25B ARTMS Project Development 25% 25B ARTMS Presale Distribution 15% 15B ARTMS User Rewards 15% 15B ARTMS Liquidity Pool 10% 10B ARTMS Staking Rewards 10% 10B ARTMS Deflationary Mechanisms This crypto presale stands out with two powerful deflationary mechanisms. The project plans to burn 14 billion unsold tokens right after launch. A systematic reduction will then decrease the total supply by 30% within the first two weeks. These measures will create a lack of tokens that could drive up value for early investors. Staking Rewards and Benefits The staking system offers several advantages to long-term holders: Auto-compounded rewards through a sustainable yield generation system Boosted network security through participant incentives Lower price slippage through smart liquidity management Smart contract-verified rewards distribution Our audit review confirms that the staking smart contracts have achieved a ‘secured’ rating. This adds more confidence for investors in this best crypto presale of 2024. Conclusion ARTMS, a crypto presale project, has caught our attention with its detailed analysis. The project excels with exceptional exchange support, resilient infrastructure, and well-planned tokenomics. Market indicators point to growth opportunities ahead. Seven major exchanges have already partnered with the project, which raised $850,000 in its presale phase. ARTMS operates on six major networks with its multi-chain architecture. The project’s deflationary mechanisms look promising. A planned burn of 14 billion tokens and 30% supply reduction should create value for investors who get in early. The project’s staking infrastructure and security protocols show its steadfast dedication to sustainability. ARTMS deserves attention from investors looking to explore emerging crypto opportunities before launch. This comes from its clear distribution framework and professional audit outcomes.

37095344,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311200,1733067029,"Crypto Strategist Says Dogecoin Close to Confirming Pattern Breakout, Updates Forecast on Polkadot and FET","A closely followed crypto analyst believes Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is in a solid position to ignite fresh moves to the upside. Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 517,400 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE looks bullish as it trades within an ascending triangle pattern. The technical structure is often viewed as a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting that the asset is consolidating prior to a new upside burst. Says Rekt, “If this indeed turns out to be an ascending triangle on Dogecoin, then memecoins could enjoy another round of money flow. Needs a daily close above the pattern top ($0.43) to confirm a breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.432, slightly above the pattern’s horizontal resistance. Looking at the broader memecoin market, Rekt says that the popular crypto sector is starting to regain bullish momentum. “Recently, altcoins have been breaking old resistances and turning them into new support. But memecoins have recently been losing supports teasing turning them into resistances. But the way memecoins are rallying now, they may be reclaiming these supports.” Turning to the interoperability blockchain Polkadot ( DOT ), the trader highlights that it needs to flip a key resistance level into support to have a shot at witnessing more rallies. “Polkadot has performed a weekly close above the black $8.60 resistance. Now in the process of retesting this level into new support. In 2021, this retest led price to new all-time highs. But earlier this year, we saw a failed retest and saw price sink to 2023 lows. DOT needs this retest to be successful to rally higher and a monthly close above black would increase chances for further upside.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, DOT is trading for $8.85. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ). The analyst says FET also needs to convert a previous resistance level into support to sustain its rallies. “Price will need to turn the upcoming $1.77 resistance (red) into support, much like back in March 2024.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, FET is worth $1.88.

A blend of established favorites and fresh innovators provides numerous opportunities for growth. From rapid transaction networks to meme-driven currencies and expandable platforms, there's a choice for all. This overview highlights four primary contenders: BlockDAG, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hedera. Each presents unique advantages and current price points, yet one emerges as the prime selection for sustained expansion. Let’s explore why BlockDAG has the potential for similar success. 1. BlockDAG: Driving Decentralization Forward BlockDAG (BDAG) has gained attention with its hybrid fusion of blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies, enabling swift and secure transactions. Its presale attracted over $152 million, and with BDAG coins currently at $0.0234 in Batch 26, it stands out as a leading choice for this bull run. The X1 Miner App, with its 200,000 active users, demonstrates BlockDAG’s dedication to making its technology accessible and easy to use. The initiative finished its mainnet development on November 14, 2024, indicating it is set for full operation following audits. Market analysts foresee BDAG's price potentially reaching $30 by 2030, underscoring its growth prospects. With the ""BLACKFRIDAY150"" offer providing a 150% bonus concluding in just 2 days, it's an opportune moment to buy into this forward-thinking project. 2. Solana: Leading with Lightning-Fast Operations Currently priced at $240.86, Solana shines with its rapid transaction capabilities and scalable framework. The recent ETF application by Bitwise has enhanced market trust, propelling its price towards $250. Solana’s popularity continues to grow among developers, further solidifying its status as a top blockchain choice. Nonetheless, its prioritization of speed occasionally sparks debates about its decentralization, providing an edge to alternatives like BlockDAG. For those interested in high-performance networks, Solana remains a compelling pick in this bull run. 3. Dogecoin: The Iconic Meme Cryptocurrency Ascends Dogecoin (DOGE), valued at $0.386336, has experienced a resurgence of interest following Elon Musk’s humorous nod to his government efficiency project named “DOGE,” sparking an 800% increase in its value recently. While Dogecoin relies on its vibrant community and humor, its practical uses are fewer compared to other cryptos on this list, limiting its long-term allure. Nonetheless, its affordability and high profile keep it appealing for those new to cryptocurrencies looking for short-term investments. 4. Hedera: Pioneering Sustainable Crypto Solutions Hedera (HBAR), with a current value of $0.12491, appeals to environmentally conscious individuals with its low-energy consensus approach. Its recent push for a spot ETF has elevated HBAR's presence in the market, leading to a 25% rise in its price. Focused on enterprise applications and consistent development, Hedera maintains its position among the top choices for this bull run. Yet, for those aiming for larger returns, BlockDAG's rapid advancements and broader appeal present a more advantageous option. Essential Takeaways Each of these cryptocurrencies—BlockDAG, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hedera—offers distinctive attributes. From Solana’s unparalleled speed to Dogecoin’s infectious enthusiasm to Hedera’s commitment to sustainability, all provide unique investment opportunities during this bull run. However, crypto presale momentum and modern mining solutions elevate BlockDAG as the prime cryptocurrency to consider for those seeking to leverage the current market dynamics. Be sure not to overlook this progressive project as it continues to make significant strides.

According to data from DefiLlama, the platform has seen its weekly revenue drop by 66% following the decision to disable its livestream features. The platform decided to disable the feature following reports of illegal and harmful content being broadcasted to users by some developers. The company’s revenue notched a weekly high of $33 million in November. The Solana launchpad started November on a bright note, seeing its revenue peak by the end of the fourth week. DefiLlama’s data detailed the platform’s activities from November 18 to 24, where it posted $33 million in revenue for the week. The rise was a surge of 60% from the previous week and a 400% jump compared to revenue from the start of the month. Pump.fun registers a drastic weekly revenue drop Following its massive weekly returns in November, the platform’s revenue fell drastically this week. DefiLlama shows that the drop occurred from November 25 to December 1. The platform registered a weekly inflow of $11 million, undoing the gains it registered in November. The figure represents a massive 66% drop from the previous week. Pump.fun weekly revenue. Source: DefiLlama The decrease ensued after the platform announced it would remove livestream capabilities from the website. Before this decision, there had been several calls from Pump.fun users detailing the illicit activities playing out on live streams. For instance, some users threatened to harm themselves if the market cap of their tokens failed to hit a threshold by a certain time, while others were using it to carry out rug pulls, floating tokens, and draining liquidity. Livestream backlash and the can of worms in the crypto industry Pump.fun and the whole crypto sector were alarmed on November 25, after the safety manager of Pudgy Penguins Beau reported the case of a developer threatening to commit suicide. The developer took to the livestream to threaten users that he was going to commit suicide if his coin failed to hit a specific market cap target. Although the Pump.fun said adequate help had been provided to the streamer, there were reports of similar events. There were various users making threats of bodily harm, with others threatening to cause harm to others. A peculiar case on X was when a man threatened to shoot a dog if he failed to hit his target, while another user threatened a school shooting. Responding to the increased violent conduct, Pump.fun announced that the livestream feature has been disabled. The platform mentioned that upon its checks, it realized disturbing content and activities were being perpetrated live. Although live stream has been disabled indefinitely, Pump.fun hints at a comeback for the feature, but only when it has figured out effective moderation. Discussing the unfortunate incidents on the livestream, partner at Digital and Analogue Partners Yuriy Borisov said it is a legitimate cause to involve the police. He also said that aside from notifying authorities, there should be civil lawsuits against the perpetrators. Meanwhile, Trading Strategy co-founder Mikko Ohtamaa highlighted that the activities put Pump.fun at the risk of being shut down till regulators are sure it can moderate things.

With major coins experiencing strong rallies and modern projects gaining ground, it’s a thrilling time for those interested in crypto. Enthusiasts are identifying high-potential opportunities that could yield substantial gains in this expanding market. Leading the way are BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP, each offering distinctive advantages, from scalability to network dominance. These assets are gaining recognition for their growth potential during the bull run. Let’s explore why these cryptocurrencies are noteworthy and their role in optimal strategies for the bull run. 1. BlockDAG: Dominating in 2024 BlockDAG distinguishes itself with its hybrid blockchain and DAG technology. By integrating the security features of a blockchain with the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graphs, it achieves up to 15,000 transactions per second. This capability sets BlockDAG (BDAG) as a prime candidate for managing real-world demands while preserving decentralization. Currently valued at $0.0234, BDAG has yielded a 2240% gain for early participants. Its ongoing presale has gathered over $152 million from both individuals and organizations. The BLACKFRIDAY150 promotion, which offers a 150% bonus on purchases, is concluding in 2 days, providing a brief opportunity for advantages. The BlockDAG ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with the X1 Miner App reaching over 200,000 users. This achievement highlights its community engagement and user-friendliness. Analysts predict BDAG will hit $1 soon, with future estimates suggesting a rise to $20 by 2027. These projections support its potential for a 30,000x ROI, presenting a compelling opportunity for substantial gains. 2. Bitcoin: Dominance in the Market Bitcoin (BTC) is currently valued at $96,879, peaking today at $97,858. It maintains its lead in the crypto market as the most established and extensively used digital currency. Recent enhancements, including the greenlighting of Bitcoin ETFs, have rekindled enthusiasm. For instance, BlackRock’s ETF witnessed $1.9 billion in options exchanged on its debut, propelling BTC’s progression. Post the U.S. elections, Bitcoin has climbed 40%, driven by anticipations of a more crypto-supportive regulatory framework. Market experts posit that BTC might soon break the $100,000 threshold, positioning it as a formidable participant for continuous advancement in this bull market. Though Bitcoin may not offer the scalability seen in newer systems like BlockDAG, its network safety and widespread acceptance are unparalleled. For those prioritizing enduring dependability, Bitcoin remains a fundamental element of optimal strategies during bull runs. 3. Cardano: Architect of the Future Cardano (ADA) lists at $0.786, indicating a significant uptick in momentum amid the current bull market, with a 120% increase in the last fortnight alone. ADA is now a focal point for both traders and developers, thanks to its emphasis on sustainability and its research-based approach to development, earning a solid reputation within the blockchain community. Key achievements include its recent listing on Robinhood, enhancing its visibility and accessibility to a broader audience. Predictions indicate that ADA might climb above $2 by the end of 2024, with expectations for continued expansion as its ecosystem matures. Cardano is viewed as a stable choice for those seeking sustained value and scalability, making it a solid contender in strategies for capitalizing on bull run dynamics. While it may not deliver rapid, short-term spikes, its consistent progress and commitment to innovation stand out. 4. XRP: Primed for Expansion XRP is currently priced at $1.11, showcasing an impressive 80% increase in recent weeks. This climb is fueled by a positive outlook on regulatory decisions and increasing interest from institutional entities. Even amid ongoing legal discussions with the SEC, XRP remains resilient. The recent proposal by Bitwise Asset Management to introduce an XRP ETF underscores the rising institutional demand. Forecasts suggest that XRP could hit between $8 and $30 in future years, contingent on regulatory developments and broader market dynamics. XRP differentiates itself with its scalable framework and emphasis on enhancing international payments, positioning it as a notable option in the crypto sector. For those exploring the most promising assets for bull run success, XRP stands out for its unique solutions and potential lucrative returns. Essential Takeaways The 2024 bull run unfolds significant possibilities for navigating the crypto terrain. Leading with its cutting-edge approach and potential for substantial growth, BlockDAG is highlighted as the best crypto presale , making it an attractive option for maximizing returns. Bitcoin continues to offer stability and reliability, while Cardano and XRP contribute their unique strengths in scalability and practical applications. These digital currencies each fulfill a unique niche in the evolving market, but BlockDAG's blend of high scalability, potential for return, and robust ecosystem distinguishes it as a top contender.

37094935,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/cloudzy-introduces-privacy-focused-vps-hosting-with-cryptocurrency-payment-options,1733066179,Cloudzy Introduces Privacy-Focused VPS Hosting with Cryptocurrency Payment Options,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 1st, 2024, Chainwire Virtual private servers have revolutionized the way people navigate the digital world. With the increasing demand for virtualization, VPS providers must ensure user privacy and security—a task that’s only getting more complex, with data breaches and invasive third-party tracking becoming increasingly common. For the same reason, finding a provider that prioritizes user privacy has become a critical task for VPS users. Cloudzy , a global VPS provider, has made this its mission by offering secure, high-performance hosting, incorporating decentralized cryptocurrency payment options. This allows users to maintain control over their data and financial transactions in an ever-evolving digital world. The Role of VPS Hosting in Supporting Traders Freelance crypto traders who work from anywhere in the world need a reliable way to connect to cryptocurrency exchanges and keep their trades running smoothly, even when they're sleeping or on the go. This is where a VPS comes in handy. With a Virtual Private Server (VPS), traders can access their accounts from anywhere with an internet connection, serving as a dedicated server for their trading activities. One of the primary advantages of a VPS is that it ensures an uninterrupted connection to cryptocurrency exchanges, which is especially beneficial if their home internet is unstable or if they're traveling. This connectivity helps them avoid missing valuable trading opportunities. Additionally, VPS servers are typically located closer to exchange servers, resulting in faster trade execution—a critical factor in the fast-paced world of crypto trading, where even milliseconds matter. Traders can also set up automated trading bots on a VPS, allowing them to trade around the clock based on predefined strategies, even when they're not actively monitoring the market. The Importance of Privacy in VPS Hosting User privacy has become a non-negotiable aspect for anyone navigating the online world. Whether they're a startup, developer, or enterprise, ensuring that sensitive information is safeguarded is critical. The importance of privacy in VPS hosting extends beyond just protecting website data; it’s about ensuring the integrity of user transactions, communications, and intellectual property. Providers must take every precaution to ensure that their users’ data remains secure, particularly given the increasing threats of cyberattacks, ransomware, and data breaches. VPS hosting users rely on their provider to protect not only their business-critical data but also personal information such as customer details and payment information. As a digital service, users rely on online transactions to purchase VPS services. This means sharing their personal information and financial data online. A breach in this data can lead to devastating financial consequences and reputational damage. Hence, it’s vital for VPS providers to implement strong encryption, secure storage protocols, and other advanced security measures to give users confidence that their personal and payment information will remain confidential and protected from any unauthorized access. Decentralized Technologies and Crypto Payments Decentralized technologies are reshaping how financial transactions are conducted, offering enhanced security and privacy compared to traditional payment methods. When purchasing a VPS with cryptocurrencies, users benefit from the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. This decentralization means there’s no central authority that can access or control transaction details, reducing the risk of financial information being exposed to third parties or compromised during the transaction process. Cloudzy is fully aligned with the decentralized movement, recognizing the benefits that decentralized technologies bring to user security. By decentralizing data and eliminating single points of failure, Cloudzy works to ensure that its clients’ information is less vulnerable to attacks or exploitation. To reinforce this commitment, Cloudzy integrates cryptocurrency payments, giving users more control over their financial transactions. Utilizing crypto payment gateways such as BTCpay and Cryptomus, Cloudzy supports popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing a layer of anonymity and convenience for those who value decentralized financial tools. Cloudzy's Vision for a Secure Digital Future Cloudzy remains steadfast in its mission to prioritize privacy and security across its services. Understanding that users' data protection needs are growing with the increasing threats of cyberattacks and surveillance, Cloudzy has placed privacy at the core of its offerings. By utilizing decentralized technologies and robust security measures, Cloudzy aims to create an environment where users have complete control over their data and online activities. The company’s focus extends beyond just businesses and developers; it also caters to privacy-conscious individuals who seek a VPS provider they could trust. Cloudzy envisions a future where privacy is not a luxury but a standard, offering secure, high-performance solutions for all users.

Its global network of data centers ensures low-latency, high-performance hosting, and by supporting a wide range of payment methods—including traditional and decentralized options—Cloudzy caters to privacy-conscious individuals and businesses.

Although tokens like Dogecoin and Cardano are popular, other cryptocurrencies offer significant potential. Among these are Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and TRON (TRX). Each of these tokens could have massive returns through different advantages unique to them. Rexas Finance: How it will change the tokenization of real-world assets Rexas Finance has taken a leading position in incorporating blockchain technology, providing a unique platform that connects physical-world assets to the digital space. It has 1 billion total supply tokens, of which 42.5% is for presale, 22.5% for staking pools, 15% for liquidity, 10% for treasury, and lesser amounts for marketing, team, giveaways, and partnerships. This distribution promotes balanced growth, and early investors benefit from a strong basis for long-term success. The presale is currently at stage 8, where RXS’s token presale price stands at $0.10 per token. The entire sale of tokens across all presale stages has raised more than $17 million, with around 261 million tokens sold, showcasing great investor confidence. In line with its plans, RXS is slated to be listed in 2025 with projections of $0.20 per token. Another of the advantages this token has is that it is an ERC-20 asset and regarding interoperability, it has the benefit of operating within the rule of the Ethereum ecosystem. As stated in its CertiK-audited documentation, security is a priority for Rexas Finance. This extensive audit provides guarantees to investors about the reliability and transparency of the platform. To further increase its popularity, Rexas Finance has announced a $1 million giveaway where 20 participants will receive 50,000 RXS tokens each. This program not only rewards early adopters but also builds the project’s credibility. Purchasing RXS tokens is straightforward. First, download an ERC-20-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Then, purchase Ethereum (ETH) or USDT from a reliable exchange, as these are the only accepted payments. Link a wallet to the Rexas Finance platform, indicate the number of tokens to buy, and finalize the purchase. The tokens purchased will then move to the wallet and can be tracked by adding RXS as a custom token on the monitor.

The network’s TVL has been growing gradually, further proving its appeal to developers and end users. Considering its constant growth, the price of TRON has reached $0.2013, with the total market capitalization standing at $17.37 billion. The stability of TRX’s price is further enhanced by collaborations with international payment gateways as well as successful tangential mergers with industry leaders indicating good potential for sustained long-term growth.

As we look to the future, investors are keen to uncover the best meme coins to join for long term success. With the explosive growth of projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, many are eager to find the next big opportunity. Right now, all eyes are on BTFD Coin , which has made a sensational start to its presale, raising over $200,000 in just the first 24 hours. BTFD Coin is at the forefront of this meme coin revolution, having raised an impressive $300,000 so far in its presale journey, with over 8.5 billion coins sold to more than 700 holders. Currently in its fourth stage, the presale will unlock its fifth stage once 10 billion BTFD coins are sold. With an enticing price of $0.00005 and predictions suggesting an increase to $0.0006, BTFD Coin presents a compelling case for anyone searching for the best meme coins to join for long term growth. In this article, we’ll delve deeper into what makes BTFD Coin such an exciting prospect, while also exploring the strengths of Goatseus Maximus and Turbo. Each of these projects has established its own unique space in the world of meme coins, appealing to investors looking for alternatives to traditional assets. Let’s kick things off with a closer look at BTFD Coin, the new darling of the meme coin market. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin has quickly distinguished itself in the meme coin landscape, showcasing an impressive presale performance that highlights its potential. Within just 24 hours, it raised over $200,000, and with more than 8.5 billion coins sold, the excitement surrounding this project is palpable. The presale is carefully structured to unlock the fifth stage once 10 billion BTFD coins have been sold, creating a sense of urgency that motivates prospective investors. What makes BTFD Coin particularly compelling is its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. This feature allows users to earn cryptocurrency by participating in gameplay, effectively merging fun with financial rewards. Imagine playing a game where your achievements translate into actual earnings—this blend of gaming and investing is where BTFD Coin shines. The P2E model is gaining traction, and BTFD Coin is poised to be at the forefront of this trend. Staking rewards add another layer of appeal to BTFD Coin . Investors can earn passive income simply by holding their tokens, which creates a long-term incentive to remain engaged with the project. For example, let’s say you invest $200,000 at the current price of $0.00005. If the price rises to $0.0006 as anticipated, that initial investment could balloon to an astonishing $3.1 million. This potential return on investment underscores why BTFD Coin is being touted as one of the best meme coins to join for long term growth. BTFD Coin’s utility extends beyond mere trading; it’s about fostering a community. With 18% of the maximum supply allocated for staking rewards and 17% for gaming incentives, BTFD Coin is committed to building a loyal investor base. The coin’s strategy includes community incentives, airdrops, and burn mechanisms to keep holders engaged and invested. In a market often dominated by speculation, BTFD Coin’s focus on real-world utility sets it apart. It’s not just about the money; it’s about creating an ecosystem where the community thrives. This commitment to engagement and innovation positions BTFD Coin as one of the best meme coins to join for long term success. Goatseus Maximus: A Community-Centric Approach Shifting gears, let’s explore Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that has captured the hearts of investors with its fun branding and community-driven ethos. Unlike other meme coins that focus solely on potential profits, Goatseus Maximus has built a loyal following by engaging its users and fostering a sense of belonging. The project thrives on community involvement, making it a go-to option for those who value connection as much as investment. Goatseus Maximus has successfully established itself in the marketplace by promoting a strong community narrative. Its marketing strategies leverage social media to create buzz and encourage participation. This engagement is vital in the meme coin ecosystem, where a dedicated community can significantly influence a project’s success. Goatseus Maximus understands this dynamic and actively promotes events and challenges that keep its users engaged. In terms of market positioning, Goatseus Maximus has found its stride by appealing to younger investors looking for alternatives to traditional investment vehicles. The project resonates with millennials and Gen Z, who are increasingly disillusioned with conventional finance. By aligning itself with social causes and community initiatives, Goatseus Maximus attracts a diverse investor base that seeks both financial return and social impact. Among the crypto community, Goatseus Maximus is known for its commitment to charitable contributions. By partnering with non-profits and promoting social good, the coin has carved out a unique identity that differentiates it from other meme coins. This focus on social responsibility not only enhances its image but also builds a strong, loyal following—an essential element for anyone looking for the best meme coins to join for long term gains. While it may not have the explosive presale figures of BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus excels in creating a culture of engagement and social impact. For investors who appreciate a blend of community spirit and investment potential, Goatseus Maximus is a compelling choice in the ever-changing landscape of meme coins. Turbo: Speed and Community at the Forefront Lastly, let’s talk about Turbo, a meme coin that’s all about speed and innovation. Turbo has quickly made a name for itself in the cryptocurrency market, appealing to those who thrive on quick returns and fast-paced investment opportunities. Its branding centres on the idea of rapid transactions and quick rewards, making it a popular choice for those looking to capitalise on the meme coin frenzy. Turbo’s community-driven model fosters active participation from its users. One of the standout features of Turbo is its governance structure, which allows holders to vote on key decisions regarding the project’s future. This democratic approach resonates with younger investors who value transparency and inclusivity in their investments. Turbo’s focus on community engagement is crucial, as it helps maintain interest and excitement around the project. Market positioning for Turbo is all about speed. Investors looking for fast-paced opportunities find Turbo appealing, but potential buyers should remain aware of the volatility that often accompanies such rapid projects. Turbo’s regular events and contests keep users actively involved, creating a vibrant community atmosphere that enhances user loyalty. While Turbo may not boast the initial excitement of BTFD Coin’s presale, its commitment to community and innovation makes it a noteworthy contender among the best meme coins to join for long term investment. Investors seeking a dynamic experience might find Turbo’s approach refreshing and engaging, particularly in a market that rewards quick decision-making. Conclusion As we conclude this exploration of the best meme coins to join for long term growth, it’s clear that the landscape is filled with opportunities.

With a trading volume of $40.1 billion in the last 24 hours, the live Ethereum price as of writing is $3,563.52. Reflecting great hopeful momentum, the price has jumped by 42.01%. With a market value of more than $429 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization; the count of ETH coins in circulation is around 120.4 million. Although Ethereum's development path seems bright, everyone's main concern is whether ETH will hit $10,000 in the current bull cycle. But while Ethereum is becoming more popular, another player with even more explosive development potential is on hand: Rexas Finance (RXS). With estimates estimating a likely price surge to $22, an eye-watering 21,900% gain from its current presale price of $0.10, this creative idea is transforming real-world asset tokenization and could see an exponential climb. The Future Big Thing in Cryptocurrency: Rexas Finance (RXS) While Ethereum is emphasizing the digital economy, Rexas Finance is bringing the conventional financial scene under the crypto umbrella. With just one click, its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) lets anyone buy, sell, and trade physical assets including real estate, commodities, and even artwork. Opening access to the biggest markets in the world, like the $379.7 trillion real estate sector, $121.2 trillion in commodities like gold, and $65 billion in art and collectibles, is a whole fresh path for crypto investors. Rexas Finance seeks to close the gap between blockchain technology and actual assets so that users may wholly or fractionally own physical objects, therefore making them available to everybody, wherever. This strategy not only improves liquidity in conventional markets but also makes more inclusive and democratized investment chances possible. Rexas Finance is on the presale stage 8 right now; the RXS token costs $0.10. From its $0.030 presale price at stage 1, the coin has already climbed 240%. Rexas Finance has shown itself to be a quite appealing investment possibility with over $16.5 million raised out of its $20.75 million target as of writing. Moreover, the token is scheduled for debut at $0.20 on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges worldwide in early 2025, thus now is the ideal moment to participate in the presale and profit on early development. Why Should You Right Now Invest in Rexas Finance? Rexas Finance is positioned to upend several sectors with its fast expansion and creative application of blockchain technologies. But there's more: a strong ecosystem supporting the platform consists in: Anyone can tokenize their actual assets with Rexas Token Builder, a user-friendly tool free of a single line of code coding. Users of Rexas Launchpad can fund their tokenized assets, therefore creating fresh fundraising opportunities. Rexas Finance is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko boosting its visibility and presence in the cryptocurrency market. Apart from its innovative technology, Certik has audited Rexas Finance, therefore guaranteeing its dedication to openness and security. With 310,389 entries and 20 lucky winners poised to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway has also attracted notable interest. Individuals can boost their chances by finishing activities on the Rexas Finance website. Next for RXS? The trip of Rexas Finance is only starting. Investors have the chance to purchase RXS at a comparatively cheap $0.10 as the presale moves further. Once the coin is launched on tier-1 exchanges in early 2025 for $0.20, it is predicted to witness notable gains, possibly reaching $22, a huge increase of 21,900%. Rexas Finance is poised to create waves in the crypto market with its strong community emphasis and a good range of products. While Rexas Finance presents investors with an even more appealing growth possibility, the present Ethereum price projection points toward a future whereby ETH surpasses $10,000. Rexas Finance is a project that might change the direction of finance given the worldwide movement towards tokenized real-world assets and the platform's capacity to access a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Now is the chance to participate in the RXS presale before it's too late if you're seeking an investment with exponential potential.

37094446,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656153,1733065219,"Bitcoin Set To Hit $140,000 Target In December – Here’s Why","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a rather turbulent end to November, reaching a local bottom of $90,796 on Tuesday. Notably, the market bulls have shown some resilience in the past few days producing a market gain of 5.9% to move the digital asset back above $96,000. Interestingly, as December begins, popular market analyst Ali Martinez has backed BTC to resume its uptrend reaching a potential price target of $140,000. Prepare For Bullish December – Analyst In an X post on November 30 , Martinez predicted Bitcoin is likely to maintain a positive performance going into the last month of 2024. So far, the crypto market leader has captured significant investor interest in Q4 2024, gaining by 10.76% in October and 37.99% in November. The BTC market has been strongly bullish, driven by several factors including the recent Fed rate cut in November , Donald Trump’s electoral victory, and high market inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Moving forward, December historically presents itself as a two-phased month for Bitcoin proven by an average return of 5.45% and a median return of -3.59% over the past 11 years. However, Martinez explains that Bitcoin has traditionally surged in any December following the US Presidential elections, as evidenced by gains of 30.80% and 46.92% in 2016 and 2020, respectively. If the premier cryptocurrency mirrors this similar pattern from these previous bull cycles, the analyst predicts Bitcoin to trade between $125,000 – $140,000 before 2024 runs out. According to data from the BTC weekly chart, the asset’s 100-day simple moving average (SMA) remains far above its price signaling an uptrend continuation in agreement with Martinez’s projection. However, a relative strength index (RSI) of 75.56 indicates Bitcoin has been overbought and is vulnerable to sudden price falls. Investors Withdraw $5 Billion Bitcoin From Exchanges In more positive news for the Bitcoin community, over 55,000 Bitcoins, valued at $5.34 billion, have been moved from crypto exchanges over the last three days. This development is largely interpreted as bullish as it reduces available Bitcoin supply on exchanges, potentially decreasing selling pressure. Moreover, it signifies investors’ anticipation of immediate price gains by BTC. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $96,203 following a 0.43% loss in the past 24 hours. In any further ascent, Bitcoin will encounter minor resistance at $97,300, which should provide no major opposition as the premier cryptocurrency is largely tipped to break above $100,000 sooner or later. Meanwhile, BTC’s daily trading volume, valued at $31.98 billion, is down by 41.27% indicating a decline in traders’ participation and general market activity.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-set-to-hit-140000-target-in-december-heres-why/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) keep making headlines, experienced traders are turning to the market seeking the best altcoins to buy. Among them is a new crypto, DTX Exchange (DTX), which stands out as a game-changer, advancing the DeFi sector with its groundbreaking features and massive growth potential. Apart from DTX, Sui (SUI) and Render (RNDR) are positioning themselves as great investments, powered by considerable milestones and increasing investor confidence. Despite the many coins rising, DTX stands as the best cryptocurrency investment that will deliver huge profits in this bull cycle. Here is why! Sui Network Achieves Key Milestones, Attracting XRP Investors The Sui Network recorded multiple milestones recently, helping boost its position among the best altcoins with the best ROI in this bull run. In that context, its token, SUI, gained almost 90% within a month to hit highs of $3.927. Moreover, SUI’s transaction volumes exceeded 1.67 billion, a significant boost from the previous $395 million monthly average. Elsewhere, the Router Chain platform announced the addition of the Sui network to its growing list of cross-chain ecosystems, allowing users to move tokens between EVM chains and Sui smoothly. This integration offers Sui users a decentralized cross-chain experience, enabling them to access Sui’s connectivity directly via the Router Chain without needing to switch networks. Moreover, SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeded $1.5 billion, proving there is investor trust in its security and potential profits. Analysts believe it might surpass $4.225 to outshine Dogecoin and XRP in the next bull run. SUI traded at $3.562 on November 28, up 0.17% in the past week. Analysts believe SUI will rise to $3.855 in December. Despite this long-term bullish SUI movement, investors have turned to DTX, which is considered the best cryptocurrency investment due to its massive growth potential. DTX Exchange: The New Crypto Revolutionizing DeFi with 1000x Leverage The crypto market bull run is here and DTX Exchange is turning heads. Even as XRP, Sui, and Render are rising, investors are turning to DTX as it prepares for exponential growth. DTX Exchange’s accelerated adoption rate has sparked a lot of hype in the crypto sector, making it top the list of the best altcoins to buy. DTX’s impressive presale rally attracted many investors to the new crypto. Analysts say the token will perform well in this bull run since its features and fundamentals will enable it to redefine the DeFi sector. Recently, DTX Exchange made headlines after it was listed on CoinMarketCap . It integrated groundbreaking trading options in a hybrid platform to offer lucrative investment opportunities, significant benefits, and access to many premium features. Also, the platform offers investors over 120,000 digital assets to choose from and up to 1000x leverage. Long-term investors and retail traders are buying the new crypto, dominating the best altcoins space, due to its massive growth potential. Furthermore, its accelerated growth has defied all market sentiment and DTX will dominate the current bull run. Render Breaks Resistance with Bullish Momentum For the Bull Run After several months of consolidation at $6.09, Render broke out after recording an 18% price increase from October 2024 highs. RNDR has seen a lot of action after breaking above the $7.05 resistance. On that note, more investors entered Render’s market in the November bull run, helping support its position as one of the best altcoins to buy currently. Market experts say RNDR could be on its way to record a new ATH above $13.01. This move seems likely to happen because many industry leaders are turning to RNDR during the current market-wide rally. The increasing demand for AI-generated media visuals also supports RNDR’s upside momentum and trend reversal. On November 28, 2024, RNDR was valued at $8.21, up 15.66% in the past week. Market experts believe that since RNDR broke the $7.51-$7.72 resistance zone, it could target $10.25 in December due to increased adoption. However, investors are also buying DTX due to its massive growth potential during this bull run. Forget Dogecoin and XRP: DTX Emerges as One of the Best Altcoins to Buy As the crypto market records increased volatility, the focus has shifted away from Dogecoin and XRP towards the best altcoins to buy due to their unrivaled growth potential. While Sui (SUI) and Render (RNDR) perform strongly in the market, coupled with investor confidence, a new crypto, DTX Exchange (DTX), emerges as the best investment option in this bull run. Currently available in Stage 5 of its public presale, DTX is selling at $0.10, a 400% ROI for early investors who acquired the new crypto at $0.02. Furthermore, Stage 5 investors will enjoy a 100% profit after the token gets listed on mainstream exchanges at $0.20.

37094586,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314820,1733065200,Grayscale’s Crypto Holdings Surge in November Amid Stellar and XRP’s Triple-Digit Gains,"Grayscale Investments has seen its cryptocurrency holdings skyrocket in November, driven by surging altcoins like Stellar (XLM) and XRP. The growth aligns with analysts’ expectations of an imminent altcoin season. Data from Cryptorank reveals an 85% surge in the market capitalization of Grayscale’s crypto portfolio over the past month. Stellar’s XLM Token Surges Around 500% The standout performers include Stellar’s XLM token, which climbed an extraordinary 469%, and XRP, which posted gains exceeding 262%. Decentraland’s MANA token also contributed to the rally, jumping more than 105% during the same period. Analysts predict that an altcoin season, fueled by increasing investor confidence, could extend into early 2025. Ether (ETH), for instance, is projected to surpass $4,000 before January 20, when President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. One key indicator of this shift is Bitcoin’s dominance, which fell below its two-year support line on November 30. Analysts view this as a signal of profit-taking from Bitcoin positions, with funds being reallocated into altcoins. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, forecasts XRP could rally to $2.57 by the end of December, citing historical growth patterns tied to Bitcoin halving events. “XRP could reach approximately $2.57 during December 2024,” Lee said. “Historically, XRP has shown significant growth around 228 days after a Bitcoin halving.” Potential progress on XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another anticipated catalyst. Asset manager 21Shares recently filed for an XRP ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 1. Fundamental changes in regulatory leadership may also play a role. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down on January 20, and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, is the leading candidate to succeed him. Analysts believe this transition could pave the way for more crypto-friendly regulations and ETF approvals, further boosting altcoin markets. Grayscale to Launch Bitcoin ETF Options As reported, Grayscale Investments is set to introduce options trading on its spot Bitcoin ETFs this Wednesday. The move came amidst a surge in investor interest, as indicated by the record-breaking performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on its first day of options trading. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded nearly $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded on its debut, including 354,000 contracts, with a striking 4.4:1 call-to-put ratio. As reported, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is reportedly poised to approve Ripple Labs’ RLUSD , an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as December 4. The anticipated approval positions Ripple to enter New York’s heavily regulated digital finance market, further solidifying its presence in the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple’s flagship business revolves around RippleNet, a decentralized payments network offering a faster and cost-efficient alternative to traditional banking systems like SWIFT. The network relies on blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border transactions. While RippleNet’s operations are closely tied to its native cryptocurrency, XRP, the token faces legal scrutiny in the United States.

37094347,https://crypto.news/?p=14315251,1733065073,Shiba Inu ignites meme coin buzz while Rollblock dominates the gaming token market,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. November’s bull market surged after Trump’s win, boosting Shiba Inu 60% and gaming token Rollblock’s presale beyond predictions. Table of Contents Rollblock dominates the gaming token market Shiba Inu price rise ignites meme coin buzz Conclusion The bull market has been in full flow this November, all triggered after President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide win. Meme coins were some of the biggest beneficiaries as the Shiba Inu price rocketed 60% in a few days, before correcting. New gaming token Rollblock was another key recipient of the Trump factor as its presale has now exceeded all bullish predictions. It’s still ongoing, but its attraction isn’t actually the gaming aspect, but is something DeFi has long promised but always failed to deliver — until now. Rollblock dominates the gaming token market In a market where utility is now king, Rollblock is establishing itself as a leader among gaming tokens. By merging blockchain technology with the multi-billion-dollar online gambling industry, Rollblock is bringing real-world utility with the promise DeFi always failed to deliver on. Unlike speculative projects of past crypto cycles, Rollblock boasts a gaming token, which serves as the backbone of its entire ecosystem. An ecosystem that offers over 7000 gaming options and a sports betting book to keep its users entertained. However, it’s not gaming that’s attracting such big investment to Rollblock’s presale. The promise of passive income is key for many investors and this is how Rollblock stands out, not only from other DeFi platforms but its centralized competitors. Holders of RBLK benefit from profit-sharing opportunities and cashback rewards that are built into the Rollblock platform. All token holders are paid a share of the revenue generated by the casino. This is automatic and is sent to all token holders. But there’s an even more lucrative way to build on passive income through Rollblock’s staking mechanism, earning up to 30% APY. Rollblock also employs a Buyback and Burn mechanism, which is used to pay the staking rewards, but the rest are burned from existence. This will help create scarcity, ensuring consistent demand for RBLK and a likely token value appreciation. With its unique use of blockchain, Rollblock and its in-demand gaming token have attracted substantial investment during its presale . With over $6 million raised and the price up 350%, Rollblock’s position as a dominant player in the DeFi and gaming sectors looks cemented once it launches.

While it has since corrected, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is still up 30% even with the heavy pullback across the entire market. No doubt SHIB can and very well bounce back, especially with the imminent launch of its TREAT token. Designed as a reward token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, TREAT will enhance utility across its platform and drive utility to Shiba Inu. This should further excel the Shiba Inu price upwards as the bull market picks up pace yet again. Conclusion Gaming token Rollblock has the market excited. Now in stage 8 of its presale and all price targets smashed, this is setting up to be a bull market to remember for Rollblock investors. As for SHIB, it’s undergone a steady correction after rocketing up. Another boost is due to Shiba Inu’s price, thanks to its burgeoning ecosystem.

37094392,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/dogecoins-chart-hints-at-massive-gains-in-the-next-bull-run-whereas-this-rising-token-is-set-to-repeat-doges-2021-pump-and-create-millionaires-in-the-next-87-days,1733065049,Dogecoin’s Chart Hints at Massive Gains in the Next Bull Run whereas this Rising Token is Set to Repeat DOGE’s 2021 Pump and Create Millionaires in the Next 87 Days,"Recently breaking past a crucial resistance level at $0.2267, a barrier it has been fighting since March 2024, Dogecoin signals a turning point and indicates optimistic momentum approaching the upcoming crypto bull run. Similar trends have historically resulted in notable demonstrations; experts see DOGE's recent triple bottom pattern at $0.0916 as indicating the possibility for large gains followed by a 424.99% increase. Though DOGE’s chart hints at massive gains in the next bull run, for investors looking for life-changing rewards Rexas Finance (RXS) offers an even more interesting prospect as it’ll repeat DOGE’s 2021 success in the next 87 days. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star Possessed with Great Potential Currently priced at $0.10 in its presale stage 8, Rexas Finance has already shown an amazing increase, exploding 240% from its starting presale price of $0.030. Early 2025 marks a targeted launch price of $0.20 on three out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, which prepares RXS to double before it ever finds public release. After its introduction, market analysts estimate RXS might climb by 17,500%, hitting a possible high of $17.50, creating billionaires in as little as 87 days. How Can RXS Outperform the Legendary Rally of DOGE? While RXS's real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing strategy prepares it for something similar to DOGE's 2021 rise of over 25,000%, RXS has caught worldwide notice. This is the justification: By tokenizing real-world assets including real estate ($379.7 trillion market), gold ($121.2 trillion), and art ($65 billion yearly volume), Rexas Finance seeks to combine traditional finance and blockchain technology. For people all around, this creates hitherto unheard-of investing possibilities that allow fractional ownership and liquidity in markets once reserved for the wealthy. To guarantee openness, security, and efficiency, the Rexas ecosystem combines blockchain, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence. By democratizing asset tokenization with tools like the token builder and launchpad, anyone may tokenize assets without knowledge of coding or capital raising for fresh ventures. Rexas Finance has developed a devoted community of individual investors, unlike many crypto initiatives supported by venture capital. This grassroots support not only promotes natural development but also conforms with the distributed attitude of blockchain. Certik Audit and Transparency: Rexas Finance's Certik audit underlines its dedication to safety since security and trust are top priorities in crypto. Being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko improves visibility even more so that investors may reliably track real-time data and metrics. Out of its $20,750,000 aim for stage 8, Rexas Finance's presale has already raised $17,851,971 with over 261 million RXS tokens sold as of writing. With 20 lucky winners slated to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, the ongoing $1 million RXS giveaway has drawn 328,516 submissions. These figures show great investor belief in the future of the project. Early investors find the arithmetic appealing. If RXS targets $17.50, a startling 175x return, a $5,800 investment at the current presale price of $0.10 might become $1 million in the next 87 days. This reflects DOGE's explosive ascent but with the benefit of a proven use case in an industry valued at trillion dollars. The Road Ahead: Why Timing Counts The RXS presale is fast-moving, and the chance to buy at $0.10 is closing. Early investors will already be in profit whenever RXS starts on top-tier exchanges at $0.20. The actual benefits, meanwhile, come from staying through the expected bull run. Given a forecasted 17,500% rise, the possible upside in the current market is unmatched. The breakout signals of Dogecoin indicate the beginning of a fresh bull run; historical data indicates that early movers gain the most. Although DOGE is still a popular choice, Rexas Finance presents a special, high-potential substitute with its real-world asset tokenizing approach, excellent presale performance, and future listings on elite exchanges. Purchasing RXS now could be like purchasing DOGE before its pump for 2021. Though it is rare to find the chance to turn a small investment into life-changing riches, Rexas Finance has all the tools needed for success: creative technology, community-driven development, and a forward-looking road map. Act now before the presale ends to seize the opportunity to contribute to the next crypto success narrative!

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-memecoin-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The postponement comes after a proposed financial investment income tax was shelved last month for similar reasons. The tax plan, originally scheduled to go into effect next year, aimed to impose a 22% tax (including local taxes) on annual virtual asset income exceeding 2.5 million won ($1,790). The policy has been postponed twice before, with the DPK initially seeking to implement it with an increased tax exemption threshold of 50 million won ($35,780). However, growing discontent among cryptocurrency investors and opposition from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) led to further delays. DPK grassroots leader Representative Park Chan-dae made statements on the issue at a press briefing at the National Assembly: Related News: Watch Out: FED Chairman Jerome Powell to Speak This Week - Here are the Date, Time and Details “After extensive discussions, we concluded that additional institutional arrangements were necessary for the taxation of virtual assets. We agreed to postpone the taxation for two years.” He added that the decision was taken after “lengthy negotiations, discussions and political reasoning.” The ruling PPP, which has long advocated for the crypto tax law to be repealed, welcomed the move. PPP leader Han Dong-hoon called the delay a “good outcome for the youth,” saying it was important to support younger generations in building their wealth. “No policy can prevail against the will of the people,” Khan wrote in a Facebook post. The DPK’s step back is its second in recent times regarding financial taxation. Earlier this month, the party abandoned plans to introduce a financial investment income tax, citing a “difficult domestic stock market.” The postponement of the cryptocurrency tax will be made official with an amendment to the Income Tax Law, which is expected to be passed by the plenary session of the Parliament on Monday. *This is not investment advice.

As Shiba Inu and Bonk try to compete with established players like XRP, Lunex Network is making waves aiming to replicate BNB’s ICO success. With advancing market developments and investor interest, Lunex Network might be the next big crypto next year. Shiba Inu’s token burns to drive SHIB’s scarcity Shiba Inu , a meme coin community favorite, has skyrocketed from its 2020 debut by an amazing 1,944,604.08%. Today, Shiba Inu has gained over 2% at $0.00002589 within the last twenty-four hours and 212% in 12 months. However, Shiba Inu hasn’t had a smooth ride. SHIB sits 14th on CoinMarketCap’s crypto rankings with a $15.24 billion market cap after briefly making the top ten. Efforts to boost Shiba Inu’s value include a 5,545.73% burn rate increase, removing over 61 million tokens. This community-driven mechanism aims to limit supply and increase scarcity. While Shiba Inu aspires to reach $0.01, it needs a staggering 38,530% leap.

Recently, an experienced crypto veteran predicted Ethereum (ETH) at $5 and now has his sights set on Rexas Finance (RXS) as the next big thing. That’s because this altcoin is making waves, with bold claims that RXS could take off by a stunning 37,890% before the end of Q1 2025, attracting investors and market analysts alike. The RWA Revolution Rexas Finance is leading the way in the RWA movement, where real-world assets (RWA) are tokenized. The digital representation of physical assets such as real estate, commodities, and art on the blockchain is enabled by this innovative approach. With this, Rexas Finance hopes to unlock unprecedented liquidity and accessibility to investors. Rexas is strategically situated to take a large share of the $16 trillion RWA market, estimated to be worth around 2030. The crypto veteran’s prediction that RXS could reach an astronomical price point of $38 before the end of Q1 2025 follows an anticipated altcoin season. As Ethereum has been gaining momentum and has been reclaiming its all-time highs, RXS should follow this wave of momentum. It is projected that Rexas Finance will increase by 37,890%, making it one of the most promising investments in the crypto space today. It’s not pure speculation, this bullish sentiment is on the back of potential developments within the Rexas ecosystem. Stages 6 and 7 of the RXS presale have sold out even before reaching the end of sale on a record-breaking day for presale! RXS is currently priced at $0.100 in Stage 8 and has already raised over $16 million, with the expectation that it will continue to receive large levels of investment as it nears its goal of $20.75 million for this stage.

It shows significant confidence in RXS’s ability to have explosive growth. Community engagement also backs this trend, with more retail investors attracted to the platform’s pioneering approach to asset tokenization. CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm, has also rigorously audited Rexas Finance . This audit helps enhance investor faith in the project by making sure that the project complies with a standard level of security and transparency. Furthermore, it has been listed on major platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which have only solidified its credibility in the cryptocurrency community even more. The Technology Behind Rexas Rexas Finance is at its core built on blockchain technology to offer a hassle-free experience for users who wish to invest in real-world assets. The platform supports many features to make it easy to access and participate in asset tokenization. One of those features is the Tokenization tools, which make it easy for users to tokenize their assets. The process is one that allows people to take physical assets such as cars and turn them into digital tokens that can be traded or owned fractionally. Furthermore, the Decentralized Launchpad provides a secure place for token sale across various blockchain ecosystems with transparent and trusted transactions. Users can co-own properties and earn passive income through stablecoin distribution through Rexas Estate initiative. On top of that, with integrated AI AI-powered features, creators can create high-quality digital artworks and NFTs, opening doors for creators to new opportunities in the growing digital asset market. With the markets entering into a new phase of market dynamics with increased interest from altcoins, Rexas Finance is a great opportunity to invest in. RXS is in a good position as the combination of strong fundamentals, such as asset tokenization of real-world assets and favorable market conditions, means it’s in for big growth. These are valid projections, and it’s one of these that the crypto veteran’s endorsement offers some weight to. He was already a credible voice in the industry as a result of his previous success in predicting the rise of Ethereum. If the RXS forecast is true, early investors could see their investments multiplied exponentially as there is more and more demand for the tokenization of real-world assets. Finally, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a great opportunity for investors to cash in on the next big thing in cryptocurrency. RXS’s innovative solution for real-world asset tokenization combined with strong community support paves the way for huge growth in the next couple of years. With an altcoin season right around the corner thanks to Ethereum’s resurgence, now is perhaps the ideal time to evaluate adding RXS to your portfolio. As those who spoke to BitcoinTalk predicted that there might be a price surge by the end of Q1 2025, timing can definitely be a girl’s best friend if you want to profit from this investment.

Schwartz claimed that the government is “addicted to indirect regulation” and outlined four reasons why de-banking undermines the rule of law. He argued that cutting off banking access pushes entities to switch service providers or operate underground, making them harder to regulate and monitor. Schwartz also stated that de-banking erodes due process, freedom of speech, and protections against unlawful search and seizure. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils. It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process, but the government ought not to punish people without giving them due process,” Schwartz wrote. He added, “It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal,” calling on the government to regulate transparently and lawfully. Industry Leaders Share Experiences Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen revealed that over 30 tech firms have been affected by Operation Chokepoint 2.0, with industry leaders recounting their experiences. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian said JPMorgan Chase debanked him in December 2022. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to uncover details about the operation and is compiling records. In September 2024, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter accused the Biden administration of deliberately shutting down Silvergate Bank to harm the crypto sector. “I believe Silvergate could have survived its drawdown — and was on a path to do so,” Carter said.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), which attempted to reach $100,000 two weeks ago, was a key driver of last week’s market downturn. It retested the $90,000 support level before rebounding to over $97,200 at last check Sunday. Despite last week’s bearish trend, several altcoins demonstrated impressive performance. Here are our top picks of notable performers to keep an eye on in the week ahead: XRP retests 2021 peak XRP ( XRP ) was one of the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s market rebound. Despite dropping by more than 12% from Nov. 24 to 26, XRP eventually closed the week with an impressive 33% gain. XRP 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Particularly, after retesting $1.28 on Nov. 26, the altcoin saw a massive rebound the next day, spontaneously breaching the $1.63 resistance that capped its previous run and flipping Binance Coin ( BNB ) to secure fifth among the top assets. XRP sustained the rally until it clinched $1.81, soaring further to $1.9586, which marked a retest of the $1.96 peak of April 2021. Veteran trader Peter Brandt previously asserted that XRP could surge if the $1.96 resistance clears. https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1858530426320535980 If XRP sustains the uptrend this week and breaches $1.96, this would allow it to finally reclaim $2 for the first time since the 2018 bull run. Its next Fibonacci level from here sits at $2.35 (Fib. 1.272), with further resistance at $2.56 (Fib. 1.414).

By the close of the week, APE retraced to retest the descending trendline, reaching support of $1.380. However, the bulls showed strength, reigniting a rally that allowed the asset to close the week at $1.5. APE has since dropped below $1.5, with its RSI at 69 still near overbought territories. This week, the bulls must defend the $1.3 region to hold above the symmetrical triangle. A breach back into the triangle could signal a shift in momentum to bearish.

ALGO spikes 51% Algorand ( ALGO ), the native token of the open-source smart contract layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was one of the largest gainers last week, spiking by a remarkable 51%. ALGO 1D chart | Source: crypto.news Most of ALGO’s gains occurred on Nov. 29, when the altcoin rallied by a massive 36.92%, its biggest intraday gain throughout this year. Before this rally, Algorand had observed the formation of a golden cross on Nov. 25, as its 50-day MA moved above the 200-day MA. The asset built on the ensuing bullish momentum to recover the $0.48 mark for the first time since the Terra collapse in May 2022. Analysts have projected lofty price targets, with some expecting a rally to $1.5. Interestingly, the last time ALGO saw a bullish cross was during the first phase of the bull run in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a 96% rally. This week, ALGO needs to breach its next major resistance at $0.4893 to sustain the upward push. Meanwhile, a drop below $0.40 could weaken the momentum.

37094584,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314861,1733063707,"XRP Price Forms Bullish Triangle Pattern, But RSI Signals Overbought Territory – Could XRP Hit $5 in December?","While the threat of a potential correction looms, the front-running altcoin doesn’t appear stirred yet, as today sees another 1.67% uptick in the XRP price. XRP has far surpassed expectations with a 270% increase over November, but it doesn’t appear over as bullish projections for XRP eye a target much higher running into 2025. However, cracks are starting to show today as XRP’s recent momentum dwindles somewhat, with a 38% lapse in trading volume, hitting $11.4 billion. XRP Price Analysis: Could A Correction Derail the Path to $5? Indeed, the concern that the recent rally may have been too much too quickly for the XRP price appears to be coming to a head as technical indicators raise alarms. As the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached deep overbought territory at 88, a correction seems like the natural and healthy next step for XRP to find stable footing for its next leg up. However, this would do little to derail XRP’s path to $5, according to a recent X post by popular pseudonymous analyst Egrag Crypto. XRP / USDT 1W chart, symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: Egrag Crypto / X The analyst likened the recent breakout of a symmetrical triangle pattern forming since mid-2017 to the breakout of a similar pattern in early 2017. Given the current rally mirrors the 2017 breakout, the analyst sets a $5.30 XRP price, a 180% advance from current prices. However, the projection comes with a caution. Just as the 2017 rally was followed by major corrections, a similar pattern could play out this time. Egrag expects a potential 63% retracement after XRP reaches its peak. This would bring the price back just below the $2 mark, aligning with XRP’s previous all-time high in 2021. The analyst also warned that the timeline of this rally may not match the last. Particularly as XRP seems to have far outpaced its fundamentals, given that the anticipated regulatory changes expected under the Trump administration have yet to get off the ground. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Bring Bigger Gains While a 2.8x for the XRP price is certainly appealing, emerging opportunities hold the potential for quicker and more substantial returns. After all, fortune favors the bold. As “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $Coolguy and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, strategic investors are looking to newer low-cap meme coins with exponential growth potential . Among them, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) stands out as a unique opportunity by pioneering the industry’s first meme coin staking platform.

On November 30, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson and MultiversX Foundation CEO Beniamin Mincu agreed upon a goodwill meeting this week. Everything started with a casual conversation between ADA and EGLD communities regarding the ongoing dominance of centralized dollar-based stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, Tether’s USDT, and Ripple Lab’s RLUSD, looking for sound alternatives . During the talk, Cüneyt Denizli, DBCrypto , and Angry Crypto Show discussed a Cardano-MultiversX ecosystem collaboration, referencing decentralized stablecoin alternatives. Denizli summoned Hoskinson for the talk, asking if IOHK is in contact with MultiverseX, which received a positive answer . I am in contact with them. My old friend and former colleague Adam Bates is their CMO — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2024 One hour later, Charles Hoskinson tagged Beniamin Mincu on X, suggesting they could “have a call sometime.” Mincu responded he will be in the United States “next week” and is “happy to meet and chat” with Hoskinson. Cardano (ADA) and MultiversX (EGLD) price analysis As of this writing, ADA is trading at $1.07 and EGLD at $44.53, up 199% and 86.7% in the last 30 days, respectively. This is a 23% surge since Finbold featured EGLD as an opportunity for investors who missed the XRP and ADA rally . At these prices, Cardano has a market cap 31 times higher than MultiversX.

Cardano could benefit from new functionalities and interoperability, while MultiversX could benefit from a boost in visibility and utility. Therefore, the AI predicts ADA could range between $2.55 and $3.38 by the end of 2025. In the meantime, EGLD is forecasted to trade at a minimum of $60 and a maximum of $72.71.

37094250,https://thecoinrise.com/central-banks-shifting-to-instant-payment-systems-over-cbdcs-survey/,1733063456,Central Banks Shifting to Instant Payment Systems Over CBDCs: Survey,"The allure of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a solution for improving cross-border payments is fading, according to the Future of Payments 2024 survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Interest in CBDC networks has dwindled, with only 13% of respondents considering them the most promising approach, down from 31% last year. Instead, Instant Payment Systems (IPS) are emerging as the preferred alternative. CBDCs Face Growing Skepticism One of the primary challenges central banks aim to tackle with CBDCs is the high cost of cross-border transactions. However, central banks appear increasingly divided on the effectiveness of CBDCs as a solution. The survey highlights governance and operational hurdles as persistent concerns, particularly for multi-currency CBDC platforms like Project mBridge . Launched as a collaborative effort to streamline cross-border payments, mBridge achieved a minimum viable product stage in mid-2024. Yet, liquidity management and governance remain barriers to adoption. Additionally, the platform’s reliance on Chinese-developed technology has raised concerns about centralization and potential misuse for evading sanctions. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) distanced itself from the project, with General Manager Agustín Carstens emphasizing that mBridge is not intended to serve the needs of BRICS nations or facilitate sanctions evasion. Still, skepticism remains. “Even the perception that mBridge could aid such ambitions is enough for Western stakeholders to withdraw support,” remarked Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. Instant Payment Systems Gain Traction In contrast, IPS models are gaining momentum, supported by 47% of central banks surveyed. The scalability and proven effectiveness of IPS in domestic markets, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, make it an attractive option for cross-border integration. Notably, five Southeast Asian countries recently piloted Project Nexus, showcasing the potential of IPS to interconnect existing systems seamlessly. While IPS holds promise, challenges remain. The report identifies governance structures and regulatory frameworks as critical factors requiring attention. Despite these hurdles, IPS is being hailed as the more pragmatic and scalable choice for global payments infrastructure. As enthusiasm for multi-currency CBDCs wanes, the shift toward IPS underscores a growing consensus among central banks. The focus is increasingly on systems that can deliver immediate, cost-effective solutions without the complexities associated with CBDCs.

37094249,https://finbold.com/?p=216122,1733063393,"Dogecoin is now in a ‘vigorous and rapid’ growth zone, according to analyst","Dogecoin’s ( DOGE ) technical setup is signaling a continuation of its recent momentum, which has seen the meme coin outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ). With DOGE aiming to breach the $0.5 resistance level, the coin could get a boost from the fact that it has officially entered the bullish “Green Zone.” This phase has historically seen explosive growth for the meme coin, according to cryptocurrency trading expert Trader Tardigrade . In an X p o st on December 1, the analyst noted that the “green zone” is associated with vigorous and rapid price movements. Historically, Dogecoin’s trajectory within this zone has led to monumental price surges, and this cycle appears no different. “The green zone tends to narrow after each cycle, indicating that the $Doge pump will be more vigorous and rapid in this zone,” the expert noted. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade To this end, the trading expert called on investors to hold their DOGE, anticipating a potential rally to double-digit prices. It’s worth noting, however, that even as DOGE emulates past movements, reaching double figures during this phase is not guaranteed, especially if the broader cryptocurrency market experiences significant declines. Meanwhile, as reported by Finbold, the analyst previously suggested that DOGE’s bull run had “just started,” based on signals from the Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) indicator. Dogecoin’s price likely to outperform Bitcoin further On-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez also shared the bullish outlook. Martinez suggested that Dogecoin could skyrocket by 2,400% against Bitcoin. This analysis is based on a breakout from a two-year descending channel, signaling potential gains from 0.00000438 BTC to 0.00009375 BTC. Dogecoin/Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Such a rally will continue Dogecoin’s impressive performance in 2024, during which the coin has gained nearly 360% year-to-date, compared to Bitcoin’s 119% return over the same period. Notably, Dogecoin’s rally has been fueled by bullish optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s election and the influence of Elon Musk , who is expected to play a significant role in the upcoming administration. DOGE’s possible ETF approval Further bullish sentiment arises from the potential entry of institutional investors into Dogecoin through an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). In this regard, Alexander Blum, CEO of Two Prime Digital Assets, believes a DOGE ETF application is inevitable, driven by the success of Bitcoin ETFs . However, Blum noted that regulatory approval remains uncertain. If the product gains approval, attention will turn to whether Dogecoin can replicate Bitcoin’s gains and potentially reach the $1 mark. Nevertheless, the launch of a Dogecoin ETF might not be universally welcomed. Dogecoin’s volatility, limited utility, and whimsical origins could deter significant investment in such a product. Dogecoin price analysis At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.42, with daily gains of about 0.5%. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has risen by 3.6%. Dogecoin price analysis chart.

As they set new standards for decentralization, investors are increasingly turning their attention to a new altcoin called 1FUEL , which promises significant returns. The excitement around 1FUEL lies in its innovative approach to managing digital assets, offering both simplicity and security. Continue reading to learn about these groundbreaking updates. Privacy, Staking, and Spending: 1FUEL Does it All 1FUEL is one of the enticing blockchain solutions in the market today that has the potential of changing the way we use digital assets. As Bitcoin and Filecoin gave new meaning to decentralization, this secure crypto wallet presents a compelling opportunity that has caused investors to consider it as possibly the best cryptocurrency to buy now. One feature worth mentioning about 1FUEL is its staking offering that allows users to earn crypto staking rewards without doing anything more than having their tokens on the platform. This means that not only can you trade and manage your cryptocurrencies but also earn your passive income from your investment. Also, 1FUEL has both virtual and physical debit cards to help users exchange their crypto assets for real money for purchasing goods and services. This makes it easier than ever to adopt cryptocurrency in our everyday use, such as online shopping or as we visit a nearby store. Moreover, 1FUEL is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that includes features like a privacy mixer, as well as a top-notch cold storage for crypto tokens. This allows investors to still own their assets without anyone knowing it is them, which is especially important in the current world where data breaches seem to be the norm. Filecoin: Decentralized Storage Leads Resurgence with 77% Gain Filecoin is one of the emerging names in the decentralized technology space and today it holds a market capitalization of $3.44 billion. Despite FIL having been down in the previous months, it is now one of the most actively growing assets with a 77% monthly price gain. While FIL has yet to reach its all-time high, recent price movements are encouraging. Market momentum as depicted by the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is at a high level, hence investors are very confident in Filecoin . If this positive momentum continues, analysts say FIL could rise to $7.5 from its current price of $6.5 by December. Conversely, if the market shifts negatively, the price may go down to about $4.96. Kiyosaki: Decentralized Bitcoin is a Benchmark, Price Could Reach $1 Million Bitcoin has been the most popular of the decentralized currencies and has recently been on the rise, nearing the $100,000 mark. More surprisingly, one of the most popular investors and the author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” Robert Kiyosaki claimed that bitcoin will soon climb above the monumental mark. However, he warns that this could make it harder for average people to invest in it, as only the very wealthy—like large companies and banks—might be able to afford it at that price. He describes Bitcoin as a decentralized benchmark for wealth. He also says that by 2025, Bitcoin could go up to $500,000 and could even hit a million by 2030 because of shifts in the markets. Currently trading at $96,603.06, BTC has been rallying for the past month, registering a 35% rise. Conclusion Analysts believe that 1FUEL has enormous potential and could become the best crypto to invest in 2024 . Currently in the presale phase at just $0.01 per coin, investors might see an increase of 500% or more as the presale progresses. Sign up to the presale now and you could experience your best returns in crypto.

Posting on X, he apologized for past remarks and pushed for collaboration ahead of what he sees as a critical moment for blockchain in 2025. “One suggestion that I have for all of us in the Cardano community is to let the comments and opinions of the past go and embrace a full reset of all ecosystems,” Charles wrote.

Charles wanted Ethereum to adopt a for-profit structure, clashing with Vitalik Buterin, who insisted on a non-profit model. This disagreement got Charles booted from the project in 2014, an exit he has since described as politically motivated and unfair. After Ethereum, Charles built Cardano, which he promoted as a superior blockchain with decentralized governance. And naturally, he has been critical of Ethereum, calling its governance model a “dictatorship” controlled by Buterin. This narrative set the stage for years of tension between the two communities, with Charles often at the center of heated debates. But his ‘beefs’ extended beyond Ethereum. Bitcoin maximalists were next in line for his sharp commentary. Charles frequently positioned Cardano as Bitcoin’s true rival, emphasizing its proof-of-stake model and smart contracts. His claims didn’t sit well with Bitcoin supporters, who thought he was overstepping. XRP fans didn’t escape his wrath either. During the Ripple vs. SEC legal battles, he referred to the project’s community as “XRP trolls,” escalating the already tense relationship between Cardano and Ripple’s communities. Legal battles and industry tensions Charles’s combative approach hasn’t been limited to words. Last month, we reported that he threatened legal action against Wyoming’s Stable Token Commission. The issue? Cardano was excluded from a government-backed stablecoin project that included Ethereum and Solana. Charles accused the commission of bias and claimed its selection process violated legal standards. Meanwhile, Cardano has struggled with adoption rates compared to Ethereum and Solana. Adding to his list of controversies, former Ethereum colleagues have actually accused Charles of embellishing his credentials. Allegedly, he implied being Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s elusive creator—an accusation he vehemently denies. Still, these allegations linger, casting a shadow on his public persona. Now, Charles wants to turn the page. He told his people: “2025 is about unity and progress. We have a window to make crypto mainstream and grow our markets to the tens of trillions of dollars of value, thereby entering every home and government alike. We can not allow petty tribalism to squander this opportunity.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-charles-hoskinson-apologizes-unity/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37093281.jpeg

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-trumprus-memecoin-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37092578,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656143,1733059820,Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record High Of $17 Billion — Bearish Or Bullish For ETH Price?,"The price of Ethereum has been on a remarkable run in the past week, returning above the $3,500 level for the first time since July 2024. This single-week performance represents a change in the fortunes of the “king of altcoins,” which somewhat slowed down after a great start to the month of November. While the current price layout for Ethereum suggests that there is still room for upward movement, certain on-chain signals indicate that the market might be on the cusp of a pullback. One of these signals is the ETH open interest , which recently hit a new all-time high. Is ETH Price At Risk With Surging Open Interest? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym ShayanBTC has revealed that while the Ethereum price trajectory looks bullish at the moment, investors need to tread with caution. This projection is based on the “alarming divergence” in the ETH futures market metrics. Specifically, the relevant futures market metric here is the open interest, which tracks the total amount of open futures or derivatives contracts of a particular cryptocurrency (ETH, in this case) in the market at a given time. It basically evaluates the amount of money being poured into Ethereum futures at every moment. According to data from CryptoQuant , the Ethereum open interest has reached a new all-time high value of $17 billion. Typically, surging open interest signals a shift in investor sentiment, with traders increasingly speculating and gearing for a potential market movement. ShayanBTC, however, noted that the notable spike in open interest was not accompanied by a new all-time high for the price of Ethereum. According to the Quicktake pundit, this divergence between the price and the open interest points to a potential increase in volatility and significant liquidation cascades. ShayanBTC added: If Ethereum’s price faces a sudden downturn or consolidation, the overleveraged positions from futures traders could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, leading to rapid price declines. As of this writing, the price of Ethereum sits just beneath $3,700, reflecting an over 3% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin’s value is up by nearly 8% in the past seven days. Ethereum Whales Load Their Bags Fortuitously, another on-chain data has emerged to counter the bearish prognosis for the second-largest cryptocurrency. In a November 30 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that a particular class of Ethereum large investors has been active in the market. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 coins have purchased over 280,000 ETH in the past four days. This level of buying activity from such an influential class of investor could be considered bullish for the altcoin.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-open-interest-hits-record-high-of-17-billion-bearish-or-bullish-for-eth-price/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/37092578.jpeg

37092419,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372860,1733059517,"Bitcoin Miners Pump $3.6B Into Infrastructure, Equipment in 2024","Since the beginning of 2024, publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies have collectively spent more than $3.6 billion on property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). This includes money spent on mining hardware, data center upgrades, and other infrastructure needed to maintain and expand their operations. Record Spending Incoming A November 28 newsletter from TheMinerMag revealed that mining companies’ investments in PP&E between July and September 2024 were the highest since Q1 2022 when they forked out a record $1.246 billion. In Q3 2024, the firms paid out $1.226 billion, only $20 million less than the Q1 2022 numbers. CleanSpark has yet to release its financial report for that period, and analysts feel that adding the Nevada-based miner’s outlay could allow the industry to set a new record for net PP&E expenditure in a single quarter. The BTC miners have invested about $3.49 billion in equipment and upgrades this year, including $1.18 billion between January and March and $1.07 billion between April and June, in addition to the Q3 figure. This is already nearly $900 million more than the sector’s outlay in the entirety of 2022. Hardware Purchases Dominate Spending The uptick in investment following a subdued 2023, when the companies put about $1.3 billion into PP&E, coincides with the Bitcoin network’s hashrate going up to nearly 790 exahashes per second (EH/s). Furthermore, the cryptocurrency’s mining difficulty also hit a new all-time high of 101.6 T on November 5, with experts predicting it will probably go up by at least another 2% in the coming days. It means that mining operations will have to focus on efficiency and scale to stay competitive and profitable. As such, most of the PP&E money invested in the last year went towards upgrading and expanding mining hardware. Preorder data tracked by TheMinerMag between July 2023 and March 2024 shows the firms committed more than $2 billion to buying the latest BTC mining machines. Deliveries were expected to start streaming in by September 2024, with China-based Bitmain securing most of the deals. However, delays in shipping the company’s Antminer ASIC devices to U.S.-based BTC miners have sparked speculation about potential links to ongoing geopolitical issues. This includes a reported investigation into possible sanctions violations by Sophgo, a Chinese chip maker associated with Bitmain co-founder Micree Zhan. If a connection were established, it could have serious consequences for the multi-billion dollar BTC mining sector, especially at a time when the cryptocurrency is threatening to breach the $100,000 milestone.

In a post on X, Marcus described the project as a “political kill,” halted by behind-the-scenes pressure on banks and resistance from high-ranking officials. Political Pressures Undermined Regulatory Efforts Launched as Libra before its rebranding to Diem, Meta’s stablecoin project aimed to revolutionize global finance . However, despite years of intense modifications to meet regulatory demands, Marcus claims that the project was ultimately thwarted by political resistance. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen played a decisive role, warning Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell about the political fallout of allowing the project to proceed. Marcus pinpointed this as the moment the venture unraveled, stating, “Effectively, this was the moment Libra was killed.” Following Yellen’s intervention, the Federal Reserve reportedly pressured participating banks during private calls. Marcus shared that the Fed’s general counsel delivered a statement to banks, saying, “We can’t stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.” This subtle but clear warning led to the project’s unraveling. In January 2022, Meta sold Diem to Silvergate Bank , which abandoned the initiative a year later, citing unsustainable prospects and writing off its investment entirely. Diem’s Legacy: New Horizons in Blockchain Although Diem failed to materialize, its influence persists through the blockchain talent it nurtured. Many former team members transitioned to Aptos and Sui, two innovative Layer 1 blockchain projects utilizing Move, a programming language originally developed for Diem. Meanwhile, Marcus has shifted his focus to Lightspark, a startup enhancing Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. The collapse of Diem underscores the tensions between private-sector innovation and public-sector control in the financial landscape. Regulators were especially concerned about the concentration of power. A 2021 report by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets warned that combining a stablecoin issuer and a corporate giant like Meta could result in an “excessive concentration of economic power.” The post David Marcus Explains How Politics Killed Meta’s Stablecoin Project Diem appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | APT,,0,0,The Coin Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/david-marcus-explains-how-politics-killed-metas-stablecoin-project-diem/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/37092717.jpeg
37092462,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620619,1733059164,Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin crash days after $500k AI prediction,"Famous author of the best-selling finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki has made a new Bitcoin prediction. According to Kiyosaki, Bitcoin is primed for a crash. He made the prediction days after his initial AI-fuelled prediction of Bitcoin hitting $500,000 by 2025. He took to his handle on microblogging platform X to reveal to his 2.6 million followers the situation surrounding the leading digital asset. Kiyosaki, a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, has always called on American citizens, especially the ones active in the crypto market to purchase Bitcoin. There is a consensus that the crypto is now down from its Trump-fuelled surge since early November, and speculation has grown about what will happen next for the asset. Initially tied to the situation surrounding Trump’s win at the polls, analysts have said the asset could maintain its momentum till next year. Robert Kiyosaki makes sensational Bitcoin price prediction In his post on X, Kiyosaki highlighted Bitcoin’s situation, explaining why he predicted an implosion. Kiyosaki maintains that he is still an avid Bitcoin believer even though he expects the asset to go down. Kiyosaki said that since the asset has tried to breach the $100,000 mark without success, the next move is a downward spiral. He cited historical instances when bears overtook the Bitcoin market as he said BTC could drop to as low as $60,000. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 However, he assured his users they should not be dismayed as he won’t sell even if it happens. He noted that instead, he will take advantage of the “Bitcoin sale” to purchase more units of the digital asset . Updating his prediction, Kiyosaki revealed the asset may do well and settle around $250,000 in 2025. He also said that users should stop dwelling on the asset’s price, urging them to keep stacking up as much as possible. “At this stage of the BTC process… price is not as important..as how many BTC you acquire. I want more BTC,” he said. Kiyosaki’s past bold BTC predictions and market reaction Robert Kiyosaki has built a reputation around his support for Bitcoin and assets like gold and silver. The famous author has always held his stance against traditional money, arguing the disadvantages of holding it. While his credibility has not been called into question, Kiyosaki has certainly made audacious Bitcoin predictions in his campaign for the leading digital asset. For instance, he predicted last year that Bitcoin would hit $350,000 by August, a prediction that did not happen. Again this year, Kiyosaki made a bold prediction noting that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030. He revealed that the surge will be driven by artificial intelligence (AI), and it will be frightening. So far, his predictions have been wide of the mark, and his bullish stance has failed to align with reality. Meanwhile, some of his followers have voiced their opinion over his constant predictions. One said they no longer take Kiyosaki seriously due to his ever-changing predictions. “I just can’t take this guy seriously anymore. His constantly changing opinions on crypto, gold, silver, and all this back-and-forth—crash, no crash, bullish, not bullish—are exhausting,” the user said. They added that it’s just clickbait in a discussion with another user who said Kiyosaki is only two years old in the Bitcoin market.

Video-sharing platform Rumble has announced plans to allocate up to $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin, aligning with broader corporate and institutional adoption trends while reinforcing its ties to the crypto community. With an absolutely huge $5.4 billion purchase of $BTC announced on Monday, MicroStrategy stock would perhaps be expected to rise. However, $MSTR is down 25% from its $540 high, and as per pre-trading, a further fall to $376 could take place.

37091960,https://finbold.com/?p=216115,1733058524,Analyst sets XRP price roadmap to $6,"XRP has captured the attention of traders and investors with its recent surge to $1.91, reflecting a 2.75% daily gain and a robust 37.5% weekly increase. Analysts are optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s outlook, mapping a bullish trajectory that could see XRP reaching $6.42. This optimism is driven by a combination of technical strength, regulatory shifts, and Ripple’s strategic moves to position itself at the forefront of the evolving crypto landscape. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technical analysis: XRP charts a path toward $6 XRP’s price action reveals a well-defined bullish roadmap, with multiple technical indicators supporting its upward trajectory. Crypto analyst Dark Defender , in an X post on December 1, highlighted that XRP has recently shown significant strength, reinforcing its potential for continued gains. Having decisively broken the critical resistance at $1.88, which now acts as support , XRP is poised to test $2.13 in the short term. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender Mid-term targets are identified at $4.11, a key level aligning with the 261.8% Fibonacci extension , and $5.85, paving the way for the ultimate target of $6.42, supported by the 361.8% Fibonacci extension. Trading well above the Ichimoku Cloud, XRP demonstrates strong momentum, with any pullbacks expected to find robust support within the cloud. Elliott Wave analysis further bolsters this outlook, suggesting the cryptocurrency is in the impulsive third wave of its bullish cycle, typically the most expansive phase. Derivatives data paints a bullish outlook Complementing this technical strength, derivatives data from CoinGlass reflects a bullish bias, with several indicators pointing to positive sentiment among traders. Open interest has increased by 4.26% to $3.35 billion, signaling heightened participation in XRP futures markets, while options volume and options open interest have grown by 17.41% and 16.20%, respectively, showing increased trader activity and positioning for potential price movements. XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass Binance’s long/short ratio of 1.5126, along with a strong long bias among top traders, underscores the optimistic sentiment driving XRP toward its ambitious price targets. Although overall trading volume has decreased by 36.46%, indicating reduced activity or potential consolidation, this does not diminish the bullish momentum evident in other metrics. Furthermore, liquidation data reveals a slight edge in long liquidations, approximately $9.88 million, compared to shorts at $9.62 million. This suggests some volatility but no significant bearish pressure. Overall, the data continues to support a bullish outlook for XRP in the near term Regulatory developments and market sentiment boost XRP Speculation about a pro-crypto shift in SEC leadership under a potential Trump administration has significantly boosted XRP demand. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has emerged as the leading contender for the SEC Chair position, with a 68% probability, according to betting platform Kalshi. Paul Atkins is now the frontrunner to become the next SEC chair, with his chances rising to 66%, up from 30% this morning pic.twitter.com/6yIJzz3i72 — Kalshi (@Kalshi) November 27, 2024 Brad Bondi, another pro-crypto candidate, holds a distant second position with a 20% probability of succeeding current Chair Gary Gensler . Both Atkins and Bondi are viewed as potential catalysts for ending the SEC’s appeal in the Ripple case, a development that could set a crucial legal precedent for the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s legal victories against the SEC remain a pivotal driver of XRP’s bullish momentum. The recent approval by the California District Court to amend the judgment and stay in the XRP lawsuit has brought the protracted legal battle closer to resolution. Adding to this optimism, the approval of XRP ETF filings by Canary Funds, Grayscale, and WisdomTree could attract substantial institutional investment, fueling XRP’s ongoing rally and reinforcing its market position. If approved, these ETFs could mirror Bitcoin’s success, which saw its price soar 129% after Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in January 2024. Furthermore, Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse’s $25 million donation to Fairshake PAC is widely seen as the company’s proactive efforts to build stronger relationships with pro-crypto policymakers. This move has further energized the market, contributing to a bullish reversal. In summary, institutional interest and rising derivatives activity continue to signal strong confidence in XRP’s long-term growth. Coupled with increasing open interest in derivatives markets, these factors position XRP as a leading asset for sustained market gains. If current momentum persists, XRP’s roadmap to $6.42 becomes increasingly attainable.

This groundbreaking platform is merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) in ways never seen before. With its native token, LCAI, making waves in its presale phase, the question on everyone’s mind is: Could LCAI spearhead the next major shift in decentralized AI? Join the presale today and secure your stake in this revolutionary project. The Rise of Lightchain Protocol AI Lightchain Protocol AI is more than just a blockchain project—it’s a bold attempt to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. By introducing the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain provides a seamless environment for executing AI-specific tasks like machine learning model training and inference. Central to this ecosystem is the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, a revolutionary approach that replaces traditional validation methods like Proof of Stake (PoS) with computational AI contributions. This allows participants to perform valuable AI tasks while securing the network, making every action a meaningful step forward for decentralized intelligence. Lightchain’s focus on transparency, scalability, and privacy makes it a game-changer for industries ranging from healthcare to logistics, where AI and blockchain can unlock unparalleled potential. Why Solana Whales Are Making the Shift Solana has long been a leader in the blockchain space, offering high-speed, low-cost transactions that attract major investors. However, Lightchain Protocol AI’s focus on decentralized AI opens up a completely new sector of innovation, one that promises long-term growth and utility. Here’s why Solana whales are making the shift: Cutting-Edge Technology: Lightchain’s AIVM and PoI consensus mechanism offer a highly efficient and scalable platform for decentralized AI applications. Deflationary Tokenomics: LCAI’s built-in scarcity model burns a portion of transaction fees, ensuring that the token’s value increases as the ecosystem grows. Real-World Utility: From decentralized AI-driven apps to privacy-focused computations, Lightchain Protocol AI is built for real-world use cases that appeal to enterprises and developers. Interoperability: Compatibility with major AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch makes it easy for developers to adopt and deploy AI solutions on the platform. For Solana whales, this isn’t just another investment—it’s a chance to be part of a transformative movement in blockchain and AI. LCAI: The Token Powering the Decentralized AI Revolution The LCAI token is the backbone of the Lightchain ecosystem. It powers governance, AI services, and staking, giving holders multiple ways to engage with and benefit from the platform. Its deflationary design, which reduces supply over time, ensures long-term value for early adopters. As Lightchain Protocol AI scales, demand for LCAI is expected to rise dramatically. Whether for accessing premium AI services, participating in decentralized governance, or developing AI-driven dApps, LCAI is integral to the platform’s success. How Lightchain Stands Out from Solana While Solana excels in speed and efficiency for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Lightchain Protocol AI is carving out its niche as the leader in decentralized intelligence. By focusing on the integration of AI and blockchain, Lightchain offers something entirely unique. Its AIVM and PoI systems are specifically designed for AI-heavy workloads, making it a more suitable platform for developers and enterprises working in AI-driven fields. Additionally, Lightchain’s focus on privacy, enabled by advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), ensures that sensitive data is handled securely—an essential feature in today’s data-driven world. These differences make Lightchain a complementary force rather than a competitor to Solana, appealing to a new wave of investors seeking diversified exposure in the blockchain space. Could LCAI Be the Future of Decentralized AI? The growing interest from Solana whales is a clear signal that LCAI is on the radar of major players. With its presale already attracting significant attention, Lightchain Protocol AI is positioned to lead the decentralized AI revolution. As industries increasingly adopt AI solutions, the demand for platforms that combine blockchain’s transparency with AI’s computational power is set to soar. LCAI isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a token backed by cutting-edge technology and a clear vision for the future. By addressing critical issues like scalability, privacy, and transparency, Lightchain Protocol AI is poised to become a cornerstone of decentralized AI development. Secure Your LCAI Today Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. The LCAI presale offers early investors a rare opportunity to secure tokens at a discount before demand drives prices higher. With Solana whales and other major investors already making their move, now is the perfect time to join the revolution. Join the LCAI presale today and position yourself at the forefront of decentralized AI innovation.

37091269,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27594,1733057118,"South Korea Delays Crypto Tax Implementation by Two Years, Now Set for 2027","South Korea Delays Crypto Tax by Two Years, Now Set for 2027 The Democratic Party of South Korea’s KDP has reversed its efforts to enforce a crypto capital gains tax starting in 2025, accepting an agreement to postpone the policy to 2027. The compromise between both parties was announced on Dec. 1, the result of hard bargaining between the KDP and the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP), which earlier pressed for a longer delay. Bipartisan Agreement Reached In a news conference, KDP floor leader Park Chan-dae confirmed the party’s agreement to the two-year postponement of the tax. The tax, due to start in January 2025, is now expected to be introduced in January 2027. The decision comes in tune with proposals by the government and the PPP for a grace period with the objective of ensuring market stability and protection for investors. The Case for Delaying the Tax The PPP has argued that imposing the tax prematurely could drive investors away from South Korea’s crypto market. Emphasizing the need for clarity and infrastructure, the party first proposed a three-year delay to 2028. Although the KDP initially opposed any delay, it eventually agreed to a two-year grace period as a middle ground. KDP’s Initial Opposition Before agreeing to the delay, the KDP had criticized the ruling PPP’s proposals, accusing the party of using the tax deferral as a political strategy . The Democratic Party felt the tax could have been applied in 2025 if combined with a higher threshold for taxation, proposing an increase from $1,800 to $36,000. This approach, they claimed, would target high-value traders without punishing smaller investors. A Long History of Postponements The crypto tax policy of South Korea has faced several delays since its announcement in 2021. It was first postponed from 2022 to 2023, then from 2025 to 2027. Each delay has been influenced by factors such as concerns about market readiness, regulatory clarity, and investor sentiment. What Does 2027 Hold? Once enforced, the crypto tax will charge 20% on annual gains over $2,300. Lawmakers say that this extra time will provide them with ample opportunity to implement a sound regulatory framework and enhance stability in the market. The latest delay demonstrates how South Korea is being cautious with regard to the regulation of its rapidly changing crypto sector while striking a balance between innovation and investor protection.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/south-korea-delays-crypto-tax-implementation/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP’s market cap is now hovering at around $110 billion, well above BNB’s valuation of $94.422 billion. BNB, the native asset of the Binance ecosystem, was the fourth-largest crypto asset at the start of last month while XRP was ranked seventh. But XRP furiously rallied from $0.491 on November 1st to $1.957 on November 30th, printing staggering gains of 298% in as little as 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP is now closing in on Solana ( SOL ). The layer-1 altcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) rival is currently the fourth-largest crypto asset valued at $113.416 billion. About six years ago, XRP stood as the second-largest crypto by market cap just behind Bitcoin ( BTC ). But things went downhill for the payments altcoin after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple in December of 2020, alleging that the firm has been selling XRP as an unregistered security for years. In July 2023, XRP exploded after Judge Analisa Torres ruled Ripple’s automated, open market sales of XRP are not securities. Judge Torres also tossed out the SEC’s allegations that Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen personally conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP.

37090990,https://crypto.news/?p=14315192,1733056530,"Crypto market corrects, Justin Sun saves WLFI, XRP takes center stage | Weekly Recap","In today’s edition of the weekly recap: the crypto market witnessed a correction spearheaded by Bitcoin, while TRON founder Justin Sun came to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s aid. Market correction As Bitcoin ( BTC ) slumped below the $98,000 mark days after breaching $99,000, altcoins collapsed. The global crypto market cap dropped 2.3%, with liquidations hitting $494 million as of Nov. 25. The following day, liquidations had surged to a 24-hour peak of $553 million, with long liquidations dominating amid a BTC drop to $92,000. On-chain data confirmed that the pullback was due to profit-taking trades. Bitcoin ETFs began the week with a net outflow of $435 million, breaking a five-day inflow streak. These funds saw an additional $122 million net outflow before recouping $103 million on Nov. 27 and $320 million on Nov. 28. WLFI taps Sun as advisor Last week, TRON founder Justin Sun pumped an investment of $30 million into U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s floundering crypto project, World Liberty Financial. Shortly after, the project announced that Sun had joined its ranks as an advisor. Trump and his sons had been promoting its cryptocurrency for weeks, saying it would “make finance great again,” but the industry “largely rejected it,” according to Bloomberg . Sales plummeted so badly that Trump couldn’t secure a payout. On Nov. 25, Sun’s investment pushed the project over the threshold, and the Trumps are expected to collect at least $15 million from the Tron entrepreneur’s coin purchase. XRP takes center stage Leading asset manager WisdomTree registered a trust in the state of Delaware, declaring its intentions to file for an XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Following the market-wide correction, XRP positioned itself as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ensuing recovery, spiking to a top of $1.95 on Nov. 30, as it retested the 2021 peak. Amid the run, XRP flipped Binance Coin ( BNB ) to become the fifth-largest crypto asset, hitting a $100 billion market cap for the first time since January 2018. XRP closed the week with a 33% gain. Traditional firms courting Bitcoin Traditional companies warmed up to Bitcoin last week. MicroStrategy built on its existing buying spree with a purchase of 55,000 more BTC for $5.4 billion. This brought total holdings to 386,700. On Nov. 25, Rumble, a video-sharing platform, confirmed plans to cop $20 million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining firm Marathon procured $67 million in BTC, bringing its holdings to 34,794 worth $3.3 billion. Reports confirmed that leading publicly traded company Metaplanet is looking to secure $62 million in funding to purchase Bitcoin. Global regulatory efforts Countries are pushing to regulate the crypto market. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority plans to complete crypto regulations by 2026. North African country Morocco is also looking to enact proper crypto regulations to bolster the growth of the local industry after banning the asset class seven years ago. While the U.S. debated the possibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, Brazilian lawmakers proposed the idea last week, suggesting the South American country allocate 5% of its treasury to procure BTC. Russia introduced a federal law that will impose taxes on cryptocurrencies in the country, essentially recognizing the asset class as taxable property. A U.S. court of appeals overturned the Treasury’s sanction of Tornado Cash, noting that it exceeded the department’s authority. Reports suggested former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins was the favorite to become the next SEC chair under Donald Trump. Pump.fun’s live stream dilemma Pump.fun’s live stream feature was abused by multiple token deployers, including threats of suicide and other heinous acts. The platform released a statement on the growing issue, noting efforts at regulating the live stream feature. Pump.fun eventually suspended live stream indefinitely to curb the issue. Despite the recent predicament, Pump.fun’s monthly revenue reached a new all-time peak of $82.7 million last month, representing a 207% rise from October’s figures.

37090887,https://finbold.com/?p=216102,1733056377,Small-cap crypto dominates payments in this AI pay-per-use hub,"NanoGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) hub that exclusively takes crypto for payments to pay-per-use dozens of premium AI models. Finbold covered NanoGPT’s launch and growth while also reporting on its competitors like PayPerQ, a Bitcoin ( BTC )-first platform. On December 1, NanoGPT published a data breakdown of all its crypto payments from November in the different accepted cryptocurrencies. The AI hub looked at the transaction count and volume of each coin, revealing its users’ preferences and customers’ behavior. As promised in October we're releasing the payment stats for the different coins used on our website! We hope this can help other merchants decide what to prioritise in integrating, and we were quite interested ourselves to see what the stats would show. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/4iXBNTqwZA — Nano-GPT (@NanoGPTcom) December 1, 2024 What is NanoGPT’s AI hub and pay-per-use model Essentially, people can top up their NanoGPT accounts with 15 cryptocurrencies to pay-per-use more than 30 AI models (chat and image). Each prompt or query generates a payment, which is deduced from the pre-funded wallet. Among the AI models, customers can query OpenAI ’s o1, ChatGPT -4o, and Dall-E 3, Antrhopic ’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet , Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, Meta’s Llama 3.1 Large, xAI’s Grok 2 , Flux Pro, and others. The accepted crypto and blockchains for payments are Nano ( XNO ), Monero ( XMR ), Base, Polygon ( POL ), Optimism ( OP ), Arbitrum (ARB), Litecoin ( LTC ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Solana ( SOL ), Circle USD ( USDC ), Dash ( DASH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Banano ( BAN ), Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Tether USD ( USDT ). NanoGPT’s AI crypto payments breakdown Notably, Nano leads with a 77.8% and 51.35% dominance for crypto payments count and volume, respectively. The “OG” cryptocurrency is the AI hub’s favorite and has a 5% discount if chosen as the deposit method. “With many other coins, there are always fees and often waiting times,” Milan de Reede, NanoGPT’s creator, exclusively told Finbold . “Whereas with Nano, it just feels really good to send it and see it instantly confirmed without paying any fees.” Monero comes as the second most used crypto for payments in the AI platform despite being the most-recent addition. XMR has seen remarkable growth, which NanoGPT believes is due to its privacy-experience, aligned with the platform’s values and mission. Then, BTC is the third by volume, while BCH has this position by payment count and the fourth by volume. Interestingly, this reflects a user’s behavior depending on the crypto used, favoring higher or lower value per each payment made. NanoGPT’s percentage (left) and volume (right) of total transactions. Source: NanoGPT / Finbold Why is Nano (XNO) leading AI pay-per-use crypto payments? It is notable that, despite having a far lower market capitalization and overall penetration than the other cryptocurrencies, XNO dominates the users’ spending preferences in the AI pay-per-use platform. Talking to Finbold, de Reede explained that, besides Nano’s efficiency for payments, the small-cap crypto also has other notable qualities. “It’s probably a combination of [XNO] being the first coin that we supported, so it having spread widely in the Nano community,” he added. “The reason we like Nano so much despite its low market cap is that it’s quite unrivaled as a medium of exchange with zero fees and instant confirmations, but also that we think it fundamentally might be the strongest possible store of value. That is not recognized in the market cap at all right now, but Nano is fixed supply and has a game theory that actively incentivizes decentralization.

37090943,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620607,1733056344,Balaji Srinivasan proposes Zethereum to boost Ethereum privacy using ZK tech,"Crypto entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan has proposed a concept to improve Ethereum privacy. In a post on X, Srinivasan termed the concept Zethereum, saying it would involve adding zero-knowledge (zk) technology to Ethereum smart contracts. According to Srinivasan, all it takes is for a pseudonymous engineer, whom he chose to call Zatoshi, to add private transactions and zk stack features to Ethereum as optional smart contracts. He believes a developer must have high-level OpSec knowledge to implement the changes. Srinivasan said : “Essentially it would be a way to ship much of Justin Drake’s impressive five year ZK roadmap in three months…except via smart contracts rather than the base layer. This would enable our hypothetical Zatoshi to move quickly and take more risk.” He believes that going this route is more efficient as it ensures that Ethereum could have privacy features within months instead of years. With the implementation, Zethereum could function like Tornado Cash, the crypto mixer that a recent US court ruling declared not illegal. However, the entrepreneur admitted that developing Zethereum could be risky even though the legal position on Tornado Cash has become more favorable. Thus, it is better for any developer working on such a project to do it anonymously. He observed that until Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev are pardoned, anyone building such technology will be taking a major risk with their freedom. Why build on Ethereum? Srinivasan discussed why he chose Ethereum for this idea and not any other blockchain network. According to him, Ethereum is the best option because the recent Tornado Cash ruling concerns an Ethereum smart contract. This ensures that anyone who builds Zethereum on Ethereum could directly rely on the ruling as a defense. He further noted that other chains do not have the qualities that make Ethereum ideal. Bitcoin, for instance, has an immutable base layer, and the community is more focused on “political innovation than technical innovation.” As for Zcash, which is a pioneer in ZK technology, he noted that it is not as popular as Ethereum. He said: “Zooko and his old team are of course the pioneers in zero knowledge. And Zcash arguably has already done much of this in terms of base-layer privacy. But Zcash doesn’t have the distribution of Ethereum.” Meanwhile, he said popular networks such as Solana and Base would have been good for such a protocol, but most of their developers are not anonymous, which could put them at risk given the current legal situation. However, he believes that any developer willing to build Zethereum on any network and improve internet freedom can still give it a shot. Crypto community reacts to proposal Srinivasan’s proposal has sparked several reactions. While everyone agrees on the importance of on-chain privacy, most people believe that several projects are focused on this problem and that the solution is not as simple as the former Coinbase CTO presents it. Pseudonymous Basedcrypto noted on X that Aztec Network, Penumbra, and Rift are just a few of the protocols building this vision. Aztec Network, a privacy-focused L2 on Ethereum, stole the most spotlight, with many stakeholders noting that it has been working on this issue for years. Aztec Labs CEO Zac Williamson also responded, noting that he has been working on the idea for seven years now, and it will take at least 70 developers to make it work rather than just one. He said: “I’ve been working on this exact thing for seven years and now the KOLs are clout farming with their microbrain ‘hot takes’ because privacy is the new meme narrative.” He went further to explain that the tech involved in making this work is extremely complex, with years of collaborative painstaking research and thousands of technical deployments by several protocols. According to him, this is why it has taken seven years to build the Aztec Network, and the mainnet will soon launch. However, Williamson noted that it is not necessary for developers working on the Zethereum concept to be anonymous, and Aztec Network has focused on programmability. He said: “This work does not need to be done anon. Privacy is a force for good and is not fundamentally hostile to the concept of protecting users. On the contrary, our programmability enables specific dapp developers to program in whatever checks they need for the jurisdiction they are targeting.” In his response, Srinivasan called on Aztec to launch its mainnet, noting that the community is looking forward to trying it. However, he acknowledged the technical difficulties and noted that he has supported several projects within the sector. Meanwhile, some believe there is no need for Zethereum at all. Pseudonymous user Naval believes Zcash is sufficient as a privacy network and works well because it uses proof of work. He noted that a programmable chain has more vulnerabilities and that it is best to separate chains for store value, programmability, and privacy.

The nine products combined booked $332.9 million in net inflows during Friday's shortened trading session, data compiled by Farside Investors shows. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led, attracting $250 million and $79 million in fresh funds, respectively.  Friday was the fifth consecutive session with net inflows for the group, and concluded the second strongest week with $455 million in net inflows, per SoSoValue data. It was a shorter week as U.S. traditional markets were closed on Thanksgiving Thursday.  Ether ETFs also outpaced flows into their spot bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $320 million inflows on Friday and suffered net outflows during the week.  After falling out of investors' favor and lagging behind bitcoin in price action and ETF flows this year, ether has enjoyed a resurgence recently as Donald Trump's election victory rejuvenated interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  Along with strong ETF inflows, open interest for ETF futures on the institutional-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged to all-time records of almost $3 billion, per CoinGlass, underscoring the improving sentiment towards the asset.

Analysts Predict 100% Surge by 2025,"Ethereum (ETH) could be on the brink of a major price surge, with a potential 97% gain by the end of Q1 2025, according to insights from leading crypto analysts. The formation of a classic “cup and handle” pattern on Ether’s price chart is fueling this optimism, signaling a major breakout if critical resistance levels hold. Pseudonymous crypto analyst venturefounder highlighted in a November 30 post on X that Ethereum’s three-year technical pattern is nearing completion, with the $3,800 mark being a pivotal support level for confirmation. Ethereum Price Targets Venturefounder outlined a bullish trajectory for Ether, projecting three key price targets: $5,349, $6,457, and $7,238. Achieving the highest target would reflect a near-doubling of Ether’s current price, which stood at $3,690 at the time of writing. Despite a 47% rally since the beginning of November, Ether has yet to experience its anticipated “explosion,” the analyst noted. The delay is attributed to the resilience of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has maintained strength in the 100-106 range. Historically, significant breakdowns in the DXY have often preceded major cryptocurrency price movements. Other crypto analysts have joined the conversation, with Titan of Crypto noting that the weekly Ichimoku Golden Cross—a key bullish indicator—has finally materialized. Titan forecasted a price target of $5,800 for Ether, while trader Wolf predicted an even more ambitious range of $9,000 to $10,000 by May 2025. Growing Interest in Spot Ether ETFs Adding to Ether’s bullish narrative, spot Ethereum ETFs recently hit a record daily inflow . On November 29, $332.9 million poured into nine-spot Ether ETFs, surpassing the previous high of $295.5 million set earlier in the month. This surge in inflows underscores growing institutional interest in Ethereum, aligning with the broader market’s optimism for the asset’s mid-term prospects. Pseudonymous trader Doctor Profit described prices below $4,000 as a “gift for the mid-term” in a December 1 post, encouraging investors to consider current levels as an entry point. As Ethereum approaches the critical $3,800 support, the coming weeks could determine whether the crypto asset achieves its ambitious price targets. The post Ethereum Ready for a Massive Rally?

The platform had seen consistent growth in November, with revenues peaking during the fourth week of the month. From Nov. 18–24, Pump.fun generated $33.83 million in weekly revenue, according to DefiLlama. This marked a 60% increase compared to the previous week and an almost 400% surge from the start of November. However, the following week, Nov. 25 to Dec. 1, revenues dropped dramatically. DefiLlama data revealed a 66% decline to $11.31 million, reversing the prior growth trend. The revenue decline followed mounting community concerns over harmful actions being livestreamed by users attempting to boost their tokens’ popularity. Livestream Backlash On Nov. 25, Beau, safety project manager for Pudgy Penguins, reported a troubling incident where a livestreamer threatened suicide if their coin didn’t reach a specific market cap. Beau called on Pump.fun to intervene, urging the platform to disable its livestream feature and provide support to the individual. Other social media users reported similarly disturbing behavior. One user claimed a streamer threatened to harm a dog, while another alleged a threat of school violence. In response, Pump.fun disabled the livestream feature indefinitely. In a community note on Nov. 25, the platform acknowledged the concerns over the violent content and stated it had paused livestreams until proper moderation systems could be implemented. Industry Reactions Yuriy Brisov, a partner at Digital and Analogue Partners, called the incident “a legitimate reason for a criminal investigation and civil lawsuits.” Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of Trading Strategy, suggested Pump.fun might face swift police action or eventual regulatory shutdown as authorities assess the situation.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Organized through the International Federation of American Football’s 75 national member federations, flag football recently became the official game of the NFL Pro Bowl and was confirmed as part of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Leading the charge is eleven-year NFL veteran and Super Bowl Champion Russell Okung, a prominent advocate for athletes’ financial sovereignty and the first professional athlete to receive his salary in Bitcoin. George Mekhail, Vice President of Operations at BTC Inc., commented on the topic: “ The flag football match at our Bitcoin event is no accident—it embodies the collaboration and resilience of the Bitcoin community. Russell Okung’s push to empower athletes with Bitcoin is a forward-thinking vision that moves us more into mainstream consciousness. We’re proud to host this mission at the Bitcoin Conference, bringing purpose and excitement to our attendees .” The star-studded lineup also includes over 22 football legends, such as Antonio Brown, Le’Veon Bell, Johnson Bademosi, Jurrell Casey, and Jared Evans. The roster further includes celebrated players such as Dez Bryant, Dontrelle Inman, Mohammad Sanu, Randell Johnson, Michael Thomas, Craig Robertson, and Wesley Woodyard, representing an array of talent from across the NFL. The Bitball Flag Football game will be part of the official lineup of side events at this year’s Bitcoin MENA 2024, December 9-10, 2024, the largest global gathering of Bitcoin investors, developers, and stakeholders. All Bitcoin MENA ticket holders will have free access to watch the Bitball Flagg Football match live on December 10 at the Al Nahyan Stadium in Abu Dhabi starting at 7 pm. Separate tickets for the event that blends sports, technology, and digital assets will be available for purchase at PlayBitBall, which will be distributed globally via live streaming on Bitcoin Magazine’s platform, Rumble, and YouTube, allowing global audiences to witness this unparalleled fusion of Bitcoin and professional football, that marks a cultural milestone for the UAE as well as the wider GCC region. Digital asset taxation Some good news for the Bitball Flagg Football players is that the United Arab Emirates has no income tax and has recently abolished value-added taxes on digital asset transactions. By exempting individuals and businesses from a VAT on the transfer and conversion of digital assets, the UAE has positioned itself as a potential hub for digital currencies (see Coincub Tax Report here ). So, the players will not be subject to double taxation on their digital asset income in the absence of a UAE and the US Income Tax Treaty. Nevertheless, the Bitball Flagg Football players will be subject to worldwide US taxation on their digital assets, which are treated as property and are subject to income tax or capital gains taxation. Digital assets taxed as income in the US The IRS provides guidelines on when digital assets count as income rather than a capital gain. Transactions that are viewed as additional income subject to income tax include: Getting paid in digital assets (such as the Bitball Flagg Football players). Mining digital assets (on a hobby level). Receiving an airdrop. Receiving new digital assets from a hard fork. Staking rewards. Referral bonuses. Earning interest through lending protocols. Earning new liquidity pool tokens, governance, or reward tokens on DeFi protocols. Learn to earn rewards. Watch to earn rewards. Browse to earn rewards. GameFi rewards. Digital asset taxation as an investment in the US Digital assets that are held as investments are subject to taxation at different tax rates. Short-term gains (held 1 year) at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income and filing status. NFTs deemed collectibles may be taxed at 28%. Digital asset losses can offset gains and can reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000. Any unapplied losses can be carried forward to future tax years until they’re fully used. The IRS does not let digital asset investors claim lost or stolen crypto as a capital loss, so if a digital asset investor lost a digital asset due to a hack, scam, or loss of private keys—the investor is out of luck, and the best thing is simply to write it off. Digital asset tax breaks American digital asset investors can benefit from a few tax-free allowances that can help them pay a little less tax: Gifting digital assets under $18,000 : You can gift up to $18,000 in digital assets per person tax-free (for 2024). This is known as the annual gift tax exclusion. This can help you take advantage of lower Income Tax rates in your household and pay less tax overall. If you gift over this amount, provided you’re under the lifetime gift tax exemption of $13.61 million in 2024—you won’t need to pay gift tax. However, you may need to file Form 709 (more on this below). For 2025, this increases to $19,000 with a lifetime exemption of $13.99 million. Capital gains tax-free allowance : If you earned less than $47,026 in 2024 in total income (including your digital asset gains), you’ll pay no capital gains tax on long-term gains. For 2025, this increases to $48,350. Long-term capital gains tax rate : If you hold your crypto for more than a year, you’ll pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate of between 0% and 20%, depending on how much you earn. How to report digital assets on tax returns A digital asset owner files digital asset taxes with their annual tax returns by answering the IRS’s digital asset transactions question. A variation of this seemingly innocuous question appears at the top of Forms 1040, Individual Income Tax Return; 1040-SR, US Tax Return for Seniors; and 1040-NR, US Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The question was also added to these forms: Forms 1041, US Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts; 1065, US Return of Partnership Income; 1120, US Corporation Income Tax Return; and 1120S, US Income Tax Return for an S Corporation. The IRS asks this question with variations for corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts: “At any time during the year, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?” Yes or No? The box indicates that they had digital asset tax reportable transactions. Report digital asset disposals, capital gains, and losses on Form Schedule D (1040) and Form 8949. Report digital asset income on Form Schedule 1 (1040) or Form Schedule C (1040). Report digital assets held in foreign exchanges, such as an exchange in the UAE on FATCA Form 8938 and FBAR FinCEN Form 114. Digital asset tax disclosure deadline The US tax year is from January 1 to December 31. Digital asset tax deadlines match traditional assets: April 15 for most individuals. If a digital asset investor is a US expat, then you have until June 15. If you filed for an extension to file your taxes using Free File or Form 4868, you’ll automatically have an extension until October 15. Can the IRS and state tax departments track my digital assets? Yes—both the IRS and state tax departments can track digital assets. The IRS has won cases against Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, forcing them to share customer data, and the IRS has cross-border reach for tax evasion. This February, the IRS levied its first stand-alone crypto tax fraud case, which led to a guilty plea by Frank Richard Ahlgren III for filing a false tax return underreporting gains from selling $3.7 million in Bitcoin. USA v. Ahlgren was the first crypto case with tax evasion allegations unrelated to another crime; it is now also the first stand-alone crypto tax fraud case to result in a guilty plea. Ahlgren faces up to three years in prison. At the state level, billionaire Bitcoin bull and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, who evaded more than $25 million in local income taxes from 2005 to 2022 through falsified records and statements, paid $40 million to settle a lawsuit alleging he committed massive local and state tax fraud by lying to authorities for years about where he lived. Ahlgren, Saylor, and the DOJ’s case against Roger Ver (also known as “Bitcoin Jesus”) underscore the IRS, State Tax Department, and DOJ’s commitment to prosecuting digital tax evasion. The IRS indicated earlier this year that its audit focus would be on digital assets and high-network individuals. In light of these developments, digital asset owners and investors may wish to reevaluate their tax reporting and filing obligations to ensure compliance.

Despite this loss, market sentiments on premier cryptocurrency remain highly bullish amidst a 61% price gain that stretches to early October. However, Bitcoin’s impressive ascent to new points over the past few weeks has resulted in potentially bearish market developments. Bitcoin Realized Price Up ‘Only’ $37,000 Amidst Charge To $100,000 In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with username Grizzly shared an intriguing insight on Bitcoin’s realized price following the asset’s recent price surge. According to Grizzly, as Bitcoin moved from $60,000 to almost $100,000 in the past two months, its realized price only rose from $31,000-$32,000 to $37,000 indicating a widening gap between both values which produces multiple implications. For context, realized price means the average price at which all Bitcoin in circulation was purchased, effectively representing the aggregate cost basis of all holders. It is often applied in investor behavior analysis as well as identifying market cycles. A rise in realized price is generally a positive development which indicates heightened capital inflows as new investors are purchasing Bitcoin at elevated price levels. Furthermore, an increased realized price also signals a reduced selling pressure from long-term holders despite significant price gains which is a strong representation of market confidence. However, Grizzly explains that a widening gap between market price and realized price as presently seen traditionally signals short-term overheating that indicates an unsustainable price growth driven by speculation with no underlying fundamentals. Albeit, the analyst also highlights that historical data has shown Bitcoin to witness similar widening gaps in previous bull seasons with sustained price growth. This phenomenon can be attributed to the rapid price appreciation recorded in a typical bull run. Therefore, the current widening gap between Bitcoin’s realized price and market price may likely bear no influence on the asset’s present bullish trajectory. BTC Records Largest Exchange Withdrawal In Two Years In other news, the crypto community has now experienced the highest outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since December 2022. According to the team at CryptoOnChain , this development strongly signifies that BTC’s bullish rally has much room to run. At press time, the crypto market leader is valued at $96,468 following a 0.08% decline in the past day. However, Bitcoin remains in profit on larger time frames as evidenced by a 38.22% gain in the past thirty days.

37089763,https://finbold.com/?p=216095,1733054122,Legendary trader warns Bitcoin ‘expectations way too high’ – Here’s why,"A legendary trading expert has warned young people banking on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as their ticket to financial freedom, even as proponents maintain the asset is poised for record highs. According to Peter Brandt, Bitcoin bull cycles have significantly ‘degenerated in magnitude’ over time, noting that Gen Z and millennials may have set their expectations regarding digital currency too high, he said in an X post on December 1. “Bitcoin bull cycles have exponentially degenerated in magnitude. BTC is likely to remain a great hedge vs. fiat busts. But, the bloom is off the rose. Gen M & Zers who view BTC as the road to financial glory are likely to be very disappointed,” he said. To back this assessment, Brandt shared data mapping Bitcoin’s historical price surges, from a 483-fold rise in 2010-2011 to a much more subdued 6.4-fold advance between November 2022 and November 2024. History of Bitcoin parabolic advances. Source: Factor LLC While Bitcoin has far outpaced traditional investments like the Dow Jones, gold , and even technology giants like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) over decades, Brandt suggested the cryptocurrency’s days of explosive growth are fading. Despite this, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s properties, saying it remains an ideal hedge against fiat currency devaluation. What next for Bitcoin His warning comes as the market anticipates Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark, with some proponents maintaining that the asset has the potential to rally to $1 million. To this end, MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has projected that Bitcoin might trade as high as $13 million by 2045—a prediction author and investor Robert Kiyosaki endorsed . In the same vein, Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, investors should expect a shift in ownership. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki believes ownership will be dominated by the ultra-rich, potentially locking young investors out. Indeed, some key drivers are seen as favorable for Bitcoin, including the possibility of the United States incorporating the cryptocurrency into its strategic reserves and implementing crypto-friendly regulations .

Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts For instance, Martinez noted that during the last Bitcoin bull run, the index’s extreme greed zone surged from $15,000 to a staggering $57,000.

While Bitcoin’s growth is slowing, its possible role as a hedge against fiat and potential for future rallies keep it a key focus.

The latest move pushes the tax’s implementation to 2027, marking a significant shift in the country’s stance on digital asset taxation, allowing the market additional time to adapt. “After extensive discussions, we concluded that additional institutional arrangements are necessary for the virtual asset taxation,” DPK floor leader Rep. Park Chan-dae said during the press meeting at the National Assembly. “We have agreed to defer taxation for two years.” Park also noted that the decision was made after a ‘prolonged deliberation, debate, and political judgment.’ This decision comes after months of disagreement between the ruling PPP and the KDP. While the PPP supported a three-year grace period, the KDP had previously pushed for implementing the tax in 2025 and had accused the ruling party of using delays as a political strategy regarding South Korea crypto tax policies. South Korea’s Journey In Crypto Taxes South Korea’s journey toward taxing cryptocurrency gains began in 2021 when the government proposed a 20% tax on digital asset profits exceeding $1,800 annually. However, criticisms from investors and industry stakeholders led to repeated delays. Notably, the South Korea crypto tax’s implementation was initially pushed to 2023, then to 2025, and now to 2027. The current tax framework charges taxes on gains exceeding 2.5 million won, whereas stock trading profits are taxed only above 50 million won, a disparity that has been heavily criticised. Government’s Plans To Impose Crypto Taxes Beginning next year, the government had planned to impose a 22 percent tax, including local taxes, on annual income exceeding 2.5 million won ($1,790) from virtual asset investments. Although the policy had already been postponed twice, the DPK initially intended to implement the taxation plan by raising the tax exemption threshold to 50 million won. However, the widespread criticism from the increasing number of crypto investors and opposition from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) led the party to agree to a further postponement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in South Korea 2024 , South Korea Remains Key Player In Global Market South Korea remains a key player in the global crypto market .

Theta Network is a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain providing infrastructure for multimedia and artificial intelligence use cases. Data shows that its price surge brought a huge wave of derivatives traders. According to data provided by Santiment, open interest increased by 77% over the past day and reached an ATH of $84 million.

The indicator shows that the number of traders betting on the price drop has increased. Consequently, high price volatility would be expected for the asset since any movements could potentially trigger increased liquidations. Data from the market intelligence platform shows positive social sentiment and discussions around the blockchain have significantly increased over the last 30 days. This could raise the fear of missing out among investors. Most notably, price rallies that emerge on the back of FOMO (fear of missing out) tend to be highly volatile due to the lack of major catalysts. Theta Network was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2017. Liu is a veteran in the video and gaming industries, who previously founded startups like Tapjoy and Gameview Studios. IronSource purchased Tapjoy for $400 million. Long is a specialist in blockchain, virtual reality and live-streaming. Theta has attracted several high-profile investors and strategic partners from various industries, including Samsung, Sony, Digital Currency Group, Sierra Ventures and Heuristic Capital Partners.

The surge brought 7-day gains to 30%, outperforming bitcoin (BTC) and other majors, while 30-day gains stand at nearly 300%, data from CoinGecko show.

37088827,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620600,1733051994,Calgary police issue warrant for suspect linked to house fire and crypto threats,"Calgary police have issued an arrest warrant for a man suspected to have attacked a home in Hillhurst last month. According to the authorities, the suspect, Finbar Hughes, is wanted on several charges, including possession of materials to commit arson and setting fire to a dwelling. The police noted that Hughes may have decided to set the house on fire after failing to extort Bitcoin from its residents. The Calgary police were alerted to a fire incident at a dwelling around 3 AM on the morning of November 19. After several attempts, the fire service successfully extinguished the fire, leaving the house with minimal damage. The fire happened after residents in the area reported receiving threatening letters on their doorsteps, asking them to transfer Bitcoin to a wallet address. The authorities also noted that there had been reports of fire incidents around Edmonton. However, they have yet to find any connection between both incidents. Calgary police urge the public to help find Finbar Hughes According to an official statement, the police have enjoined the public to help them find Hughes, noting they had exhausted all options at the time of the publication on Saturday. The police said that anybody with details of his whereabouts should come to the local station, or call them. This is not the first arson crime that occurred in the region this year. Police arrested and charged 40-year-old Gavin Peter Robinson for arson and disregard for human life in October. Although the police said the motive for the act was unknown at the time, they will add subsequent charges as the investigation proceeds. Robinson was said to have used an accelerant to set fire to his home, causing a huge explosion. The fire affected four other homes, rendering them unlivable and displacing their occupants. According to his neighbor Gladys, Robinson lived with his partner and dog. Gladys said the fire was intentional, noting that she was away with her family when it happened. Gladys and the other neighbors who have lost their house to the fire have called for justice, asking the police to speed up Robinson’s prosecution. Bitcoin threat epitomizes dangers in the crypto sector This is not the first time Bitcoin and other digital assets have been demanded with threats of physical harm. While the Calgary police are continuing their investigations to tie the fires to the Bitcoin threat, it has become normal for bad actors to carry out vicious acts like this. According to a Chainalysis report , crypto ransomware rose in the first half of 2024. The report revealed an increase of $10.7 million in ransomware inflows from 2023, noting that the 2024 figure, $459.8 million, is well on course to smash the record for the highest-grossing ransomware year. The year also saw the largest ransomware payment, the $75 million received by the Dark Angels group. However, ransomware payments decreased by 27% over the same time frame. Threats for Bitcoin and ransomware are not the only bad acts in the crypto sector as other illegal activities remain. It is left for the market to remain vigilant and users to safeguard their assets in the best way possible.

37088595,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372922,1733051885,Ethereum Price Analysis: Here is the Next Probable Target for ETH,"Ethereum’s price shows signs of strength, with a slight rebound after retesting the $3.5K support level. While the price is poised to challenge the $4K resistance soon, periodic consolidations within the $3.5K to $4K range are likely as the market digests recent gains. Ethereum Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s upward trajectory has faced a pause after an impressive surge above the $3.5K resistance level. This breakout was a significant milestone, but the subsequent loss of bullish momentum led to a consolidation period, returning to the $3.5K mark. This pullback has triggered renewed buying interest, leading to a slight rebound that demonstrates the market’s intention to sustain its upward movement. However, the bearish divergence in the RSI indicator suggests a weakening bullish momentum. It indicates that Ethereum might face a mid-term consolidation correction phase before resuming its climb. As the price progresses toward the $4K psychological resistance, periods of reduced volatility and retracements are expected. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart During the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum’s bullish strength remains evident, with its breakout above the ascending wedge pattern and the critical $3.5K resistance level. The price’s pullback to this region and subsequent rebound confirm the continuation of the uptrend toward the $4K mark in the mid-term. However, the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the 4-hour chart suggests increasing seller activity and waning bullish momentum. This scenario implies that while the price will likely move toward the $4K mark, it may face periods of sideways trading and minor corrections within the $3.5K-$4K range. Such movements would allow the market to consolidate before another impulsive move. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum’s price has rebounded at the critical $3.5K support level, maintaining its bullish trajectory. However, while price action indicates potential upward movement, the futures market metrics reveal an alarming divergence that could significantly influence market dynamics. The open interest metric, which tracks the total number of open perpetual futures positions across all exchanges, has reached a new all-time high. This spike suggests unprecedented speculative activity in Ethereum’s derivatives market. Interestingly, this surge in open interest is occurring without a corresponding new all-time high in Ethereum’s price. This divergence raises concerns of increased volatility and substantial liquidation cascades. If the price faces a sudden downturn or consolidation, the overleveraged positions in the Futures market could trigger a wave of forced liquidations, leading to rapid price declines.

The regulator claims the company raised nearly $95 million under false pretenses, marking another high-profile case of alleged misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector. According to a statement released on November 29, the SEC alleges that Touzi Capital misled investors by portraying its crypto asset mining fund as a stable, high-yield opportunity comparable to money market accounts. Instead, funds were reportedly misused across unrelated ventures, leaving investors exposed to substantial risks. Misleading Claims The SEC’s complaint paints a grim picture of the alleged scheme. Investors were led to believe their contributions would support crypto mining operations, but Touzi Capital allegedly “commingled” the funds with those of its subsidiaries. The SEC claims that much of the money was diverted to projects entirely unrelated to crypto mining, with investors kept in the dark about the true nature of the fund’s activities. Despite mounting issues, Touzi Capital continued soliciting new investors even as its projects began to fail. The SEC alleges that the fund’s assets were not only illiquid but also far riskier than portrayed in promotional materials. By downplaying these risks, the company is accused of violating securities laws and undermining investor trust. This case underscores the ongoing challenges regulators face in curbing fraudulent activity within the crypto industry, as firms exploit the hype surrounding digital assets to attract unsuspecting investors. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation The SEC’s legal action against Touzi Capital comes amid heightened scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. This case adds to a growing list of enforcement actions aimed at holding bad actors accountable , but some industry insiders believe a political shift could reshape the regulatory landscape. Joe Lubin, CEO of Consensys, suggested in a recent interview at DevCon 2024 that many SEC cases against crypto firms might be dismissed if Donald Trump is reelected as U.S. president. Lubin predicts a more lenient regulatory approach could save the industry millions in legal fees and create an environment for innovation.

However, the $90K support level has pushed the price back higher, and Bitcoin could finally reach the $100K level in the next few days. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart offers a clearer picture of the recent price action. The price has been gradually correcting since a rejection from the $99K level, but a V-shaped recovery at the $90K support zone has seemingly ended this correction. As a result, the market is now climbing toward the $100K level again, and it could only be a matter of time before a 6-figure BTC price is witnessed. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Active Addresses (100-day Moving Average) Bitcoin’s network is built on the activity of peers, which is observable because the blockchain system is transparent. Higher network activity can lead to higher BTC prices, as it has before. This chart presents the Bitcoin active addresses metric, which counts the number of addresses sending and receiving BTC. The number of active addresses has been rising recently as the price is making new record highs. Yet, it is still much lower than what it was earlier in 2024, when BTC was trading around $40K. Therefore, even higher Bitcoin prices could be expected in the coming months if network activity continues to rise.

37088437,https://crypto.news/?p=14315207,1733051576,"How a TikTok meme turned $1,000 into $1M— DOGEN poised to follow suit","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DTX Exchange and Cardano show strong growth, while Solana gains momentum with predictions of a new all-time high. Table of Contents DOGEN: The next big meme coin opportunity What Makes DOGEN Different? DOGEN’s bold path forward: A visionary roadmap for the future Conclusion Success in crypto often takes an unpredictable path, arriving from the most unexpected corners of culture. This time, it came from TikTok’s viral meme – Just a Chill Guy. No drama, no hype, just a laid-back, relatable character created by artist Phillip Banks. This easygoing figure, who stays chill despite life’s challenges big or small, resonated deeply with a Gen Z audience on TikTok. As a result, the CHILLGUY meme coin has skyrocketed, surging from a modest $10 million market cap to nearly $500 million in just a few days after its launch, turning heads across the crypto world. The star of this story was a lucky trader who invested $1,000 in CHILLGUY during its token launchpad phase. Riding the coin’s meteoric rise, the trader made a savvy move by selling their holdings at the peak of the frenzy, resulting in a mind-blowing profit of $1 million in less than a week. This story underscores a golden rule in crypto trading: timing is everything. This trader’s ability to seize the moment turned a modest investment into life-changing wealth. You might also like: Top trader claims XRP will never drop below $1 again as Cardano and Dogen eye big gains DOGEN: The next big meme coin opportunity If stories like CHILLGUY inspire you, then it’s time to pay attention to the next potential breakout in the meme coin space: DOGEN . Currently in its presale stage, DOGEN is already generating buzz as the next big player in the meme coin ecosystem. While CHILLGUY captured attention with its chill, stress-free, and laid-back nature, DOGEN is all about boldness, ambition, and unapologetic success. Dogen’s origin merges the internet’s beloved Swole Doge with the daring crypto “Degen” culture, symbolizing strength, confidence, and a fearless approach to risks. As a bold figure in the crypto world, Dogen embodies the spirit of high-stakes investing, where courage and quick thinking reign supreme. Dogen is a representation of a new crypto era, where confidence and audacity drive the biggest wins. For those who dare to follow, Dogen offers the spirit of boldness and belief in a world where only the fearless rise to the top. At a low price of $0.0009 during presale Stage 7, DOGEN is projected to surge by 500% before the presale even ends. For investors who recognize potential early, this is the kind of opportunity that could turn small investments into life-changing gains. Here’s a glimpse of DOGEN’s potential: A $100 investment at the first presale stage price of $0.0003 would have yielded 333,333 tokens. By the final presale stage, when the price hits $0.0019, that investment would grow to $633.33, delivering a 533.33% return. The message is clear: early adoption pays off, and DOGEN offers a golden opportunity to get in before the rocket takes off. What Makes DOGEN Different? While many meme coins are fleeting, DOGEN is built for longevity. The backbone of DOGEN is its strong and engaged community—an energetic group of investors ready to seize the next big opportunity. With over $2,00,000 already raised, DOGEN has proven its appeal among crypto enthusiasts. Adding to its allure is DOGEN’s unique multi-level referral program, which rewards community participation: 7% in USDT from direct referrals 2% from second-tier referrals 1% from third-tier referrals In addition to the referral program, DOGEN’s Golden Points airdrop initiative adds another layer of rewards for active investors. The more DOGEN an investor buys, the more Golden Points they accumulate, directly increasing their share in future airdrops. For example, buying $10–$250 worth of DOGEN yields a 6% Golden Points boost, while purchases over $10,000 earn a 12% boost. This program extends to referral-based purchases as well, meaning investors can further amplify their rewards as their network grows. DOGEN’s bold path forward: A visionary roadmap for the future DOGEN doesn’t entirely rely on hype, it is building an ecosystem that is set to last. The journey starts with DogenTap v1, a Telegram app that connects the community like never before. Staking options will let holders grow their earnings, while a powerful marketing liftoff puts DOGEN in the spotlight. Next up? DEX and CEX launches will take DOGEN mainstream, making it more accessible than ever. Then comes DogenTap v2, introducing PvP battles and clans to amp up the excitement, while DogTournaments bring competitive action and rewards to the community. It’s not just a token; it’s an experience! Then comes the AIRDROP phase, where DOGEN levels up again with DogenTap v3—seasonal events, NFTs, and the game-changing DogenWallet Telegram App. Where other tokens fizzle out, DOGEN keeps delivering with utility, innovation, and a roadmap designed for explosive growth. Don’t just watch the change—be part of it! DOGEN is here to dominate, and this is the chance to get in early. Conclusion The incredible story of CHILLGUY shows what’s possible in the meme coin market with a small bet and the right timing. Now, DOGEN is offering its own chance at life-changing gains, with a roadmap and community that promise long-term success.

37094095,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103425,1733051055,Expert Says XRP Holders Likely to Sell at $10 Will Regret It,"Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, recently took to X to caution XRP holders against short-term thinking that could lead to missed gains. In his tweet , Farina expressed his belief that 95% of XRP holders will likely sell their holdings at the $10 psychological price level. In his view, this action could result in such investors missing out on the long-term value and growth that XRP may offer.Backing his view, he cited the case of many investors who had already liquidated their XRP holdings when the asset first pumped to $0.80 earlier this month. These were retail investors who believed the XRP uptrend would not last, as seen in several instances over the past 12 months.However, to many’s surprise, XRP’s bull run endured, and the asset climbed to $1. Now, XRP is confidently approaching the $2 mark. Essentially, those who had parted ways with the XRP market earlier have settled for far fewer gains than those who held on, as the asset is currently trading at $1.89.Remain Patient and Stay Locked in for the Long HaulAs a result, Farina urged crypto enthusiasts not to rush to take profits from XRP. He encouraged them to remain patient and lock into their investments for the ""perpetual run.""His tweet reminds XRP investors to take a more strategic approach and avoid the temptation of quick profits that can ultimately limit long-term gains. While XRP is worth around $1.89, market commentators like Farina have argued for a hypothetical future where the asset could be worth $10,000. He firmly believes that this dream will ultimately come true far in the future. His bold forecast suggests that selling XRP at $10 would miss the opportunity to sell at $10,000 or higher.Community Members DisagreeHowever, in the comments section of his post, some community members expressed disagreement with Farina’s view. They argued that strategically taking profits from one's portfolio is a more prudent approach to achieving financial success.Community member Dexter Douglas remarked that everyone has their own version of life-changing wealth. He pointed out that if an individual considers $5 to be a life-changing gain, they should sell and hold a ""moon bag"" (a portion of the asset for potential future growth).Douglas emphasized that selling at the time that best suits one's personal financial goals, family, and future is key. Moreover, he added that money left unrealized is not a loss.Similarly, Nunoarmada reminded market participants that not all crypto assets will continue to rise by the end of a cycle.

37088116,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620575,1733050833,South Korean opposition agrees to crypto tax postponement,"South Korea’s major opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (KDP), has agreed to the government’s proposal to delay implementing taxes on crypto assets for two years. Floor leader, Rep. Park Chan-dae, disclosed the postponement agreement in a press conference. The decision marks a turnaround, given that the party had earlier kicked against the moratorium, calling for the immediate implementation of the tax as planned. However, the KDP has now changed its tune, making it more likely that the moratorium will now be implemented. The tax regime that would have imposed a 20% tax on virtual assets’ capital gains was meant to become effective by January 2025. Park Chan-dae said : “We have decided to agree to a two-year moratorium on the implementation of cryptocurrency taxation proposed by the government and ruling party.” With this agreement, one of the key tax issues that has caused disagreements between the ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition KDP has now been resolved. The disagreements had earlier led to the failure to convene the plenary session for the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee. South Korean crypto tax regime delayed for the third time With the KDP now agreeing to the moratorium, the virtual asset tax regime will likely not go into effect until 2027. This aligns with the government’s desire, although it falls short of the ruling PPP’s request for a grace period of 3 years. This latest delay means that the tax has been postponed three times since 2021 and will not be implemented for at least six years since it was first considered. In 2021, the government attempted to implement crypto taxes, but disagreements with opposition parties pushed the discussion until 2023. The delays are a welcome development for crypto investors and highlight the South Korean government’s pro-crypto approach. The ruling party insisted on the delay because it believed that a quick implementation of crypto taxes could harm the country and force investors to flee. South Korea is the leading country in crypto adoption in East Asia, ranking 19th globally in grassroots adoption, according to Chainalysis . It is also the largest in cryptocurrency value received, with $130 billion, and its transaction share continues to rise. Other tax issues remain unresolved Meanwhile, there are still pending issues that might delay the implementation of the tax amendments. The KPD chair, Rep. Lee Jae-Myung, said his party will oppose the government’s proposal to reduce the inheritance and gift tax rate to 40% while increasing child deduction for inheritance tax from 50 million won to 500 million won. However, the KDP has agreed to several other amendments, including scrapping financial investment income tax. The government has sought to remove the tax on stock dividends for investors, but the KPD initially opposed the bill before eventually agreeing to it last month. At the time, the KDP chair said he could not continue to ignore the 15 million investors who were against the tax, given the difficult stock market. The South Korean stock market and its currency have been among the worst performers this year. Only the Japanese yen performed worse than the Korean won among the 40 major economies. Still, it remains to be seen whether the KDP’s proposal to increase the threshold for crypto capital gains tax from 2.5 million won ($1,800) to 50 million won ($36,000) will be retained. The KDP proposed a time when it was opposing the moratorium and argued that implementing that effectively abolishes crypto tax because it only means that only the major investors and not the small low-income investors will pay taxes on their crypto gains.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/mr-chill-doge-mrdoge-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Of course, there are some exceptions to this, including the new Hyperliquid token that is doing rounds, so let’s dive deeper. Bitcoin Price Flat Around $97K During the past day, Bitcoin failed to note any considerable movements and is trading at a slight increase of around 0.4%. For the most part, it traded below $97,000 and was even close to falling below $96,000 at one point, but the bulls were quick to stop the assault and prevented further declines, as seen in the chart below. Source: TradingView All eyes are still on Bitcoin, though, as the entire industry expects it to break above $100,000. However, at the same time, its dominance – the metric that tracks BTC’s share relative to that of the rest of the industry, has been dwindling lately. It declined by more than 3% during the past seven days, which is a clear sign that altcoins are popping and are gaining more ground. One clear example of that is the new token that was airdropped a couple of days ago – Hyperliquide (HYPE). HYPE Leads Altcoin Gains Hyperliquid (HYPE) is trading at above $9, achieving a total market capitalization of upwards of $3 billion in the first couple of days since it was airdropped to users. This is nothing short of impressive, and it’s the best-performing cryptocurrency from the top 100 following its airdrop. Another runner today is the meme coin Brett (BRETT) and Hedera’s HBAR, both of which have gained more than 20% in the past 24 hours.

However, the meme coin’s performance has somewhat slowed down in the past week, struggling to make a play for the psychological $0.45 level. However, a popular analyst on the X platform has said that the price of Dogecoin won’t be in consolidation, with a bullish breakout on the horizon. In fact, the meme token is being touted to outperform Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Here’s How Dogecoin Might Outperform Bitcoin In a recent post on the X platform, prominent analyst Ali Martinez put forward a bullish prognosis for the price of Dogecoin against the Bitcoin price over the coming months. According to the pundit, the meme coin is set to outperform the premier cryptocurrency by a whopping 2,400%. The rationale behind this projection is the formation of a bull flag pattern on the Dogecoin price chart on the monthly timeframe. A bull flag pattern is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a period of steep upward price movement (the flagpole) and a short period of consolidation or slight downward trend (the flag). Typically, the bull flag formation serves as a strong continuation signal for an upward price trend. Nonetheless, a price breakout from the flag (or the consolidation range) is a prerequisite to confirming the continuation of the uptrend. As observed in the chart above, the price of Dogecoin against Bitcoin has been moving mostly sideways since 2021. However, DOGE/BTC appears to be breaking out of the consolidation range at the moment, suggesting the continuation of the current market trend. According to Martinez, if the price of Dogecoin against BTC successfully breaks the upper boundary of the flag, it might be ready to soar by more than 2,400%. The target of this projection was calculated using the initial flagpole as a template, as the breakout usually replicates its length. Ultimately, this would push the value of DOGE against BTC from the current level of 0.0000043 to an unprecedented 0.00009375. A Dogecoin rally this huge would also support the numerous predictions of an altcoin season before the end of the current cycle. DOGE Price At A Glance As of this writing, Dogecoin is valued at $0.4246, reflecting a mere 1.2% increase in the past 24 hours. The price performance of the meme coin is not any less insignificant on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of DOGE is down by 1.7% in the last seven days. The meme token ranks as the seventh-largest asset in the sector, with a market capitalization of $62 billion.

Just like in 2017 and 2020, we got a sell signal from TD, anticipating a brief correction before the bull rally continued.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez’s chart suggests that DOGE is in a large ascending channel that could push the memecoin to $14 if it reaches the upper bound of the pattern once again. At time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.42. Turning to Bitcoin, Martinez remains bullish on BTC despite many market participants calling for a correction after its sizeable multi-week rally near $100,000. Looking at social media metrics that track mentions of “pullback” and “100K,” Martinez says that the price may move in the opposite direction of the predominant market sentiment. “Everyone’s anticipating a pullback after Bitcoin reclaimed $95,000 – just look at how often it’s mentioned. But markets often move against the crowd’s expectations. Don’t be surprised if BTC pushes even higher!” Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also backs up his bullish stance by noting the average mining cost of Bitcoin, which refers to how much it costs miners to earn one BTC. “Seeing lots of chatter about Bitcoin BTC dipping below $90,000. Keep in mind that the average mining cost is $90,524. Historically, during a bull run, BTC has never fallen below its mining cost.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,523.

Chainlink is gaining momentum with a potential price breakout toward $50, while AAVE remains a solid pick for decentralised finance enthusiasts. Meanwhile, Qubetics , a rising star in the Web3 ecosystem, has raised over $3.8 million in its presale and is poised to disrupt the blockchain landscape with its revolutionary QubeQode IDE. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to buy today, these three are worth your attention. But what makes these projects so compelling? Let’s dive into their unique offerings and explore why they’re capturing the interest of investors and analysts alike. Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Blockchain Usability and Scalability Blockchain technology has been around for over a decade, yet its complexity remains a barrier for many. Enter Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, which aims to simplify blockchain development and adoption. At the heart of Qubetics is the QubeQode IDE, an innovative tool designed to make blockchain programming accessible to businesses, developers, and everyday users. One of the biggest hurdles in blockchain adoption is its lack of user-friendly tools. Developers often grapple with unintuitive interfaces and the steep learning curve of programming for decentralised systems. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE solves this problem by providing a seamless, easy-to-use platform for creating and deploying smart contracts. Imagine a small business owner who wants to implement blockchain for supply chain tracking. Instead of hiring expensive developers or navigating complex coding, they can use QubeQode IDE to set up a secure and efficient system in hours, not weeks. Scalability is another major issue in blockchain. Many platforms struggle with limited transaction processing capacity, leading to congestion and high fees. Qubetics addresses this by enabling seamless integration with existing blockchain networks, allowing businesses to scale operations without sacrificing performance. For instance, think about an NFT marketplace experiencing rapid growth. Qubetics’ tools ensure that such platforms can handle increased traffic without crashing or slowing down. Impressive Presale Numbers and Predictions Qubetics is currently in the 10th phase of its presale, having already sold over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders, raising a staggering $3.8 million. With tokens priced at just $0.025, early investors are eyeing significant returns. Analysts predict that Qubetics’ token price could climb to $0.10 within months of its mainnet launch, offering an impressive 4x return for presale participants. Consider this: if you invest $10,000 now, you could own 400,000 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.10, your investment could grow to $40,000. With the presale ending soon and prices set to increase by 10% in the next phase, now is the time to act. Chainlink: The Backbone of Smart Contracts As blockchain technology evolves, the need for reliable and secure data feeds has never been greater. This is where Chainlink shines. Known as the go-to oracle network, Chainlink bridges the gap between blockchain and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to function seamlessly. Chainlink’s recent performance has been nothing short of stellar. The token’s price has been steadily climbing, with analysts projecting a breakout toward $50 in the near term. According to a recent analysis on Coinpedia, the growing adoption of decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi platforms has driven demand for Chainlink’s services. This surge in utility is expected to propel its price to new heights. AAVE: A DeFi Pioneer with a Bright Future In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), few names carry as much weight as AAVE. This platform revolutionised the lending and borrowing sector by allowing users to earn interest on their crypto assets or take out loans without traditional intermediaries. AAVE’s unique selling point lies in its versatility. Unlike traditional financial systems, AAVE enables users to deposit various cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools and earn interest in return. Borrowers can use these pools to secure loans, all while maintaining complete control over their assets. This peer-to-peer model eliminates the need for banks, offering a decentralised alternative that’s both efficient and secure. Imagine a freelance graphic designer looking to fund a new project. Instead of going through the hassle of securing a bank loan, they can use AAVE to borrow funds against their crypto holdings. This flexibility makes AAVE an attractive option for both individuals and businesses. Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Buy Today? Choosing the best cryptos to buy today ultimately depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. If you’re looking for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Qubetics offers unparalleled potential with its groundbreaking QubeQode IDE and impressive presale performance. Chainlink, on the other hand, is a safer bet for those seeking long-term stability and utility, thanks to its critical role in powering smart contracts. Finally, AAVE remains a top pick for DeFi enthusiasts, offering a decentralised alternative to traditional financial systems. All three projects have unique strengths and are poised for significant growth. But if you want to capitalise on early-stage innovation and maximise your returns, Qubetics stands out as the clear winner. Don’t miss the chance to join over 4,600 investors who have already recognised its potential. Head over to Qubetics’ presale page today and secure your $TICS tokens before prices increase this weekend. The future of blockchain is here—and you don’t want to be left behind.

Originally slated for January 2025, the controversial tax will now take effect in 2027, following a compromise with the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP). Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the KDP, confirmed the decision during a press conference on December 1. This delay marks the third time South Korea has pushed back the implementation of its digital asset capital gains tax, reflecting ongoing debates over its timing and impact. Heated Debate Over Timing and Impact The crypto gains tax, first proposed in 2021, has faced multiple delays due to mounting concerns from investors and industry stakeholders. Initially scheduled for 2023, the tax was postponed to 2025 , and now 2027. The PPP, South Korea’s ruling party, had even suggested extending the grace period to 2028, arguing that premature taxation could drive investors out of the market. In the lead-up to this decision, the KDP strongly opposed any further delays. As recently as November 20, the party criticized the PPP’s proposal as a political maneuver, accusing them of pandering to voters ahead of future elections. Instead of deferring the tax, the KDP suggested raising the taxable gains threshold from $1,800 to $36,000, aiming to shield smaller investors while targeting larger players. However, under mounting political pressure and in the spirit of compromise, the KDP has now aligned with the government’s recommendation for a two-year delay. What This Means for Investors Once implemented, South Korea’s crypto gains tax will impose a 20% levy on digital asset profits exceeding the taxable threshold. The tax’s initial intent was to create a fairer financial ecosystem while generating revenue from a rapidly growing industry. However, its repeated postponements highlight the challenges governments face in regulating emerging markets. The decision to delay the taxation has been welcomed by many in the crypto community, as it allows more time for the industry to mature. Yet, critics warn that such deferrals could create uncertainty and hinder long-term policy planning. As South Korea grapples with balancing investor protection and market growth, the extended timeline may provide an opportunity for clearer regulations. For now, crypto investors in the country can breathe a sigh of relief—at least until 2027.

Powell's speech will take place at 21:45 Turkish time (UTC+3). The speech comes amid rising expectations following the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's November monetary policy meeting, which revealed policymakers are taking a cautious stance on future rate cuts. Federal funds futures suggest markets are pricing in interest rates to fall from the current 4.5%-4.75% range to around 3.8% by the end of 2024. That’s a significant shift from September’s forecast, with expectations now pointing to cuts of more than 100 basis points next year. Powell’s speech was set against the backdrop of a strong performance in U.S. stock markets, with the S&P 500 Index posting its biggest monthly gain since November 2023, supported by steady inflows into global equity funds. These funds attracted $12.19 billion this week, a 32% increase from last month and extending a streak of nine consecutive weeks of inflows, according to LSEG Lipper data. Related News: Founder of Facebook's Former Cryptocurrency Project Diem Reveals Why the Project Was Actually Shut Down - Serious Allegations Ahead of Powell’s speech, the market’s attention is focused on upcoming U.S. labor market data. Strong nonfarm payrolls could signal continued resilience in the labor market, dampening expectations for aggressive rate cuts. Additional data points, such as the October job openings report and the November ADP employment report, are expected to provide more insight into employment trends. Analysts are weighing the Fed’s next moves in light of improving economic conditions. The Fed is increasingly assessing how much easing is necessary for the economy and the labor market, said Sameer Samana, senior strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. *This is not investment advice.

Speculation, Rumors, and Predictions","CryptoAutos: A Powerhouse of Real-World Crypto Utility CryptoAutos, the platform behind $AUTOS, is redefining cryptocurrency utility by merging the physical and digital worlds. As a global car marketplace and real-world asset (RWA) platform , CryptoAutos allows users to buy vehicles or participate in fractional ownership of high-value automobiles using 1,000+ cryptocurrencies . With over $58 million in sales , 180,000 monthly visitors , and a network of 1,100+ dealers , CryptoAutos is delivering real-world use cases for digital assets, aligning seamlessly with Binance’s mission to drive crypto adoption. Its innovative approach and growing ecosystem have sparked rumors of a potential Binance listing. Speculation: Is a Binance Listing Imminent? The crypto community is buzzing with speculation that $AUTOS might be the next project to debut on Binance. Here’s why the rumors are heating up: Influential KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) are increasingly mentioning CryptoAutos in connection with Binance, signaling strong industry anticipation. People close to the project hint that CryptoAutos has completed its Binance application and that the process is moving forward. Partnership potential with Binance’s ecosystem suggests deeper integrations may soon be revealed. These whispers from the industry, coupled with CryptoAutos’ achievements and strategic moves, lend credibility to the possibility of a Binance listing. $BNB Integration: A Game-Changer The recent integration of $BNB on the CryptoAutos platform has fueled speculation further. By allowing users to pay with $BNB, CryptoAutos has effectively deepened its relationship with Binance’s ecosystem. Key impacts of this partnership include: Unlocking access for millions of $BNB holders to purchase vehicles and rentals via CryptoAutos. Projecting a $5M+ monthly transaction volume , demonstrating the growing adoption of $BNB as a real-world payment solution. Strengthening the case for $AUTOS as a viable Binance listing candidate by showcasing its alignment with Binance’s push for real-world crypto utility. This integration suggests a growing partnership between CryptoAutos and Binance, with $BNB playing a pivotal role in the ecosystem’s expansion. Experienced Leadership & Visionary Tokenomics At the helm of CryptoAutos is a seasoned market maker with a proven track record on Binance-listed projects. Harley’s deep industry connections and expertise in centralized exchange operations inspire trust and confidence in the project. His publicly stated belief in tokenomic structures that balance meme tokenomics with traditional economics resonates with Binance’s recent emphasis on fair and sustainable models . Harley’s insights and leadership have enabled CryptoAutos to adopt tokenomics that appeal to retail and institutional investors alike, addressing challenges of the low float, high FDV model while ensuring long-term sustainability. Tokenomics and the Low Float, High FDV Debate One of the standout aspects of $AUTOS is its tokenomics, which reflect a strategic response to the challenges posed by the low float, high FDV model. This structure, characterized by a small circulating supply and a high fully diluted valuation, has faced criticism for benefiting early investors at the expense of retail participants. CryptoAutos acknowledges these concerns and adopts a balanced approach to tokenomics that: Incorporates fairness for retail investors by ensuring a gradual release of tokens to minimize selling pressure. Balances value appreciation with long-term sustainability. Aligns with Binance’s strategy of supporting projects that move away from traditional low float, high FDV models. By addressing these issues, $AUTOS positions itself as a token that appeals to Binance’s vision of fair and robust crypto markets. Predictions: What’s Next for CryptoAutos? If the rumors are true, a Binance listing could be a game-changer for CryptoAutos . Here’s what we might expect: Expansion of Binance Ecosystem Partnerships : Beyond $BNB integration, we could see deeper collaborations, such as the use of Binance Pay for seamless transactions on the platform. Accelerated Growth for $AUTOS : A Binance listing would amplify $AUTOS’s visibility, driving demand and attracting more users to the CryptoAutos platform. Strengthened Market Position : Listing on Binance would solidify CryptoAutos as a leader in crypto utility, further bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. With CryptoAutos already demonstrating significant achievements—such as facilitating high-value sales like a $4.4M LaFerrari purchase and collaborating with notable partners like TON Blockchain —the foundation for a Binance listing appears robust. Conclusion: Could the Rumors Be True? While no official confirmation exists, the signs are promising. From its $BNB integration to its industry-leading leadership and real-world utility , CryptoAutos embodies the qualities Binance looks for in potential listings. Whether the rumors prove accurate or not, one thing is clear: CryptoAutos is well-positioned to make waves in the crypto space. As the crypto community eagerly awaits more news, the growing partnership between CryptoAutos and Binance only strengthens the speculation that $AUTOS could soon debut on Binance .

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-loves-russia-trumprus-will-explode-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37085454,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620572,1733045113,AI tool promises precise prediction of the day you’ll die,"An app promises to do what humans have wondered about forever: tell you the exact day you’ll die. The Death Clock, launched in July, claims to predict your death date using artificial intelligence. It has already pulled in over 125,000 downloads, according to Sensor Tower, and it’s backed by data from over 1,200 life expectancy studies covering 53 million participants. You plug in details like your diet, exercise habits, sleep schedule, and stress levels. The result? A personalized death date—morbid, maybe, but apparently accurate. The app charges $40 a year and isn’t shy about its theme. Users get a “fond farewell” death card complete with the Grim Reaper, and a countdown timer that ticks off your remaining life by the second. Brent Franson, the app’s creator, says this is no gimmick. It’s a serious upgrade from the actuarial tables insurance companies and governments have used for centuries. Life expectancy isn’t just a personal concern. It’s the backbone of critical financial systems. Insurance companies, pension funds, and governments use it to decide everything from policy premiums to Social Security payouts. The United States, already lagging behind other developed countries in life expectancy, could see its outdated mortality models upended by AI. Is there actually a need for Death Clock? For years, mortality data has been frustratingly broad. The Social Security Administration, for example, predicts that an 85-year-old man in the U.S. has a 10% chance of dying within a year, with an average 5.6 years left to live. That might work for general estimates, but Franson says it’s useless for individuals. Death Clock’s AI skips the averages and tailors predictions based on your unique inputs. It claims to be a “significant” improvement over traditional methods. The app’s approach has already sparked interest in academic and economic circles. In recent months, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) published two papers exploring mortality and its economic impact. One, titled On the Limits of Chronological Age, argues that age-based policies, like mandatory retirement, are outdated. People age differently, and their capabilities don’t always align with their calendar years. Death Clock’s personalized predictions could help shift the focus from age to actual functionality. Another NBER study looked at the “value per statistical life” (VSL), a calculation used in cost-benefit analysis for things like environmental regulations and workplace safety. Typically, VSL is estimated based on compensation for dangerous jobs. The researchers behind The Value of Statistical Life for Seniors used a different approach: how much older Americans spend on healthcare to lower their risk of dying. They found that a healthy 67-year-old values their life at $2 million, compared to $600,000 for someone in poorer health. How AI predictions could reshape economics The implications of accurate mortality predictions are massive. For regular folks, it could mean smarter financial planning. Decisions about saving, investing, and withdrawing retirement funds often rely on rough estimates. Death Clock’s precision could make those plans less of a guessing game. For governments and corporations, the stakes are even higher. Pension funds, life insurance, and Social Security programs all depend on life expectancy estimates. If people live longer than expected, funds run dry. If they die earlier, resources are wasted. But there’s a catch. Extended life expectancies bring their own problems. Longer lives mean longer retirements, which require more savings. Investment strategies may need to move toward higher-risk, higher-return assets like stocks. Traditional fixed-income approaches may not cut it for people planning to live well into their 90s. It’s not just about investments though. AI-powered mortality predictions could influence public policies, from healthcare to labor laws. Age-based benchmarks like statutory retirement might become irrelevant if personalized data becomes the norm. Governments might need to rethink how they structure everything from taxes to pensions. Longevity gaps and the role of money Not everyone will benefit equally from these advances. Longevity isn’t just about health, it’s about wealth. Rich Americans live significantly longer than poor ones. Research by the American Medical Association found that at age 40, the richest 1% of men live 15 years longer than the poorest 1%. For women, the gap is 10 years. Angus Deaton, a Nobel-winning economist, linked this disparity to “deaths of despair” caused by economic inequality. AI tools like Death Clock could expose these gaps even further. A person’s ability to change their predicted death date depends largely on their resources. The app suggests lifestyle changes to extend your life, but not everyone can afford healthier food, gym memberships, or stress-reducing vacations. Without addressing these inequalities, AI predictions might widen the gap instead of closing it. There are also intangibles that AI can’t account for. Loneliness, for example, is known to shorten life expectancy. Gratitude, on the other hand, may extend it. A Harvard study found that women who reported feeling the most grateful had a 9% lower risk of dying within three years. These factors aren’t easily quantifiable, but they matter.

37085327,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=372780,1733045109,This Meme Coin Trader Made a Profit of Over $1.5 Million: Here’s How,"TL;DR A whale turned $2.42M into $3.94M by trading Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), while another turned $158 into $5.6M with CHILLGUY, showcasing the high profit potential of early investments. However, meme coins are highly volatile and many lack intrinsic value, making thorough research and cautious investment crucial to avoid significant losses. The Multi-Million Trade Meme coins are extremely volatile and allow people to make substantial profits, assuming they enter in the early days and cash out at the right time. One savvy trader followed that strategy, purchasing 416.8 million Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) tokens in July this year. The transaction was worth around $2.42 million at the time. Lookonchain recently revealed that the whale sold the stash for 16,270 SOL ($3.94 million), making a profit of 6,270 SOL ($1.52 million). The cat-themed meme coin saw the light of day in March this year and it s price was hovering at approximately $0.003 when the trader jumped on the bandwagon . Currently, MEW is worth $0.009, representing a 200% increase since the July levels. The trader’s actions caused mixed reactions among X users. Some highlighted the multi-million trade, while others suggested that the whale could have waited a bit longer before cashing out since the market is in a bull mode. Not long ago, another trader spent just $158 worth of SOL to purchase 12.4 million CHILLGUY tokens. As of this writing, the stash equals nearly $5.6 million. Recall that CHILLGUY began trading in mid-November and was worth around $0.007. It experienced an impressive rally in the following days and is currently standing at approximately $0.45. Beware the Risks While dealing with meme coins can indeed lead to substantial profits, it may also result in crucial losses. After all, many of these assets are based on temporary trends and lack fundamental value in terms of utility or intrinsic worth. This means their prices might head south in a very short period of time . Those about to enter the ecosystem should follow some key rules to avoid a devastating outcome, such as investing only as much as they are ready to lose and conducting proper research beforehand.

37084804,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620566,1733043917,Trump’s economic plans will overheat the US stock market. But investors don’t care,"Trump’s economic agenda has Wall Street on a sugar high, pushing the stock market into dangerous territory. The S&P 500 is smashing records, clocking 53 highs this year alone. Retail investors are going all in, throwing caution and cash into the market’s riskiest corners. But Trump’s policies could light the match that sets this overhyped market on fire. Think protectionist trade wars, skyrocketing inflation, and corporate tax cuts — all against the backdrop of geopolitical chaos and rising interest rates. And while the market seems to be loving the chaos, not everyone is. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index, long a laggard, is suddenly the darling of Wall Street. It’s up 20% this year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 26% gain. Traders are betting big on Trump’s “America First” doctrine, which favors domestic-focused companies. Small caps and tech: A bubble brewing? Small-cap stocks have latched onto Trump’s trade war rhetoric like it’s a lifeline. The logic is simple: less exposure to international markets equals less risk in a protectionist world. But here’s the problem. Small-cap earnings are weak, and rising borrowing costs could cripple these debt-dependent companies. And then there’s tech — semiconductors, to be exact. AI hysteria sent chip stocks soaring, but the party might be over. Trade wars are looming, and chipmakers, with their global supply chains, are sitting ducks. The tech sector, which led the market for years, is now underperforming. Jonathan Krinsky from BTIG warned , “Bulls really need to see semis stabilize here to prevent a bigger breakdown into 2025.” In other words, tech could be the domino that starts the chain reaction. Trump’s economic fireworks aren’t just a U.S. problem. Emerging markets are bracing for impact too. South Africa is a standout though, having managed to slash inflation to 2.8% — which is a far cry from its post-Covid peak of 7.8%. Its bonds offer juicy returns, and its stock market is outpacing peers. Investors are all in Retail investors are acting like it’s 1999, dumping cash into stocks at record levels. Data from Bank of America shows households’ equity holdings are at an all-time high. Risk? What risk? Everyone’s betting the market will keep climbing, but history says otherwise. Eric Diton of the Wealth Alliance said, “We know from history that when investors are too bullish, the question is who’s left to drive the market higher?” Institutional investors are also piling on, driving the S&P 500 to back-to-back annual gains of over 20% in 2023 and 2024. That kind of streak hasn’t happened since the dot-com bubble. Yet, valuations are climbing into nosebleed territory, and bullish sentiment is off the charts. The broader market feels unstoppable, doesn’t it? Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent , has even reassured some traders with his moderate stance on economic proposals. But let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: Trump’s dream of taking over the Federal Reserve . That risks destabilizing the U.S. economy, and our markets right along with it.

37084558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656164,1733043608,Key Bitcoin Levels Under The Spotlight This Weekend: Insights From Glassnode,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a remarkable uptrend over the past three weeks, inching close to the elusive $100,000 mark. This follows Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election over Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris, which boosted investor confidence in a new era for the broader industry. This has led to increased adoption of the leading crypto, with major corporations worldwide adopting it as a strategic reserve asset . In addition, inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have increased, further contributing to the bull run. However, after its recent 7% correction, the Bitcoin price fell to around $91,000. Then it regained the $96,000 mark, raising questions about its ability to break through the psychological $100,000 barrier before the end of the year. Critical Support At $92,700 The peak price of $99,540 achieved last week has left investors wondering whether Bitcoin can sustain its momentum or if selling pressure will lead to further consolidation. Despite the uncertainty, Glassnode founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel have provided insights into Bitcoin’s potential trajectory as December approaches. They acknowledge the challenges ahead but maintain that the $100,000 target remains feasible. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Allemann and Happel outlined critical levels to watch in Bitcoin’s price action. They noted that while Bitcoin is currently in a bullish channel, resistance at $97,200 has yet to be overcome. Should this resistance hold firm, a retest of the $92,700 support level—aligned with the Daily 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA)—is likely. This support zone is deemed crucial by the two founders for maintaining the bullish channel and keeping the $100,000 target within reach. Bitcoin Could Surge To $125,000–$140,000 By Year-End Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted historical trends indicating that Bitcoin has typically surged in December following US presidential elections. In the last two cycles, Bitcoin recorded gains of 30% and 46%, leading Martinez to speculate that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could close out the year in the range of $125,000 to $140,000. Martinez further pointed out that long-term Bitcoin holders have been taking profits as the price climbed from $62,000 to $99,000. However, he emphasized that this profit-taking behavior is typical during bull markets and should not be interpreted as a signal to short the asset. The analyst asserts that according to historical patterns, long-term holders often realize gains as prices rise, which can create short-term volatility but does not necessarily indicate a shift in the overall market trend. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $96,500, down a slight 0.3% in the 24-hour time frame and down nearly 2% in the past week.

37084695,https://cryptonews.com/?p=314817,1733043220,SEC Sues Touzi Capital Over Misleading Crypto Mining Fund Claims,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against investment firm Touzi Capital, accusing it of defrauding investors and misrepresenting the liquidity and profitability of its crypto asset mining fund. According to the SEC’s statement released on November 29 , Touzi Capital allegedly raised nearly $95 million from more than 1,200 investors through its crypto mining fund. The firm reportedly claimed that the funds would be used exclusively for cryptocurrency mining operations. SEC Claims Touzi Capital Diverted Funds to Unrelated Ventures However, the SEC contends that Touzi Capital diverted investor funds to unrelated ventures through its subsidiaries. The complaint also alleges that Touzi Capital misled investors about the risks and potential returns of the investment. The firm purportedly likened its offerings to stable, high-yield money market accounts, despite the SEC’s assertion that the fund was “risky and illiquid.” Additionally, the SEC claims that Touzi Capital continued soliciting new investments even after its ventures began failing. This case is the latest in a series of legal actions targeting fraudulent practices within the crypto industry. Recently, a U.S. federal judge rejected an appeal by Kristoffer Krohn, accused of promoting an $18 million fraudulent crypto mining scheme. Krohn’s argument that the SEC had not adequately demonstrated the Green Boxes were securities was dismissed. As legal battles between crypto firms and the SEC persist, some industry leaders suggest a potential shift in regulatory attitudes with political changes. Speaking at DevCon 2024, Consensys CEO Joe Lubin speculated that Donald Trump’s potential return to the presidency could alleviate the financial strain on the crypto sector, potentially reducing ongoing litigation costs. SEC Is Under Scrutiny As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, a coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency. Led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, the states have filed an amicus brief arguing that the SEC’s attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies constitutes a “power grab” that would stifle innovation, harm the crypto industry, and exceed the agency’s authority. The coalition includes Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, with Oklahoma becoming the latest state to join. Earlier this year, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that the regulatory agency is currently operating in an “enforcement-only mode” when it comes to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. As reported, President-elect Donald Trump is considering selecting Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins – who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt – is both “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the best performers of the ongoing bull market, currently trading at a high last seen in June 2021. Despite the market-wide correction, which triggered a 2.8% drop in the Dogecoin price in 24 hours, the meme coin boasts a 159% increase in November.DOGE has achieved this immense growth rate on the back of mere market speculation and discussions around the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) spearheaded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the incoming Donald Trump administration.DOGE Rallies on Market SpeculationInterestingly, the impact from external fundamental market catalysts such as ETFs has not materialized yet, with these factors capable of triggering a more substantial price gain. Notably, Bitcoin’s Q1 price upsurge was partly fueled by inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January.In addition, the ongoing uptrend, which saw BTC cross $99,000, has also come on the back of capital flows into the ETF products. With Bitcoin ETFs currently boasting inflows worth $30.8 billion since January, discussions around ETFs for other crypto assets have emerged.Ethereum (ETH) was the next to attract ETF products , which launched in July. Moreover, some asset managers have filed for XRP ETFs and Solana ETFs. However, the SEC has not yet approved these filings.Dogecoin has been in the background, but the possibility of an ETF for the meme coin is not out of the question. Notably, Nate Geraci, CEO of the ETF Store, recently argued that some asset managers could file Dogecoin ETFs as a marketing strategy. Dogecoin Price if Its ETFs Capture 30% of Bitcoin ETF InflowsMeanwhile, Bloomberg’s ETF expert Eric Balchunas, noted that Dec. 31 could be the perfect time to file for a Dogecoin ETF. Should asset managers show interest in Dogecoin for an ETF product, the market could witness an influx of capital.Such an influx is capable of triggering an impressive increase in the Dogecoin price. Notably, with Bitcoin ETF products currently witnessing $30.8 billion in cumulative net inflows, if a Dogecoin ETF market captures only 30% of this figure, DOGE’s market value could skyrocket.For context, 30% of the Bitcoin ETF inflows amount to $9.24 billion in capital injection. If one leveraged a quarter of the Bank of America (BoA) multiplier of 118x, this would lead to a market cap multiplier of 29.5x for every dollar that flows into the Dogecoin ETF.At this 29.5x rate, the $9.24 billion would translate to $272.58 billion in additional market cap for Dogecoin. This would bring DOGE’s market valuation to $334.68 billion, slightly lower than Ethereum’s current market cap of $406.58 billion. With the $334.68 billion market cap, the Dogecoin price could breach the $1 mark, essentially skyrocketing to $2.2 per token. Analysts such as Ali Martinez believe this target is feasible for Dogecoin price, with Martinez recently predicting a possible rally to $2.4.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/01/here-is-how-high-dogecoin-can-rise-after-etf-approval-if-doge-gets-30-of-btc-etf-inflows/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-how-high-dogecoin-can-rise-after-etf-approval-if-doge-gets-30-of-btc-etf-inflows,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Marcus claimed that Diem, which initially launched as Libra, was on track for a limited launch in 2021 after clearing all regulatory concerns. However, he accused key figures in the US government of orchestrating the organization’s collapse. Marcus specifically claimed that then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen privately warned Fed Chair Jay Powell that approving the Diem project would amount to “political suicide.” The Fed then reportedly pressured banks to sever ties with the project, effectively leaving the payments system to die. This points to one of the most direct accusations, which links the government’s influence to the broader difficulty of using crypto in traditional financial systems. Related News: Legendary Bullish Forecaster Tom Lee Assesses Bitcoin's $250,000 Target Next Year, Answers the Question of Whether Altcoin Season Will Come Marcus’ comments reignited discussions about “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used by crypto advocates to describe allegations that the government is pressuring banks to sever ties with crypto firms. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long responded to Marcus’s comments by saying that her bank had faced similar targeting. “One day… I will be able to tell the real story of what the Fed did to Custodia Bank,” she wrote, accusing the Fed of corruption. Prominent investor Marc Andreessen echoed similar sentiments in a recent interview, claiming that over 30 tech founders have been “debanked” over the past four years. Other crypto leaders, including Sam Kazemian, have accused major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase of shutting down accounts linked to government-sponsored crypto assets. Allegations against U.S. regulators and financial institutions are not new. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges, previously accused the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of discouraging banks from partnering with crypto firms through vague “safety and soundness” reviews. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A top analyst sees parallels between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin’s price breakout, with WallitIQ AI token also set for growth. Table of Contents Shiba Inu price set to replicate the Dogecoin price breakout WallitIQ’s crypto wallet: The driving force behind its rise as a top investment pick Conclusion A leading analyst noticed similarities between the Shiba Inu price chart and the Dogecoin price breakout, stating that history may repeat itself. While the possibility of the Shiba Inu price mirroring the Dogecoin price performance is probable, the emerging WallitIQ AI token could also see fast growth due to its innovative wallet functionalities. Shiba Inu price set to replicate the Dogecoin price breakout In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), a leading analyst, Ali Martinez, observed that the Shiba Inu price behavior closely resembled the Dogecoin price historical trajectory. The Dogecoin price, which surged from $0.1 to $0.4 earlier this month, experienced double-digit gains driven by bullish catalysts such as the US presidential elections and Elon Musk’s influence. Similarly, the Shiba Inu price appears to be tracing a comparable pattern in its price chart. Martinez noted that between 2021 and 2024, both the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu price showcased parallel actions, including major rallies, sharp declines, and periods of consolidation. For instance, the Dogecoin price historic 2021 surge to its all-time high of $0.73 was followed by a drop to $0.05 in 2022. After a recovery above $0.1 in 2023, the Dogecoin price saw steady consolidation and eventually rallied back to $0.4 in 2024. The Shiba Inu price trajectory aligns closely with this. After reaching an ATH of $0.000083 in 2021, the Shiba Inu price plummeted to $0.000007 in 2022, entered a prolonged consolidation phase, and started recovering in 2024. The Shiba Inu price recently climbed above $0.000044 before retracing to $0.00001.

With its unique AI-driven technology, WallitIQ is changing this crypto market and meeting the changing demands of crypto owners. WallitIQ’s appeal is derived from its wallet, which is powered by AI and machine learning (ML). This wallet combines advanced security with an intuitive, customizable interface designed to improve user experience and address any issues investors may have with current wallets. Security-wise, WallitIQ monitors account activity in real-time to spot unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity. With features like fraud detection, biometric authentication, and robust malware protection, WallitIQ offers more than basic security. SolidProof, a leading security and auditing firm, has audited the crypto wallet, boosting investor confidence and guaranteeing the safety of its crypto holdings. WallitIQ further improves the experience by eliminating the lag of traditional wallets. Its “Scan and Pay QR” feature simplifies transactions. Consequently, transaction fees are paid with its native token, WLTQ, eliminating the stress of converting other assets to offset gas fees. Thanks to WallitIQ’s special Physical 2 Digital (P2D) wallet feature, crypto wallet users can also effortlessly switch between digital and physical assets while trading. With P2D, users can store their IDs, licenses, documents, and so on. WallitIQ uses traders’ data and provides behavioral and predictive analysis in real-time, enabling them to trade crypto and DeFi assets profitably. When users are absent, the wallet can also function as a trading robot, allowing them to issue commands and place trades. Based on in-depth data analysis, the AI wallet also provides smart transactions and sophisticated portfolio management. These AI features improve the wallet experience and help users make better trading decisions. Still in the first stage of the WLTQ presale, the platform has raised over a million dollars, signaling high investor interest. As a result, investors who have yet to secure their WLTQ tokens are advised to start purchasing them now, as they are still valued at $0.0171 during the current presale. Conclusion WallitIQ’s unique wallet features could be a major catalyst in its growth in the DeFi space. Investors can join the WLTQ train now before it leaves the station. The WLTQ token has also been listed on CoinMarketCap.

The President-elect has asked these countries to promise not to create a new BRICS currency or support any other currency that might replace the dollar, otherwise, they will face 100% tariffs and lose access to the US Market. The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2024 Formed in 2009, BRICS is the only major international group of which the United States is not a part. Its other members are South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. Notably, over the past few years, a few of its member countries, particularly Russia and China, are seeking an alternative to the US Dollar to create their own BRICS currency. However, India has so far not been a part of the move. In an X post on Saturday, November 30, Trump warned these countries of such a move. “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,” the President elect underscored. ‘No Chance BRICS Will Replace USD’ He firmly made known that there is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in international Trade, and further noted that any country that tries, should wave goodbye to America. At a recent summit, Russian Vladimir Putin blamed the United States of America for ‘weaponizing’’ the dollar, terming it as a big mistake. Putin highlighted that Russia is not choosing to abandon the dollar but is forced to look for other options because of US restrictions. Notably, Trump on his campaign trail pledged that he would make it costly for countries to move away from the US dollar. And threatened to use tariffs to ensure they complied. Efforts To Keep USD Dominance Intact Trump and his economic advisers have been discussing ways to punish allies and adversaries alike who seek to engage in bilateral trade in currencies other than the dollar. Those measures include considering options such as export controls, currency manipulation charges, and levies on trade. Trump has long stressed that he wants the US dollar to remain the world’s reserve currency, saying in a March interview with CNBC that he “would not allow countries to go off the dollar” because it would be “a hit to our country.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : South Korea Delays Crypto Tax Again: What It Means for Investors in 2024 , BRICS Members Express Frustration The US dollar has been the bedrock of global commerce for a long time and continues to dominate as the world’s most widely used currency.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK.

Cosmos is celebrated for its interchain connectivity, EOS is advancing blockchain scalability, and Qubetics stands apart with its groundbreaking multi-chain wallet designed to make blockchain management seamless. While Cosmos and EOS excel in their respective niches, Qubetics leads the charge with its forward-thinking solutions, revolutionising how users and businesses interact with blockchain ecosystems. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Blockchain with Its Multi-Chain Wallet Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s an ecosystem poised to redefine blockchain utility. At the centre of this revolution is its multi-chain wallet , which eliminates the need for juggling multiple wallets across different blockchains. This innovation allows users to store, manage, and transact across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more—all from one secure interface. Imagine a small business owner who deals with payments in various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Instead of navigating multiple wallets and platforms, Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet simplifies the entire process. Professionals and investors can monitor assets across several blockchains, reducing time and complexity. The wallet isn’t just convenient—it’s robust. With quantum-resistant cryptography, Qubetics ensures top-notch security while delivering a user-friendly experience. Even a casual crypto enthusiast can transfer tokens, stake assets, and interact with decentralised apps (dApps) without needing advanced technical know-how. Qubetics is currently in its 10th presale stage, with over 239 million tokens sold and $3.8 million raised. At $0.025 per token, it’s a bargain for investors looking to get in early. A $1,500 investment could grow to $13,050 if $TICS reaches $0.25 at the presale’s end. Long-term projections are even more exciting. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $15 post-mainnet launch, turning the same $1,500 investment into a staggering $900,000. With unmatched utility, the multi-chain wallet cements Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2024 . Cosmos (ATOM): Pioneering Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos is often called the “Internet of Blockchains,” and for good reason. Its ecosystem is designed to connect multiple blockchains, allowing them to exchange data and tokens seamlessly. This interoperability addresses a significant limitation in the blockchain space, enabling decentralised networks to collaborate rather than operate in isolation. For example, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform built on Ethereum can leverage Cosmos to integrate with other networks like Binance Smart Chain, enhancing user experience and expanding functionality. This connectivity makes Cosmos a cornerstone for dApp developers and blockchain innovators. Trading at approximately $8, Cosmos is an appealing option for investors betting on blockchain interconnectivity. A $1,500 investment in ATOM could yield substantial returns as more projects adopt its technology. However, Cosmos’ utility is mostly limited to developers and blockchain integration specialists, making it less accessible to everyday users. EOS: Scaling Blockchain for dApp Development EOS has long been a favourite among developers for its high-speed transactions and minimal fees. Designed to support decentralised app (dApp) development, EOS provides a scalable blockchain infrastructure capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. This scalability has positioned it as a competitor to Ethereum, particularly for projects requiring fast and cost-effective transactions. Picture a gaming company launching a blockchain-based game. With EOS, they can ensure seamless user experiences without worrying about network congestion or exorbitant gas fees. This focus on scalability has made EOS a go-to platform for developers building dApps across industries like gaming, DeFi, and supply chain management. Currently priced around $0.65, EOS offers a low entry point for investors seeking exposure to blockchain scalability. A $1,500 investment could yield decent returns as dApp adoption grows. However, EOS’ success largely depends on developer activity and competition from other platforms like Solana and Avalanche. Compared to Qubetics, EOS lacks the user-centric innovations that make $TICS a game-changer. While EOS excels in scalability, it doesn’t address the broader blockchain challenges that Qubetics tackles with its multi-chain wallet . Conclusion: Qubetics Outpaces Cosmos and EOS In the race to be the best crypto investment of 2024 , Qubetics emerges as the clear winner. Its multi-chain wallet simplifies blockchain interactions, making it a must-have for businesses, professionals, and casual users alike. While Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability and EOS leads in scalability, neither matches the versatility and innovation of $TICS. With $TICS priced at $0.025 and a 10% price hike just days away, there’s no better time to invest. Analysts project massive ROI, turning modest investments into life-changing wealth. Secure your $TICS tokens today and be part of the blockchain revolution.

At launch, the HYPE token was valued at $3.90, bringing the total distribution to $1.2 billion, according to CoinGecko data. The token’s value surged by 63% within 12 hours, trading at $6.16 at the time of reporting. Its market capitalization is now nearing $2 billion. Token Distribution and Ecosystem Hyperliquid, a layer-1 blockchain based on a proof-of-stake mechanism, is designed to handle up to 200,000 transactions per second. The HYPE token plays a central role in the ecosystem, functioning as the staking asset for consensus and the gas token for the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer, HyperEVM. Hyperliquid revealed that 31% of its 1 billion HYPE tokens were distributed during the genesis event. Of the remaining supply, 38.8% is allocated for future emissions and community rewards, 6% for the Hyper Foundation treasury, and 0.3% for grants. Core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply under a one-year lock period, with vesting schedules extending through 2028. Hyperliquid clarified that no allocations were made for private investors, centralized exchanges, or market makers. Comparisons to Previous Airdrops Hyperliquid’s airdrop ranks among the largest in DeFi history. In 2020, Uniswap distributed 400 UNI tokens to over 250,000 addresses, initially valued at $3.40 each, totaling $1,300 per recipient. UNI’s value later skyrocketed to over $42 during the DeFi summer of 2021. Similarly, Arbitrum conducted a significant airdrop in 2023, distributing ARB tokens to over 625,000 wallets, with a total market value of approximately $812,500. The Role of Airdrops Airdrops serve various purposes, from rewarding early adopters to promoting new cryptocurrencies.

37083644,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620564,1733041312,SEC drags Touzi Capital to court over fraudulent activities,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated legal action against investment firm Touzi Capital. According to its filing, the SEC claimed the investment firm misled investors by lying about its liquidity and the potential profits users would earn from its crypto asset mining platform. In the statement published by the regulator, the firm defrauded about 1,200 United States investors. The regulator claimed that Touzi Capital misrepresented its capabilities, offering a fraudulent securities offering of its mining fund to investors. The SEC also revealed that it made a cumulative $95 million from the fraudulent scheme. The agency said the firm convinced investors by telling them to invest in their crypto mining platform, a claim the SEC found untrue. Touzi Capital lied to investors about its capabilities The SEC’s filing revealed that instead of carrying out the services it was paid for, it mixed all the funds from the investors and pushed it into other subsidiaries. Notably, the subsidiaries had no direct link to a crypto service or a mining facility. The SEC said Touzi Capital refused to explain the risks involved in its investment to investors, lying about the profitability level of its venture. The SEC also discussed the fund’s stability, showing dissatisfaction with how the firm presented it. “The SEC alleges that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements as to the stability of these investments – comparing them to high-yield money market accounts,” the filing read. The SEC also revealed that the investment was highly risky, with those in charge of its activities still accepting new customers even after things started to go bad. Uncertainty surrounds SEC cases amid dismissal threats There have been uncertainties surrounding the cases that the SEC has tried over the last few years, with some risking dismissal. For instance, a United States Judge struck out an appeal from a promoter of an allegedly fraudulent crypto scheme to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against the company. The Scheme was said to have scammed users’ funds worth $18 million. In his arguments, Kristoffer Krohn highlighted that the SEC failed to establish in its complaint letter if the green boxes, the lawsuit’s basis, were securities offerings or investment contracts. Despite Krohn largely arguing on why the SEC lawsuit should be canceled, including noting that the SEC confused elements that defined Securities in its Howey test, the Judge sided with the regulator. However, there is a likelihood that most of the SEC’s legal battles against firms in the crypto sector will fade away soon. This is, in part, due to the emergence of Donald Trump as the president of the United States of America in the last election. Trump, during his campaign, made several promises to the crypto industry, with the industry looking to hold him to his promises when he takes office. One such promise is to fire current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is set to step down before the new administration is sworn in. With Gensler stepping down, there have been intensified efforts to find a pro-crypto replacement. However, speculations still trail the cases tried by the SEC, with market participants predicting a likely dismissal of most cases. Consensys CEO Joe Lubin discussed it at the DevCon 2024 in Thailand, highlighting changes in the future. “Maybe not all the cases, maybe not all elements of the case, but I have a feeling that our industry is going to save hundreds of millions of dollars going forward,” he said.

Moreover, with Bitcoin’s price hovering close to the $100k mark, the crypto space has achieved a new ATH. Will the top 3 cryptocurrencies resume the month of December on a bullish note? In this article, we have covered the short-term market sentiments of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) crypto tokens. Bitcoin (BTC) Despite recording a neutral trend over the last seven days, the BTC price surged ~39% in November. Moreover, with a market capitalization of $1.909 billion, the Bitcoin token currently holds a market dominance of 56.13%. BTC Dec End Analysis The Simple Moving Average (SMA) supports the BTC price chart in the daily time frame. Further, the RSI indicator is hovering close to its overbought range. This indicates an increase in the market’s bullish sentiment for the star crypto. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Bitcoin price will surpass its target price of $100k and head toward its upper high of $110k. On the flip side, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its lower support level of $81,000. To understand the long-term possibilities of the BTC token?

ETH Dec End Analysis The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a constant green histogram with its averages recording a steady rise. Moreover, the EMA 50/200-day displays a Golden Cross daily, highlighting a bullish outlook. Maintaining the price above its resistance level of $3,697 could set the stage for the ETH coin price to head toward its high of $4,100. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the altcoin leader may retest its lower support level of $3,000. Ripple (XRP) The XRP price has continued gaining momentum despite ongoing market turmoil.

XRP Dec End Analysis The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering above its overbought range in the 1D time frame, with its average trendline experiencing a bullish crossover.

Table of Contents DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who always dominate Dogecoin: From meme coin to cryptocurrency powerhouse Shiba Inu: A meme-inspired token with expanding utility Conclusion After a remarkable surge, Dogecoin’s value is edging closer to the coveted $1 milestone. This impressive climb is fueling excitement among traders and investors. At the same time, other meme-inspired cryptocurrencies like SHIB and DOGEN are gaining traction. These developments hint at a possible new wave in the crypto market that could redefine digital currency trends. DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who always dominate The DOGEN vision revolves around the life many aspire to live—luxury cars, wads of cash, and making heads turn wherever. That’s the DOGEN dream.

DOGEN is the new leader in the Solana meme token space, joining the ranks of BONK, WIF, and Popcat—projects that each saw incredible 1000% gains.

Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no supply limit, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute, making it highly abundant. Once regarded as a “memecoin,” Dogecoin skyrocketed in 2021, reaching a market capitalization of over $50 billion and securing its place among the top cryptocurrencies. This rise was fueled by social media buzz and high-profile endorsements, including Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s journey highlights the power of community and social influence in shaping the cryptocurrency market. Despite ongoing debates about its future, its widespread recognition and utility sustain investor interest. Shiba Inu: A meme-inspired token with expanding utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the pseudonymous developer Ryoshi. Initially minted with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB gained attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, significantly boosting SHIB’s profile. Running on Ethereum, SHIB benefits from ecosystem compatibility, enabling projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. These developments position SHIB as a notable player in the current market cycle, blending meme appeal with functional innovation. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of its presale, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters, aiming for unmatched success this altcoin season.

In a new discussion on the Wealthion podcast with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, the Fundstrat head of research says the current technical trajectory of BTC and the incoming pro-crypto presidential administration are putting Bitcoin in a position to achieve his massive price target. “Over the next twelve months, I think something over $250,000 is possible, but maybe highly probable based on just following this price cycle. The second reason I think Bitcoin has maybe more upside than that is because the new administration has run on a pro-Bitcoin platform, and I think the possibility of the US not only legitimizing Bitcoin but making it a strategic reserve asset, I think raises what would be the possible price scenarios for Bitcoin because if the US government, as the intend, ultimately gets to a million Bitcoin it will be the largest Bitcoin holder in the world and they exert an enormous positive influence on legitimizing Bitcoin. I would add to that… It’s almost like taking a playbook from MicroStrategy because MicroStrategy has proven that using Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset has really created a lot of value for MicroStrategy shareholders.” In a recent interview with Natalie Brunell, Lee said that Bitcoin’s market cap could soar about 750% from its current value to hit $16 trillion. Lee believes investors will increasingly flock to Bitcoin as a more useful store of value than gold. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,943.

37082476,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51109,1733039344,Legal Expert Is Certain Ripple-SEC Case Appeal Will be Dropped. Here’s why,"Bill Morgan, a prominent lawyer in the cryptocurrency sector, recently responded to a tweet by Charles Gasparino, Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, regarding the potential implications of Donald Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. The comment has sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community. Gasparino’s original tweet highlighted the possibility that a new SEC administration under Trump could drop the appeal concerning the portion of the case Ripple won. The appeal will be dropped because there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost and the political motive for continuing a near hopeless appeal will largely disappear when its main internal SEC enabler Gary Gensler resigns on 20 January 25. https://t.co/HfaepDv95c — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 28, 2024 Gasparino quoted Christopher Giancarlo, the former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who expressed a similar belief during a Fox Business segment. Gasparino described this scenario as plausible, noting that the political landscape under Trump could significantly influence the SEC’s litigation strategy. In response, Bill Morgan asserted that the appeal would likely be dropped regardless of political dynamics. Morgan stated that the SEC’s appeal of the summary judgment , which ruled that certain XRP sales did not constitute securities transactions, is “near hopeless” due to the absence of any judicial error in the decision. He further emphasized that the political motivations driving the appeal would diminish once Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, steps down, which he projected to occur on January 20, 2025, coinciding with the presidential inauguration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal and Political Implications Morgan’s response underscores a key legal consideration in the SEC’s case against Ripple. The court’s ruling in July 2023 differentiated between institutional sales of XRP, deemed securities, and programmatic sales to retail investors, which were not. This split decision was a partial victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Morgan’s assertion that “there was no error” in the court’s ruling aligns with many legal experts who view the SEC’s prospects on appeal as weak. The case has drawn significant attention due to its implications for crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC leadership under Gensler has been criticized for its aggressive enforcement actions against cryptocurrency firms. A change in the SEC’s administration following the 2024 presidential election could impact its regulatory approach, particularly if Trump appoints officials with a more favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies.

In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, Giancarlo suggested that the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple after a series of courtroom losses. Crypto Dad Claims SEC Will Drop The XRP Case On being asked whether the SEC would drop the XRP case , the ‘Crypto Dad’ responded saying “I think they should, I bet they would. I would recommend, it’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases which they have lost at the trial court,” he noted. Giancarlo’s remarks come amidst waves of optimism in the crypto industry following a Trump victory , in expectations of more crypto-friendly regulations . Particularly in the backdrop of Gensler’s exit and Trump taking office the same day, this matter has gained widespread traction as there is renewed confidence in the community after years of backlash against the “regulation by enforcement” approach backed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Curious about Ripple’s future? Read XRP price prediction to stay ahead of the curve in this ongoing battle with the SEC! ‘The Crypto Czar’ Notably, Trump’s team has revealed plans to decentralize crypto oversight, potentially shifting some responsibilities to the CFTC and appointing a dedicated ‘Crypto Czar’. Trump’s former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo is a lead contender for the role of White Crypto Czar. This new position could usher in a new era of pro-crypto policy in Washington, noted Fox Business. Previously, the former CFTC Chair had shared that he does not wish to clean up the mess that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler created when there were rumors that he was being considered for the position. On asking his views on who will be the next SEC Chair, Giancarlo hopes that it is someone who has both the institutional knowledge of the building and a deep commitment to innovation and crypto agenda. He suggested that Paul Atkins, who is among the top names in consideration, could be the next SEC Chair. Atkins is widely respected for his deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and the SEC’s operations, making him a likely ally for the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Time to Buy XRP?

He believes that Trump is committed to all this and aims to create ‘the second industrial revolution in America’. “If we can go from where we’ve been in the last few years, which was resistance to innovation, to really furthering innovation, we might be able to get to that 4.5% growth rate and get us out of our debt problems,” underscored the former CFTC Chair.

37082475,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51087,1733038252,BTC Whales Are Loading Up—Massive Rally Predicted! Top Cryptos to Watch Now,"The crypto market is on the cusp of another rally, and investors are getting set to take full advantage of it. This is due to Bitcoin’s boom, a development that has sent BTC whales buying copious amounts of Bitcoin . But Bitcoin is not the only coin investors are keeping an eye on– Rollblock is also heating up, and Binance Coin BNB is on the minds of many as well. Veteran investors believe these are the crypto to watch during this period. This article explains why you should pay attention to them. A surging revolution in the GambleFi market Unknown to most people, the GambleFi market is worth an astonishing $500 billion. In fact, this market is on course to hit $1 trillion in a few years, and Rollblock is well-positioned to dominate the space. This is because the online crypto casino integrates blockchain technology into its processes to provide a provably fair gaming experience for gamblers. Rollblock users play without anxiety and worry because the platform is committed to trust and transparency. Every betting odd, stake, transaction, and other important metrics are recorded on the blockchain, which makes them immutable and makes Rollblock incapable of sharp practices. Since this feature is very rare in the GambleFi space, Rollblock effectively qualifies as a crypto to watch out for. Its presale is tearing things up, having raised $6 million for investors alone. And it should, since it’s got an attractive entry price of $0.0037, with the potential for a significant price appreciation in the upcoming crypto surge. BTC price prediction sends the crypto market on a bullish run Ever since Bitcoin hit a new all-time high close to $100k, BTC price predictions have gone through the roof. Several people believe a rally to $150K is imminent, while others expect a correction. However, one thing is clear: the crypto market is set to embark on a massive price rally! This is due to the massive influence Bitcoin has on prices. With Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor about to pour billions into BTC , things could get crazy any time soon. Will BNB ride the upcoming crypto boom? Binance Coin BNB appreciated handsomely over the last year. It rode a bull wave to hit an ATH of $700, but that was its highlight for the year. BNB only appreciated modestly during the last post-US election boom, and this leaves much room for doubts. After appreciating to an impressive $600 last March, BNB has traded mostly in a straight line. It dropped below $500 but struggled to break a resistance level of $600. After Donald Trump’s victory, most coins shot through the roof, but BNB barely crossed $700. This doesn’t inspire confidence in its ability to ride the upcoming crypto bull run. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is surely going to set the crypto market on an extremely bullish momentum and Rollblock tops the coins to watch out for during this period. Unlike Bitcoin and BNB , it has an affordable entry price of $0.037. Also, going by their recent price history Rollblock is more likely to ride the upcoming wave than BNB . This makes it the ideal crypto investment for ambitious investors. If you missed out on Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana when they were worth less than a dollar, Rollblock has provided a brand new opportunity to join a revolutionary movement that is heading to the top. Don’t miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

As the crypto markets enter the final month of 2024, ETH is looking to end the year on a high and extend its rally beyond $4,000. Ethereum (ETH) Sees Surge In Investor Interest Ethereum (ETH) is trading just below the $3,700 level and could rally to test the resistance at $4,000. Trading data shows that ETH has established a foothold above the crucial $3,500 level, indicating growing investor confidence in the asset. Its recent price action also points to strengthening market dynamics as ETH looks to maintain its upward trajectory. ETH’s price chart shows a consistent recovery phase, with prices remaining above crucial support zones. Data from Kraken reveals buyers consistently stepping in above $3,500, suggesting the formation of a strong foundation and support zone at this level, providing a base for future price discovery. Trading volumes have also jumped, indicating active participation across derivatives and spot markets and broad-based interest at current prices. This level of market activity indicates strong market engagement rather than short-term speculation. Ethereum CME futures open interest (OI) has been significantly higher since the US elections and has consistently risen with the price of ETH. The Ethereum CME open interest gives an idea of US investor interest in ETH derivatives. The ETH CME open interest crossed $2.8 billion for the first time last week, indicating surging interest among US traders in the altcoin. The bullish sentiment also sent ETH’s CME futures surging. Spot Ethereum ETFs have also seen consistent inflows, outpacing spot Bitcoin ETFs, and have recorded $225 million in inflows over the past four days. Ethereum Sets Sights On $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) has been steadily climbing over crucial levels as it looks to end the year on a high. Following the US election, ETH surged past the 200-day SMA and $3,000, levels it has struggled to cross. It faced a decline after reaching this level as sellers attempted to drive the price below $3,000. However, ETH found strong support at around $3,100, preventing a further decline. After trading between $3,100 and $3,200 for a few sessions, ETH rallied on Thursday (November 21) to go above $3,000 and settle at $3,360. The price faced considerable selling pressure on Friday, falling back in the red, dropping by 0.96% to $3,328. Source: TradingView The weekend began with ETH surging towards $3,500. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching $3,502, and ETH fell to settle at $3,396, an increase of just over 2%. Sellers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH faced significant volatility, dropping by 1.01% to $3,362. ETH recovered on Monday, rising by 1.60% to hit an intraday high of $3,547 before dropping and settling at $3,415. It fell back in the red again on Tuesday, registering a drop of almost 3% and settling at $3,325. Despite Tuesday’s bearish session, ETH rallied on Wednesday, surging nearly 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, it could not go above the resistance at $3,700 and fell back on Thursday, dropping over 2% to $3,580. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday but could only manage a marginal increase and move the price to $3,694. However, ETH has seen momentum build during the ongoing session as it went past $3,700 to $3,733 before declining to its current level of $3,665, up 2%. Where Next For Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum faces resistance at $3,700. If ETH can rally and move above this level, it could move to $4,000. A break above $4,000 could see the altcoin hit a new yearly high above $4,522. The RSI indicates bullish sentiment, hinting we could see a rally towards the $4,000 mark. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37080976,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656160,1733036403,"XRP Makes A Strong 20% Surge, Pushing Past BNB To Become 5th Largest Crypto","XRP experienced a notable surge of over 20% on Friday, outperforming leading digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This increase has propelled XRP to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, now exceeding $107 billion. As of the latest trading data, XRP is priced at $1.87, reflecting a remarkable 99% increase over the past two weeks. This performance has allowed XRP to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization , signaling a resurgence of investor interest. XRP Breaks Free From Three-Year Stagnation The recent rally marks a significant turnaround for XRP, which had been consolidating between $0.30 and $0.60 for nearly three years. This period of stagnation was largely attributed to the end of the 2021 bull run and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s classification of XRP as an “unregistered security” has created substantial uncertainty for investors, particularly in the US, which has impacted the token’s market performance. However, recent political developments in the United States have contributed to a renewed sense of confidence among crypto investors. Following Donald Trump’s victory on November 5, where he defeated current Vice President Kamala Harris, the cryptocurrency market saw a significant recovery. Bitcoin, in particular, reached a new all-time high of $99,540, leading this resurgence. Trump’s election promises to overhaul regulatory frameworks, including the dismissal of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office, have further fueled optimism. Gensler has announced his departure from the agency effective January 20, coinciding with the presidential inauguration, raising hopes that the protracted legal dispute between Ripple and the SEC may soon be resolved. This potential resolution could pave the way for increased investment in XRP and the introduction of new investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the token, with several asset managers having already filed applications. New Price Targets And Support Levels In terms of technical analysis, crypto analyst DarkDefender has noted that XRP has successfully broken through a critical resistance level at $1.44. With the recent uptrend recorded for the fifth largest token on the market, DarkDefender outlined new targets for XRP, including $3.4176 and $11.3233, while also revisiting historical targets of $5.85 and $18.22. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted new support levels at $1.44, $1.28, $1.14, and $1.03. The 4-hour chart indicates a new market structure for XRP, with expectations of touching $2.13 before any potential corrections. New resistance levels are identified at $4.11 and $6.42 within this timeframe, aligning with the main target of $5.85 following the anticipated move above $1.88.

37080652,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51106,1733035706,"BitBoy to Ethereum (ETH): You Can Run, But You Can’t Hide From XRP","Ben Armstrong, popularly known as BitBoy, has reiterated his belief that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market capitalization during the ongoing bull run. Armstrong, a prominent crypto commentator, made the remarks following XRP’s recent significant milestone, where it surpassed Binance Coin (BNB) to claim the fifth spot among cryptocurrencies by market cap. $XRP has flipped $BNB , and it's just a quick, easy pump away from flipping $SOL . $ETH you can run, but you can't hide! — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) November 29, 2024 XRP Outpaces BNB, Climbs to Three-Year High On Friday, XRP overtook BNB after reaching $1.70, propelling its market capitalization to $97 billion. This marked a significant achievement for XRP, which has since gained momentum. As of the latest data, XRP is trading at $1.86, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent peak of $1.94—the highest price recorded in three years. The asset currently holds a $107 billion market capitalization, solidifying its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. This development has widened the gap between XRP and BNB, solidifying XRP’s fifth-place position. The new valuation brings XRP within striking distance of Solana (SOL), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Solana holds a market capitalization of $117 billion, maintaining a $10 billion lead over XRP. Analysts suggest XRP could surpass Solana if its price reaches $2.10, assuming Solana’s price does not see a proportional increase. Achieving this milestone would position XRP directly behind Ethereum , which leads the altcoin market. Ethereum Under Pressure from XRP’s Surge Amid XRP’s recent progress, Armstrong has emphasized his long-standing prediction that XRP will surpass Ethereum. In a tweet, Armstrong stated, “ETH, you can run, but you can’t hide (from XRP),” signaling his confidence in XRP’s upward trajectory. Ethereum currently trades at $3,705, with a market capitalization of approximately $446.27 billion. By comparison, XRP’s market cap of $107 billion highlights a significant gap between the two. For XRP to match Ethereum’s valuation, its price would need to quadruple, reaching roughly $8. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although such a scenario may seem ambitious, XRP’s recent performance suggests it is not impossible. Since November 4, XRP has surged from $0.4968 to $1.94, representing a remarkable 291% increase. In contrast, Ethereum’s price has grown by just 40% over the same period. If XRP’s growth continues at this pace and Ethereum’s rise remains modest, the possibility of XRP closing the gap becomes more plausible. Can XRP Reach Ethereum’s Market Cap? Reaching Ethereum’s market valuation would require XRP to sustain its bullish momentum. Should XRP achieve a market cap of $445 billion, the asset’s price would align with the projected $8. However, some critics view this target as overly optimistic, citing the likelihood of resistance between the $3 and $5 price levels. Despite these concerns, many XRP proponents remain confident that the cryptocurrency could reach double-digit prices during this cycle, potentially leading to the much-anticipated “flip” of Ethereum. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether XRP can maintain its upward trajectory and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Armstrong and other bullish commentators remain steadfast in their belief, but market dynamics will ultimately dictate the outcome.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/sheikh-musk-shemusk-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Each offers unique value propositions, making them prime contenders for anyone looking to diversify their digital portfolio. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just testing the waters, understanding the nuances of these projects could unlock massive potential gains. Among them, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a dark horse, sparking excitement in the crypto space with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator platform and impressive presale performance. While Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) are already well-established names known for their reliability and innovation, Qubetics is quickly positioning itself as a disruptor with unparalleled utility and growth prospects. If you’re wondering where to put your money this week, it’s worth diving deep into what makes each of these projects unique. This exploration might just give you the edge you need to make a strategic and profitable decision. Qubetics: A Revolutionary Force in the Web3 Space Qubetics ($TICS) is the talk of the town, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s not just offering a token; it’s redefining how businesses and developers interact with blockchain technology. At the heart of its innovation lies the QubeQode IDE , a groundbreaking tool that simplifies blockchain development for professionals without technical expertise. Imagine you’re a freelancer, wanting to leverage blockchain without spending months—or a fortune—learning complex coding languages. QubeQode steps in with drag-and-drop functionalities that make creating smart contracts and decentralised applications as simple as building a presentation. The presale numbers further underscore Qubetics’ momentum. Currently in its 10th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders, raising a staggering $3.8 million. At just $0.0257 per token, this is a window of opportunity that savvy investors won’t want to miss. Analysts predict that $TICS could soar to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a jaw-dropping 871% ROI. But that’s not all. With projections of $1 post-presale and a staggering $15 after the mainnet launch, early investors could be looking at returns exceeding 58,000%. Consider this scenario: A freelancer investing $1,000 at the current price of $0.0257 would secure approximately 38,910 tokens. By the time $TICS hits $1, that $1,000 grows to $38,910. And if the ambitious $15 projection holds true? A life-changing $583,650. Litecoin: The Veteran Altcoin That Still Delivers Litecoin (LTC) is the wise elder in the cryptocurrency world, and its staying power is nothing short of remarkable. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was designed to offer faster and cheaper transactions, and it’s delivered on that promise for over a decade. While newer projects grab headlines with flashy innovations, Litecoin quietly continues to serve as a reliable workhorse in the crypto ecosystem. First, its robust technology and extensive adoption. Litecoin is widely regarded as one of the most secure blockchains, making it a trusted choice for peer-to-peer transactions and as a payment method for merchants worldwide. Moreover, its finite supply ensures scarcity, which often translates to long-term value retention. Litecoin’s ongoing commitment to innovation also keeps it relevant. The recent MimbleWimble upgrade, enhancing privacy and scalability, has solidified its position as a go-to for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. While its price movements may not match the volatility of meme coins or newer tokens, Litecoin’s strength lies in its stability and reliability—making it an excellent hedge against riskier bets. Cardano: The Smart Contract Powerhouse Cardano (ADA) has long been celebrated for its visionary approach to blockchain technology, earning a reputation as one of the most academically rigorous projects in the space. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a mission: to solve the scalability, sustainability, and interoperability issues that plague first-generation blockchains. Over the years, it has firmly established itself as one of the best altcoins to buy this week, offering a potent mix of innovation and real-world utility. The recent surge in Cardano’s price reflects growing investor confidence in its ecosystem. With its proof-of-stake mechanism leading the charge for energy-efficient blockchains, Cardano has become a favourite among eco-conscious investors. Its smart contract capabilities, enabled by the Alonzo upgrade, have opened the floodgates for decentralised applications and DeFi projects. Developers can now create everything from NFT marketplaces to decentralised finance protocols, making Cardano a playground for innovation. Community trust is another hallmark of Cardano’s success. Its transparent development process and rigorous peer-reviewed approach foster confidence among both retail and institutional investors. As decentralised finance continues to grow, Cardano is well-positioned to play a pivotal role, with its ADA token serving as a cornerstone of its thriving ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on These Altcoin Opportunities When it comes to the best altcoins to buy this week, Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cardano each offer compelling reasons to take a closer look. For those seeking a cutting-edge opportunity with unparalleled growth potential, Qubetics’ ongoing presale presents a rare chance to get in before a likely price explosion. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Cardano remain stalwarts in the crypto space, offering stability, innovation, and long-term promise. But the clock is ticking. With $TICS poised for a 10% price increase as it moves to the next presale stage, the time to act is now. Securing your stake in Qubetics today could be the move that transforms your financial future.

XRP is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the latest market rebound. In the past 24 hours, it has climbed over 24%, reaching $1.93. As a result, market watchers are optimistic about XRP’s potential for further gains, with some predicting a rally similar to the 2017 surge.One such analyst is EGRAG, who recently suggested the possibility of XRP reaching $5.3 in the near term. The prediction stems from an analysis of XRP's price movements since 2013, focusing on the symmetrical triangle pattern that has defined its long-term chart.XRP’s Historical Symmetrical Triangles The chart from EGRAG points out two symmetrical triangle formations in XRP’s history. The first triangle spanned from December 2013 to March 2017. During this period, XRP experienced a breakout that led to a staggering 287% increase in just one month. This breakout was a precursor to XRP’s meteoric rise, which culminated in a peak of $3.31 in January 2018. XRP 1W Chart | EGRAG Crypto The second triangle emerged after XRP’s decline from the $3.31 peak. This pattern has persisted for seven years. However, November 2024 has brought renewed optimism, as XRP has recorded a remarkable 270% gain this month. Analysts believe this surge could mark the beginning of a breakout similar to the one from 2017.XRP Targets $5.3EGRAG’s analysis suggested that if the current rally mirrors the 2017 breakout , XRP could see an astonishing 1,273% surge. The market analyst confirmed that this rally would push XRP’s price to approximately $5.3. However, the projection comes with a caution. Just as the 2017 rally was followed by major corrections, a similar pattern could play out this time. EGRAG expects a potential 63% retracement after XRP reaches its peak. This would bring the price back to the $1.94–$1.96 range, aligning with XRP’s previous all-time high in 2021.The analyst further stressed that while the price action closely resembles the 2017–2018 cycle, the timeline may differ. Notably, external factors, including market sentiment and regulatory developments, could influence the speed and trajectory of the rally.Currently, XRP trades for $1.90 , up 5% today. Its latest surge has seen it breach major resistance levels. The asset surpassed $1.63 and is now approaching its 2021 peak of $1.96. Market watchers expect XRP to easily claim the $2 price level once it clears the $1.96 resistance.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/01/xrp-set-for-5-3-as-analyst-says-even-a-63-drop-would-keep-price-above-1-96/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-set-for-5-3-as-analyst-says-even-a-63-drop-would-keep-price-above-1-96,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Shiba Inu stands among the assets that have delivered life-changing returns for investors, particularly those who have remained steadfast. Currently, Shiba Inu trades at $0.000027, reflecting a year-to-date growth of 161%.Although it still trades with four leading zeros, market analysts have highlighted the possibility of SHIB eliminating another zero in the near future. This article explores how investors could leverage Shiba Inu to amass lump sums of $10K, $30K, and $50K should the price reach higher levels, such as $0.0005 or $0.005. How Much You Need to Make $10K, $30K, and $50K If Shiba Inu Hits $0.0005With Shiba Inu trading at $0.000027, attaining the $0.0005 price point would require a growth of 1,751%. To benefit from this 18-fold price expansion, an investor would need to hold 20 million units of SHIB tokens. At Shiba Inu’s current market value, 20 million tokens cost $540.Essentially, an investor must commit $540 to acquire 20 million SHIB tokens to earn $10,000 in the future, should the price appreciate to $0.0005 per token.Meanwhile, to see a $30,000 return from Shiba Inu at the $0.0005 price, one must hold three times as many SHIB tokens. Acquiring 60 million SHIB tokens today costs $1,620.Similarly, the $50,000 target requires five times more capital, at $2,700, as an investor must hold 100 million Shiba Inu tokens today to position for the $50K goal.Making $10K, $30K, and $50K If Shiba Inu Hits $0.005Meanwhile, optimism for Shiba Inu to cancel even more zeros and trade as high as $0.005 is prevalent in the crypto community. For context, reaching $0.005 from Shiba Inu’s current market value would demand an astronomical price surge of 18,418%. This essentially implies a massive 184-fold return on the initial investment.In this case, making $10,000 from Shiba Inu would require holding 2 million SHIB tokens, which costs just $54 today. Likewise, making $30,000 requires an investment of $162 or holding 6 million SHIB tokens. To realize $50,000 from Shiba Inu at a price of $0.005, an investor must be holding 10 million tokens, which costs $270 today.When Can Shiba Inu Reach $0.0005 and $0.005?In May, an analyst using the Elliott Wave Theory suggested that Shiba Inu could reach $0.0005 , citing the completion of a fifth wave on the weekly chart. The analyst predicted that SHIB will recover from past losses and potentially rally to $0.0005059. This projection suggests that this price level is attainable the season by 2025.However, analysts at Telegaon projected a six-year timeline for Shiba Inu to reach $0.0005.

37080651,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51102,1733033178,Market Expert Lark Davis Calls Timeline For Cardano (ADA) to Hit $10,"A recent prediction by crypto analyst Lark Davis has sparked significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. Davis foresees Cardano (ADA), currently ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reaching $10 this bull cycle. This target is approximately an 817% increase from its current value. BREAKING: Lark Davis says "" #Cardano 's getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA ."" pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Cardano’s Recent Surge and Ecosystem Growth Cardano has recently emerged as one of the strongest-performing cryptocurrencies in the market, recording a monthly gain of over 210%. The asset’s market cap is closing in on that of USD Coin (USDC), currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency. This performance underscores the growing interest in Cardano, which Davis attributes to substantial hype around the ecosystem. Davis emphasized that this attention creates a favorable macroeconomic environment for the asset, stating that Cardano could experience significant momentum in the ongoing bull market. Lark Davis’ Price Targets for Cardano Davis’ bullish outlook on Cardano suggests the asset will first aim for its previous all-time high of $3.16, achieved during the last cycle. From there, he anticipates further increases, projecting a rise to the 1.618 Fibonacci level of $4.80, representing a 332% gain from its all-time high. Beyond this, Davis predicts ADA will target the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $7.70 before reaching his ultimate goal of $10 at the 3.618 Fibonacci level. He said it is achievable given the current market dynamics and Cardano’s growing adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Dominance and Price Correlation To substantiate his prediction, Davis referenced Cardano’s market dominance during the previous cycle, which peaked at around 4%. If Cardano achieves a similar level of dominance in the current market, its market cap would need to increase tenfold to approximately $370 billion. According to Davis, this rise in market valuation aligns with his Fibonacci-based price projection of $10. Other analysts share similarly optimistic views about Cardano’s future. For example, Dan Gambardello has predicted ADA could rise to between $5 and $10 after stabilizing above the $1 mark. On-Chain Indicators Support Continued Growth On-chain data and trading activity indicate Cardano may be gearing up for further gains. Recent statistics from CoinMarketCap reveal that Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has surpassed that of Binance Coin (BNB), suggesting a growing interest from market participants. Additionally, analyst Jake Wujastyk has identified strong technical signals for Cardano’s next move. He highlighted the “volume shelf” indicator in his analysis, which suggests that ADA could see another significant upward trajectory. Current Market Performance As of now, Cardano is trading at $1.09, representing a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. This price movement reflects sustained momentum and investor confidence, aligning with analysts’ expectations of further gains in the ongoing bull cycle. With substantial market activity, technical indicators, and optimistic predictions from industry experts, Cardano appears to be positioned for further growth. If Davis’ $10 target materializes, it would mark a historic achievement for the asset, cementing its status as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies in the market.

Following its surge to $98,000, a crypto analyst has asserted that the BTC price has officially entered the parabolic phase of this four-year market cycle . Bitcoin Price Enters Parabolic Phase Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital has declared to his 517,800 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has officially and completely transitioned into its “ Parabolic Upside phase ” this bull cycle. The analyst shared a chart illustrating the coin’s price action during the 2021 bull run and the current bull cycle. After its halving event in 2022, the Bitcoin price experienced a massive rally that pushed it to its 2021 all-time high of over $64,000. At the time, Bitcoin had experienced a significant correction before fully entering its bullish upside phase. Interestingly, a similar trend can also be seen in this bull cycle, signaling a possibility of more price rallies. In the last few months, the BTC price entered a re-accumulation phase characterised by slight declines and consolidation before recording a subsequent rally above $99,000 . Rekt Capital disclosed that after BTC hit $98,000, the pioneer cryptocurrency had successfully entered its parabolic upside phase. This phase suggests that Bitcoin could rise even higher, matching analysts’ expectations in this bull market. On November 27, Rekt Capital also shared a post illustrating the crypto asset’s steady progression into the parabolic phase. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency was on the verge of exiting a reaccumulation phase and transitioning into the parabolic upside, as indicated by the green zone on the price chart. Bitcoin Price: $100,000 ATH – Now Or Never The crypto community is on an intense bullish ride, as analysts and investors widely anticipate the Bitcoin price surge to $100,000. The leading cryptocurrency has been trading just shy of the $100,000 mark , experiencing a price increase above $98,000 at some point in the past week. A crypto analyst identified as Trader of Crypto on X is tapping into this strong bullish trend, announcing that “the clock is ticking” for Bitcoin to reach $100,000. His statement underscores how close Bitcoin is to reaching the milestone during this cycle. Trader of Crypto has also stated that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks past the anticipated $100,000 all time high. While the analyst has maintained a bullish outlook on Bitcoin , he has also presented a price chart that suggests that the cryptocurrency could experience a crash towards $46,757 if bears take over. The Bitcoin price is currently trading at $96,965, marking a 1% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

With its playful mascot and a community of fervent supporters, Dogecoin has evolved from a meme into a formidable altcoin, sparking discussions about its potential for massive gains. As analysts scrutinize the charts and market behaviors, one altcoin rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is emerging as a contender that could deliver astonishing returns, projected at an eye-popping 9,505%. Dogecoin Price Déjà Vu: Echoes of 2021’s Meteoric Rise Dogecoin’s journey from a meme-inspired altcoin to a significant player in the market is nothing short of extraordinary. In 2021, the Dogecoin price experienced an unprecedented surge, skyrocketing over 800% daily, largely fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. Fast forward to November 2024, and the Dogecoin price is at approximately $0.418, reflecting a 5.67% increase from the previous close. Analysts note that its current price patterns resemble those preceding the 2021 surge. Technical analysis indicates a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish indicator that historically signaled significant upward movements for the Dogecoin price. This pattern, combined with increased market interest and favorable regulatory developments, suggests that the Dogecoin price might be poised for another substantial rally. However, the altcoin market’s inherent volatility necessitates cautious optimism. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Dogecoin Rival on the Rise Amidst the renewed interest in the Dogecoin price movements, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a formidable rival in the altcoin space. RCOF is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that leverages crypto AI to optimize investment strategies, offering users access to various financial instruments.

SolidProof has rigorously audited RCO Finance’s smart contracts, guaranteeing they are secure and functional. This level of transparency builds trust among users, who can invest confidently, knowing their assets are protected against potential vulnerabilities. RCOF Altcoin Presale Surpasses the $7 Million Milestone As the Dogecoin price continues to gain momentum, RCO Finance is positioning itself to replicate similar growth, offering investors substantial returns on investment (ROI). With a rapidly growing investor base, its presale has already surpassed the $7 million mark and is closing in on the $10 million milestone. The ongoing presale of RCOF presents an extraordinary opportunity for investors eager to capitalize on this promising project.

37078766,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51084,1733031046,How Lunex Network’s Robust DeFi Platform Is Radically Changing DeFi for the Better As BNB & XRP Holders Ape In,"With its groundbreaking platform, Lunex Network is changing decentralized finance (DeFi) and drawing considerable attention from BNB and XRP holders. Lunex Network’s non-custodial exchange and cross-chain interoperability have established new standards in crypto trading. With access to over 50,000 cryptocurrencies and staking rewards, Lunex Network is changing how traders utilize DeFi. With rising demand and whale investments, this platform is emerging as a vital player bringing fundamental changes to the DeFi sector. BNB’s (BNB) Price Expected To Fall BNB is the native token of the Binance ecosystem and remains amongst the biggest altcoins in terms of market value. However, contrary to other highly ranked altcoins, BNB didn’t experience an impressive price boost after Donald Trump’s election victory. Although BNB has stayed over $600, BNB hasn’t beaten $700 or even close to its all-time high price. For most of the entire year, BNB has traded between $450 and $600. This stagnation has disappointed many BNB holders but what do analysts predict about its future? The consensus is that BNB is facing low volatility and declining interest. If buying pressure increases, BNB might experience a rise. However, based on its recent trends, it is more likely to fall. XRP (XRP) See Over 100% Price Increase In A Month Ripple lost out to Dogecoin in Elon Musk’s X stakes, but the Ripple ecosystem has several bullish factors stacked in its favor. The prospects for Ripple ETF becoming approved in the U.S. have improved lately with the announcement that SEC chair Gary Gensler is leaving in January. Some XRP analysts think the lawsuit against Ripple Labs will be resolved in a short while and the legal fights will end. Additionally, XRP has gained over 176% in a month. While XRP’s all-time high of $2.44 may not hold much longer, this surge could continue as clarity about the SEC leadership unfolds. XRP’s exchange-traded product, now renamed the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP, has also sparked renewed investor interest. Ripple has invested heavily in this renamed ETP, contributing to the growing interest in XRP. Multi-Chain Support: Lunex Network’s Competitive Edge in DeFi Lunex Network (LNEX) is changing decentralized trading by combining off-chain efficiency with on-chain security through a hybrid architecture. This approach creates an ideal trading environment for over 50,000 multi-chain currency pairs across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network addresses key issues like high slippage and rejected transactions, making trading smoother for users. In addition to redefining crypto trading, Lunex Network rewards its users. Lunex Network offers staking rewards of up to 18% APYs through a unique revenue-sharing model. Traders who add $LNEX tokens to their staking pools can begin receiving rewards in as little as 30 days. Since presale investors get their tokens immediately, many are already taking advantage of this opportunity to earn returns before $LNEX officially launches on the open market. During its presale session, Lunex Network, valued at $0.0033, has already attracted over $3.7million in investments. Lunex Network’s unique features and market potential have made it a hot topic in the decentralized exchange space. The growing fear of missing out (FOMO) is drawing more investors, with experts predicting a potential 1,800% return after its exchange listing debut. As 2025 approaches, many crypto investors are looking for tokens that could bring significant returns. Lunex Network stands out as one with high ROI potential, surpassing other favorites like XRP and BNB, which focus on business adoption and sharding techniques. Now is the perfect time to join the Lunex Network’s presale and enjoy the unique benefits of this rapidly growing crypto.

BTFD Coin Could Be Your Next Shot at Greatness!,"If you were one of the unlucky few who missed out on Neiro’s explosive ICO and the incredible profits that followed, you might be feeling a bit like you’ve missed your chance at meme coin glory. But don’t fret—there’s another opportunity on the horizon that could be your ticket to the next big thing in crypto. Enter BTFD Coin, the meme coin that’s been making waves with its presale success and strong community backing. Neiro may have had its moment, but the hype around BTFD Coin is just getting started, and the numbers speak for themselves. With over $295,000 raised in its presale and 10 billion coins already sold, BTFD Coin is setting up to be the next meme coin legend. If you missed Neiro’s launch, this might be your second shot at riding the meme coin wave to serious gains. Let’s take a closer look at why BTFD Coin could be the best opportunity to jump into right now. Neiro: The Meme Coin That Left Investors Speechless Often seen as the little sister to Dogecoin, Neiro carries the same meme magic but with a story all its own. Adopted by the same person who once owned Kabosu—the iconic dog behind Doge—Neiro takes the mantle of meme coin royalty and runs with it. Neiro made a serious splash during its ICO, deploying first on the Ethereum network and drawing the eyes of none other than Vitalik Buterin himself. In a surprise twist, Vitalik publicly backed Neiro on August 4th, 2024, during a rare moment of the New Moon. Shortly after, the Ethereum founder made waves again by donating over $500k to an animal welfare fund, marking a key turning point in Neiro’s journey. This was only the second time Vitalik interacted with a meme coin, the first being with the SHIB token in 2021. Talk about a major endorsement! But Neiro’s story isn’t just about big names and crypto stardom. It’s about redemption. After being abandoned by its original dev and sent to a shelter, Neiro has risen from the ashes—just like any true meme coin. Today, the project is 100% community-owned, with an enthusiastic group of supporters driving its growth. With a charitable mission at its core, the coin has already made donations to the shelter that took in Neiro, and more initiatives are in the works. This commitment to giving back is what makes Neiro stand out in the crowded world of meme coins. BTFD Coin: Your Second Shot at Meme Coin Glory For everyone kicking themselves over Neiro, BTFD Coin is ready to deliver redemption. This meme coin is making waves with its revolutionary approach to community-driven growth, gamification, and high APY staking rewards. Oh, and let’s not forget its wildly successful presale performance. In less than 24 hours, BTFD Coin raised over $150,000 during its presale, and it hasn’t slowed down since. To date, it’s surpassed $295,000 in funding, with over 10 billion coins already sold. The current price sits at $0.00005—meaning early investors still have time to secure their slice of the pie before the price increases again. Why is everyone so hyped about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: High Staking APY: Offering an average annual percentage yield of 90%, BTFD Coin makes your investment work overtime, ensuring rewards stack up fast. Play-to-Earn Game: With a four-level gamified ecosystem, users can convert in-game rewards into real tokens, adding serious value for crypto gamers. Bulls Squad Characters: This isn’t just another meme coin. BTFD Coin has built an engaging narrative around its quirky mascot team—Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull—capturing the hearts of investors and creating a sense of belonging. Investment Potential: Turning $1,000 Into a Dream Let’s say you decide to jump into BTFD Coin right now. With an investment of $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00005, you’d snag a whopping 20 million BTFD Coins. Now, here’s where it gets exciting: If BTFD Coin achieves a price of $0.0006—an entirely realistic target based on its trajectory—you could see your $1,000 investment skyrocket to $12,000. That’s a 12x return, folks. And remember, this doesn’t even factor in additional gains from staking rewards or P2E game earnings. Why Choose BTFD Coin Over Neiro Now? While Neiro made its mark and created millionaires, its initial boom has passed, and the hype has started to plateau. BTFD Coin , on the other hand, is still in its growth phase, making it a prime opportunity for savvy investors looking for the next breakout star. Don’t let history repeat itself—secure your BTFD Coins during the presale and position yourself for what could be one of the most profitable moves in your crypto journey. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin The crypto world rarely gives second chances, but BTFD Coin is the exception. With its explosive presale, game-changing features, and a community that’s growing by the day, it’s shaping up to be the redemption story you’ve been waiting for. Jump into the presale today and grab your share of this rising star before prices climb even higher. It’s your time to turn missed opportunities into massive wins.

RLUSD is Ripple’s proposed stablecoin designed to provide a digital asset pegged to the US dollar, ensuring price stability. Stablecoins like RLUSD are often seen as tools for reducing volatility in cryptocurrency transactions and facilitating seamless financial operations. This stablecoin aligns with Ripple’s broader vision of promoting faster, more cost-efficient payments globally, particularly for businesses and institutions seeking a reliable, stable medium of exchange. Community Insights: RLUSD’s Impact on XRP The introduction of RLUSD has raised certain questions and discussions among cryptocurrency enthusiasts regarding its implications for XRP. One X user expressed concern, asking, “I don’t understand how the stable coin will impact XRP cause wouldn’t the money go into the stable coin?” Hassan, another user, provided a detailed response, stating that XRP’s utility remains intact. RLUSD, being a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is primarily designed for domestic use and dollar-based transactions. In contrast, XRP remains the core tool for bridging various currencies and ensuring liquidity across diverse financial corridors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further into his tweet response, Hassan noted that RLUSD’s introduction could attract a broader range of businesses and institutions to Ripple’s ecosystem. While some may primarily use RLUSD, others might leverage XRP for international payment solutions, increasing the overall utility of Ripple’s technology stack. Strategic Advantages for Ripple Securing approval in New York is a significant achievement for Ripple considering the state’s stringent regulatory standards. This license would position RLUSD as a trustworthy and compliant stablecoin, potentially bolstering Ripple’s reputation among financial institutions wary of regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, RLUSD could open doors for Ripple to expand its product offerings, catering to clients seeking solutions that combine the stability of a pegged asset with the efficiency of blockchain technology. This dual approach—providing stablecoin solutions and XRP-powered cross-border payments —may enhance Ripple’s competitiveness in the global digital finance space.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP.

37077680,https://coinpedia.org/?p=387724,1733030001,Crypto Hack Weekly Report: Solana Wallet Breach and DeFi Challenges,"The post Crypto Hack Weekly Report: Solana Wallet Breach and DeFi Challenges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency markets are still at risk from hacks, fraud, and big losses. This week’s reports of hacks show that many platforms have security weaknesses. These problems also raise concerns about rules and safety in the industry. Dexx Hack Affects More Than 8,620 Solana Wallets The DEXX trading platform, aimed at trading in meme coins, was hacked on November 16th. The attack emerged due to a private key leak to steal more than 8,620 Solana wallets and siphon $30m. In the same case, at least 900 users were affected out of which one person lost more than one million dollars. However, the platform has engaged in mitigation measures like; tracking the hacker’s wallets and negotiating for the funds’ return, yet the outcome is often unpredictable. Pump Science Wallet Hack: Developer Negligence Sparks Token Fraud Pump Science, a Solana-based decentralised science (DeSci) platform, shared news about the breach, which resulted from the recklessness of one of its developers. The attacker used a leaked private key to mint fake URO and RIF tokens into the system voluntarily. The fake tokens circulated into the market erasing the reputation and trust of the project. Pump Science has since explained that any tokens produced by the said wallet since its compromise are fake. The team has also warned users to stay away from fake accounts while trying to contain the losses made so far. MrBeast Gets Accused of Crypto Manipulation and Insider Trading A popular YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) misused his 31.2M subscribers by using forums to promote pump-and-dump schemes. Researchers claim that he manipulated token prices using his status to gain control over them to pump the prices and dump them for a $23 million profit. Key projects tied to these allegations include: $SUPER: $11.45M, $ERN: $4.65M, $PMON: $1.72M, $STAK: $1.31M and $AIOZ: $1M This has again caused many people to ponder on the kind of ethical practices there are in crypto marketing. Crypto Losses in November: A $71M Blow to Defi Analyzed by ImmuneFi , 26 hacking and fraud cases in November led to $71 million in losses. This has reduced by 79% from that recorded in November 2023 when $343 million was drained from the accounts. However, challenges persist, particularly for DeFi platforms, which accounted for: 100% of incidents and losses, $70.99M from 24 hacks and $25,300 from 2 rug pulls Major incidents included: Thala Labs: $25.5M and DEXX: $21M The BNB Chain was the most attacked blockchain with 14 attacks and a total loss worth 46.7%; Ethereum received a 30% loss. Conclusion: Creating a Safer Crypto Space This week’s events show that there’s a need to attend to security loopholes and other malpractices taking place in the crypto industry. Although the total amount of losses has gone down compared to last year, cases such as DEXX and Pump Science clearly indicate the importance of hard technical security measures. In the same way, MrBeast’s case suggests that the FCA should pay more attention to the financial promotions of influencers. Looking ahead to the last quarter of 2024, the key to change and growth of the crypto community is trust, transparency and security to make the ecosystem stronger in 2025.",NEGATIVE,AIOZ,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | AIOZ,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-hack-weekly-report-solana-wallet-breach-and-defi-challenges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37078764,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51095,1733028933,99.999% of People Have No Idea What XRP Is About To Do,"Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a prominent cryptocurrency advocate, has once again drawn attention to XRP with a bold statement. Taking to X, he claimed , “99.999% of people have no idea what $XRP is about to do.” While Farina is well-known for his optimism regarding XRP, his tweet sparked a spirited discussion among community members with varying opinions. XRP Community Reacts A notable response came from X user Pablo Fernandez, who criticized the lack of reasoning behind such claims. Fernandez argued , “This hype is not helpful, saying that something is going to happen and not explaining your logic is like Disneyland for kids, just empty illusion. We all want something big to happen.” He further contended that statements without supporting evidence could lead to emotionally driven investment decisions, stating, “Pushing hype like this makes people FOMO without any base of logic. All emotional, after a month of this, I’m getting tired of it.” Fernandez also highlighted the practical challenges of XRP reaching significant price levels, asserting that for XRP to exceed $10, widespread adoption by banks and the injection of billions to trillions of dollars into the asset would be necessary. His comment encapsulates a growing frustration among some investors who are wary of speculative hype without substantial evidence. Another user, InvestorSauce, took a more neutral stance, acknowledging the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. “100% don’t know. It’s a market with unlimited possibilities where no one can predict certainly,” they remarked. This perspective emphasizes the inherent volatility and uncertainty of digital assets, even those with strong utility narratives like XRP. Balancing Optimism with Realism Farina’s statement underscores the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding XRP, especially given its use case in cross-border payments and its potential for institutional adoption. However, critics like Fernandez raise valid concerns about the implications of unsubstantiated claims in a market where emotional decision-making can lead to financial risks. The cryptocurrency market has seen substantial price movements driven by speculation and hype. While XRP’s potential utility in the financial sector is widely recognized, achieving large-scale adoption by banks globally and integrating trillions of dollars in liquidity remains a complex and gradual process. Such developments depend on regulatory clarity, technological integration, and institutional support. Ultimately, whether XRP will deliver on its potential remains to be seen. As with any investment, individuals must base their decisions on sound research and realistic expectations, rather than succumbing to speculation.

37076893,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620556,1733028474,Self-regulation or overregulation – OpenAI’s cross-continental dilemma,"Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was released in November 2022, tech experts, media, and governments have expressed worry over what it could become in the hands of bad actors. As a result, some countries have leaned towards over-regulation, stifling development (the EU), while others, like the US, have adopted a more hands-off approach to the industry. As of December 2024, various countries have legally besieged AI startups like OpenAI on claims of breaches in data privacy policies and regulations. Most recently, Canadian media houses, including the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, Postmedia, The Globe and Mail, The Canadian Press, and CBC, joined a lawsuit , reportedly the first of its kind in the country. They all sued OpenAI for allegedly ignoring safeguards like paywalls or copyright disclaimers meant to prevent the unauthorized copying of content. “Journalism is in the public interest. OpenAI using other companies’ journalism for their own commercial gain is not. It’s illegal,” the media organizations claimed in a joint statement. The group, which includes the publishers of Canada’s top newspapers, demands damages of C$20,000 per article ($14,300, £11,000) that OpenAI allegedly used to illegally train ChatGPT. The total could amount to billions of dollars in compensation. The news organizations also want an order that would force the company to share profits made from using their articles, as well as an injunction prohibiting OpenAI from using them in the future. Meanwhile, OpenAI says its models are “trained on publicly available data” and that the software is “grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.” “We collaborate closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search, and offer them easy ways to opt out should they so desire,” the company has said. The New York Times and other publishers filed a similar lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft in the US last year. OpenAI faces different regulatory standards around the world China was one of the first countries to set up a regulatory framework for generative AI technology as it issued the final version of its Generative AI Measures on 10 July 2023. Seven Chinese central government agencies jointly adopted the Generative AI Measures, which took effect on 15 August 2023. Compared to the first draft of the Generative AI Measures released for public consultation in April 2023, the new Generative AI Measures encouraged the development of and investment in generative AI technology and services. However, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar services are banned due to censorship laws and fears of misinformation. This pushed Chinese developers, many of whom used OpenAI’s API in their products, to scramble for domestic AI alternatives. The government has also supported these alternatives as they align with its regulations. On the other hand, Russia has taken a more reserved stance regarding artificial intelligence. The country now has restrictions in place to counter what it perceives as risks of US influence through AI. It also cites cybersecurity concerns. In the months leading up to the US election, there were several reports claiming Russia was using AI to influence perspective although many brushed it off as propaganda. In North Korea, the government treats AI with suspicion and great caution, as it does many external innovations. The government has banned ChatGPT and similar technologies in a bid to maintain strict control over information and prevent potential misuse. The EU is behind in the AI race Many experts have accused Europe of stifling AI innovation through its EU AI Act. The EU AI Act is the regulation created to harmonize the legal framework for AI systems across the EU. According to the Act, AI applications fall into three risk levels: unacceptable risk (banned), high-risk (subject to strict requirements), and low-risk (largely unregulated). The Act prohibits AI practices that are manipulative or deceptive, but there are exceptions for certain law enforcement uses. Flouting the Act can result in fines of up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global turnover. Europe’s cautious approach to AI was on full display as Italy’s data privacy regulator clashed with OpenAI over access to one of its media houses’ content. The core purpose of the partnership was to use Italian language content from GEDI’s news portfolio to train and improve OpenAI’s products, a step to train ChatGPT models on Italian content. In response, GEDI stated, “The project has not been launched yet therefore no editorial content has been made available to OpenAI at the moment and will not be until the reviews under way are completed.” The clash comes almost a year after another Italian authority, known as Garante, one of the European Union’s most proactive in assessing AI platform compliance with the bloc’s data privacy regime, banned ChatGPT. It alleged breaches of the European Union (EU) privacy rules, but the service was reactivated after OpenAI addressed issues such as users’ right to decline to consent to the use of personal data to train algorithms. In an e-mail statement, OpenAI said it believes its practices are aligned with the EU’s privacy laws. “We actively work to reduce personal data in training our systems like ChatGPT,” it said, adding it “plans to continue to work constructively with the Garante.” Europe is behind in the AI race while places like America continue to leap forward. Currently, American companies, including OpenAI’s parent company, Microsoft, dominate the ranks of the largest AI firms by market valuation. The nation’s measured response has no doubt paid off for its AI businesses, at least in the short term. Very recently, Kanye West, a Grammy-winning American rapper, became the latest to embrace the technology as he debuted a music video created using generative AI for his single titled, BOMB. While many places cite concerns about the ethics of AI usage as the rationale for their tight restrictions, they also appear to be because of political tensions and efforts to protect national interests. If nothing changes, the world may be far ahead by the time Europe finally catches the AI bug.

37076335,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655934,1733027426,Uniswap Bulls Set Sights On $16.9 Resistance As Uptrend Extends,"Uniswap (UNI) is gaining impressive momentum, reigniting hopes for a continued bullish run. As the token powers up, its next target could be the $16.9 mark, a critical level that could set the stage for even greater gains. With momentum building, the question is whether UNI can break through this resistance and push toward new heights . The aim of this article is to analyze Uniswap’s recent surge, focusing on its potential to break through the key $16.9 resistance level. This analysis will determine if UNI is poised for further gains or challenges in breaking through this critical price point by examining the factors driving UNI’s rally, including technical indicators and market sentiment. Examining UNI’s Recent Momentum Surge On the 4-hour chart, UNI is showing strong bullish strength, attempting to break out of its consolidation zone. Trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the token is targeting the key $16.9 resistance level, signaling the potential for additional upward movement if it maintains its position above the SMA. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 61% threshold after experiencing a decline to 56% signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish movement in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Also, the daily chart showcases UNI’s robust upward momentum , highlighted by the formation of a positive candlestick pattern as the price rebounds, indicating the potential for further gains. Its position above the SMA solidifies the positive trend, signaling consistent strength. As UNI continues its ascent, it inspires growing market confidence and paves the way for an extended increase. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently hit 70%, suggesting that Uniswap has entered overbought territory, reflecting strong bullish sentiment . While this suggests an extended upside, it also raises the risk of a pullback if buying pressure becomes excessive. Will Uniswap Reach New Heights? Tracking The Path Toward $16.9 Uniswap is exhibiting strong upbeat strength, with $16.9 acting as a key resistance level to watch out for. If the token maintains its upward trajectory, it could soon test this level. A successful breakout above $16.9 could open the door to new highs, setting the stage for gains and a possible rally to even higher price targets. However, if UNI fails to maintain its momentum, a pullback or consolidation may follow, potentially driving the price toward the $11.8 support level. A decisive break below this level might lead to more declines, with the next support zone at $10.3 and below.",POSITIVE,UNI,MARKET | TRADING | UNI,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/uni/uniswap-bulls-set-sights-on-16-9/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

37076780,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51093,1733026472,Shiba Inu Team Says SHIB Super Price Cycle Is Still Ahead of Us,"Shiba Inu’s marketing specialist, Lucie, has drawn attention to the similarities between the ongoing market dynamics and the conditions observed in 2020. These comparisons have sparked speculation that the current market could precede a significant bull cycle akin to 2021. Market Overview The recent rally across cryptocurrency markets, initiated following the U.S. election, has resulted in substantial price increases for several major assets. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $99,655 on November 22, while Solana (SOL) peaked at $263 shortly afterward. Despite these developments, some altcoins, including Shiba Inu (SHIB), have not yet achieved new ATHs during this bullish momentum. Shiba Inu’s price increased notably to $0.00003031 on November 12, climbing from a monthly low of $0.00001626. However, this price remains 69.8% below its ATH of $0.00008616, recorded on October 28, 2021. The disparity has raised concerns among investors about whether Shiba Inu has been sidelined in the ongoing market rally. Historical Context and Lucie’s Insights Lucie, a prominent figure within the Shiba Inu team, addressed these concerns by drawing parallels to the token’s historical performance. She noted that the current trend resembles the market behavior of 2020, just before the explosive gains witnessed in 2021. Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 with a price carrying ten zeros after the decimal point. By November 28, 2020, the token had dropped to its all-time low (ATL) of $0.000000000056. At that time, the asset showed little price movement, leaving many investors doubtful about its future. However, the scenario shifted dramatically in 2021 when increased demand, notable exchange listings, and the token’s largest burn event drove significant interest in SHIB. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One pivotal moment occurred in May 2021, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sent over 410 trillion SHIB tokens to a dead wallet, effectively removing them from circulation. This event, alongside widespread market adoption, propelled Shiba Inu to its ATH later that year. Lucie believes the current cycle mirrors the period leading up to SHIB’s breakout in 2021. She has identified 2025 as a potential turning point, calling it the “year of the super cycle,” which could lead to an even larger bull run. She has encouraged investors to remain patient and consider assets with a high tendency for growth. Predictions for Shiba Inu’s Future Price Despite trading below its ATH, many analysts foresee significant price growth for Shiba Inu during the 2024/2025 bull cycle. SHIB is valued at $0.00002598 at the time of writing, reflecting a 3.54% increase in the past 24 hours. Projections for Shiba Inu’s future price vary. Bitcoin investor Dona has predicted that SHIB could reach $0.000114, while cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks suggests an even higher target of $0.0001553 . Both forecasts indicate confidence in the token’s potential to exceed the $0.0001 threshold during the ongoing market cycle. Whether Shiba Inu will achieve these ambitious price targets before the bull cycle concludes remains uncertain. However, historical trends and current market activity suggest that the token may yet experience a substantial upward trajectory.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

37074982,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51091,1733023617,Crypto Founder Predicts Cardano (ADA) Rally to $5 or $10. Here’s when,"Cardano (ADA) has recently captured significant attention after regaining the $1 price level—a milestone many investors and analysts believed might not be reached again. This development has reinvigorated confidence in the cryptocurrency and sparked discussions about its future trajectory. Dan Gambardello, a renowned analyst suggests that Cardano’s current consolidation phase is setting the stage for even greater price milestones, with targets ranging from $5 to $10. $1 Milestone: A Symbol of Resilience for Cardano Cardano’s recapture of the $1 price level is a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. After years of struggling to overcome this psychological barrier, the token’s achievement highlights its strength and resilience. For long-term investors, this marks a moment of validation after enduring multiple market corrections and bearish trends. Ranked as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated solid growth. Over the past week, its value increased by 27.53%. As of report time, the token is trading at $1.05, indicating strong support around this crucial price level. Gateway to $5–$10 The market’s response to ADA’s rally has been mixed. While many in the crypto community celebrated the achievement, others have used this milestone as an exit point, taking profits after enduring prolonged underperformance. Analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He sees the ongoing consolidation around the $1 mark as a positive sign. According to him, this phase allows for redistribution among investors, setting the stage for a more significant upward movement. Once the consolidation phase is complete, Gambardello predicts that ADA could break through to new highs, with $5 and $10 becoming realistic targets soon. Other analysts have shared even more ambitious projections for Cardano. They believe the ADA could hit $10–$12 within the next 6 to 12 months, aligning with bullish forecasts for the broader cryptocurrency market. Predictions for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $250,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to climb to $7,000 lend credibility to these expectations. As one of the leading altcoins, Cardano is likely to benefit from the overall bullish sentiment toward large-cap cryptocurrencies. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Adding to the bullish outlook, Cardano whales have been increasing their holdings. Recent reports indicate that after ADA surpassed the $1 mark, whales purchased over 130 million tokens, bringing their total holdings to 3.2 billion ADA as of November 27. This accumulation trend suggests that large investors position themselves for a potential bull run. Despite profit-taking, the market has shown remarkable resilience, with ADA maintaining a steady upward trajectory over the last three weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Factors Driving Cardano’s Momentum Several factors, including technological advancements, contribute to ADA’s renewed momentum. Cardano’s focus on scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency continues to differentiate it from competitors. The ongoing development of its ecosystem reinforces investor confidence. In addition, broader market sentiment contributes to ADA’s momentum, a bullish outlook for major cryptocurrencies often spills over to altcoins like ADA. As Bitcoin and Ethereum rally, Cardano is expected to follow suit. Also, growing institutional interest in Cardano’s blockchain technology and real-world applications has fueled demand for ADA tokens. The Road Ahead for Cardano Cardano’s ability to maintain its position above the $1 mark will likely determine its future success. Analysts like Gambardello believe this consolidation phase is a necessary step before ADA can target higher price levels. With the support of long-term holders, increasing whale activity, and optimistic market sentiment, Cardano appears well-positioned to achieve its ambitious targets. While risks remain, the outlook for ADA is undeniably promising as it sets its sights on $5, $10, or even higher price levels. Cardano’s resurgence to the $1 mark represents a critical juncture in its journey. The consolidation phase is not a sign of stagnation but a precursor to potential exponential growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, ADA is emerging as a contender to watch, backed by technological advancements, investor confidence, and the vision of a decentralized future.

37074120,https://nulltx.com/?p=135020,1733022904,Best Altcoins to Buy This Weekend: Invest Early in $TICS While Cosmos and Polkadot Stay Strong for 2024,"Best Altcoins to Buy This Weekend: Invest Early in $TICS While Cosmos and Polkadot Stay Strong for 2024 For seasoned traders and newcomers alike, the allure of altcoins—innovative projects built to disrupt industries—remains irresistible. Altcoins have consistently provided unique value propositions, from blockchain interoperability to decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. In 2024, three standout projects—Qubetics (TICS), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polkadot (DOT)—have solidified their positions as some of the best altcoins to buy this weekend. Whether you’re looking for a revolutionary project with high potential returns, or a proven crypto mainstay offering stability, there’s plenty to explore. Polkadot and Cosmos, each with their strong foothold in the market, represent resilience and continued innovation. But a rising star, Qubetics , is turning heads with its record-breaking presale and ambitious goals. If you’ve been searching for a game-changer, now’s your chance to learn more. Let’s tune into what makes these altcoins exceptional choices, starting with Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s setting a high bar for innovation and investor excitement. Qubetics: Revolutionising Web3 with $TICS and the QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t just an altcoin; it’s a movement. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics has captured the attention of investors and developers alike with its seamless integration of blockchain technologies and real-world applications. Currently in the 10th stage of its presale, Qubetics has already raised an impressive $3.8 million, selling over 239 million tokens to more than 5000 holders. Priced at just $0.0257 per token, $TICS offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to capitalise on a projected ROI of up to 58,213% after its mainnet launch. What truly sets Qubetics apart is the QubeQode IDE, a cutting-edge integrated development environment designed to streamline Web3 project creation. Imagine this: a business professional managing supply chain logistics could leverage QubeQode’s intuitive interface to integrate blockchain-based data storage. Instead of juggling traditional, siloed systems, they gain secure, decentralised data access at their fingertips. For artists, the IDE could offer a transformative way to mint NFTs, track ownership rights, and even monetise their digital works in real time—all with zero coding experience required. Now consider the financial implications. An artist investing $10,000 in $TICS at $0.0257 could see jaw-dropping returns of $378,700 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale. If the token reaches $5, that same investment could balloon to $1.93 million. With the presale price set to increase by 10% in the 11th stage, waiting even a day could mean missing out on what analysts call a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The buzz around Qubetics isn’t just hype; it’s backed by a bold vision, tangible innovation, and the kind of investor enthusiasm that rarely goes unnoticed. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos, often referred to as the Internet of Blockchains, is one of the most established names in the cryptocurrency world. Since its inception, Cosmos has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain interoperability, allowing disparate networks to communicate and share data seamlessly. For investors seeking reliability, Cosmos delivers a well-rounded proposition: robust technology, active developer communities, and a proven track record of adoption. But what makes Cosmos one of the best altcoins to buy this weekend? It’s all about its adaptability. While many blockchain projects struggle to remain relevant, Cosmos thrives by solving real-world problems. Consider this: you’re a tech entrepreneur running a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. With Cosmos, you can connect your platform to other blockchains effortlessly, enabling faster transactions, lower fees, and access to a broader user base. That’s the power of the Cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos has also earned a reputation for serving as an alternative investment instrument. It caters to those disillusioned with traditional finance by offering exposure to cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re a long-term holder or a swing trader, Cosmos provides the kind of stability and innovation that keeps portfolios balanced, even during turbulent market conditions. Polkadot: A Pioneer in Blockchain Innovation Polkadot, the brainchild of Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, stands tall as a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Known for its groundbreaking parachain technology, Polkadot enables multiple blockchains to operate within a single network, making it a go-to choice for developers and enterprises. In the crypto community, Polkadot has earned a loyal following for its scalability, security, and forward-thinking approach to decentralisation. For investors, Polkadot represents an opportunity to be part of a project that consistently pushes boundaries. It’s not just about owning a token; it’s about being part of a movement that aims to redefine how blockchain technology interacts with the world. Think of Polkadot as the engine that powers next-generation decentralised applications (dApps), from supply chain management to digital identity verification. Polkadot’s appeal also lies in its ability to weather market fluctuations. While newer projects often experience volatile price swings, Polkadot remains a symbol of resilience, proving that established altcoins can still deliver impressive returns. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, Polkadot offers a solid foundation for diversifying your investments. The Best Altcoins to Buy This Weekend As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polkadot stand out as compelling choices for investors. Qubetics dazzles with its record-breaking presale, revolutionary QubeQode IDE, and unparalleled growth potential. Meanwhile, Cosmos and Polkadot continue to serve as stalwarts in the market, offering reliability, innovation, and long-term value. Don’t wait too long. With the $TICS price set to increase soon, now’s the time to act. Visit Qubetics’ presale page, explore Cosmos’ groundbreaking solutions, or dive into Polkadot’s unparalleled ecosystem.

And while it changed the world, it’s not without its flaws. Bitcoin lacks many modern functionalities, leaving gaps in privacy, scalability, and accessibility. This has left the door wide open for innovative projects like Qubetics to step in. Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s a game-changer. With its decentralised VPN, it addresses issues Bitcoin never could, like securing user privacy in a highly surveilled online world. If you missed the Bitcoin revolution, don’t let Qubetics slip by. It’s shaping up to be the best crypto to invest in now , combining innovation with unmatched potential. How Qubetics Solves Privacy Problems In today’s digital age, privacy is increasingly rare. Traditional VPNs claim to secure your data but often fall short, storing logs that can be accessed or hacked. Centralized solutions also leave users vulnerable to government interference and corporate misuse of personal data. Qubetics revolutionizes this space with its decentralised VPN, which removes central control entirely. Users retain full ownership of their data while benefiting from enhanced security and anonymity. This makes Qubetics more than just a blockchain—it’s a solution for an era where privacy is under siege. Its presale offers an incredible opportunity to get involved in the best crypto to invest in now. Tackling Security Risks with a dVPN Cybersecurity threats have skyrocketed, with hackers targeting everything from financial institutions to individual users. Centralized VPNs, while helpful, are often the weakest link, becoming single points of failure in an increasingly hostile digital landscape. Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates these vulnerabilities. By decentralizing the network, Qubetics ensures there’s no single point of attack. This provides unparalleled security, making it an essential tool for anyone concerned about their online safety. With its presale already creating waves, Qubetics is undeniably the best crypto to invest in now for those who value both security and innovation. Restrictive Data Practices Are No Match for Qubetics Many VPNs and online tools restrict how users can access and share data. These limitations stifle creativity and freedom, forcing people to operate within narrow parameters set by centralized systems. Qubetics challenges this status quo with its decentralized approach. With Qubetics, users regain control over their data and online activities. There are no middlemen imposing restrictions or profiting from your information. This makes Qubetics a leader in the fight for online freedom and positions it as the best crypto to invest in now . Presale Momentum—Why Qubetics Is Your Next Smart Move The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment opportunity; it’s a chance to be part of a revolutionary project from the ground up. Tokens are currently priced at just $0.025, and with predictions of hitting $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential returns are staggering. Missing Bitcoin was painful, but you don’t have to make the same mistake twice. Qubetics offers innovation, security, and privacy, all while being accessible to early investors. It’s more than a blockchain—it’s the best crypto to invest in now , and the time to act is now. Conclusion Missing Bitcoin’s early days taught us all an invaluable lesson: opportunities in crypto don’t wait. Qubetics represents the next frontier, tackling issues like privacy, security, and data restrictions with its innovative dVPN technology. The presale is already underway, and the clock is ticking.

37071333,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51053,1733017503,Qubetics Presale Hits $3.8M with 239M $TICS Sold—The Best Crypto to Buy Now Amid Ethereum’s DeFi Power and Kaspa’s Lightning Speed,"In the crypto world, there’s never been a better time to explore the best crypto to buy now. In a market full of innovation, three projects stand out for their potential to shape the future. While each brings something unique, one newcomer is stealing the spotlight. Ethereum has long been a pioneer in decentralised applications, while Kaspa focuses on speed and scalability. But then there’s Qubetics ($TICS)—a revolutionary blockchain platform redefining interoperability. The presale creates waves, offering massive ROI potential and a chance to get in early. This article will explore Qubetics, Ethereum, and Kaspa and explain why they are the best cryptos to buy now. Let’s start with the rising star: Qubetics. The Web3 Aggregator That’s Redefining Crypto: Qubetics Is Here The current blockchain ecosystem is like a bustling city with no bridges. Each network operates in isolation, limiting the potential for seamless transactions and data sharing. This siloed approach creates headaches for developers and hinders mass adoption of blockchain technology. Enter Qubetics, a Web3-aggregated chain that’s tearing down these barriers. Qubetics unifies multiple networks into a single, interconnected framework. This groundbreaking approach enables smooth asset transfers, efficient data sharing, and true cross-chain functionality. For developers, enterprises, and users, Qubetics means fewer limitations and more opportunities. Imagine an app that easily communicates with other networks or seamless asset swaps without complex workarounds. Qubetics is setting the stage for decentralised technologies to work together like never before, unlocking blockchain’s full potential. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract Platform Ethereum needs no introduction. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, it paved the way for decentralised applications (dApps). Its ecosystem is home to thousands of projects, from DeFi to NFTs, making it a cornerstone of the crypto world. Despite its success, Ethereum faces challenges like high fees and slower transaction speeds, which newer competitors are eager to address. However, with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades rolling out, including proof-of-stake consensus, the network is evolving to stay competitive. For those looking for a solid long-term bet, Ethereum remains one of the best cryptos. Kaspa: Speed Meets Scalability Kaspa is all about speed. Designed as a proof-of-work blockchain, Kaspa delivers ultra-fast transaction confirmations without sacrificing decentralisation. Its innovative design ensures scalability, making it a great option for real-time applications and high-demand networks. Kaspa’s focus on speed and simplicity sets it apart in a complex market. While it’s still growing, its unique architecture and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a standout for those seeking efficiency. For many, it’s emerging as one of the best cryptos. Why $TICS is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Qubetics’ presale is where the excitement hits a fever pitch. Currently, in Phase 10, this presale is structured to reward early adopters. Every week, token prices climb by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike at the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, and the numbers are jaw-dropping: $3.8 million raised 5000+ holders 239 million tokens sold If you’re looking to maximise returns, this phase is your golden ticket. Analysts predict a post-presale value of $0.25 per token, translating to a staggering 900% ROI for those who get in now. But that’s just the start. Let’s talk numbers. A $100 investment at $0.025 would secure 4,000 $TICS tokens. If the token price hits $10, that $100 turns into $40,000. At $15, you’re looking at $60,000—a mind-blowing ROI of 59,900%. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about timing. The best crypto to buy now is the one with massive growth potential, and $TICS checks every box. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now with Massive Growth Potential As the crypto market evolves, three projects stand out: Ethereum, Kaspa, and Qubetics. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralised innovation, while Kaspa offers unmatched speed. But Qubetics ? It’s the game-changer. Analysts are excited about the insane ROI potential of Qubetics’ presale. With its vision of unified blockchain interoperability and a token price poised to skyrocket, $TICS offers something no other crypto does right now. The presale is your chance to be part of the next big thing. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now, don’t let Qubetics’ presale pass you by.

37070888,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655911,1733016652,Dogecoin Consolidates Below Key Supply Level – Analyst Expects Rally Soon,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is consolidating below a critical resistance at $0.43, a price point that has captured the attention of traders and analysts alike. This key level, acting as a significant hurdle, is widely seen as the launchpad for a potential parabolic rally. If DOGE manages to break above this barrier, it could enter uncharted territory and achieve new all-time highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical and macro analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s strong potential for continuing its bullish momentum. According to Martinez, DOGE is positioned for a parabolic rally, driven by growing interest and increasing adoption in the market. His analysis underlines the importance of the $0.43 resistance level, suggesting that a decisive breakout could trigger substantial upward price action. The meme coin, known for its vibrant community and unpredictable price moves, has gained traction as broader market sentiment turns bullish. With consolidating price action and strengthening technical indicators, Dogecoin appears ready to embark on its next major leg up . The coming days will be critical for determining whether DOGE can overcome this resistance and fulfill the expectations of a parabolic rally. Dogecoin About To Enter Bullish Phase Again Dogecoin’s history of explosive rallies has made it one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies. The last time DOGE began a significant rally, it surged over 215%, delivering substantial gains and fueling widespread speculation about its price potential. Now, as the meme coin consolidates, investors and analysts are eyeing the next big move. Martinez has provided valuable insights into DOGE’s current price action . He notes that Dogecoin is firmly in a consolidation phase, testing investors’ patience during this parabolic run. Drawing comparisons to similar market conditions in 2017 and 2020, Martinez highlights a critical pattern: the appearance of a TD Sequential sell signal, often signaling a brief correction before the rally resumes. This historical perspective suggests that DOGE’s temporary pause may set the stage for an even more aggressive surge. As the broader market continues to rise, expectations for Dogecoin remain high. Many investors are optimistic that DOGE will soon replicate its past performance and embark on a massive upward trajectory. Martinez predicts that such a surge will likely align with Bitcoin breaking its all-time highs and crossing the $100,000 threshold, a milestone anticipated as early as next week. If Bitcoin delivers, Dogecoin could follow suit with a breakout to new highs. DOGE Testing Supply Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.426, just below the critical resistance level at $0.43. This resistance has so far prevented a bullish continuation, making it a pivotal point for DOGE’s next price action. If the price manages to break above $0.43 and sustain this level for a few days, it could pave the way for a strong breakout and further upside momentum. Investors and traders are closely monitoring this area as a decisive move could trigger a significant rally. However, the $0.43 mark also represents a potential barrier. A failed breakout at this level would likely lead to a correction, pulling the price back to retest lower support zones. In such a scenario, DOGE could drop to around $0.35, depending on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action. The next few days are crucial as Dogecoin approaches this resistance with heightened market anticipation. Bulls aim for a breakout to sustain the parabolic run, while bears may seize the opportunity to push prices lower if momentum falters. For now, the $0.43 level remains the key to determining DOGE’s immediate direction and whether it will embark on a bullish continuation or face a pullback.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP.

He’s even encouraged developers to build on the platform, saying, “Build, and we will be rewarded.” Base’s VIRTUAL is in surprisingly high demand, with its market cap growing by over 60% Although the L2 network does not intend to release a native token on its network anytime soon, some of the products on its blockchain are doing exceedingly well, including the VIRTUAL Token and aixbt. According to Coingecko , by November 29, Virtual Protocols Ecosystem on Base’s platform’s market cap had soared by over 50.4%, reaching $1.78 billion. Currently, it is close to surpassing $2.4 billion, rising by 61%. The token VIRTUAL‘s 24-hour trading volume is at $498,352,940. It is currently trading at $1,79, a 35% rise in the last 24 hours and up by 206% in the last seven days. Aixbt’s price has also risen by over 323% in the last week, trading at $0.201. Pollak even commented on Aixbt’s rise, saying the AI agent ranks first in on-chain mindshare. Analysts have attributed the growing interest in the Virtual Products Ecosystem to the escalated demand for AI agents and AI-based programs, which are efficient and fast at completing tasks. Greg Isenberg, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, projects even more revenue growth for AI agents like Aixbt. He believes the market for AI agents could easily grow to a trillion-dollar market, saying the world will soon replace human workflows with AI agents.

37068760,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620538,1733012416,"Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson says Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is worse than we think, and global","Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano and Ethereum, is calling out what he describes as a coordinated global campaign against the crypto industry, one that’s worse than anyone anticipated. Charles took to X (formerly Twitter) to sound the alarm on the aftermath of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he claims has devastated businesses, hurt economies, and crushed innovation worldwide. “So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it’s not as bad as the industry made it out to be,” Charles wrote. “It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed.” He warned that the fallout from this crackdown will take years to heal and urged the crypto community to unite, adding, “We have a small window of time to get a law passed.” Charles’s comments were prompted by Binance chairman Gabriel Abed, who revealed his own experience of being debanked outside the United States. Abed recounted how First Citizens Caribbean Bank shut down his accounts—accounts he’d held for over a decade—because he received a bitcoin-related deposit. The bank’s CEO explained that working with crypto companies posed too high a risk to their American correspondent banking relationships. Abed’s experience, he said, is not unique. International banks were severing ties with crypto clients to comply with “standards” set by their U.S. counterparts. “This isn’t just an American issue,” Abed said. “It’s global.” Crypto industry blames Biden administration for financial suppression The crypto community believes it knows who’s behind this assault: the Biden administration. Industry leaders accuse the government of reviving the controversial Obama-era Operation Chokepoint under a new guise. The original program, launched in 2013, pressured banks to cut ties with industries considered “high risk,” such as payday lenders and firearms dealers. Critics argued that legitimate businesses were being unfairly targeted. Operation Chokepoint officially ended in 2017, but crypto insiders say it made a comeback in 2021, this time with blockchain firms in its crosshairs. Elon Musk reignited the discussion with a single question: “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, jumped in immediately. “Yes,” he responded. “I was debanked because I’m in crypto, as was Gemini. The number is probably much larger than 30. That’s just in the a16z portfolio alone.” Tyler accused the Biden administration of “assassinating” banks that dared to serve the crypto industry. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, backed Tyler with his own allegations. “Can confirm this is true,” Brian said, calling the debanking of crypto companies one of the most unethical moves in American history. He pointed fingers at Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler, claiming they orchestrated a deliberate attempt to “kill” the industry. “My guess? We’ll find Warren’s fingerprints all over it. Biden himself was probably unaware,” Brian speculated. He revealed that Coinbase is using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover who exactly was involved. Can confirm this is true. It was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration, and my guess is we'll find Elizabeth Warren's fingerprints all over it (Biden himself was probably unaware). We're still collecting documents via FOIA… https://t.co/2Rda7VU9MT — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 27, 2024 “This was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election,” Brian continued. “The party should realize Warren is a liability and distance themselves if they want any hope of rebuilding.” Marc Andreessen, the highly-respected venture capitalist, appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast to call out what he sees as blatant financial censorship. “This is about control, not compliance,” Marc said, describing how at least 30 tech founders, himself included, were targeted and debanked for political reasons. He pointed to the broader implications: “This goes beyond crypto. This is about freedom.” The global fallout of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Andrew Torba, founder of Gab, shared his story of relentless account closures. “Without a bank account, you can’t store cash, run payroll, or pay bills,” he said. “That’s the point—choke businesses until they die.” Andrew said he opened accounts with major banks, credit unions, and even Christian financial institutions, only to be repeatedly shut out. “The reason was always the same: ‘Our terms say we can do this anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.’” According to him, banks have admitted off the record that they were being pressured by the government with threats of audits and regulatory scrutiny. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has also been vocal about her experience. Long confirmed that her company has been debanked multiple times and is now suing the Federal Reserve. Her case is scheduled for oral arguments on January 21, just one day after Inauguration Day. John Deaton, a well-known crypto lawyer and former US Senate candidate, called Caitlin’s lawsuit “arguably the most important fight against unelected bureaucrats and the deep state protecting the banking system’s status quo.” Payment processing veteran Brian Roemmele shares these concerns. He described how Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has destroyed trust in the financial system. Roemmele has worked in merchant processing since the 1980s and said the Biden-era version of the program is even more destructive than the original. “This time, it’s vengeful,” Roemmele said, adding that thousands of businesses have been wiped out overnight. He claimed the crackdown has made doing business ten times more expensive and accused the government of using banks as tools of state corruption. Gabriel Abed’s story offers a glimpse into how this suppression plays out on the ground. After receiving a bitcoin-related deposit flagged as high risk, his decade-old accounts were shut down. He called the debanking crisis a “clear example of how far-reaching the consequences of U.S. banking policies are,” adding that local banks are often caught in the crossfire. “Barbadian banks face immense pressure to comply with U.S. standards or risk losing their correspondent relationships.” Charles, for his part, is urging the crypto industry to unite. He believes the community has a small window of time to push for legislative reforms to ensure such a campaign is never repeated. “We have to come together to prevent this horror from ever happening again,” he said.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pink-shiba-inu-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-wif-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

American author Robert Kiyosaki made a controversial stand after commenting that the psychological phenomenon of the fear of missing out (FOMO) can be a positive driving force that will push investors to buy the top crypto before it reaches the $100,000 level. Bitcoin: The Challenge To Invest Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 level, it would be challenging for the middle class to invest significant amounts in the firstborn crypto, urging them to invest now that the digital currency is still below the said level. “Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up,” Kiyosaki said. The American author explained that once Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy, holders of traditional fiat currencies such as the dollar, euro, and yen will lose out. Kiyosaki, who is an advocate of alternatives to fiat currencies such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, argued that if BTC breaks the $100,000 level, “only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence.” THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER?A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER?A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad“Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Embracing FOMO Ever since Kiyosaki has been promoting investment in Bitcoin, he believed that the crypto offers an opportunity to better protect wealth than the traditional currencies. Now that BTC is nearing a new all-time high, Kiyosaki urged people like those in the middle class to invest in Bitcoin, saying that if they are hesitant, they can embrace the FOMO mentality. “FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” he added. He explained that the fear of missing out on the Bitcoin opportunity could pull people to invest in the crypto so they could benefit when the coin reaches new heights. Fiat Savings Not Good The author dispelled people from saving, saying that ‘savers are losers” because, in his opinion, “cash is trash.” Kiyosaki explained that holding Bitcoin is better than saving in cash because traditional fiat currencies have to contend with inflation which reduces its value over time. In an X post, he urged people to diversify their assets and invest in alternatives such as Bitcoin, claiming that government monetary policies and inflation will continue to “erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies.” He pointed out that today is the right time to invest in BTC because once the coin breaches the $100,000 milestone, it will be nearly impossible for most people to get hold of it. As of press time, BTC is being traded at $96,722 per coin, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.
