42398334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI6z,1430940325,FinCEN Conducting 'Examinations' of Digital Currency Businesses,"US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said during a speech today that her agency is in the process of investigating businesses in the digital currency ecosystem.  Calvery gave the keynote address during the first day of the 2015 West Coast Anti-Money Laundering Forum in San Francisco. FinCEN later published the text of her speech, which acknowledged that “a series of supervisory examinations of businesses in the virtual currency industry” had begun.  The announcement comes a day after FinCEN, in conjunction with the US Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California, announced that it had reached a settlement with Ripple Labs over violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. As part of the agreement, Ripple Labs and a subsidiary agreed to pay $700,000 and facilitate more stringent oversight of the Ripple network.  In her remarks, Calvery suggested that the process could result in future enforcement actions, noting:  ""Working closely with our delegated BSA examiners at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), FinCEN recently launched a series of supervisory examinations of businesses in the virtual currency industry.""  Calvery said this supervision will help FinCEN determine that ""virtual currency exchangers"" are meeting compliance obligations.  ""Where we identify problems, we will use our supervisory and enforcement authorities to appropriately penalize non-compliance and drive compliance improvements,"" she continued.  The FinCEN director also touched on the settlement with Ripple, with some of the remarks echoing comment offered by the agency when it announced yesterday’s agreement.  At the time, she said that “innovation is laudable” but noted how digital currency businesses in the US must comply with federal statutes.

42398340,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTIHo,1430936130,Dubai's BitOasis Opens Bitcoin Buying Service at TechCrunch Disrupt,"Dubai-based startup BitOasis has announced the launch of a new bitcoin buying platform.  Aimed at consumers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the platform was revealed at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY Startup Alley, a venue for early-stage companies taking place over the course of the three-day conference.  Co-founder Ola Doudin explained that the goal of the service is to increase bitcoin liquidity in the Middle East as part of BitOasis' long-term strategy of serving what she characterized as the vital remittance corridors of the region.  Doudin told CoinDesk:  ""The UAE specifically serves as a gateway to the Middle East, but it's a big outbound remittance market with corridors to India, Philippines, Thailand, Kenya and other countries. It's a connection between different countries and different markets and we see a big opportunity for bitcoin.""  For now, Doudin indicated that BitOasis is acting as a bitcoin brokerage, purchasing bitcoin on other, more liquid markets, with the goal of one day opening up cash-in, cash-out services that can appeal to the 75% of consumers in the region locked out of traditional bank accounts.  ""Bitcoin can fill lots of gaps in the Middle East when it come to payments and providing affordable financial services for an underserved market,"" she added.  In addition to its brokerage service, BitOasis offers a three-key multisig wallet. The company estimates it has registered 15,000 users since its January launch, with users in the UAE, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Indonesia and Malaysia.  Telling its story  While not available in the US, Doudin explained that BitOasis sought to foster connections with the broader payments industry at TechCrunch, with the hopes of also being selected by popular vote for a presentation slot on the event's main stage.  While BitOasis fell short in the vote, however, Doudin said her company received attention due to what she characterized as their 'unique story', being among the few bitcoin companies that services MENA markets and one of the only bitcoin companies at the event.  ""For us, it's about networking with startups and investors,"" she continued. ""We've been approached by different people, people who want internships and other startups who are interested in payments to the Middle East.""  This attention, she said, has translated to easier messaging in its domestic market. ""We're one of the only ones so we get the attention and the spotlight, which was a nice marketing strategy, we kind of came built-in,"" she added.  As part of its initial wallet sign-up process, the four-person company offered 1,000 bits to new users, with referral bonuses of 500 bits for those who referred family and friends.  Currently, buyers are limited to purchases of 2000 AED, or roughly $550, which can be made through cash deposits at banks and wire transfer.  Moving forward in MENA  Doudin reported that the public in the Middle East is still learning about bitcoin and blockchain technologies, but that the environment is warming.  With this in mind, BitOasis aims to launch a mobile wallet app this summer, with the goal of capitalizing on the region's high smartphone penetration. As for how these consumers will take to a new currency as well as unfamiliar terms like multisig, Doudin expressed her belief that focus on the consumer experience could propel BitOasis past these problems.  ""For the less tech-savvy users, mutlisig is more technical to understand, but they understand that with three keys it's a higher level of security. They understand why it's better logically without going into the technical details,"" she added.  On the legal and regulatory front, Doudin framed Dubai as a progressive jurisdiction for bitcoin development.  ""In Dubai, we've been interacting with different partners and there hasn't been any negativity from regulators, they are being open about it,"" she said, adding:  ""UAE has been open for innovation for years and they've been embracing innovation on different industries, so I see that as an opportunity.""

42398329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTI9w,1430929711,Bitseed Open-Sources Creation of Second Plug-in Bitcoin Node,"Bitcoin startup Bitseed has announced it is open-sourcing the creation of its new plug-in node.  The company, which launched its first node in March, is asking contributors to help evolve its product by completing tasks and solving bounties in exchange for rewards.  Bitseed's project is hosted on Assembly, a collaborative platform that tracks contributions to projects with coloured coins on the bitcoin blockchain.  John Light, co-founder at Bitseed, told CoinDesk:  ""The Bitseed Assembly community is our way of trying to make open-source development sustainable, and to financially support the open-source software that runs on Bitseed. If a contributor completes a bounty they earn Assembly coins for that project.""  He continued: ""When the project earns revenue, the revenue is distributed proportionally to all coin holders. Our current pledge to coin holders in the Bitseed Assembly community is to give them $1 for each Bitseed [node] sold.""  New developments  The bounties – which include improvements to software and hardware development, graphics design and marketing – proposed by Assembly community members are subject to approval by a Bitseed core team member.  The company says the new node, known as Bitseed v2, has already undergone a series of design improvements, including allowing operators to decide how many nodes their device will connect to.  The bitcoin startup revealed it is also venturing into the altcoin space, offering support for currencies on a ""per coin basis"".  For example, if Bitseed receives an order for 100 nodes with litecoin support, it will begin to produce single units which can run the altcoin.  Alternatively, Bitseed is also seeking the support of developers from the altcoin community.  Light said that the purpose of this was to fund the integration. ""If a developer helps us, there is no need for the up-front funds, but without a developer we would need to devote our own resources"", he said.  Declining nodes  The news comes amid concerns about the declining number of full bitcoin nodes.  Besides Bitseed, other initiatives have set out to boost the number of nodes across the world, including Fullnode.co – a non-profit project that lets bitcoin donors ""spin up a full node"" by tipping a wallet address. Currently, it has four up-and-running.  As an essential component of the network, bitcoin nodes broadcast messages in order to validate and relay transactions, but unlike bitcoin miners, who are rewarded for confirming transactions, node operators do not have any financial incentive.
