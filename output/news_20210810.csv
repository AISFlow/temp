The phrase refers to the run-up in the prices of altcoins after the price of bitcoin slows down. The altcoins usually see an uptick in their individual and collective market dominance, taking even more market share from the top cryptocurrency, bitcoin. As the coins become more valuable, their prices soar following the increased market share. An altcoin season usually sees most of the altcoins in the market rallying at the same time. With Ethereum&apos;s price mostly leading the charge once the prices start surging. Related Reading | Here&apos;s What Happens To All Of The Crypto Assets The IRS Seizes At this point, altcoin prices are no longer following the price of bitcoin as they usually do in the market.

Movement on the charts point to the possibility of this following the current bull rally. Bitcoin Market Dominance Continues To Decline Bitcoin has held a majority share of the market dominance for the longest time.

42397071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYa9a,1628633872,Changing Crypto Trading Patterns Reveal the Market's Power Shift to the West,"A recent blockchain analysis has pinpointed a dramatic shift in trading patterns this year from Asia to North America and Europe.      By analyzing trading activity on centralized exchanges from different days and time zones, blockchain data firm Kaiko found that on Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, the ratio between the volume of weekend and weekly BTC/USD trading doubled from March 2020. This finding showed that the average weekend bitcoin trading volume is growing relative to the average weekday volume on the three exchanges that are more popular among users in the West.      Meanwhile, as the chart below shows, the ratio of the BTC/USDT pair on crypto-to-cyrpto exchanges Binance, Huobi and OKEx has remained at around 1 in weekday and weekend volume over the past year. The three exchanges represent the power of retail investors in East Asia, especially in China.      On the derivatives market, Kaiko saw that, on an hourly basis, trading volume for bitcoin perpetual futures contracts on Binance and FTX, the two biggest derivatives exchanges, surged around 16:00 UTC. The peak trading time on the two exchanges overlaps between European and U.S. trading hours, suggesting that European Union and U.S. jurisdictions have become “extremely” significant for global crypto exchanges.      ""With China cracking down on crypto trading and businesses, a lot of the volume has shifted to North America in the last 12 months,” said Kevin Kang, founding principal of U.S.-based quant hedge fund BKCoin Capital.      Kaiko's report also show that while the crypto community has focused on the growing presence of institutional investors, it may have underestimated an increase in retail investors.      “This trend conflicts with bitcoin's institutional narrative as it supposes that retail participation is increasing,” Dessislava Aubert, research analyst at Kaiko, told CoinDesk.    TradFi playing a role    Kaiko's findings also highlight how investors from traditional finance may have played a role in changing trading behaviors, according to market observers.      Rising weekend trading volume could be partly attributed to automated trading tools that can move some trading activities to weekends, according to Kaiko. Traders who usually conduct large-volume transactions may choose to split their orders into smaller sizes over a longer period of time to “minimize the execution costs and price impact,” Kaiko said.      “As more traditional market makers and quant shops [are] coming into the [crypto] space, we see higher liquidity on weekends than we saw in the past,” Kang said.      Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk that the trading volume in the past weekend at LMAX Digital was up by 85% from the weekend before, as institutional investors tracked the hotly debated $28 billion tax reporting provision of the $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill.      “We’re definitely seeing institutional players taking advantage of the 24-7 access to markets,” Kruger said. “This means being able to react to developments as they’re happening as opposed to being stuck in a position and needing to wait for the market to open up on Monday.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/changing-crypto-trading-patterns-reveal-the-markets-power-shift-to-the-west,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1911abcff356da95160fe75c87193c5040121071-1200x640.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYaAZ,1628627635,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slips as Infrastructure Bill With Crypto Tax Provision Heads to House,"Bitcoin pulled back on Tuesday after a nearly 20% rise over the past week. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $45,000 at press time and is down 2% over the past 24 hours, compared with a nearly 1% loss in ether over the same period.      Analysts remain optimistic about bitcoin despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. regarding crypto tax rules.      “The crypto sector itself is new, and leaning on a nascent technology industry for taxes could impair its growth,” Lucia della Ventura, a researcher at Trinity College Dublin and legal compliance manager at financial software company Ledgermatic, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      “It is necessary to wait for the final vote, taking into account that several amendments have been tabled as they can potentially change the impact of the bill for companies,” Ventura wrote.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $45593, -1.37%  Ether (ETH) $3135.1, -0.33%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4436.8, +0.1%  Gold: $1728.6, -0.05%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.347%, compared with 1.319% on Monday    “Cryptocurrency traders are not so much focused on the expected passing of President Biden's infrastructure bill, which, as it stands, will include new tax-reporting rules that are very negative for the space,” Edward Moya, an analyst at online brokerage Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      In the meantime, “Wall Street is also closely watching bitcoin outperform the dollar and gold,” Moya wrote.      Also, on Tuesday, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Poly Network was attacked, with the alleged hacker draining roughly $600 million in crypto. The cyberattack contributed to a sour mood across the crypto market.    BTC and ETH options strategy    Bullish sentiment is rising in the options market for bitcoin and ether. “There's been a spike in demand for near-term options as BTC and ETH obliterated their multi-month price ranges,'' Delphi Digital tweeted. “Both assets seem to be in a strong uptrend, and speculators have been buying short-term options.”      The chart below shows the declining 25 delta skew for one-week BTC and ETH option contracts, which means there is more demand for calls than for puts.      Some traders see an opportunity to short BTC and ETH volatility given the recent activity in the options market. The chart below shows the recent rise in BTC three-month and six-month at-the-money volatility.      “We maintain our short volatility view. In fact, vega (longer dated puts and calls) looks like a good sell at these elevated levels,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.      QCP said that the frenzied buying of calls in both BTC and ETH across the volatility curve led to the short-squeeze rally. “We think this flow comes from funds and large speculators making large topside bets, buying BTC strikes up to $80K to $100k and ETH strikes up to $8K to $10K from as early as September 2021 out to June 2022,” QCP wrote.    Large bitcoin transactions    Bitcoin’s blockchain transaction volume with values of at least $1 million has risen 10% since the beginning of August and accounts for nearly 70% of the total value transferred.      These larger investors, as represented by large-value dollar transactions, fueled bitcoin’s nearly 20% price gains since last week, Glassnode said.      A number of analysts say the trend shows that these institutions are focusing more on the cryptocurrency’s upside than on potential obstacles, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen wrote.    Blockchain spending behavior    The ""spent output profit ratio,"" or SOPR, which is calculated by dividing the realized value of a spent output by the value at creation of the original unspent transaction output, has broken above 1.0, reached a local high, and then reset back to 1.0, after months trading below 1.0, according to Glassnode. The movement indicates ""a textbook bullish reversal,"" Glassnode said.      An SOPR value above 1 “implies that the coins moved that day are, on average, selling at a profit (price sold is greater than the price paid)"" and vice versa.      ​​“Most important to watch is whether SOPR holds above 1.0,” Glassnode wrote. “Should SOPR continue to trade higher, this reflects a bullish scenario where the market is adequately absorbing profits realized on spent coins. If, on the other hand, SOPR falls and trades back below 1.0 on a sustained basis, it would suggest a general weakness in the market and potentially a fake-out rally.”    Altcoin roundup  Poly network hacked with potential loss of $600M: As mentioned above, Poly Network was attacked on Tuesday, with the alleged hacker draining roughly $600 million in crypto, CoinDesk’s Eliza Gkritsi and Muyao Shen reported. Poly Network, a protocol launched by the founder of Chinese blockchain project Neo, operates on the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Tuesday’s attack struck each chain consecutively, with the Poly team identifying three addresses where stolen assets were transferred. At the time that Poly tweeted news of the attack, the three addresses collectively held more than $600 million in different cryptocurrencies, including USDC, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC, -1.88%), wrapped ether (ETH, -1.35%) and shiba inu (SHIB), blockchain scanning platforms show. After the hack, opportunistic cryptocurrency users flooded Ethereum’s blockchain explorer with pleas for even a tiny portion of the plunder.  Ether held on centralized exchanges hits three-year low: The proportion of ether held on centralized exchanges (CEXs) dropped to 9.4% of the total supply today, the lowest in three years, according to data from crypto intelligence platform OKLink. Out of the 117 million ether in circulation, only 11 million were held on addresses related to CEXs, OKLink data show. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The main factor for the outflow is DeFi, Eddie Wang, a senior researcher at OKLink, told CoinDesk. Wang pointed to wrapped ether (WETH) being the top address in the Ether Rich List, as well as deposits and liquidity pools of popular DeFi protocols to explain the outflow of ether from CEXs.  A16z Leads $111M Token Sale for Helium’s HNT: Helium’s ascent is being rewarded with a $111 million token sale led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Ribbit Capital, 10T Holdings, Alameda Research and Multicoin Capital also invested, the company said Tuesday. The decentralized telecommunications network now has more than 100,000 hotspots, a16z said in a blog post announcing the investment. The network uses ""LoRaWAN"" technology to connect devices (think scooters, e-bikes or environmental sensors) to the internet. Helium is one of the few “real-world” Web 3.0 projects tapping token-powered incentives to fuel growth.

Analysts had estimated the exchange would post $1.57 billion in transaction revenue.      The U.S.’ largest cryptocurrency exchange grew to 8.8 million monthly transacting users (MTUs) and 68 million total users in the quarter, versus analyst estimates for 6.7 million monthly users and 62.8 million total users. The exchange's take rate – or retail trading revenue divided by retail trading volumes – was 1.24%, up from 1.21% last quarter.      The company did note that MTUs in July had declined significantly to 6.3 million and trading volume was only $57 billion in the month. While August's numbers were slightly higher than this, Coinbase warned that MTUs and trading volume would be lower in Q3 compared to Q2.      The exchange also slightly lowered its yearly forecast range for active users, a key metric, from a range of 5.5 million to 9 million by the end of the year, to a range of 5.5 million to 8 million.      Coinbase reported that more than 9,000 financial institutions are now using the exchange to create their own crypto products. The exchange publicly named PNC Bank as a partner for the first time, and it also named Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla, Third Point LLC and WisdomTree Investments as partners.            For Q2, Coinbase reported:    Net income of $1.6 billion, including a tax benefit of $737 million mostly related to stock-based compensation awards tied to the company's direct listing in April. That's up from the first quarter's $771.5 million. It wasn't immediately clear if the figure was comparable to analysts' expectations for net income of $569 million.  Adjusted EBITDA of $1.12 billion, down slightly from last quarter's $1.15 billion.  Revenue of $2.2 billion, with $1.9 billion from transaction revenue and $103 million from subscriptions and services revenue. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.78 billion.  Retail transaction revenue of $1.8 billion, up 26% from Q1.  Institutional transaction revenue of $102.4 million, up 20% compared to Q1.  Custodial fee revenue of $31.7 million, a 35% increase from Q1.  Trading volume was $462 billion, up 72.5% from $335 billion in the previous quarter.  Total assets on Coinbase's platform decreased in value along with the decrease in the price of bitcoin: $180 billion compared to $223 billion in Q1.  Total operating expenses were $1.4 billion, led by $335 million in transaction expenses, $292 million in technology and development expenses and $248 million in general and administrative expenses. That compared to total operating expenses in Q1 of $813 million.  The firm added 450 employees, ending the quarter with a total of 2,176 employees.    Coinbase also noted that for the first time, ether was traded more than bitcoin on its platform in Q2, with 26% of trading volume denominated in ether, 24% in bitcoin and 50% in other crypto assets.      Shares of Coinbase initially rose after-hours on Tuesday following the release of the report, but were recently trading down 1% to $266.98. Coinbase shares are up about 7% from their reference price of $250, but down around 30% from their opening trading price of $381.      This is a developing story and will be updated.

42397067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYa7c,1628622676,Crypto Adoption in Middle East Will Come From Unstable Nations,"Although several Middle Eastern countries continue to restrict cryptocurrency trading and mining, digital transformation in the region has proceeded at a rapid rate.      From Dubai’s first-of-its-kind Bitcoin Fund listing to the Bank of Israel’s trial of a digital shekel, enthusiasm among authorities and citizens is spreading, even as certain governments remain openly hostile to bitcoin and other digital assets.    Nimrod Lehavi is the founder of Simplex and a board member of the Israeli Bitcoin Association.CoinDesk's Crypto State: Middle East virtual event is Aug. 11.    Despite the majority of blockchain startups choosing to set up shop in crypto-friendly territories such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the next wave of crypto adoption is likely to come from citizens in unstable autocracies, as well as those in countries suffering from crushing inflation – Iran and Lebanon to name but two.    Bitcoin blueprint    A template for wider adoption in such countries can be seen in Turkey, where around one in five citizens reportedly own or has owned cryptocurrency. Deputy Minister of Treasury and Finance Sakir Ercan Gul will unveil a fresh legal framework for digital assets in October, with a view to protecting retail investors and tackling money laundering.      The Turkish government’s stance on crypto hasn’t always been favorable: In May, a law came into force banning the use of digital assets for payment. Despite such heavy-handed interventions, crypto usage in the country has increased 11-fold in the last year, a consequence of the Turkish lira’s falling value against the dollar.      At present, the country has the fastest inflation in all of Europe and the 13th highest inflation rate on the planet. Little wonder Turks are escaping into stablecoins and deflationary assets like bitcoin, which allow them to retain their purchase power and transact on the international market.      Iran’s economic outlook is just as stark, with inflation running at over 40%. As the cost of everyday items (rice, meat, oil) skyrockets and pushes citizens into desperate poverty, U.S. sanctions have compounded the matter by hitting government coffers hard.      In this unforgiving milieu, a rampant crypto mining industry has unfathomably emerged because of low electricity prices and government support. Two years ago, Iran recognized bitcoin mining and established a licensing system that forced miners to pay a higher tariff for electricity consumption. Another caveat stipulated that miners must sell their mined bitcoins to the central bank. Amazingly, mining in the country now accounts for around 5% of all bitcoin mining worldwide.    Read more: Challenges of Dealing With Cryptocurrencies in Israel | Lior Yaffe    Following several blackouts earlier this year President Hassan Rouhani ordered all such operations to cease until Sept. 22.      Crackdowns in China, meanwhile, have compelled major miners to look at alternatives – with Iran likely to be high on the list, the current ban notwithstanding. While mining is a highly specialized endeavor, Iranians on the ground increasingly see cryptocurrency as both a hedge against the devaluation of the rial and a means of overcoming crippling international embargoes.    Oppressive rules    Although many crypto services remain off-limits to ordinary Iranians due to geo-blocking, the use of virtual private networks offers a gateway to a panoply of financial tools beyond the government’s purview, particularly those related to lending and borrowing. In addition to facilitating citizens’ escape from crushing inflation and crippling sanctions, cryptocurrency permits them to send and receive money faster and cheaper than ever before.      That is especially relevant in Lebanon because of the diaspora – up to 15 million Lebanese have fled the war-torn nation, leaving an economic crisis in their wake. A recent article in Arabian Business discussed how Lebanese citizens are starting to embrace cryptocurrency, with busy peer-to-peer (P2P) trade taking place over encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp. That is the logical outcome when the local currency is depressed and acquiring greenbacks is prohibitively expensive.      As we have seen from crypto adoption in Latin America, snuffing out interest in banking alternatives is an entirely futile mission – even in nations governed by autocratic leaders. While banks invariably bend to the will of strongmen, blocking withdrawals, freezing funds and closing accounts, decentralized cryptocurrencies cannot be appropriated by any oppressive state.      Although sanctions and know-your-customer rules make the process of purchasing crypto more difficult for people in the Middle East, they are increasingly finding a way to do so. Expect the UAE to continue leading the way from a government and regulatory standpoint; but away from the trading floors and showy skyscrapers, the next wave of users will be common people.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Nimrod Lehavi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/crypto-adoption-in-middle-east-will-come-from-unstable-nations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cbdd0533c25f1c8131f97fb5f1879beb2b7e62d-2400x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42397059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYZzk,1628619888,FTX Market Share in Bitcoin Futures Nearly Doubled Since June,"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX has overtaken competitors to become the second-largest exchange in the bitcoin futures market, behind only Binance, according to a report by Arcane Research.      From the end of June through now, FTX’s market share has grown from 9% to 16%.  FTX was founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, 29, in 2019. The exchange announced recently that its $900 million Series B funding round included more than 60 investors, including Paradigm, Ribbit Capital and Sequoia, and valued the company at $18 billion.  “The exchange has long been the second-largest futures market in the broad crypto sector, but their bitcoin futures have lagged behind OKEx, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and Bybit up until recently,” the report said.  Bybit’s bitcoin perpetual swap was the dominating futures instrument in April at around the time the cryptocurrency hit its $64,000 peak, according to the report.  “Paying attention to the Bybit OI (open interest) could be a viable indicator to gauge whether the sentiment is turning over exuberant in the future,” Arcane’s report said.  Global open interest recently surpassed $15 billion for the first time since May. Despite that climb, the market, in general, seems less over-leveraged given how the bitcoin denominated open interest sits at 330,000 BTC currently, according to the report.  “Both prior to the May 19th crash and the July 26th short squeeze, the bitcoin-denominated open interest sat at a far more substantial 400,000 BTC,"" Arcane said.

42397063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYa3g,1628619845,"BitMEX Announces $100M CFTC, FinCEN Settlement","Crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX announced Tuesday it had reached a settlement on civil charges with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).      BitMEX will pay a $100 million penalty to resolve the charges, the firm announced in a blog post, with $50 million going to the CFTC and the remainder to FinCEN. The blog post did not address the criminal charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and other executives.      A consent order in the CFTC case, filed Tuesday, found that BitMEX offered U.S. persons leveraged and unlicensed crypto products – a violation of federal law – between 2014 and 2020. The firm’s oversight systems were “inadequate” and lacked effective know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards, the document said.      In doing so, BitMEX employees violated the Bank Secrecy Act, commodities regulations and CFTC rules, the court found.      In a statement, CFTC Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle said crypto trading platforms must comply with U.S. laws if they're doing business in the nation.      ""This action highlights that the registration requirements and core consumer protections Congress established for our traditional derivatives market apply equally in the growing digital asset market,"" he said.      A FinCEN statement said BitMEX processed more than $200 million in transactions for darknet markets or mixing services.      ""BitMEX’s rapid growth into one of the largest futures commission merchants offering convertible virtual currency derivatives without a commensurate anti-money laundering program put the U.S. financial system at meaningful risk,"" Deputy Director AnnaLou Tirol said.    BitMEX bounceback?    As part of the settlement, BitMEX will refrain from offering futures or other types of crypto commodity contracts in the U.S. without registering with the CFTC, or operating a swap trading facility. The company is also required to ensure it has adequate KYC procedures moving forward.      “Settling Defendants shall cooperate with the Commission, including the Commission’s Division of Enforcement, in this action and in any current or future Commission civil litigation or administrative matter related to, or arising from, this action,” the consent order added.      BitMEX has also told the CFTC it no longer maintains any operations or business functions in the U.S. beyond certain cybersecurity functions.      The CFTC sued BitMEX in October 2020 on allegations it violated the Bank Secrecy Act and commodities laws, and sought a permanent injunction against the company.    Enforcement spillover    The case’s conclusion could spell added trouble for BitMEX’s embattled former CEO, Arthur Hayes. Hayes is at the center of a criminal probe the Department of Justice launched in unison with the CFTC action last year.      Court documents show the CFTC has agreed to share a trove of corporate records, witness interview memos and notes with federal prosecutors. It may also share a series of foreign regulatory documents from authorities in the Seychelles, Bermuda and Hong Kong, if their commodities counterparts sign off.      A spokesperson for Hayes and fellow co-founders Ben Delo and Sam Reed told CoinDesk that the three were not involved in the settlement.      “As their defense will show, from the company’s earliest days, the co-founders sought to comply with applicable law as it developed over time. The actions against Arthur, Ben, and Sam by the U.S. authorities are unfounded and represent an unwarranted overreach. The co-founders look forward to defending themselves in court,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

42397061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYa0j,1628618851,The Node: Crypto Gets Political,"The old saying was, crypto may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in crypto. Now, crypto is interested in politics, too.      Over the past few weeks, the blockchain industry has mobilized against a heavy-handed attempt at increased regulation. It was a show of force against a crypto tax provision in the Biden administration’s $1 trillion infrastructure package, a provision that fundamentally misunderstands and endangers the domestic cryptocurrency market. These efforts will likely have been in vain in the short-term, as the political machine bulldozes over attempts to amend the bill.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The experience seems like a turning point for crypto as a serious political force in Washington. Some of the industry’s most visible and respected voices – like Ryan Selkis, Meltem Demirors and Barry Silbert – are signaling their new political awareness and willingness to spend big supporting politicians who understand this emergent industry.      “Electoralism is going to become a fact of life for crypto now that it has become popular, even mainstream,” Paul Dylan-Ennis, an assistant professor in the College of Business at University College Dublin, said over Telegram. “We will see more and more serious political organizations” from now on.    Read more: Against the US Senate’s Heavy-Handed Crypto Provision | Editorial    There are calls to donate to the coffers of Washington insiders like Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), likely the first U.S. senator to own bitcoin, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime advocate for financial and digital privacy. The rumblings of new crypto PACs (political action committees) or parties. And a new meme, “I’m a single interest voter” for crypto.      It’s more than just political signaling on Twitter: As the Washington Post reports, cryptocurrency firms are on track to spend more than $5 million on lobbying this year, twice the total from just last year. Organizations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center have seen donations pour in.      The irony is radicalization in crypto once meant dropping out of the political process. By design, crypto empowers individuals over hegemonic corporations and states – it cuts out the middleman and bureaucrat. That’s why there was some resistance to even calling senators from some corners of the blockchain industry – any engagement with the State is anathema.      But if banks and big tech firms are willing to spend to protect their interests, then so should crypto.      “It's already risky and tricky enough to run validator nodes on emerging crypto networks without Uncle Sam getting involved and making up a whole new set of rules to try to follow,” Lauren G., a noted Ethereum coder, said. She would contribute to a crypto PAC when it comes time to vote, “especially if they take illiquid NFTs (non-fungible tokens).”      It’s entirely possible that politicians will run for office with an explicit crypto mandate. With 13% of Americans trading crypto in the last year and many more aligned with its values of freedom and self-reliance, the Crypto Vote is likely to become a political force that professional pols can't ignore.

42397053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYZrs,1628618700,Coinbase’s Second-Quarter Earnings Report: Here’s What You Need to Know,"Coinbase’s retail trading volumes reached record highs during bitcoin’s volatile second quarter, but Tuesday’s earnings report, due out at 4 p.m. ET, will reveal how much money the company made on that volume.      Coinbase’s take rate – or retail trading revenue divided by retail trading volumes – has been declining consistently over the past few quarters, according to Mizuho Securities’ Ryan Coyne. In Q1 2021, retail transactions yield was 1.21%, down from 1.41% in Q4 2020 and 1.46% in Q3.      Using publicly available data, Coyne estimated that total trading volume for Coinbase in Q2 was around $458 billion, a 36.7% increase from the $335 billion in total trading volume the company reported in Q1. Whether or not Coinbase’s stock (COIN) will react positively to the Q2 results this afternoon depends on how much money Coinbase earns on those volumes, Coyne said.      One factor driving down yield for the U.S.’ largest cryptocurrency exchange is the mix of Coinbase Pro retail users, who benefit from lower transaction fees compared to regular Coinbase retail users, Coyne noted. Another factor is larger transactions coming from bigger crypto traders, which would also drive down yields.      The company’s forecasts for monthly transacting users will also give investors a view into how the company expects to fare with the price of bitcoin stuck in the $30,000 to $35,000 range in June and July.      “We believe that [average daily trading] volumes in August are tracking well above July,” Coyne said. “If they hold or raise guidance, that will be viewed positively.” In the company’s first-quarter report, Coinbase raised its annual forecast range for monthly transacting users to 5.5 million to 9 million, up from its initial predicted range of 4 million to 7 million.    Read more: Coinbase Boosts Active User Forecast, Reports Q1 Results Inline With Preview    Any sign that Coinbase’s trading volumes are less dependent on bitcoin or that its sources of revenue are less reliant on trading volumes overall will be a positive signal to the market, said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. This could include an update on Coinbase’s acquisitions ofcrypto infrastructure firm Bison Trails (now called Coinbase Cloud), data analytics platform Skew or crypto data aggregator Zabo.      “All of these initiatives could help Coinbase expand their current revenue base,” Lau said. “Many people think they focus too much on trading revenue.”      The top line revenue numbers of the report will matter much more to the stock price than bottom line earnings numbers, DA Davidson’s Chris Brendler said.      “Because a lot of the tech companies like Square and PayPal want to invest as much [as possible] in the growth phase, if they have extra revenue they’ll spend it,” Brendler said.    Second-quarter estimates    While Coinbase’s stock is down on the day along with several other crypto stocks, Coyne, Lau and Brendler all expect today’s earnings to beat the consensus estimate. Coinbase shares are up about 8% from their reference price of $250, but down around 30% from their opening trading price of $381.      According to FactSet, the analyst consensus is 6.7 million monthly transacting users for Q2, a 600,000 increase from Q1 results. Analysts expect Coinbase to have as many as 62.8 million verified users on its platform, versus 56 million in the first quarter.      Analysts estimate that transaction revenue – where Coinbase makes the bulk of its money via trading fees – reached $1.57 billion from the $1.54 billion Coinbase recorded in the first quarter. Analysts expect total revenue to have hit $1.78 billion in Q2. With costs factored in, analysts expect to see net income of $569 million, much less than the $771 million that Coinbase generated in Q1.      Analysts actually expect total assets at Coinbase to have decreased from $10.2 billion to $9.7 billion in the second quarter, likely because of how low the price of bitcoin has dropped compared to earlier this year, Mizuho’s Coyne said.

Although Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies have been in a red market for months, ADA has displayed resilience staying well above its yearly open. At the time of writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $1.58 with profit across the board. In the daily and weekly charts, ADA records a 7.4% and 20.2% profit.

Legendary trader Peter Brandt has been keeping a close eye on ADA&apos;s performance and recently provided a bullish analysis. Previously, Brandt identified a potential Head and Shoulders pattern to support a bearish thesis but change his mind as ADA was able to hold the critical support at $1.25. Cardano must stay above this level in order to sustain the bullish momentum. Otherwise, it could re-test support below $1. Brandt said: New development in Cardano $ADAUSD The advance through the Jul 4 high goes a long way to negate the potential bearishness of the H&amp;S top in this crypto. In fact, this price action can be viewed as bullish as long as price remains above 1.25. This development has taken place after Brandt compared Cardano (ADA) with Litecoin (LTC) in 2018.

42376351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEU5,1628618400,How to Make American Voters Care About Crypto,"A crypto tax provision helped delay a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, putting a once-niche industry at the center of a national story. Some crypto advocates, however, are far from happy.      Because after days of twists, turns and competing amendments, the bill is moving forward with language that critics claim could drive crypto out of the United States.      The problem is that many Americans would likely respond to this with: So what?      While Crypto Twitter has been aflame with pleas to call your senators, much of the general public likely sees this drama (if it sees it at all) as a shady industry’s attempt to avoid taxation.    Emily Parker is a managing director at CoinDesk.    On Monday, a compromise to the infrastructure bill didn’t go through, leaving us with broad, controversial language that would likely make it difficult, if not impossible, for miners, software developers and decentralized exchanges to comply with U.S. tax regulations. The reason the compromise failed isn’t solely due to crypto’s shortcomings, but there is a much larger issue here. Crypto has a storytelling problem, and that is becoming a political problem.      This infrastructure bill is just the beginning. There are a lot of unanswered regulatory questions around crypto, which means that we will increasingly see the issue come up in Congress, which consists of elected officials. They must answer to their constituents, not to Crypto Twitter. And there isn’t a compelling enough narrative for many of these lawmakers to spend any political capital fighting for crypto.      To be fair, the efforts of the crypto lobby have been truly impressive, and a famously decentralized industry has been strikingly on message – with everyone from Jack Dorsey to Elon Musk chiming in. A handful of senators – namely Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) – have been leading the charge. Even if crypto advocates didn’t get what they wanted in the infrastructure bill, they seemed to make enough noise to compel some senators to reconsider the original bill.      But over the longer term, an active crypto lobby will not be enough. It is true that an increasing number of Americans are getting into crypto trading, but they are not yet a political force. The current arguments against the bill may make perfect sense to crypto advocates but are not compelling enough to convince mainstream voters. Protecting DeFi? Hardly anyone knows what that is. Keeping mining on U.S. shores? Okay, but to what end? Crypto is the future of “innovation""? Sounds nice but is still largely abstract, especially in a country that is reeling from the very concrete damage of a global coronavirus pandemic.      So what exactly does crypto have to offer the United States? Here are a few arguments that might be more convincing:      Jobs: Claiming crypto brings actual jobs to the U.S. is a powerful argument, and it’s already out there; but there’s not a lot of well-known data to support it. Where will those jobs come from, and how many are we talking about? Cities like Miami and states like Texas have been clamoring to attract crypto miners – they could be more proactive about offering projections of how many jobs that mining could bring. And if mining is not the main source of job creation, and it may not be, then focus on the concrete headcount of software developers, startups or other crypto-related businesses. Putting forth a data-based argument based on actual or potential job numbers would have a lot more urgency than vague claims about crypto being the industry of the future.      Privacy: Crypto advocates are making the argument that the bill would increase surveillance by making a wide range of “crypto brokers” report information on their users. But there is an even broader argument about privacy to be made. We are currently at a moment when the future of cash, the most private form of money, is under existential threat. In China, a pioneer in digital payments, cash is already largely irrelevant. Governments all over the world, 81 at last count, are exploring central bank digital currencies. There are benefits to CBDCs, but anonymity is not likely to be one of them.      This all just reinforces the urgency of crypto as a relatively private form of transaction. Even as we are likely to see more regulations focusing on know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, crypto like bitcoin allows for pseudonymous transactions. Many Americans, wary of government surveillance and concerned about data privacy, should be relatively receptive to the need for a more private form of money.      But privacy is not a synonym for criminality or tax evasion. The crypto industry still has a lot of work to do to convince people of this.      Freedom: Americans like freedom, or at least the idea of it, and crypto offers it to some degree. Crypto is money that can not be confiscated by a bank or government. Don’t like the decisions of the U.S. government or the policies of the Federal Reserve? Crypto can potentially protect your savings against inflation. It also gives you the freedom to accrue wealth outside of the stock market or assets like real estate that many can’t afford. On the most basic level, crypto is a new form of money that gives people more choices about how to save and invest.      Crypto has finally hit the mainstream.

42376349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEP3,1628617772,"With Crypto Tax Rules, Conservatives Chose Tax Cheats Over Free Enterprise","This morning, we woke to the grim news that attempts to repair a broken cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. Senate infrastructure bill have failed. The huge bill is now expected to pass the Senate today with language that could impose unworkable tax reporting requirements on non-brokers, including miners and software developers. There may still be a very narrow path to repair in the House or through reconciliation, but a major chance for redemption has passed.      The immediate cause for the revision’s failure was Sen. Richard Shelby, an 87-year-old Alabama Republican, who attempted to add defense funding to a proposed fix that required unanimous consent to pass. Shelby is a big ally of Wall Street, but his role here is arguably incidental – unanimous consent from the Senate was always a long shot. If Shelby hadn’t thrown a wrench in it, someone else probably would have.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    But in a broader sense, too, a plurality of blame for this mess falls on Republicans.      The crypto provision was rushed into the bill in its current misbegotten form in part because conservative activists and lawmakers rejected a prior revenue proposal: a $40 billion budget allotment to enhance enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service. This was projected to generate $140 billion in added tax revenue, for a net gain of $100 billion – more than three times the $28 billion projected to come from the crypto reporting rules.      Just like the crypto rules, this enforcement funding would have increased collection of taxes that are already on the books rather than create new ones. America has an annual “tax gap” – taxes that are estimated to be owed, but never paid – totaling more than half a trillion dollars. About 60% of that is thanks to people underreporting their income.      And, hey, who hasn’t done some unreported yardwork for cash, massaged a lunch receipt or two, or added a couple square feet to a home office? The problem is that the tax gap isn’t evenly distributed across income levels. American taxpayers on average under-report their income by 4 to 5%, according to a 2021 study conducted by the IRS and nonprofit group Equitable Growth. But better enforcement of taxes on just the top 1% of earners could increase U.S. annual tax revenue by $175 billion, according to the report – nearly one-third of the annual estimated tax gap.      That means nearly one out of every three dollars in unpaid taxes are dodged by just one American out of a hundred.      That’s largely because the wealthy and high earners have access to offshore tools, according to Equitable Growth – as many as one out of 15 members of the category use offshore instruments to avoid taxes. (In volume, by the way, that renders tax evasion via cryptocurrency little more than a footnote.)      The situation also skews enforcement efforts along class lines. Studies have found that IRS investigators are more likely to audit the poorest Americans than the wealthiest, and the IRS in 2019 explicitly admitted to Congress that this is because it is easier and cheaper. That makes sense: The offshore entities and other tax avoidance strategies used by the very wealthy are hard to detect, and are engineered by high-priced lawyers and accountants.      The agency has said for years it can increase enforcement on high-end tax evasion only if it receives more funding. To catch rich tax cheats, the IRS needs to be able to hire skilled, knowledgeable and highly paid lawyers and accountants.      Instead, over the last decade the agency’s budget has been cut by roughly 20% (which also slowed the distribution of pandemic relief). In the last eight years, according to a Syracuse University study, there has been a 72% drop in auditing of individuals earning more than $1 million per year.      By killing the added IRS funding in the infrastructure bill, then, conservatives effectively gave their blessing to mass tax evasion by the leaders and financiers of dozens of industries, from auto manufacturing to social media to pharmaceuticals.      Then, through Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), they filled the gap by squeezing crypto. The gravity of that choice is hard to overstate.      “Ultimately, the Senate failed the country today by passing un-amended ignorant and harmful legislation,” the nonprofit Fight for the Future said in a statement about yesterday’s events. “We must protect the software developers who are trying to create alternatives to the Big Tech companies that are destroying human rights and democracy.” Fight for the Future had helped organize opposition to the original language.      Of course, conservative opposition to taxation is itself deeply rooted in perfectly defensible small-government ideas. But it certainly feels like cheating to effectively block the enforcement of democratically imposed rules by refusing to pay the cops on the beat. Redirecting those cops from our society’s wealthiest to an emerging industry, furthermore, contradicts the fundamental premise of conservative resistance to taxation: That the private sector can create prosperity most effectively if it’s left alone.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42421057,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBPQr,1628613986,What We Know – and Don’t Know – About Stablecoins’ Dollar Backing,"An integral part of the cryptocurrency markets, stablecoins are huge and getting bigger; the combined market capitalization of all stablecoins was roughly $130 billion as of Oct. 22, a more than fourfold increase since the start of this year, according to CoinMarketCap.  In response to investor demands, major stablecoin issuers have been issuing monthly or quarterly attestation reports, where third-party auditing firms verify the information provided by the issuers. Different from audits, the firms don’t thoroughly inspect the accounts and identify risks in an attestation.  The information issuers choose to disclose, such as whether the dollar value of their reserves exceeds token supply, varies. So does the frequency of such reports.  The lack of standardization is not ideal for investors who use these disclosures to decide whether a stablecoin is safe relative to the alternatives, or for regulators who are increasingly voicing concern about the risks of these ersatz dollars.  “It makes comparison difficult,” said JP Koning, a CoinDesk columnist and former equity analyst. “If they're not disclosing comparable information, that attestation reports just aren't as useful.”  Below CoinDesk presents a consolidated guide to what we know, and don't know, about the collateral behind the largest stablecoins.  What is disclosed?  Many stablecoin issuers, such as Circle, Paxos and Gemini, started issuing attestation reports in 2018 and 2019. However, the most opaque stablecoin issuer, Tether, issued its first attestation report in March.  Two months later, Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office. Its largest competitors, Circle and Paxos, also disclosed the breakdown of their reserves afterward. On August 9, Tether released its latest attestation report, which included the composition of its reserves and more details about its commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs) holdings.  Most stablecoin issuers, including Circle, Paxos, Huobi and Gemini, release attestation reports every month. For TrueUSD, the attestation is released 24/7 – you can get a report whenever you want, showing the state of its U.S. dollar collateral up to the minute. On the other end of the spectrum, Tether said it would issue attestation reports on a quarterly basis.  Asset breakdowns  Tether  Roughly 49% of Tether’s $62.8 billion reserves are invested in commercial paper (CP) - typically short-term corporate debt – and certificates of deposit (CDs), out of which roughly 93% was rated A-2 and above, 5.5% at A-3 and 1.5% below A-3 as of June 30, according to the stablecoin issuer’s latest disclosure.  Other reserves included $6.28 billion in cash and bank deposits, or 10% of the total, $1 billion in reverse repo notes (1.6%) and $15.28 billion of U.S. Treasury bills (24.3%), according to the attestation.  The company also held $2.52 billion in secured loans (4%) and $4.83 billion of corporate bonds, funds and precious metals (7.7%). Tether said in the report that none of its secured loans were made to affiliated entities. Tether’s “other investments” including digital tokens were $2.05 billion, or 3.3%, of the reserves.  Since at least 2017, Tether has made a point of disclosing something few of its competitors do: how much its assets outweigh its liabilities, an indication – at least in theory – of its cushion against potential losses. According to its website, Tether’s net assets were $162.3 million since its total assets were $70.78 billion versus liabilities of $70.62 billion as of Oct. 27. Thus its equity was a razor-thin 0.2% of its total assets. For context, the Federal Reserve requires large U.S. banks to have their capital at 8%.  Circle  In May, Circle reported that about 61% of its USDC (+0.03%) tokens are backed by “cash and cash equivalents,” meaning cash and money market funds. In Circle’s latest attestation, published in September, the company said 92% of its tokens are backed by cash and cash equivalents, as of Aug. 31. (The company didn’t disclose what assets were counted as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents usually include bank accounts and short-term securities such as U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with maturities of three months or less.)  “Yankee Certificates of Deposit” – meaning CDs issued by foreign (non-U.S.) banks – comprise a further 5% down from 13% in August. U.S. Treasurys accounted for 12% back in May, but only 1% as of August. Commercial paper is 2% down from 9% in May and the remaining tokens are backed by municipal and corporate bonds.  Unlike Tether, Circle doesn't break out its assets and liabilities in a simple balance sheet. However, it shows its assets and liabilities exactly match, thus having no extra ""cushion.""  PAX and BUSD  Some 96% of Paxos's reserves were held in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, according to a blog post written by Dan Burstein, general counsel, and chief compliance officer of Paxos.  All of Paxos’s cash balances are held in U.S.-insured depository institutions, while all its cash equivalents are held in “U.S. Treasury bills with maturities of three months or less, or overnight repurchase agreements, overcollateralized by U.S. Treasury instruments.”  The other 4% of reserves are in U.S. Treasury bills but were categorized separately, since those Treasury bills are four months from maturity, all maturing in October 2021, according to Burstein’s post.  True USD  True USD offers 24/7 attestation reports – you can download the latest report from their website whenever you want and get a real-time snapshot. However, it is still worth looking at the composition of the reserves closely.  The company’s dollar balance is held at “federally insured U.S. depository institutions and a Hong Kong depository institution,” according to the attestation report, while the cash equivalents include “short-term, highly liquid investments of sufficient credit quality that are readily convertible to know amounts of cash.”  HUSD  The reserves backing HUSD are all held in cash in money market accounts in the United States, the token’s issuer, Stable Universal, told CoinDesk.  “The current asset composition does not contain ‘cash equivalents,'” such as “U.S. government Treasury bills, bank certificate of deposits, bankers’ acceptances, corporate commercial paper, and other money market instruments,” according to the company.  Gemini  According to Gemini’s latest attestation as of June 30, all the reserves are “held and maintained at State Street Bank and Trust Company and within a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, invested only in U.S. Treasury obligations.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | TUSD,"Frances Yue, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-stablecoins-dollar-backing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3399bc7e263bb781505e4a6206e2301f0ac2c362-1200x780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376345,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEMX,1628610756,US Senate Sends Infrastructure Bill to House,"The U.S. Senate passed its bipartisan infrastructure bill to the House of Representatives Tuesday after a 69-30 vote.      The bill, which dedicates $1 trillion to infrastructure improvements over the next 10 years including roughly $550 billion in new spending, drew controversy from the crypto community due to a “pay-for” that anticipates raising $28 billion from a broadened crypto tax provision.      The provision expands the definition of a “broker,” leading to concerns the Internal Revenue Service might seek to impose broker information reporting requirements on non-broker entities such as miners.      Advocates for the crypto industry pushed back on the provision, leading to lawmakers introducing amendments to try and modify the language. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) proposed explicitly defining which types of entities are brokers, while a competing amendment introduced by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) proposed a more narrow modification that only exempted proof-of-work miners.      Ultimately, no amendments were considered, and the Senate voted to discuss only the base bill late on Sunday night.      A last-ditch effort to add a compromise amendment was scuttled on Monday. Toomey, Lummis, Warner, Sinema and Portman proposed a new amendment that needed unanimous consent to pass under the Senate’s procedural rules.      Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) objected to the provision after his effort to add a military funding amendment was blocked by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).      The infrastructure bill will now go to the House of Representatives, which is expected to take up the issue in the autumn. The crypto provision faces bipartisan opposition there as well, with Representatives Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and Ted Budd (R-N.C.) all expressing an interest in modifying the language.

While they leverage the central Relay Chain to stay connected and secured, they benefit from Polkadot&apos;s other properties, such as its security, scalability, interoperability, and governance. The uses of parachains are multiple. Taking the advantage of Polkadot&apos;s cross-chain composability feature, any sort of data or asset can be sent between parachains. While it makes Parachains eligible to connect to external networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the property also exposes a parachain to a host of new cases and applications. These benefits are what make parachains the talk of the town. Becoming a parachain allows your project to operate without paying any fees, gas, or otherwise. You get unmatched access to the relay chain and can write transactions whenever you want. It gives parachains a striking edge over parathreads, which are essentially pay-as-you-go parachains. Kusama Parachain Auctions What is a Parachain auction? These are auctions held on the Polkadot relay chain. They determine which blockchain will connect to the parachain slot. Quite similar to the regular auctions we see in the world of mainstream physical transactions, here too, the teams bid on Kusama on Polkadot.

The 87,000-square-foot facility is located in Norcross, 33 miles from the company's current operation in Atlanta, CleanSpark announced Tuesday.  The acquisition will provide 20 megawatts of additional power, enough for the installation of 6,000 additional S19 mining machines. It is expected to produce over 650 PH/s. (PH/s stands for ""peta"" hashes per second, or one quadrillion hashes per second, a measure of the computational power of a mining machine.)  ""Based on current difficulty rates, this processing power would result in an additional five to six bitcoins per day,"" CEO Zack Bradford said. ""This, along with our other initiatives, is expected to result in 2.0 EH/s (exahashes per second, or one quintillion hashes per second) by the end of 2021, which, at current difficulty rates, would result in 17 to 18 bitcoins per day.""  CleanSpark said it expects the center to be fully operational by late 2021.  The facility is part of Georgia's Simple Solar program, which allows CleanSpark to offset any carbon-based energy included in its energy mix with solar power.

Other notable investors included venture capital firm Accomplice, Coinbase Ventures and White Star Capital.      Liquidity is a portfolio company of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company ConsenSys.      Liquality co-founder Simon Lapscher told CoinDesk the funding will be used to build out new functionalities and expand the concept of the wallet to a more developer-focused platform “so that developers can build integrations into the wallet and make it super powerful.”      “The idea is that we are creating this main interface to the decentralized economy,"" Lapscher added. ""As dapps evolve and wallet functionality evolves, our take is that all of the functionality will live inside the wallet and interact with different applications in a super easy and seamless way.”      Creating and building out products that work on different blockchains for customers to manage crypto assets is a burgeoning market as multiple blockchains emerge with usable applications. But as they do, users’ assets can become stranded on networks that don’t talk to each other. To date, porting tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to, say, the Solana blockchain has been difficult.

42376346,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AENn,1628604000,DeFi Has Accounted for Over 75% of Crypto Hacks in 2021,"Over three-quarters of crypto hacks this year have occurred in decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a study by crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace.    DeFi-related hacks made up 76% of major hack volume in the crypto arena this year as of the end of July, CipherTrace's ""Cryptocurrency Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Report"" concluded.  That works out at some $361 million, 2.7 times more than in 2020.  According to CipherTrace's report, DeFi-related fraud made up 54% of major crypto fraud, up from just 3% in 2020.  An attack today on DeFi platform Poly Network that may have drained $600 million is a notable example of this trend.  Crypto crime in general, however, is declining compared with previous years. It totaled $4.5 billion in 2019, $1.9 billion in 2020 and dropped to $681 million in the first seven months of 2021.  Another major finding of the the report concerns the implementation of the cryptocurrency ""travel rule."" The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body for preventing money laundering and terror financing, said not a single crypto service provider in any jurisdiction was fully compliant with the rule, which states that the sender and recipient of crypto funds must be properly identified.  CipherTrace released a tool in March designed to tackle fraud in this area by scanning addresses associated with incoming crypto transactions. Binance tapped CipherTrace's tool in July to aid its travel-rule compliance.

42376352,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEVL,1628603810,Cross-Chain DeFi Site Poly Network Hacked; Hundreds of Millions Potentially Lost,"Cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Poly Network was attacked on Tuesday, with the alleged hacker draining roughly $600 million in crypto.      Poly Network, a protocol launched by the founder of Chinese blockchain project Neo, operates on the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. Tuesday's attack struck each chain consecutively, with the Poly team identifying three addresses where stolen assets were transferred.      At the time that Poly tweeted news of the attack, the three addresses collectively held more than $600 million in different cryptocurrencies, including USDC, wrapped bitcoin, wrapped ether and shiba inu (SHIB), blockchain scanning platforms show.      ""We call on miners of affected blockchain and crypto exchanges to blacklist tokens coming from the above addresses,"" the Poly team tweeted.      The $600 million figure would place the Poly Network hack among the largest in crypto history.      Tether froze approximately $33 million in relation to the hack, Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted.      About one hour after Poly announced the hack on Twitter, the hacker tried to move assets including USDT through the Ethereum address into liquidity pool Curve.fi, records show. The transaction was rejected.      Meanwhile, close to $100 million has been moved out of the Binance Smart Chain address in the past 30 minutes and deposited into liquidity pool Ellipsis Finance.      The Poly team could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.      Poly Network was the second Chinese interoperability protocol to be featured on the government-backed Blockchain-based Service Network.    Anatomy of an exploit    BlockSec, a China-based blockchain security firm, said in an initial attack analysis report that the hack may be triggered by the leak of a private key that was used to sign the cross-chain message.      But it also added that another possible reason is a potential bug during Poly's signing process that may have been ""abused"" to sign the message.      According to another China-based blockchain security firm, Slowmist, the attackers’ original funds were in monero, a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, and were then exchanged for BNB, ETH, MATIC and a few other tokens.      The attackers then initiated the attacks on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon blockchains. The finding was supported by Slowmist’s partners, including China-based exchange Hoo.      “Based on the flows of the funds and multiple fingerprint information, it is likely a long-planned, organized, and well-prepared attack,” Slowmist wrote.      In a response to the attack, a spokesperson from Binance Smart Chain told CoinDesk that as a “decentralized” blockchain, protocols and users on BSC need to take security measures “extremely seriously.”      “We are aware of the Poly exploit that has affected Ethereum, Polygon and BSC users,” the spokesperson said. “Recently, several trustless bridges have become victims of such critical attacks and we recommend security audits and necessary due diligence prior to interacting with any projects.”      The spokesperson said BSC is currently working with its security partners to provide as much support as possible to the ongoing investigation.      The Poly Network incident shows how nascent cross-chain protocols are particularly vulnerable to attacks. In July, cross-chain liquidity protocol Thorchain suffered two exploits in two weeks. Rari Capital, another cross-chain DeFi protocol, was hit by an attack in May, losing funds worth nearly $11 million in ETH.      “As evidenced by all the exploits we’ve seen, cross-chain is a very hard area … with the added complexity of connections with every other chain and all their idiosyncrasies,” Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at blockchain data firm Messari, said.      UPDATE (Aug. 10, 14:30 UTC): Adds information about the wallet addresses and Tether's move.

42376360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEgf,1628602200,State of Crypto: What Just Happened in the US Senate?,"Well, the U.S. Senate’s going to pass its infrastructure bill today. Despite a week of negotiations, the language in the bill will be the broadest version possible. There’s a bit of regulatory whiplash going on.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Chaos in Congress  The narrative    And after all that, the bill the Senate will pass is the exact same version we saw a week ago.      Okay, if you’re a reader of this newsletter, you’ve probably kept up with what’s going on in D.C. I’ll throw some links below if you need to catch up but, in short, the Senate is going to vote on its $1 trillion infrastructure bill with the original crypto tax reporting provision that was introduced on Aug. 1. Two amendments and a Hail Mary effort were blocked for non-crypto reasons.    Why it matters    Congress definitely isn’t ignoring crypto anymore. The jury’s still out on what that means.    Breaking it down    So last week was a trip. At one point, a $1 trillion must-pass infrastructure bill was in limbo, in part due to crypto. And on Sunday night, after all the time and energy invested in changing the crypto reporting provision, we saw the Senate vote to just pass the bill as originally introduced a week prior, for reasons that had nothing to do with the crypto provision.      Less than a day later, we saw a last-minute effort to add a bipartisan compromise fail because a senator wanted to add a military spending amendment.      I wrote last week that the crypto provision in the infrastructure bill was a sign that Washington lawmakers believe crypto will be a permanent part of the U.S. financial or technological ecosystem. The past week’s worth of lobbying and action has largely just reinforced my observation.      We saw two different bipartisan groups of senators submit amendments to the original draft to narrow the scope of the term “broker” before these groups came together to offer a compromise that satisfied all involved lawmakers, the U.S. Treasury Department and industry groups.      A handful of news articles, such as in Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times and Vox, seemed to underscore this point      Based on my Twitter feed, we’re also likely to see more support for the lobbyists and think tanks, as well as more public outreach from the incredibly online group of crypto users and proponents.      Now, all eyes turn to the House of Representatives. There’s already bipartisan support for amending the bill, but the question is how. Any changes will need to be reconciled with the Senate version, meaning if there’s a substantial difference in the pay-fors, House lawmakers will have to find a way to fill that hole.      In the weeks to come I imagine we’ll learn more about what the House may do and what are the non-crypto considerations. But in the meantime, here’s a little refresher on how we got here:    July 28: Draft text of the infrastructure bill broadens the definition of a “broker” for crypto tax reporting purposes, explicitly including decentralized exchanges.  Aug. 1: The final draft text drops the “decentralized exchanges” portion but otherwise maintains a pretty broad definition of broker.  Aug. 3: Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who inserted the provision, defends it on Twitter.  Aug. 4: Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) propose an amendment exempting what they see as non-broker entities.  Aug. 5: Portman announces support for narrowing the provision before proposing a lesser exemption with Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) that would only exempt proof-of-work miners.  Aug. 6: The Washington Post reports that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been lobbying Wyden to drop his amendment.  Aug. 7: The Senate resumes consideration of the bill.  Aug. 7: Warner and Sinema update their proposed amendment to also add proof-of-stake node validators to the aforementioned proof-of-work miners.  Aug. 8: The Senate voted to advance the bill without considering any amendments. I’m told this is due in part to Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) objecting to an expedited timeline.  Aug. 9: Toomey, Portman, Sinema, Warner and Lummis find a compromise between the two competing amendments and seek unanimous consent to add it to the bill. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) objects, meaning the amendment isn’t adopted and we’re back to the base text that was introduced eight days ago.    More to come on this story.    Defining DeFi    A lot happened last week. SEC Chair Gary Gensler gave a speech on DeFi and the regulatory agency then brought two enforcement actions that seem to be the setup for more DeFi work.      This might actually be a bigger signal than what the Senate’s doing. The infrastructure bill, even if passed into law, won’t take effect for another year. The Securities and Exchange Commission is gearing up now in what sure looks like an effort to stake its claim to DeFi regulation.      So far, the two actions we’ve seen have been with centralized entities. On Friday, the SEC announced charges against DeFi Money Market, which doesn’t appear to actually be a decentralized anything but was still described as a “decentralized finance lender” in an SEC press release.      The release said the case was the “agency’s first involving securities using DeFi technology.”      Yesterday, the SEC settled with Poloniex, which was briefly a Circle subsidiary. Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, tweeted that it looks as if the SEC may be trying to build a precedent for more decentralized exchanges, as did Collins Belton, managing partner at Brookwood P.C.      In other words: There will absolutely be more cases, and in time those cases are going to move from centralized trading platforms masquerading as decentralized ones to ones that more closely resemble DEXs.      In a statement published alongside the Circle settlement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also noted that it’s still unclear just which cryptocurrencies on the exchange were securities, a key question for other exchanges operating in the U.S.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    The Biden administration is now considering Cornell University law professor Saule Omarova as a potential head for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is currently headed up by Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu, according to The New York Times. Moreover, Acting FinCEN head Michael Mosier has stepped down, and has been replaced by Himamauli “Him” Das.    Elsewhere:  Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks Quits, Cites ‘Strategic Differences’: Oh.  Ex-SEC Director Brett Redfearn Leaves Coinbase After 4 Months: Okay.  USDC Builder Circle Says It Wants to Become a National Crypto Bank: “The OCC has not received a charter application from Circle, agency spokesperson Stephanie Collins told CoinDesk via email.”  Outside CoinDesk:  (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) The IPCC, a United Nations group, has published a report finding that global climate change is inevitable over the next three decades. Nations can still take steps to try and mitigate how severe the impact is, but there will be a global 1.5° C rise in the coming decades, with all the side effects that will bring with it.

42376357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AEct,1628600400,Horizen Labs Raises $7M in Seed Funding Round,"Blockchain privacy firm Horizen Labs closed a $7 million seed funding round, the company disclosed Tuesday.      Kenetic Capital led the capital raise, which also included Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Liberty City, with each of the three contributing $2 million. (DCG is CoinDesk’s parent company.) Sound Ventures, Deribit, Artist Capital, Deus and LionTree also participated in the round.      New York-based Horizen said it would use the money to evolve its tools for developers and businesses to establish their own blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps). Toward that end, the company’s co-founder and CEO, Rob Viglione, told CoinDesk that he was looking “to double to triple” his current 25-person staff by adding at least 20 engineers in New York, expanding Horizen’s operations in Milan and opening a new office in Ukraine.      “At this point, our biggest bottleneck is talent,” Viglione said.      Horizen just released a decentralized, ""privacy preserving"" audit blockchain called zkAudit and counts crypto lender Celsius Network and blockchain-based supply chain platform Morpheus.Network among its early users.      Separately, Horizen is banking on its Zendoo scalability protocol, still in testnet, to increase usage of its technology. Viglione said the company plans to move Zendoo to mainnet by the end of October. “Having that protocol is a necessary precursor for us,” he said.      In a statement, Viglione said that ""the raise shows the faith being put into our company"" and that it would ""enable us to continue building out the tools and technology needed for fully programmable highly effective blockchains and decentralized applications.""      DCG and Liberty led Horizen’s $3.75 million seed funding round in 2019, the same year as Horizen’s founding. DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said in a statement that he had been “consistently impressed"" by the project's development. “Horizen’s novel sidechain technology lets partners and projects harness decentralization to tackle real-world use cases,” Silbert said, adding that DCG expected demand for Horizen’s ZEN token to grow.

These may include crypto ETFs listed in other jurisdictions, such as Canada.  The SEC has yet to approve a crypto ETF despite having received well over a dozen applications. Recent comments by Chair Gary Gensler have indicated that futures products may be considered.  The fund will not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly.  Investments will be made through a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary of VanEck and managed by Gregory Krenzer.

42376347,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AERZ,1628595000,DraftKings Charts NFT Long-Game With Marketplace Debut,"Sports betting site DraftKings is getting into the non-fungible token (NFT) game with an in-house NFT platform it unveiled Monday.      A collaboration with Tom Brady’s NFT side hustle, Autograph, the DraftKings Marketplace will begin “dropping” NFTs featuring the U.S. football Buccaneers quarterback on Wednesday. More athlete drops will closely follow, DraftKings said. The DraftKings-Autograph tie-up was first revealed last month.      The NFTs will be minted on an “eco-friendly Ethereum layer 2” that DraftKings declined to identify. The company said it recently acquired a Canadian NFT startup, Scarcity Labs, to assist in development. Representatives for that art-focused collective did not immediately comment. Brady’s Autograph appears to be built on Polygon.      The marketplace debut comes as the NFT craze roars back to life, sending deep-pocketed collectors and retail traders racing to trade billions of dollars of blockchain-registered images. Sports companies and athletes are also angling to get into the lucrative mix.      DraftKings is positioned to tap that energy with its 5.5 million-strong user base, said Joel Belfer, a former banking analyst for Guggenheim who writes about sports collectibles for industry newsletter Mint Condition.      “Offering NFTs on the same platform gives DraftKings an advantage: a large existing user base plugged into a platform they already trust, which can’t be overstated given how many new marketplaces are popping up,” he said.    Read more: Tom Brady’s NFT Platform Autograph Partners With Lionsgate and DraftKings    Turning that audience on to NFTs – and keeping them engaged – is a key focus of the marketplace rollout, according to DraftKings President Matt Kalish.      Part of the strategy comes through offering the audience layered, long-term products. Debut NFTs from the “preseason access collection” will give buyers an early go at future drops from athletes including hockey great Wayne Gretzky, tennis star Naomi Osaka and others.      “Whether someone is well-versed or barely familiar with digital collectibles, we envision DraftKings Marketplace being a premier platform for all within a trend that is decidedly here to stay,” Kalish said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/10/draftkings-charts-nft-long-game-with-marketplace-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48e1ad13e297af815437bbdff3322b33cc2bd759-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Out of the 117 million ether in circulation, only 11 million were held on addresses related to CEXs, OKLink data shows. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  That level is the least since February 2018, when about 9 million of 97 million ether were held in CEX addresses, according to OKLink data.  The main factor for the outflow is decentralized finance (DeFi), Eddie Wang, senior researcher at OKLink, told CoinDesk.  Wang pointed to wrapped ether (WETH) being the top address in the Ether Rich List, as well as deposits and liquidity pools of popular DeFi protocols to explain the outflow of ether from CEXs.  Wrapping ether is the process of converting it to ERC-20 tokens, which renders the digital asset easy to swap and transfer. Because of these features, WETH is a key driving force for DeFi.  WETH represents 5.7% of total ether in circulation, according to intelligence platform TokenView.  Ethereum 2.0 might be another factor, Wang said. More than 6.5 million ether are locked into 2.0 deposit contract addressing, according to Dune Analytics.  OKLink has built its own database of addresses, which are classified into categories like centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, miners and pools based on their behavior, Wang said.

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently changing hands for around $45,712 after peaking at $46,691 over the last 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. The price has continued to drive higher and is now up 59% from the July 21 low of $29,500.      “There seems to be a shift in the sentiment in the market compared to a few months back,"" Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36 told CoinDesk via email. ""We’ve recently seen some seemingly negative news coming out about Binance facing regulatory scrutiny that did not seem to influence the price a lot.""      Monday saw bitcoin break above the 200-day moving average, a long-term indicator of market health with price action being determined bearish below (red line) and bullish above. Tuesday's daily candle marks the first time bitcoin has closed above the long-term indicator since May 20.      Daily spot volume for August is also at its highest in over two weeks given the recent flurry of trading activity backed by strong demand.      ""There was buying pressure from Coinbase, and I think the demand was from institutional investors,"" said Ki Young Ju, CEO of the Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. He also noted that based on the ""Kimchi Premium"" and other on-chain indicators, retail investors were mostly absent from bitcoin's recent run.      And while negative news has slowed, tensions over the crypto tax provision in the U.S. infrastructure bill appear to remain high.
