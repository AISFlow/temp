Miners are flocking to take advantage of bitcoin's recent price surge. But they can only do so by deploying massive operations, as evidenced by all-time high network difficulty rates and recent rig acquisitions.  Once fully online in early 2021, the rigs will vault Riot Blockchain's hashrate – the computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin blocks – well above 1 exahash per second, according to a Monday press release.  Riot Blockchain says it will have 15,040 deployed rigs posting 1.45 exashashes per second and consuming 47 megawatts of energy once it installs the Antminers.  But that day won't come until next April at the earliest. Bitmain will begin delivering 2,000 S19 Pro Antminers per month starting in January 2021.  Riot is spending $17.7 million on the rigs. It's a bulk discount that Riot says comes in spite of bitcoin's rocketing valuation.

Meanwhile, high fees on Ethereum helped decentralized exchange Uniswap rake in $7 million over the past month.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $12,002 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 2.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,825-$12,412  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Read More: Bitcoin Mining Pools See Hashrate Drop Amid Rainstorms in China      After hitting a 2020 high Monday, bitcoin dipped to as low as $11,825 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase on Tuesday. Seychelles-based BitMEX saw plenty of action during this price rise and fall, as both long and short traders were wiped out in automatic liquidations, the crypto equivalent of a margin call. During Monday’s sharp price rise, BitMEX liquidated short traders by as much as $10 million in one hour. During Tuesday’s decline, long traders were wiped out at a rate of $6.7 million in an hour.      Many traders, including Andrew Tu of quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, see $12,000 as “resistance” or a price level that is tough to overcome but when it is, bitcoin can break to higher territory.      “Bitcoin finally broke its $12,000 resistance Monday,” said Tu. “Now it's on to $13,000 and $14,000 as resistance, assuming that we can hold above $12,000.”      Bitcoin’s price was just under $12,000 as of press time after the selling pressure earlier.      Michael Rabkin of Chicago-based trading firm DV Chain told CoinDesk both retail and institutional interests are fueling fresh bitcoin highs, and the asset is headed higher. “Bitcoin’s popularity is growing in the mainstream media and with traditional investment firms as the U.S. continues its stimulus,” he told CoinDesk.“Even though this can’t last forever there is no end in sight, so people are looking for alternatives"" to the U.S. dollar, Rabkin added.      Indeed, the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength relative to a basket of other currencies, is at an over-two-year low Tuesday as the coronavirus-inflicted global economy continues to cause problems for the American economy.      Every time bitcoin’s price moves higher over the remaining months of an uncertain 2020, there will be renewed investor interest in crypto, added Efficient Frontier’s Tu. “It’s all part of this current bull cycle we're in,” Tu said. “It's a positive feedback cycle in which double-digit rises cause more retail and professional investors to jump in, which begets further rises.”      Read More: Bitcoin Holding Sentiment Strongest in Nearly Two Years    Uniswap first in ETH fees    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday at around $424 and slipping 2.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

HOPR uses a token-incentivized mixnet solution, essentially doing the same for blockchain as Tor (the onion router) or a virtual private network (VPN) do on the internet. The mixnet node combines running an Ethereum node with next-level data privacy.  It’s the first hardware product released by a data privacy company in the blockchain space, the company said in a statement. (Other types of crypto firms have pursued similar hardware offerings, including Filecoin and Helium.)  HOPR is not the first company to use blockchain tokens to incentivize participants to enhance the privacy of a network, however. Competition in this area is currently ramping up with the likes of Orchid protocol, also based on Ethereum, seeing its token recently surge in value.  HOPR’s plug-and-play, blockchain-ready node is being sold at $440 with an 8GB RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.

42404959,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vly,1597776487,Binance-Owned WazirX Announces DeFi Project With Matic,"The Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX, one of the biggest in India, recently announced it is developing a decentralized finance (DeFi) product in partnership with Matic Network, a blockchain scalability platform.      “We are launching an automated market maker (AMM) protocol and partnering with Matic Network to launch the protocol”, the exchange, a subsidiary of Binance, said in a blog post on Saturday.      Automated market makers are algorithmic agents that make it easier to list and exchange cryptocurrencies without the help of an order book.      AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, which enable running of openly accessible, on-chain liquidity pools for different tokens, have witnessed staggering growth in trading volumes over the past few months.      “The DeFi movement has picked up globally and WazirX plans to make it easy for billions of Indians to participate in the DeFi ecosystem,” WazirX said.    Lowering the gas    The exchange, however, has opted for Matic instead of Ethereum’s network, which is currently dominating the DeFi space. “High gas costs [transaction fees] and scalability on Ethereum are definitely concerns that made us choose Matic, which offers high speed,” Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Indeed, costs of executing transactions on Ethereum’s blockchain are up over 3,000% on a year-to-date basis. More recently, the average transaction fee rose to five-year highs above $6.      Also read: Decentralized Finance Frenzy Drives Ethereum Transaction Fees to All-Time Highs      Fees are relatively low on Matic’s network. “Their Reddit proof-of-concept showed 3 million transactions at a cost of [a] mere $4 and the side chains have shown throughput of 7,200 transactions per second, which is very promising for the scale WazirX wants to achieve with its AMM-based DEX,” the exchange said in its blog post.      WazIrX, which was acquired by the global cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain ecosystem Binance last year, plans to launch the testnet of its AMM in September.      “The DeFi project is WazirX's initiative,” said Shetty, adding that “we are glad to have support from the Binance team. It's a huge advantage to be a part of the ecosystem.”      Also read: India May Be Starting Its Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Yet      Trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges serving Indian citizens have soared since the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on crypto transactions in March.

42404968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vtq,1597775451,Why the Decentralized Web's Development Is Unstoppable,"Steven McKie is a founding partner and managing director at Amentum Capital, developer on HandyMiner and HandyBrowser for Handshake and host of the BlockChannel podcast. A version of this article first appeared on Medium.      The time to home in on the “New Internet” is now.      The internet today is representative of society at large. We see growing angst as digital privacy is eroded by tech-giants that are held publicly accountable, but continue to profit lavishly off our innate lack of power online.      With concerns for the modern web at an all-time-high, it’s no surprise that much-anticipated, decentralized projects are starting to take off, seemingly just in the nick of time.      See also: Ben Goertzel – Decentralized Tech Will Be Ready for Humanity’s Next Crisis      In the last few years, we’ve seen an increasing amount of:    Censorship and access being restricted by tech giants and governments  Continued personal data leaks  Web de-anonymization with pseudo-anonymity requiring increasingly better technical expertise  User data stored in the centralized cloud  Users continuously socially experimented on in real time thanks to programmatic ad-buying and AI-assisted ad tailoring    We will get to a place where decentralized tooling can assist with all the above, but patience is the name of the game here. It does not come immediately; as a matter of fact, it can’t. The progression must come iteratively so as to ensure its sustainable, scalable and secure.      Our efforts at Amentum working on HandyBrowser and HandyMiner are an example of what added incentives can do for the rapid expansion of the decentralized web (DWeb). By working hands-on as developer advocates, product managers and traders within the community, we’ve seen Handshake reach product market fit, quickly.      These are the types of initiatives we will need to see more of collectively in the coming year to ensure the web we all know and love today will persist and is properly incentivized to sustain itself for generations to come. The tools being built today will be the stepping stones of tomorrow’s internet.      As we progress out of “Gen 1” of the DWeb, we’re entering new territory ripe with existing Layer 1 and 2 tech, while simultaneously entering a period of rapid advancement in web interoperability. Once “Gen 2” (happening now) is firmly established over the next year, we will see an explosion of decentralized experimentation that will surpass much of our progress the last decade, while pushing us squarely into the hands of the mainstream.      See also: Ready Layer One: Base Layer Protocols Team for Virtual Developer Event    What’s blocking us    There’s a slew of hard technical and networking problems to solve before the DWeb developer community can collectively build what's needed. Some developers struggle with receiving public funding to maintain the commons, while other projects will be unable to find sustainable monetization models.      Many developers feel the DWeb space is still maturing, and rightfully so. We can attest to running into many potential roadblocks while building HandyBrowser as a proof-of-concept (PoC). We built the browser, and quickly realized just how sparse it feels to traverse the decentralized web – a classic chicken before the egg problem.      This tech is complex, and most don’t understand how the traditional internet works (you’d be surprised how little people care when existing things just “work”). With big expectations around improved user privacy, data sovereignty and censorship resistance, the biggest hurdle developers face is the immaturity of these peer-to-peer protocols interoperating together. However, we do see a huge interest in developers learning about DNS, data storage, data privacy, their intricacies and how they can help.    The solutions to censorship resistance, lack of privacy and trust are right around the corner    As business models improve, and Ethereum, Filecoin, Handshake and others on-board new talent, tackling many of the problems consumers worry about on the web is just a matter of time and awaiting better composability – as demonstrated by Ethereum 1.0's maturity and expansion of new use cases.    A web of change    There is an interesting phenomenon with new low-level technologies focused on revitalizing existing industries: the ones built to be more generalized from the start will often fail to gain traction. It’s only those protocols that are app-specific that will find a niche to scale and then generalize overtime. The DWeb will be no different, despite its early monetization issues. Its innate generalizability allows rich experimentation (with public chain incentives), and when we get to that phase of its maturity, that’s when we will see the app cycle of decentralized apps be taken seriously.      See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare      Many DWeb speculators and developers are preparing by analyzing the protocols that will be most useful in their stacks. Once you find a setup that works, you will become more granular with your product offering and design, finally monetizing through differentiation and expanding network effects.      When Web1 and Web2 were emerging, we had to bear the brunt of the costs. Setting up infrastructure and scaling it for a fledgling internet ripe with growing creative and financial interests was the main priority. With the DWeb (previously referred to as “Web3”), we have to pay the cost of initially bootstrapping and normalizing these protocols, but those that make the effort will also capture the profits that follow without having to be value-extracting by pillaging user data and privacy.      If our thesis is correct, this is the cycle where many will reap returns larger than ever due to their platforms’ potential scale and reach, with overhead reduction as the core tenet of the decentralized web’s main mission.      It’s clear to us the DWeb narrative is reaching a major inflection point, and will follow the tailwinds of DeFi into the next cycle as we work to decentralize our protocols, back ends and front ends. The trust in the existing web is eroding faster by the day.      Although the solutions to censorship resistance, lack of privacy and trust are right around the corner, further experimentation and development of the DWeb meme is necessary before the final barriers to the New Internet are sprung open, inviting a new world of change and enlightenment online.

SpaceChain's International Space Station-hosted (ISS) hardware authorized a 0.0099 BTC (about $92 at the time) transfer initiated by Chief Technology Officer Jeff Garzik on June 26, the decentralization company disclosed Tuesday.  Developed by GomSpace and installed on the ISS on June 25, that hardware holds a private key needed to verify blockchain transactions via the ""multi-signature"" technique.  Data can only reach the ISS via the craft's encrypted ground station links. SpaceChain says this adds security and resilience to transaction authorizations.  Representatives did not immediately answer CoinDesk's questions as to why a transaction initiated on June 26 was only made public nearly two months later.

42404956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vj1,1597772269,"Bequant, Now in Crowded Prime Brokerage Race, Adds Signature Bank Integration","Ferrari sells cars so it can go racing; Bequant built a crypto exchange to get into prime brokerage.      That’s the analogy offered by the firm’s head of institutional services, Alex Mascioli, when asked about a new banking relationship with Signature’s blockchain-based payments platform, Signet, first revealed to CoinDesk this week.      Prime brokerage, Mascioli said, was always Bequant’s race to win.      Prime brokers are facilitators for financing and trading for deep-pocketed institutional investors. While the digital asset space doesn’t have a lot of prime broker options currently, several crypto firms including Coinbase, BitGo and Genesis Trading have announced in recent months their intent to build prime brokerage wings.      Bequant was building a prime brokerage service for crypto before it was cool, said CEO George Zarya.      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      “When we started building the prime brokerage product almost two years ago, nobody was doing it,” Zarya said. “There were a couple of players that called themselves prime brokers, but what they were doing was aggregating liquidity.”      To compete in a newly crowded market, Bequant’s connection to Signature Bank's Signet will allow the firm to more easily settle fiat for more clients. Bequant is also connected to the Silvergate Exchange Network, Globitrex Exchange and U.K.-based electronic money institution BCB Group, Zarya said.      “It’s an important transition between the legacy financial markets and the new digital markets,” he added.      The variety of banking and payments relationships allows Bequant to serve clients that use a variety of onramps to the U.S. dollar, because no U.S. bank has emerged as a clear leader in the digital asset space, Zarya said.      The firm now boasts a list of services that includes capital introduction, fund administration, securities lending, multi-exchange direct market access, custody, collateral management, leveraged trade execution, over-the-counter block trading, risk management and smart order routing.      According to Zarya, clients care most about easy access to spot and derivatives markets, lending, managing collateral across exchanges, having analytics on top of their portfolios and APIs that can let them connect to multiple exchanges at once. The products that cost the most for the firm to build were custody and collateral management, he added.    Investor access    Blockforce Capital CEO Eric Ervin said capital introduction is where prime brokers in traditional markets can stand out. (Ervin uses Tagomi as Blockforce’s prime broker.) In the traditional world, investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley connect clients to hedge funds, pension funds and endowments.      Bequant is connected to 11 sources of liquidity currently including HitBTC, Binance, OKex, Huobi, Bittrex, Bitifnex, Deribit and Bequant’s own exchange and plans to expand it’s exchange connections to a dozen by the end of the year. The other four sources of liquidity are unnamed OTC desks.      “These exchanges are venues that our team has one-on-one relationships with,” Mascioli said. “This isn’t as simple as dropping in APIs.”      Read more: Bequant Launches Crypto Prime Brokerage to Compete for Institutional Money      When Bequant launched its exchange two years ago, Zarya said he recognized there was a need for an institutional-grade exchange offering high-frequency trading services. Most exchanges are still built to serve primarily retail customers, he added, meaning their infrastructure struggles to keep up with high trading volumes.      “One of the issues that we’ve had with some of our exchanges is the rate per second allocation,” Zarya said. “If you trade a high-frequency trading strategy, you may want to opt into a higher rate-per-second allocation.” Bequant’s internal trading averages around 400 microseconds per trade, which is close to the London Stock Exchange’s 150 microseconds.      The firm is currently planning to raise a round of venture capital to beef up operating capital on its lending side.      “We’ve managed to build a great product by bootstrapping,” Zarya said. “Our exchange business turned profitable within the first 12 months. … It took us about $2.5 million to get it up and running.” Zarya expects the prime brokerage side of the business to be profitable within the next six months.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/18/bequant-now-in-crowded-prime-brokerage-race-adds-signature-bank-integration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ed58eef0df47a030ca56fc3927a4b0d26096d45-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trump in the White House in 2016.    Released Tuesday in redacted form, the final report added new details and accusations to U.S. authorities' broad-based belief that Russia used disinformation, hacking and tactical leaks to bolster then-candidate Trump's presidential bid.  But it also revealed the sometimes salacious role cryptocurrency played in helping the Russians execute their influence campaign.

42404963,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8vmx,1597767908,DeFi-Yield-Hunting Token YFI Explodes to $11K From $32 in One Month,"The governance token for yEarn.finance (YFI) has shot up over 32,000% since mid-July as investors have poured hundreds of millions into its protocol, which identifies and exploits some of the best opportunities in the white-hot decentralized finance (DeFi) space.    CoinGecko data shows YFI tokens shot up to nearly $11,250 on Tuesday before giving back some gains: they were just $32 when they started trading on July 18.  As the graph below shows, YFI soared past $1,000 the day after launching and was already worth $4,000 by the start of August.  Investors have poured hundreds of millions into yEarn since it launched mid-May. On July 18, the protocol had $9.3 million in total value locked; at press time there were over $600 million, according to DeFi Pulse.  After a relative lull, the token doubled from $5,500 on Sunday to over $11,000 earlier Tuesday before dropping over $1,500 to $9,800 as this article was going to press.  In yEarn, investors deposit digital assets into the protocol which identifies and executes various DeFi trading strategies, offering ROIs of up to 95% on their holdings – the platform taking 5% of total yield as fees.  As a governance token, users can stake YFI in order to determine the overall direction of the protocol along with other token holders.  Helping drive demand is the scarcity of the tokens. There are only 30,000 YFI tokens – a $300 million market cap – with the vast majority already circulating in the ecosystem.  yEarn founder Andre Cronje told CoinDesk the price rise likely came from a combination of scarcity and the fact traders were using YFI in some of the other DeFi protocols.  Many big holders, such as Framework Ventures, are now hoarding YFI tokens for the staking rewards – increasing supply pressures still further, he said.

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Flooded network Major Chinese bitcoin mining pools are each seeing daily hashrate drops of between 10% and 20% following continuous rainstorms in Sichuan. China’s southwestern Sichuan province, estimated to have over 50% of the Bitcoin network’s total computing power, has been hit by heavy rainstorms since last week. Data from BTC.com shows the world’s top four bitcoin mining pools – PoolIn, F2Pool, BTC.com and Antpool, all based in China – have each seen their hashrates drop between 10% and 20% over the last 24 hours.      Exchanging patterns Bitcoin exchange reserves have fallen to a 21-month low. Data shows the number of bitcoins held in exchange addresses fell by 0.83% to 2,610,278 BTC on Monday – the lowest level since Nov. 24, 2018. Some view this an indicator investors feel is bullish about the market. Investors tend to move digital assets from their wallets onto exchanges when they lose confidence in the current price movement, as happened during the Black Thursday sell-off, when bitcoin crashed by 40% and exchange balances surged by 2%. Bitcoin is now riding a 13-month high.      Is ETC OK? OKEx, the exchange with the highest trading volume of ethereum classic (ETC), is considering delisting the cryptocurrency after two recent 51% attacks drained $5.6 million from its coiffures. “Given ETC’s popularity and standing, we are not rushing into delisting… We also do not want to foot the bill for ETC’s security vulnerabilities that have made it particularly susceptible to attack(s),” said Jay Hao, chief executive of the exchange. It’s assumed the hacker used OKEx during the attacks because of its ETC liquidity. The exchange has since increased confirmation times for ETC trades.      Chipping away Investors suing chipmaker giant Nvidia for allegedly misreporting the size of its crypto mining-related revenue have complained the company is now trying to block key evidence from a former employee. The lawsuit, begun in 2018, alleges Nvidia downplayed the quantity of graphics cards sold to crypto miners. Shareholders have now told the court Nvidia's lawyers had gotten the former marketing executive to ""disavow"" several key statements. Plaintiffs allege the former employee has retracted the testimony out of fear of retaliation.      Crypto trusts Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) and Litecoin Trust (LTCN) crypto products are set to begin trading publicly on over-the-counter markets after receiving DTC eligibility Monday. The twin funds provide institutional and retail investors exposure to their namesake cryptocurrencies: bitcoin cash ($5.8 billion market cap) and litecoin ($4.3 billion market cap). The crypto trusts serve as a gateway for investors who lack the technical know-how or risk tolerance to hold coins themselves.

According to JPMorgan Chase’s Treasury trading desk, only 50% of pre-pandemic U.S. Treasury trades were carried out electronically. The figure has since increased to 70% in April and 77% in June. The trend is likely to continue, says JPMorgan.      In times past, trades would be executed by “picking up the phone to negotiate with a human trader” or standing on the trading floor, the FT reports. This is no longer feasible due to hygienic concerns.      Apart from cultural impediments, the bond market is resistant to digitization due to its sheer size. “In fact, there are only 43,000 stocks in the world, but there are millions of bonds, each with [its] own legal and financial idiosyncrasies,” the FT reported in 2018.      But is a human touch necessary to make sense of trading debts?      One of blockchain’s aims is to provide a sound foundation for the digital economy. To create unique and persistent digital representations of any asset or debt.      While still in its infancy, the blockchain bond industry has seen early success. Governments, nonprofits and corporations have all had successful trials or issuances using a blockchain. Most recently, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced plans to issue $6 million in debt.    Market intel    Peaked? Bitcoin (BTC) was flat after jumping on Monday to a new 2020 high above $12,400. Analysts are speculating whether the largest cryptocurrency can hold the higher ground. The latest move up came on high volume, and it was a “convincing break,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the crypto prime broker BeQuant, told CoinDesk. Monday’s high was just 11% off the 2019 peak of $13,880. This insight came from First Mover. You can subscribe here.    Tech pod    Second sleuth Elliptic has added Binance Chain and its native payments token BNB to its monitoring platform, becoming only the second blockchain analysis company to do so.

The SEC inked a deal with competing firm CipherTrace in July, specifically for its BNB tracing ability.

42432525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGjh,1597766613,"Dust Attacks Make a Mess in Bitcoin Wallets, but There Could Be a Fix","When dust settles in your home, you wipe it up. But what about when unwanted dust makes its way into your bitcoin wallet? Well, cleaning it up may not be so simple.      In Bitcoin parlance, “dust” is the technical term given to trace amounts of bitcoin that are considered too small to send in a transaction because the transaction fee would exceed the amount sent. Typically, dust is no more than a few hundred satoshis (a microunit of measurement for bitcoin).      Because sending dust is expensive relative to the transaction size, normal bitcoin users have no reason to transact with dust. But that doesn’t mean other entities, like bad actors or blockchain researchers, don’t have a use for it.    Letting the dust settle    Entities conducting blockchain analytics may use dust to deanonymize users and their wallet addresses. The idea is to create enough deterministic links between the analysis firm’s wallets and the recipient addresses. Once these links are created, the firm can run analysis using the data it collects to trace IP addresses to the recipient wallets.      “When the dust is consolidated with the user’s other funds, it helps with chain analytics by making it easier to cluster addresses,” Sergej Kotliar, the CEO of Bitrefill, told CoinDesk. If users don’t consolidate the unspent transactions (UTXOs), then they don’t need to worry about their anonymity. However, most wallets automatically consolidate UTXOs when a user creates a transaction, so this can be tough to navigate around unless you are choosing which UTXOs to spend manually.      CoinDesk reached out to Chainalysis and CipherTrace to ask if they use dust in their analytics. Both companies denied using this technique, though Chainalysis Manager of Investigation Justin Maile added that dusting is “more often [used] by investigators” to trace illicit funds. Maile continued that exchanges may use dusting to trace stolen funds following a hack.      Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?      Dave Jevans, the CEO of blockchain analytics company CipherTrace, told CoinDesk that “hackers may use dusting as a strategy for identifying individuals who can then be phished or extorted.”      The threat of anonymity aside, consolidating these UTXOs would mean spending more in fees than the dust is worth. The resulting dilemma then becomes: leave the too-piddling-to-spend UTXOs to clutter the wallet or consolidate them and thus compromise privacy. (It’s not uncommon for users to have their wallets dusted more than once by the same entity, leading to significant clutter. Phil Geiger, the director of marketing at Unchained Capital, for instance, told CoinDesk he has “had addresses dusted repeatedly.”)      Some wallets, like Samourai and Bitcoin Core, let you freeze UTXOs, which would bar them from being consolidated in a new transaction. But Kotliar emphasized that most average users will not know how to navigate this feature.    Raising dust limits?    To mitigate the impact dust has on the network, Kotliar has suggested raising the dust limit as designated by the Bitcoin Core wallet. Currently, most wallets are designed to cap transactions at 546 sats (0.00000546 BTC, or roughly 7 cents).      “Blocking these would be censorship, but maybe raising the dust limit makes sense,” Kotliar said, adding that his proposal “is a way to raise the topic and have other people weigh in on it.”      If this limit were raised, then it would be more expensive to execute a dusting attack. But, of course, this comes at the detriment of honest users spending small sums. If bitcoin were to go up in price dramatically, then the dust limit would have to be recalibrated so as to not price out smaller accounts from sending transactions.      Read more: To Beat Online Censorship, We Need Anonymous Payments    “If the destructive action is cheaper than a constructive one, then we should fix it. In Bitcoin, we don’t have a way of censoring things we don’t like, but we can change these defaults to make it more expensive.”Sergej Kotliar    Another fix, proposed some time ago by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, involves wrangling dust UTXOs and spending them in a CoinJoin transaction to preserve privacy. In a back and forth on Twitter discussing Todd’s “dust-b-gone” proposal, a representative for Samourai indicated the privacy wallet is seriously considering adding such a feature in the future.    The dust piles up    There’s no guarantee that raising the dust limit would clean this problem up for good.      “I'm not sure that raising the dust limit would prevent this,” Ergo, a pseudonymous analyst for OXT Research, told CoinDesk, though it would “certainly [be] a deterrent.”      Blockchain analysts, for example, may still be willing to stomach the premium to send dust if the limit is raised, especially if they have high-dollar contracts with government agencies.      Still, it may deter some bad actors from wasting block space on trivial transactions. Bitcoin’s blockchain keeps a record of every transaction ever executed on the network, and there’s only so much space per block to accommodate new transactions; dust, then, causes unnecessary bloat on Bitcoin’s transaction ledger because blockspace that may have been used to accommodate legitimate, larger transactions is instead devoted to transactions worth pennies.      Read more: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government      And the pennies (or satoshis) add up. In the most recent dusting attack to hit the Bitcoin network, for instance, Ergo has traced some 84,000 dust outputs from 146 transactions to an entity that appears to be advertising an obscure Bitcoin SV messaging application. Each transaction includes a message directing users to the application. (Kotliar noted, “This does not appear to be a malicious attack.”)      The apparent advertising campaign has cost the BSVers roughly 1.147 BTC, according to the most recent figures produced by Ergo, and the attackers have spent three times more on fees than the dust itself. Ergo told CoinDesk that this round of dusting began on Aug. 4 and has been “fairly consistent.”      Jensen mentioned that promotional dustings like this are not uncommon. At the end of 2018, for instance, 100,000 addresses were dusted as a way to advertise the now-defunct mixing service Bestmixer.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/18/dust-attacks-make-a-mess-in-bitcoin-wallets-but-there-could-be-a-fix,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b265c76621ea35380559d1f7cf32754acbdeaec9-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGdh,1597765222,The OCC's Crypto Custody Letter Was Years in the Making,"A federal banking regulator’s decision to let banks provide crypto custody services may have seemed out of the blue, but the agency has been looking at cryptocurrencies for years.      The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced last month that federally regulated banks could provide services to crypto startups in addition to custody. It turns out the OCC was already leaning toward the move before Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks took the top job at the agency.      Indeed, the OCC has been examining the cryptocurrency space since at least 2018 and likely longer, said Jonathan Gould, senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel. He told CoinDesk that the very act of writing an interpretive letter typically takes months.      “Before we actually put pen to paper that process can sometimes take a while,” he said.      Read more: Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says      The OCC’s interpretative letter last month opened the door for banks to provide services to crypto companies in addition to custody services for cryptocurrencies directly, but it’s unlikely that banks will immediately start providing either service.      Rather, these letters are supposed to help banks that are also interested in crypto determine whether it makes sense for them to begin getting involved in the space, Gould said.      Banks still need to ensure they have proper risk management practices and otherwise ensure they are prepared legally to offer these services before they can actually do so.    Iterative process    The process of creating an interpretive letter typically begins when a bank makes a request, or the OCC sees a number of similar requests from different institutions.      The actual act of drafting interpretive letters can take weeks or months, Gould said.      “A lot of times we just provide informal advice, meaning advice about what we think is okay, and when we do [we do] so without putting anything in writing,” he said. “But sometimes we put things into these interpretive letter forms so again it's a function of kind of the nature of the issue.”      The OCC looks at how many banks are asking about a specific issue or whether the regulatory agency itself thinks there might be a commonly held question, with these factors determining whether there will be an informal response or a formal letter.      Read more: ‘Inherently Borderless’: Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      “The kind of process to actually write an interpretive letter like this one, that doesn't necessarily take a huge amount of time,” he said. “But kind of thinking through the legal and other issues associated with an issue that can take a lot longer depending upon the complexity of the issue.”      The letter is just the beginning of a longer process. The OCC will interact with banks on their next steps if they do decide to pursue crypto services.      “There are a whole host of legal, regulatory and supervisory expectations that we have,” he said. “Especially with new activities that involve kind of iterative and interactive dialogue with the OCC supervisors, about how XYZ activity can be done in a safe and sound fashion, whatever risks are associated when activity can be appropriately kind of managed and so forth.”      The OCC has published more than 1,100 letters it believes are precedential or otherwise of interest to the general public.    Longer term    Gould did not say how long the OCC had been looking at last month’s interpretive letter on crypto services specifically, but reiterated that it could take the agency weeks or months to draft a 10-page letter.      The OCC has been considering the legal and supervisory questions around crypto for years, he said, prior to Brooks joining the agency from his previous role at Coinbase. But Brooks has been able to bring specific knowledge about the crypto space to the agency.      “It is certainly the case, however, that because we have an Acting Comptroller who is exceptionally knowledgeable about these areas that has been hugely beneficial in terms of the agency's thinking and understanding,” Gould said.      Read more: Following OCC Letter, Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services      Banks that are now interested in branching out into crypto should reach out to their local OCC supervisors if they have additional questions, and Gould said he hopes institutions that are looking at crypto reach out sooner than later.      “This is and will continue to be a learning process for us from a supervisory perspective and so we really need that engagement and welcome it on our end,” Gould said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/18/the-occs-crypto-custody-letter-was-years-in-the-making,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/661c454184768c6f37aa4f45213ad0701af70398-1280x627.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts are now speculating whether the largest cryptocurrency can hold the higher ground. The latest move up came on high volume, and it was a ""convincing break,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the crypto prime broker BeQuant, told CoinDesk. Monday's high was just 11% off the 2019 peak of $13,880.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Elsewhere, prices for the recently-and-strangely-launched Curve DAO token slid 26% on Monday, even as total value locked into the affiliated Curve Finance protocol rose above the $1 billion mark. That's a five-fold increase over the past week, in the latest episode of this year's frenzy in decentralized finance, or DeFi.          Market moves    Suddenly, It's Not Just Bitcoiners Who Think the Dollar's Going Down      By Bradley Keoun      As the news broke in recent days that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had bought shares in a gold miner, commentators immediately began to wonder if the billionaire investor might be betting against the U.S. economy or the dollar.      Bitcoin analysts and investors wondered why it took him so long, given the trillions of dollars of money pumped into the financial system this year by the Federal Reserve to help fund the ballooning U.S. national debt.      ""The money printer working overtime is obviously causing Buffett and his board grave concern,"" Mati Greenspan, of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday. ""While Buffett is perhaps not so sure how to react to a world that no longer values bonds and government debt, others are sure.""      There's a growing sense among members of the cryptocurrency community that their longstanding assessment of the traditional financial system as unsustainable is finally gaining traction among Wall Street experts and mainstream investors. If the concerns spread, it might buoy prices for bitcoin, which many digital-asset investors view as an inflation hedge similar to gold.      Goldman Sachs, which in May of this year panned bitcoin as ""not a suitable investment,"" hired a new head of digital assets earlier this month and acknowledged rising interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional clients. The firm warned in July that the U.S. dollar was at risk of losing its status as the world's reserve currency.      Dick Bove, a five-decade Wall Street analyst who now works for the brokerage firm Odeon, wrote last week in a report that the U.S. dollar-ruled financial system could come to an end amid challenges from a possible multi-currency system, which include digital currencies.      ""The case for bitcoin as an inflationary hedge and sound investment is being articulated with crystal clarity by influential people outside of our crypto bubble,"" the digital-asset analysis firm Messari wrote last week. Buffett didn't return a call for comment.    Dollar dominance on the wane?    Whether or not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the answer, there's little on the horizon that might turn investors away from the gnawing sense that U.S. finances are becoming more precarious.      Goldman Sachs economists predicted in an Aug. 14 report that the Federal Reserve will pump $800 billion more into financial markets by the end of this year, followed by another $1.3 trillion in 2021.      According to Bank of America, there's a risk investors might shift their ""portfolio allocation out of U.S. dollar assets"" to position for the ""erosion of the hegemony of the dollar as a reserve currency.""      ""A constitutional crisis is one dynamic that could potentially accelerate the process of de-dollarization,"" they wrote, noting that November's presidential election might be ""fiercely divisive"" and ""contested.""      According to the bank, a recent survey of fixed-income money managers showed nearly half of respondents expect foreign central banks to decrease their reserve holdings of dollars and dollar-denominated assets over the next year.      It may not sound outlandish to bitcoin bulls.    Bitcoin watch    By Omkar Godbole      Bitcoin rose 3.2% on Monday to about $12,300, confirming an ascending triangle breakout on the daily chart.      The pattern resumes the uptrend from July lows under $9,000. The focus now is on resistance at $13,200 (July 2019 high) and $13,800 (June 2019 high).      ""The market is looking at the 2019 high, and that’s the level to watch,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat.      The on-chain data is supportive of continued gain in bitcoin. For instance, the balance of coins held on cryptocurrency exchanges sank to 21-month lows on Monday, indicating a strong holding sentiment in the investor community.      The bullish momentum looks strong as the cryptocurrency's recent gains have been accompanied by increased miner supply. According to crypto data company ByteTree's miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, miners have run down inventory by selling more than what they mined over the past five weeks. In other words, buyers have been able to absorb extra miner supply.      From a technical analysis perspective, the bullish bias would be invalidated if prices dropped back below $12,000 on Tuesday.    Token watch    OMG (OMG) gets boost from blockchain backup: Rising congestion on the Ethereum blockchain is spurring interest in crypto projects that might speed traffic on the network. Prices for OMG, the token for the OMG network – a “layer-2” scaling solution for Ethereum transactions – rose by more than 70% over the past weekend, according to data source CoinGecko. It reached as high as $3.30 earlier on Monday and then quickly fell below $3. The OMG network uses a protocol called Plasma to scale up Ethereum transactions. Market participants are looking for OMG to “spreadhead layer-2 solutions,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital asset firm BeQuant.      Orchid Protocol (OXT) takes off even though it's not a DeFi token: Prices for Orchid, the native token to a blockchain project that enables private internet browsing from Orchid Labs, hit an all-time high at $0.84 over the past weekend, up fivefold from a March low, according to CoinGecko. Barstool Sports’ David Portnoy, who claimed to have at least $1 million worth of bitcoin after meeting last week with the Winklevoss twins of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted earlier Monday that he has invested in OXT. “I’m now in on the shitcoin $oxt,” Portnoy wrote on Twitter, with a hashtag of “#pump.” The Orchid project previously raised $43 million for its token sale, as reported by CoinDesk. Its major investors included big names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchain Capital.      Ethereum Classic (ETC) facing delisting? The Malta-based OKEx said it may consider delisting Ethereum Classic from trading on its exchanges after it lost approximately $5.6 million of ETC from two recent 51% attacks. It won’t be an easy decision to make, Chief Executive Officer Jay Hao told CoinDesk, considering that OKEx has the highest trading volume of ETC among crypto exchanges. The impact of the two attacks on ETC’s prices, however, have not been significant: ETC’s price was still at around $7 on Monday, little changed from the week before the attacks first took place on Aug. 1.      - Muyao Shen    Analogs    The Federal Reserve is propping up the junk-bond market.

42432531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNaGth,1597751347,Bitcoin Holding Sentiment Strongest in Nearly Two Years,"Bitcoin exchange reserves have fallen to a 21-month low, a possible sign investors are feeling bullish about the shape of the market.    Glassnode data shows the number of bitcoins held in exchange addresses fell by 0.83% to 2,610,278 BTC on Monday, the lowest level since Nov. 24, 2018.  Investors tend to move digital assets from their wallets and onto exchanges when they lose confidence in the current price movement so they can easily sell them.  In the days leading up to the Black Thursday sell-off, when bitcoin crashed by 40%, exchange balances surged by 2% to a high of 2,947,555 BTC.  But bitcoin has since surged to a 13-month high of $12,400 on Monday and is currently up 200% from the $3,867 low it fell to five months ago.  As such, exchange balances are down 1.4% over the past week, and nearly 3% in the last month. Balances were down more than 11% from the March 13 high at press time.  The price rises come despite bitcoin looking increasingly overbought on the weekly chart relative strength index (RSI) – an indicator that helps traders recognize the signs of overbought and oversold markets.  eToro analyst Simon Peters told CoinDesk: “Lower BTC spot exchange balance indicates a current holding mentality among investors, I see this as being pretty bullish.""

Binance's Beirut Relief Fund campaign has committed $20,000 in donations to the victims of a devastating explosion that claimed the lives of over 150 people and injured 5,000 more.  Binance will donate $10,000 directly to Beirut victims with a further dollar-per-dollar amount in crypto matched for each donation it receives, up to a total of $10,000.  According to a company blog post on Tuesday, Binance Charity lead Helen Hai said the organization would ""work closely with local partners to help improve conditions and livelihoods.""  On Aug. 4, 2,750 metric tonnes of a highly explosive chemical used in agricultural fertilizers exploded, wreaking havoc and displacing some 300,000 people.  Immediately following the blast, a group of Lebanese expats residing in Europe quickly mobilized to raise relief funds with crypto.

China's southwestern Sichuan province, a mountainous region that is estimated to have over 50% of the Bitcoin network's total computing power, has been hit by heavy rainstorms since last week, which peaked over the last two days.      The heavy rainstorms have caused electricity outages in parts of the region as hydro-plants stop generating power to help discharge the floods. Some counties are also experiencing telecommunication and internet breakdowns, said Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of PoolIn.      As result, impacted bitcoin mining farms in the region are forced to unplug from the network for the time being. It's not clear when the situation will prove as the rainstorms are still ongoing.      Data from BTC.com shows the world's top four bitcoin mining pools – PoolIn, F2Pool, BTC.com and Antpool, all based in China – have each seen their hashrates drop between 10% and 20% over the last 24 hours. The computing power connected to these four pools accounts for around 50% of the Bitcoin network's total.      Pan said in a Weibo post Tuesday China time that in addition to mining farms being forced to unplug due to electricity and internet disruptions, some have also proactively paused operations ahead of time and evacuated their on-site staff for safety precautions.      According to the Xinhua News Agency, the accumulated rain volume in a dozen most-impacted cities in Sichuan between Aug. 10-15 alone has already surpassed the average August monthly volume in any year's record.      Further, one major highway that leads to Sichuan's mountain area, where most of the mining farms are located, is shut down due to severe floods and mudslides.      Meanwhile, bitcoin's last three-day and one-day average hashrate has dropped to around 123 and 110 exahashes per second (EH/s), respectively. These numbers are down over 3% and 10%, respectively, from the seven-day rolling average around 127 EH/s, which is still at an all-time high.
