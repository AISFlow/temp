42430480,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuwFh,1557180948,Pieter Wuille Unveils Two Proposals for Upcoming Bitcoin Privacy Soft Fork,"Prolific bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille unveiled two Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) today that offer plans that could prove foundational to a possible upgrade to the cryptocurrency.  The two proposals, announced on the bitcoin developer email list, describe Taproot, a code change designed to increase bitcoin's privacy. Taproot is expected to be bundled together with an upgrade called Schnorr in a soft fork that developers have been looking into for some time, paving the way for privacy and scalability improvements to bitcoin.  Developers have long been thinking about how to arrange this particular upgrade. There have been a number of proposed changes to bitcoin over the years and, as they are all related, it makes sense to implement them together. That includes Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), adding, improved bitcoin smart contracts, Schnorr signatures, which adds another way to sign bitcoin transactions, and Taproot, which adds even better privacy.  This pair of Taproot proposals, available on Github,https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-taproot.mediawiki is one more signal the pieces for such a transition are finally starting to come together.  It's important that these technical details are now public because more developers in the community can look at them and see if they agree with the changes. If the community agrees these changes are the right ones to make, then the change could finally go live after being put together over several years.  Notably, some think this will be less controversial than bitcoin's last soft fork activating Segregated Witness (SegWit). Bitcoin cash developers, those who split off from bitcoin because they didn't agree with the code change, actually really like Schnorr. In fact, they are implementing similar technology in a little over a week.  For a bit more detail, Wuille's first BIP describes a ""new SegWit version 1 output type, with spending rules based on Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Merkle branches.""  The BIP primarily describes the timing and methodology to be used for this next upgrade and will include the popular Taproot and Schnorr upgrades to be rolled out while ""not adding any new strong security assumptions and ""not combining into the proposal any functionality which could be simply implemented independently,"" wrote Wuille.  While the secondhttps://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-tapscript.mediawiki describes ""the semantics of the initial scripting system under bip-taproot.""  Wuille added in his email announcing the BIPs that while proposal includes Schnorr, MAST, and Taproot, one other much-anticipated feature will probably not make it in this time around:  ""While many other ideas exist, not everything is incorporated. This includes several ideas that can be implemented separately without loss of effectiveness. One such idea is a way to integrate SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which we're working on as an independent proposal.""

42430469,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvrh,1557177901,Gupta Out at ConsenSys Ventures in Shake-Up at Ethereum Startup,"ConsenSys is restructuring as it seeks to raise $200 million.  The ethereum-centric conglomerate’s ConsenSys Ventures arm, originally founded in September 2017 with a $50 million war chest from founder Joseph Lubin, is now being combined with other sectors of the ConsenSys “mesh,” including the Tachyon startup accelerator and ConsenSys Labs.  Related to the move, Kavita Gupta, the head of ConsenSys Ventures, stepped down today, as was first reported by The Block.  “All the investment activities are lining up together, which is great,” Gupta told CoinDesk Monday. “I will remain on the board of some of the existing companies and help.”  In an all-staff email reviewed by CoinDesk, Gupta said she would soon start teaching at Stanford.  ""I will be spending a lot of time at Stanford University for next two years building Distributed Trust Initiative, a platform to form an open dialogue and research on distributed trusted identity and distributed systems,"" she wrote.  To be clear, most of what people know today as ConsenSys was technically a part of ConsenSys Labs. Shawn Cheng, the managing partner of ConsenSys Labs, told CoinDesk the most widely used infrastructure providers in the ethereum space, including Infura and MetaMask, are considered part of the Labs “startup incubator.”  Other ConsenSys departments focus primarily on enterprise and government contracts as well as partnerships with external companies, Cheng said.  With the news of Gupta’s departure and the merging of ConsenSys Ventures, all the investment sectors of Lubin’s conglomerate will now operate under the guidance of Cheng’s team.  “We’ve been playing air-traffic control,” Cheng said, describing how talent would move across the company to work with various teams. “We’ve kind of been talking about this for maybe six months now.”  According to a new press releasehttps://content.consensys.net/wp-content/uploads/2019050_-ConsenSys-investment-press-release.pdf, ConsenSys has invested in 21 companies so far in 2019, including the Israeli startup StarkWare and the Truffle Blockchain Group, which was recently spun out of ConsenSys as a standalone company.  “We want to level up, put even more skin in the game and help actually build the products,” Cheng said. “It’s less about zero-sum and more about pie growth right now.”  Cheng declined to say which venture partners, beyond Lubin himself, have already agreed to fund ConsenSys going forward. However, Cheng said the future will emphasize a “global” focus.  “We also want to provide flexibility with how people think about investments and liquidity pools,” Cheng added.

42430467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvph,1557174914,Judge Asks NYAG to Narrow Scope of 'Amorphous' Bitfinex Document Request,"A New York judge has ordered crypto exchange Bitfinex to turn over documents pertaining to the exchange's alleged cover-up of an $850 million loss and a subsequent loan from stablecoin issuer Tether – but not immediately.  New York Supreme Court judge Joel M. Cohen said during a Monday afternoon hearing that the preliminary injunction secured by the New York Attorney General's office (NYAG) at the end of April should remain in effect, at least in part, though he took issue with the scope.  Attorneys for both plaintiff NYAG and respondents Bitfinex and Tether have a week to hammer out either a joint or individual proposals for what the scope of the injunction should be, which the judge will rule on.  Cohen said:  ""What I would suggest you both do is meet and talk about it, you seem like a reasonable group, in let’s say a week either with a single or proposed revision that accomplishes what we’re trying to accomplish here, and if you can't, with individual proposals.""  That being said, he added that he thinks ""the preliminary injunction that we have right now is vague, open-ended and not sufficiently tailored to precisely what the AG has shown will cause imminent harm. I think it’s both amorphous and endless.""  As such, while he denied the motion with respect to vacating, staying or modifying the order in terms of discovery and denied the motion with respect to vacating or staying the injunction in its entirety, he granted the motion to modify the ""substantive and temporal scope of the injunction.""  The injunction in question was filed on April 25, when the NYAG's office revealed that the exchange had borrowed nearly $1 billion from Tether's reserves after losing access to $850 million held by a payment processor, Crypto Capital (it was later revealed by federal prosecutors that Crypto Capital's operators had been indicted for bank fraud, and its bank accounts were frozen).  Under the terms of the injunction, Bitfinex and Tether were compelled to turn over all documents about these funding maneuvers, as well as immediately cease any further borrowing.  Attorneys for Bitfinex and Tether filed to either vacate or modify the preliminary injunction last week, saying that Bitfinex not being able to access Tether's funds is harmful to both the exchange and to the broader crypto market (a claim they repeated in another filing Sunday).  For their part, NYAG attorneys said that the injunction is ""narrow,"" and would not have a significant impact on either Bitfinex or Tether's operations.  Jurisdictional questions  Left open Monday was the question of whether USDT, the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issued by Tether, qualifies as a security, the outcome of which could also help determine whether the NYAG's office has jurisdiction.  Cohen said ""the question of whether these are securities, ... is a threshold question that the respondents [mentioned]. I know they are traded, but whether [they qualify] is [another matter].""  Under the Martin Act, the NYAG's office can regulate securities and commodities, or the venues where securities and commodities are traded, said David Miller, an attorney for Bitfinex. However, he said USDT does not fulfill at least two prongs of the Howey Test, the decades-old Supreme Court case often used to determine whether an instrument is a security or not.  Specifically, there is no common enterprise, and there is no expectation of profit from those who purchase USDT, Miller said, adding:  ""We have no fiduciary responsibility or otherwise with respect to tether customers.""  And speaking more broadly to Bitfinex and Tether's response to the NYAG, Cohen took a minute to acknowledge Tether's note that banks do not typically hold 100 percent of the funds their customers claim, saying, ""I recognize the point that banks don’t have all of the dollars available at a moment’s notice. I also recognize that you’re not banks, you’re not heavily regulated.""  John Castellanos, a lawyer with the New York Attorney General's office, argued that his office should have jurisdiction because New York residents can purchase or trade USDT through the Poloniex platform (and previously through Bittrex) in secondary market sales.  Moreover, he added, ""We have enough information to know, and we have every reason to believe, that the Martin Act has been violated.""  Miller said Tether shouldn't be responsible for secondary market sales, and that Poloniex did not promise USDT was backed 1-to-1.  However, Cohen noted that the NYAG's office still needs to investigate the broader securities question, saying, “As a law enforcement agency it doesn’t seem really out of bounds to just probe whether an otherwise unregulated business involves securities which are subject to the Martin Act.""  Miller also repeatedly noted that Bitfinex promptly disclosed to the NYAG's office that its funds had been seized.  The timeline for when the preliminary injunction would lift was not clarified just yet. Cohen noted that there are a number of issues to consider when picking a date for when the injunction would expire, including how long the NYAG's investigation would last for, as well as how much discovery there is.

42430472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuw3h,1557167403,DUST Adds Physical Products to the Blockchain,"A new blockchain-powered startup led by three physical scientists promises to paint the world in diamond dust.  DUST Identity's service, known as DUST Ledger, allows users to enroll all manner of physical objects onto a blockchain, the founders claim. The system uses a product called the Diamond Unclonable Security Tag (DUST), a coating that uniquely identifies an object when it's placed under a scanner. The coating is tagged to the specific object, be it a shipping container or transistor, allowing users to track the product's provenance around the world, DUST Identity says.  The team announced Monday that it is now part of the SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain, allowing that service's enterprise users to paint their objects and enroll them on the ledger at will. Plans start at $3,600 a month for users who want to try the tech.  The company previously raised $2.3 million from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and also got cash from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, for its work in logistics and tracking.  One of the co-founders, Ophir Gaathon, has a deep background in diamond materials and received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Columbia University. His partners, MIT professor>Dirk Englund, and MIT Ph.D. Jonathan Hodges, have backgrounds in quantum photonics and optical system design, respectively.  Initially, they joined forces to figure out how to use diamonds in quantum computers.  ""It was clear that there are several very interesting applications that can be greatly impacted by the use of diamonds,"" said Gaathon. ""However, we realized that, for any commercial application, there are three fundamental things that we need to tackle first: know how to make and nanoengineer diamonds at scale, how develop the hardware technology that can 'talk' to our diamonds, and how to build an intuitive software interface platform that will enable any user to extract value from our diamonds.""  For the third part, DUST turned to the blockchain – specifically, a private one built using the Hyperledger Fabric platform.  ""We started to look at the security threats facing supply chains – specifically how electronic parts that can jeopardize defense platforms and critical assets,"" said Gaathon. ""We found that, in many cases, the issue (and cause of friction) is that the parts or the data about the parts (or both) are difficult or impossible to identify, link, and trust. Trusted physical identity was simply missing. So we decided to build it. And that's how DUST was born.""  DUST competes with other, more-established products like near-field communication (NFC) tags and other nano-coatings. But if the blockchain lives up to its promises, perhaps in the near future diamonds will be a logistician's best friend.

42430464,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvjh,1557156633,Bitfinex: NYAG's Order Is Hurting Our Customers and the Crypto Market,"Bitfinex's customers might suffer if it can't access a line of credit from stablecoin issuer Tether, the exchange's attorneys argued Sunday.  In a new filing, attorneys Jason Weinstein and Charles Michael of Steptoe and Johnson, and David Miller and Zoe Phillips of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, outlined a number of arguments for why a preliminary injunction secured by the New York Attorney General at the end of April should be canceled or modified.  Among them, the lawyers claimed the injunction would harm the startups' customers, and in turn the market as a whole. They wrote:  ""The balance of equities strongly favors Bitfinex and Tether, because a preliminary injunction would not protect anyone but would instead cause great disruption to Bitfinex and Tether — ultimately to the detriment of market participants on whose behalf the Attorney General purports to be acting.""  Since the injunction's filing, Bitfinex's customers have withdrawn 30,000 bitcoin and 1 million ether at least, indicating that it had a ""significant"" impact on the exchange, the filing said. Already, the market capitalization of ""dozens of cryptocurrencies"" lost $10 billion within an hour after the order came out on April 24.  The impact on USDT, the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issued by Tether, has been much smaller, as ""Tethers still trade at par to this day, despite this proceeding,"" the filing states.  Stepping back, the preliminary injunction, filed under a New York state law called the Martin Act, requires Bitfinex and Tether to turn over every document pertaining to a $625 million transfer and a subsequent $900 million line of credit Tether extended to Bitfinex after the latter lost access to $850 million held by its payment processor, Crypto Capital.  The injunction also prevents Bitfinex from further drawing on the line of credit from Tether (prior to the injunction, the exchange had drawn down $700 million).  Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to both Bitfinex and Tether – which share key personnel and ownership – wrote in a filing last week that the agreements were made to protect the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, as ""Tether, and holders of tether, have a keen interest in ensuring that one of the dominant trading platforms of tethers has sufficient liquidity for normal operations.""  For its part, the NYAG's office says that the preliminary injunction doesn't prevent Bitfinex or Tether from conducting operations, and it needs greater clarity around the ""core issues in this case,"" referring to allegations that Bitfinex and Tether misled clients.  The first public hearing in the case will take place this afternoon in Manhattan.  'Other useful purpose'  The preliminary injunction is also broader than the NYAG lets on, the companies' attorneys claimed.  While the NYAG's initial response said its injunction was ""narrow"" in scope and only prevented Bitfinex and Tether from tapping the latter's reserves, Tether's attorneys say this has a far-reaching impact.  For one thing, Bitfinex ""needs the 'liquidity for normal operations,'"" the filing claims. The exchange previously indicated that it was using Tether's funds to process its own customers' withdrawals.  Perhaps more notably, the filing indicated that Tether's reserves might be allocated to other uses, saying:  ""This means that Tether must hold its $2.1 billion cash (and equivalent) reserves as is, without deploying those funds for any investment or other useful purpose, for the indefinite future.""  It is unclear what other purposes Tether's reserves might be used for. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.  The filing also states that ""the Attorney General is attempting to dictate how two private companies may deal with one another, and deploy their funds,"" though as has been pointed out in the past, the same individual – Giancarlo Devasini, who is Bitfinex's CFO and a director at Tether – signed both companies' agreements.  No fraud  Bitfinex and Tether's attorneys also argue that the NYAG's office does not have legal standing, as no fraud occurred.  ""The Attorney General faults Bitfinex and Tether for (i) having 'failed to disclose the loss of over $850 million' in connection with the Crypto Capital deposits, and of (ii) engaging in an 'undisclosed, conflicted' transaction that their customers 'would find material,'"" the filing says, adding:  ""Neither of these amounts to fraud.""  Moreover, Bitfinex and Tether's attorneys claim that the Martin Act only covers fraudulent conduct as it relates to securities or commodities, but the NYAG's office has not proven that tethers qualify as either.  ""Rather than meaningfully addressing this basic problem of the Attorney General's jurisdiction, the Attorney General states in a footnote that this is a 'fact-intensive question' better left until another day, citing no evidence to support how tethers fall within the Martin Act,"" the filing says.  Scott Andersen  , a securities attorney who previously worked for the NYAG's office, told CoinDesk that ""what the [NYAG]'s office wants to establish is that there are New Yorkers who could be hurt by [the startups' actions.]""  ""New York wants to show that New York has a very real interest to protect New Yorkers, [and] unless the respondents can prove that New York doesn't have jurisdiction, they have to produce the records,"" he said.

42430482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvth,1557151803,FCC Eyes Blockchain to Better Manage Scarce Wireless Spectrums,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could one day use blockchain to monitor and manage wireless spectrums to support the growing requirements of the internet of things (IoT).  With Juniper Research predicting that there will be 50 billion connected IoT devices and sensors by 2022, the agency is keen to find a way to manage the required radio frequencies more efficiently and transparently.  As reported by Computerworld on Monday, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel told MIT Technology Review's Business of Blockchain conference last week that a future world with such numbers of IoT devices will need a ""real-time market"" instead of today's ""clunky"" licensing system.  She added:  ""We have this registry from all of these licenses, but on a day-to-day basis we don't actually know with great clarity what's being used and what's not being used. So if you put this on a public blockchain you'd have this record of where demand is for what airwaves.""  Currently, spectrums are auctioned off one at a time in a process that is slow, complex to manage and expensive, according to the commissioner. Spectrums are also in short supply, with one option being to share them, with the FCC managing the rights to use different bands at different levels of priority. One idea touted in recent years is to build a market place that would issue permissions dynamically using AI, according to Computerworld.  If that can be achieved, said Rosenworcel, it would bring in new efficiencies and move the system from one of scarcity to one that can manage relative abundance.  The agency is currently investigating how blockchain tech could help that aim as a ""thought experiment,"" she said, adding that the FCC has been speaking about the issue on Capitol Hill and to tech firms.  However, blockchain is only one of the options being looked at by the watchdog, with traditional databases also being tested for the purpose. Rosenworcel indicated that a blockchain system might still be five-10 years off, and may not be required at all.  Still, according to the article, she said that the tech might help other nations, which will also have to manage growing demands on their wireless frequencies and may have no agency to manage them.  ""The power of making those airways work for connectivity is something that can change economies, it can change agriculture, it can change healthcare,"" she said.

42381821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqp5,1557147614,Foam Turns to Token Grants to Build Out Decentralized Mapping Platform,"Foam is accomplishing what few token issuers have: A consistently engaged community that actually uses its token beyond speculation.  Following a $16.5 million token sale in 2018, the geolocation data startup has launched a token-curated registry (TCR) with about 140 monthly participants in April and a scavenger hunt that garnered 500 user contributions to its open source map.  Foam takes the same type of data used by services like Google Maps and adds features for distributed storage and “proof of location” to make the data more reliable. This can be crucial for supply chain management and public services such as police and fire departments, whose tools malfunction when faulty data or connection issues disrupt network flows.  Starting today, CEO Ryan John King tells CoinDesk that Foam will also offer token grants worth up to $15,000, depending on the proposal, for developers to contribute to the mapping and data collection system. He said roughly 3 million tokens, or 10 percent of the total token supply, was set aside to fund community initiatives such as grants.  “We’re now seeing a lot more community-led initiatives and tools,” King said. “It’s open source and the stakeholders are going to be the ones driving it going forward.”  For example, supply chain management expert Coleman Moore recently organized and led the first Foam Community Proposal call. Moore told CoinDesk the call had roughly 20 participants and he is already planning a followup call. He said that in his profession companies rely on proprietary services or volunteer radio beckons for data. So he believes an open source tool with economic incentives to keep the data clean, via the TCR, offers an attractive alternative.  “On top of [incentives], Foam uses a blockchain, which really adds value because if you can imagine a world where everything is connected to the internet you don’t want that to be controlled by a centralized network server,” Moore said.  Highlighting Moore’s point about incentives, Microsoft engineer Cody Born collected Microsoft Azure tools to support the Foam scavenger hunt, which rewarded people for verifying location data with a custom non-fungible token (NFT) of the buildings they added to the map. Born himself won several NFTs through one of the online scavenger hunts.  “I liked that scavenger hunt so much because it combined a lot of my interests – which are blockchain, TCRs, incentivization and collecting things,” Born told CoinDesk. “That motivated me to get more engaged in the Foam community and participate in the various forums.”  Indeed, the Foam token price has remained unusually stable throughout 2019, close to $0.03 each, because holders who love maps and puzzles are using the token to vote on the quality of data or contribute to the map, rarely trading it.  Even though supply chain expert Moore admitted Foam is an ambitious project that will require continued community engagement in order for this open source mapping ecosystem to work, he optimistically concluded:  “It kind of combines cartography with gaming and finance.”  Foam co-founders image courtesy of the company (left to right: Ryan King, Katya Zavyalova and Kristoffer Joseffson)",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/06/foam-turns-to-token-grants-to-build-out-decentralized-mapping-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/883df963c8e6f88c5111abd7ef49f968bb008371-1200x651.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The suspects - ""23-year-old resident of Kleve, Germany, a 31-year-old resident of Wurzburg, Germany, and a 29-year-old resident of Stuttgart, Germany"" - ran the Wall Street Market (WSM), a dark web market akin to Silk Road.  The best part? They scammed their customers with a good, old-fashioned exit scam.  For nearly three years, WSM allegedly was operated on the dark web by the three men who now face charges in both the United States and Germany. An “exit scam” was allegedly conducted last month when the WSM administrators took all of the virtual currency held in marketplace escrow and user accounts – believed by investigators to be approximately $11 million – and then diverted the money to their own accounts. Exit scams are common among large darknet marketplaces, which typically hold money in escrow while a vendor delivers illicit goods.  The suspects are charged with ""conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, and distribution and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances."" Another man, Marcos Paulo De Oliveira-Annibale, 29, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, is suspected of being a moderator of the WSM.  “We continue to keep pace with sophisticated actors on the dark web by increasing our technical abilities and working even more closely with our international law enforcement partners,” said United States Attorney Nick Hanna. “While they lurk in the deepest corners of the internet, this case shows that we can hunt down these criminals wherever they hide.”  Police image by David von Diemar on Unsplash",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/05/06/crypto-crime-blotter-scammers-dupe-jersey-island-man-out-of-12-million-backpage-laundered-cash-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31cd73d4e568633d1a282baa964349c7cf07d023-2560x1848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Bloomberg report on Monday, citing “a person familiar with the matter,” said that Fidelity will roll out the service for trading bitcoin “within a few weeks"" and will focus on institutional, not retail, customers.  Fidelity spokeswoman Arlene Roberts told Bloomberg:  “We currently have a select set of clients we’re supporting on our platform. We will continue to roll out our services over the coming weeks and months based on our clients’ needs, jurisdictions, and other factors. Currently, our service offering is focused on Bitcoin.”  Just last week, Fidelity published a survey saying that institutional investors are increasingly open to adding digital assets in their portfolios. Around 22 percent of investors already have some exposure to digital assets, while 40 percent said they are open to taking the plunge in the next five years.  Having over $7 trillion assets under management, Fidelity also launched cryptocurrency custody service earlier this year. The giant recently hired a former head of digital assets project from investment bank Barclays.  An increasing number of traditional financial institutions are looking to offer cryptocurrency services. Online stock brokerage firms E*Trade Financial and TD Ameritrade are also said to be preparing to launch cryptocurrency trading services.  Mobile stock trading app Robinhood, on the other hand, launched cryptocurrency trading services over a year ago, and recently announced a plan to launch an initial public offering.

42381811,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqcV,1557144007,Craig Wright Ordered to Disclose Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Court Case,"A U.S. federal court has ordered self-proclaimed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in an ongoing lawsuit filed against him by the estate of a former business partner.  Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. The Australian entrepreneur is accused of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”  Kleiman, therefore, is seeking return of a good portion of 1.1 million bitcoins (worth roughly $6.19 billion as of press time) mined by the two, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for infringement of intellectual property.  In the latest update from the case, the southern district court of Florida issued an order Friday, stating that Wright must produce a list of his bitcoin holdings as of Dec. 31, 2013. However, Wright asserted that he does not have a complete list of the addresses, according to the document.  Wright further claimed that, in 2011, he transferred ownership of all his bitcoins to a blind trust.  The court has now asked Wright to also provide a sworn declaration identifying the name and location of the blind trust by May 8. He must also produce a copy of any and all documents relating to the ""formation, administration and operation"" of the trust by May 9.  The court further said:  “On or before May 15, 2019, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, Dr. Wright shall produce all transactional records of the blind trust, including but not limited to any records reflecting the transfer of bitcoin into the blind trust in or about 2011. The production shall be accompanied by a sworn declaration of authenticity.""  Last December, the court denied Wright’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that he “converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts.”  Craig Wright image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/06/craig-wright-ordered-to-disclose-bitcoin-addresses-in-kleiman-court-case,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42381834,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pr0P,1557140435,Bitcoin Risks Pullback After Rejections at Key 2018 Price Hurdle,"View  The June 2018 low of $5,780 is proving a tough nut to crack, as expected. BTC has failed to close above that level for three days in a row, indicating a price pullback may be needed to fuel a sustained move to $6,000.  BTC looks to be creating a double-top bearish reversal pattern with neckline support at $5,510 on the 4-hour chart. A break lower could yield re-test of the 30-day MA, currently at $5,294.  A strong bounce from the 30-day MA could fuel a sustained rise to $6,000. That looks likely as the long-duration charts are biased bullish.  A UTC close below the 30-day MA would shift risk in favor of a deeper drop below $5,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a price pullback, having faced rejection at key price hurdle for three consecutive days.  The cryptocurrency market leader jumped above the April 23 high of $5,627 on Friday, bolstering both the short- and long-term technical setups.  However, despite the odds stacked in favor of a quick rally toward $6,000, the cryptocurrency failed to find acceptance above the June 2018 bottom of $5,780 over the weekend, according to Bitstamp data.  For instance, BTC clocked highs of $5,796 and $5,846 on Friday and Saturday, respectively, but closed below $5,780 on both days. Similar price action unfolded on Sunday, with BTC hitting a high of $5,782 before ending the day at $5,709.  It is worth noting that $5,780 was expected to offer stiff resistance. The level is important because BTC's sell-off from May 2018 highs near $10,000 run out of steam at $5,780 on June 24. Subsequently, a bounce from that level was followed by an over 40 percent price rise to $8,500 by July 24.  Bitcoin's recent failures to cross that threshold suggest a pullback and a bounce from the historically strong support level may be needed to recharge the engines for a sustained rise to $6,000.  The case for a price pullback would further strengthen if President Trump's re-escalation of US-China trade tensions and the resulting slide in equities ends up sending gold higher. This is because the inverse relationship between BTC and gold has recently been its strongest in over 12 months.  So far, however, gold has barely benefited from the flight to safety. The safe haven asset is currently trading at $1,283 per ounce, representing a mere 0.17 percent gain on the day. That's opposed to futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down close to 500 points at press time.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $$5,617 on Bitstamp – a 1.48 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC is currently reporting losses below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high), having failed to close (UTC) above the June 2018 bottom of $5,780 for the third straight day on Sunday.  The relative strength index (RSI), which had invalidated a bearish divergence with a move above the falling trendline on Friday, has ended up creating another bearish lower high as opposed to higher high on price.  As a result, a pullback to the historically strong 30-day moving average (MA) support, currently at $5,294, cannot be ruled out.  4-hour chart  BTC seems to be creating a double-top pattern with a neckline at $5,510 on the 4-hour chart. A break below that level would create room for a drop to levels below $5,200 (target as per the measured move method).  A drop below $5,510 may happen in the next 24 hours or so, as the repeated failure to find acceptance above $5,870 has been accompanied by the bearish divergence on the RSI.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin closed last week above the 50-week moving average (MA), further strengthening the evidence for a long-term bullish reversal.  The weekly chart RSI is also biased bullish, having convincingly scaled the resistance band of 53.00–55.00 last month.  The 5- and 10-week MAs are trending north, also indicating a bullish setup. Notably, both MAs are located at $5,386, so that level could work as strong support this week.  With the long-term chart looking bullish, a pullback to the 30-day MA or lower could be short-lived. A strong bounce from that average would likely yield a rally to $6,000.  That said, the prospects of a deeper slide below $5,000 would improve if prices see back-to-back daily closes below the 30-day MA.

Dubbed “Project Proton,” the trial set out to examine if blockchain could address ""industry challenges"" in programmatic advertising.  PepsiCo’s project partner and media agency Mindshare announced the news Monday, saying that it assisted in the trial, which carried out a programmatic end-to-end supply chain reconciliation using Zilliqa’s blockchain platform. The effort compared a control budget with one for the test to gauge the effectiveness of the technology.  Zilliqa’s smart contracts were further used to automate the programmatic supply chain, Mindshare said, explaining:  “These smart contracts reconcile impressions that are delivered from multiple data sources with payments facilitated using an internal Native Alliance Token (NAT) all in near real time, resulting in major efficiency gains and complete transparency for the brand owners.”  The results indicated efficiency increases “in terms of costs for viewable impressions, in running the campaign through smart contracts, versus one without,” according to Mindshare.

Thomas Zeeb told Finews in an interview published Monday that the SIX’s planned digital exchange will go live with a native token and an “initial digital offering"" (IDO) service in 2020. That would follow a trial expected to be completed late this summer.  Zeeb said:  “We’ve got a number of organizations which want to launch tokenized structured products, real estate funds, and so on. But it could also be our own IDO.”  “Whether we begin with warrants, structured products, funds is up to our clients to decide. That is currently being finalized with our user-owners,” he added.  The executive further said that an IDO needs to comply with similar standards to an initial public offering or IPO.  By 2021, Zeeb expects the in-development SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) to be tokenizing traditional securities such as equities, fixed income and funds, provided the regulatory set-up is in place.  “Maybe the token will eventually replace the share one day,” he said.  However, the executive said the exchange is currently not comfortable with offering trading service in cryptocurrencies due to their anonymous nature and compliance risks. “The way bitcoin is currently set up and traded, it wouldn’t meet the criteria for SDX,” Zeeb said.  SIX is spending a “double-digit million amount” on building the SDX over two years, Zeeb added, as well as looking to hire 30 more people by the end of 2019 to bring SDX's total to 100 staff. The company is working with R3’s Corda Enterprise blockchain to build the platform.

42381816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqk3,1557133245,"Regulators Ready to Approve Ethereum Futures, CFTC Insider Says","The Takeaway  The CFTC is willing to let an ether futures contract go to market after soliciting market feedback last year  A futures contract might bring in fresh institutional funding to the crypto space  This, in turn, might reassure retail traders looking at the cryptocurrency  Futures might also cement the CFTC's jurisdiction over ether, which at present is limited to enforcement actions      The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is willing to approve an ether futures contract – provided it ticks all the right boxes, a senior official has told CoinDesk.  The CFTC, which oversees derivatives markets in the U.S., has already allowed bitcoin futures markets to launch, with both CME Group and Cboe Global Exchange offering cash-settled contracts at the end of 2017. Now, the regulator is willing to oversee a similar product for ether, currently the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, said the official.  ""I think we can get comfortable with an ether derivative being under our jurisdiction,"" said the person, who did not want to be identified because the regulator does not typically publicize decisions to adopt new products.  ""We don't do bold pronouncements, what we do is we look at applications before us,"" the official said, explaining:  ""A derivatives exchange comes to us and says 'we want to launch this particular product.' ... If they came to us with a particular derivative that met our requirements, I think that there's a good chance that it would be [allowed to be] self-certified by us.""  However, the CFTC would only respond to a specific application put before the regulator, rather than volunteer an opinion, the individual said.  If proposed and approved, a regulated futures product would open up the ether market to broad institutional investment.  ""Many funds have mandates that do not allow them to buy the digital currency underlying,"" said John Todaro, director of digital currency research at financial software provider Tradeblock. Further, a cash-settled futures contract, paid out in fiat rather than the underlying crypto, would allow hedge funds and the like ""to gain exposure to ether without worrying about custody (which has been a bottleneck to institutional investment),"" he said.  In the long run, Todaro added, a CFTC-supervised futures market “could usher in confidence among regulators such as the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] which could pave the way for an ETF,” an exchange-traded fund bringing additional liquidity to ether.  An increase in institutional investment would, in turn, bolster retail investors' confidence in ether, Todaro said.  CME and Cboe’s bitcoin futures, when they first launched, saw an immediate positive response, with enough traders trying to purchase Cboe’s contracts that the firm’s website crashed. The introduction of these futures contracts may also have contributed to bitcoin’s price skyrocketing to its all-time high of nearly $20,000.  To be sure, some have argued that futures may also have hurt bitcoin’s price, though Todaro said that it is more likely that bitcoin’s price had already reached its peak and the approval of futures just happened to coincide with that time.  Learning process  The CFTC first indicated it was looking at ethereum in December when the regulator published a ""Request for Input"" (RFI) asking a number of questions about the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, the market around it and the underlying technology.  These questions ranged from asking about proof-of-stake (the consensus mechanism that ethereum is expected to eventually adopt to replace bitcoin-style mining) to how ether deposits may be audited.  The agency explicitly asked what impact the introduction of derivatives contracts might have on the cryptocurrency.  George Pullen, a senior economist with the CFTC Division of Market Oversight, told CoinDesk at the end of March that the RFI sought industry and market input on the risks, mechanics and use cases for ether.  In particular, the CFTC was looking to contrast ether with bitcoin, he said, explaining:  ""After our initial public white papers, primers, on virtual currencies, bitcoin, and smart contracts it was clear that a one-size fits all approach to crypto was not appropriate and we needed to know more.""  The CFTC’s RFI will help the regulator to understand ""the range of issues that might exist"" around the ether space, as well as develop better relationships with the crypto community at large, he added.  ""It’s critically important for us to engage in outreach to understand the variety in technologies, markets, and the differences in the community; if we’re just listening to our own voices inside the building, the loudest voices in business, or just the voices in D.C. we could miss out on the bigger picture,"" Pullen explained at the time.  A total of 35 comments were submitted to the CFTC’s RFI by trade associations like the Chamber of Digital Commerce, think tank Coin Center, startups Blockchains LLC and Circle, exchanges like Coinbase and self-proclaimed bitcoin creator Craig Wright, among others.  The CFTC, or at least its Chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, is already pretty popular within the community, which has dubbed him “Crypto Dad” after he called for light-touch regulation around the space.  Power grab?  In addition to giving investors access to a new derivatives product, approving an ether futures contract may cement the CFTC’s regulatory authority over the underlying spot market.  Notably, ErisX, a digital assets and futures trading platform (which wants to offer bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ethereum futures when its derivatives clearing organization license is approved), believes that regulating a futures contract on ethereum would grant the CFTC some additional oversight on the ethereum spot market.  Thomas Chippas, the exchange’s CEO, wrote in his response to the RFI that a futures contract that ""includes a settlement price set by a physically settled cash market"" in the U.S. may improve the CFTC’s ""ability to properly oversee or monitor the cash market for fraud and manipulation."" ErisX declined to comment for this article.  The CFTC likely already has some jurisdiction over the ether cash market, several lawyers CoinDesk spoke to said. However, this authority is limited.  Anne Termine, who leads the futures and derivatives practice group at Covington & Burling LLP and was previously a chief trial attorney with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk that the regulator has already clearly said cryptocurrencies are commodities.  ""As such, the CFTC has limited regulatory oversight over cryptocurrency spot markets, namely the ability to take enforcement action whenever there is fraud or manipulation in these spot markets,"" Termine said.  Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer with the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group, noted that the regulator has “after-the-fact” enforcement jurisdiction over crypto spot markets in terms of fraud or manipulation, but no jurisdiction over exchanges simply conducting spot transactions.  Moreover, anything that is not a security is usually broadly defined as a commodity, she said.  The question of whether ether is a security has not been officially resolved, but officials at the SEC seem to believe it isn’t. William Hinman, the agency’s director of corporation finance, said at a conference in 2018 that he does not see ether as a security.  His comments were seemingly affirmed by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in March, who wrote that he agreed with Hinman’s analysis of when a crypto asset might not be a security, though he did not specifically name ethereum.  Introducing a ""futures contract would implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction beyond anti-fraud and manipulation provisions,"" Termine explained. The contract would have to trade on a CFTC-regulated futures exchange, meaning it would be subject to the regulator’s direct oversight.  Termine concluded:  ""The implications for the broader community would be enhanced CFTC oversight over [ether] but potentially a legitimization of the cryptocurrency.""

Some prices are also automatically excluded when our algorithms detect that the reported price is a significant outlier when compared to other market pairs for the same cryptocurrency, denoted by three asterisks (***) on the markets tab.""  The exclusion from CoinMarketCap's calculations comes as Bitfinex continues to be mired in controversy. Late last month, the New York attorney general alleged that the exchange, which shares management and owners with stablecoin issuer Tether, lost $850 million of corporate and client funds and subsequently used a loan from Tether’s reserves to secretly cover the shortfall.  Bitfinex later claimed that the funds had been “seized” by various authorities and that it was working to retrieve the funds.  Bitfinex has now launched what's termed an initial exchange offering (IEO) to raise as much as $1 billion through a token sale. Though an official white paper for the offering is not yet out, Bitfinex shareholder Dong Zhao has already started taking pre-orders from users who want to participate in the sale.  Last January, Bitfinex and Tether were subpoenaed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, although the regulator did not publicly state why.  CoinMarketCap previously changed the way it used data from Bitfinex in response to a report by CoinDesk that pointed out that a trading pair shown on CoinMarketCap – apparently for trades between the tether stablecoin (USDT) and U.S. dollars – did not, in fact, represent a pair available for trading on Bitfinex. In response, CoinMarketCap said it was excluding that pair from its volume data.  The data provider also formed a new alliance last week, called the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), with Bitfinex and other exchanges on board, in order to tackle concerns over cryptocurrency data reporting.

42381823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pqsr,1557115200,"Banking, Bitfinex and the Hidden Irony of Crypto's Newest Controversy","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      When I visited some early bitcoin startups in Hong Kong five years ago, they were unanimous about their biggest challenge: finding a bank that would let them open an account.  It wasn’t that local banks were especially worried about this little-understood new industry. The issue was that compliance-obsessed correspondence banks in the U.S. were demanding that their counterparts in the territory apply an especially high “know-your-customer” standard for bitcoin businesses. Since Hong Kong banks couldn’t live without a dollar lifeline from New York, the path of least resistance was to say no.  That situation was a lesson about how the dollar’s reserve status leaves U.S. financial institutions, and the Washington regulators whose guidance they heed, exerting profound worldwide influence – in this case, constraining innovation, wherever it was happening.  Fast forward to 2019 and reports of a high-profile Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange’s troubles with a dubious Panamanian entity offer a stark reminder that little has changed.  The lack of access to reliable, mainstream credit and payment facilities, and the risky steps that cryptocurrency exchanges take to get around that problem, continue to be the sector’s Achilles Heel.  Yet despite the initial market jitters provoked by the NewYork Attorney General’s allegations that that exchange, Bitfinex, used funds from closely affiliated stablecoin provider Tether to mask an undisclosed $850 million shortfall, there may be light at the end of this multi-year tunnel.  To find it, you have to look at other developments in banking, blockchains and cryptocurrency.  There’s a case to be made that new crypto technologies and business models will foster a sufficient mix of greed and fear to drive banks into a more accommodating stance with crypto entities.  Bitfinex-Tether: a banking problem  For now, though, banking challenges remain rife for crypto firms. Bitfinex and Tether’s situation is proof of that.  Bitfinex’s integrity is understandably questioned by many. But it’s true that if it had been properly banked, the Hong Kong exchange would not have had to do business with payment processor Crypto Capital in the first place. (According to the NYAG’s report, Bitfinex was seeking to recover $850 million held by that Panamanian firm and in the meantime used Tether’s reserves to make the hole that that gap left in the exchange’s balance sheet.)  Moreover, if exchanges like Bitfinex had access to bank accounts for liquidity, Tether would never have become as integral to a large part of the bitcoin market’s clearing system as it did.  In 2015, shortly after it adopted its current name following its founding as Realcoin in 2014, Tether forged a close relationship with Bitfinex. The exchange opened trading in Tether’s USDT tokens, which the stablecoin provider promised could be redeemed one-for-one for dollars, and ultimately began using them to solve for liquidity needs that banks were not providing.  Then, as Bitfinex grew, creating counterparty relationships with multiple other exchanges, they, too, started using USDT for the same purpose. Rather than clearing customers trades’ through cumbersome banking system transactions that require deep institutional support, exchanges could freely manage their fiat-to-crypto float by moving in and out of a de facto crypto dollar.  After a while, however, this model came undone. It's undoing also stemmed from the same root cause.  For Tether to consistently stand up the claim that one USDT token equaled one dollar, it had to convince investors that it held the equivalent in actual dollars in reserve at one or more banks. So, when doubts about Tether’s audits bled into concerns about its banking relationships, confidence dropped and the token lost its peg in the market. This, in turn, put pressure on Bitfinex and deepened its problems with Crypto Capital.  In summation, it’s fair to say that the bitcoin market’s persistent concern about a Bitfinex-Tether house of cards wouldn’t exist if banks had more readily serviced bitcoin exchanges.  The way out  If that were the full story, it would be hard to see how it ends. After all, in stoking additional uncertainty around liquidity and price volatility, this latest crisis only further diminishes bitcoin’s standing in the minds of regulators and bank compliance officers.  But there is a way out of this self-perpetuating trap. Such a solution arises from banks’ own need to find new sources of revenue in a post-crisis era in which their margins have been squeezed by low-interest rates, added risk constraints and heavy compliance requirements. Crypto-based products, if not cryptocurrencies themselves, could offer such an opportunity.  One opportunity lies with security tokens, which, once they mature and earn regulatory blessing, promise to give both fundraising enterprises and fund managers wider and more efficient access to capital and investments. They combine the comfort and compliance of a regulated instrument that’s attached to real-world assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate with the cost and efficiency of disintermediated issuance and smart-contract-automated cap table management, clearing, settlement, and trade reconciliation.  Security token offerings, or STOs, aren't as subversive as ICOs. Initial coin offerings mostly didn’t represent any underlying real-world assets but rather promised the value of commodity-like “utility” within their blockchain-based network’s economic and incentive model. Crypto puritans also decry the fact that STOs rely on trusted third parties to stand up the underlying assets and exist only at the whim of government regulators.  But precisely because they could earn the blessing of regulators and the participation of traditional enterprises, STOs are attracting attention on Wall Street. The recent news that Societe Generale tested an STO based on the public Ethereum blockchain has taken that interest to a new level.  STOs might make some of investment banks’ back-office functions redundant, but fees for STO market-making, risk-management and underwriting could more than offset that, at least for a while.  The missing piece  But to get to the ideal STO state, another piece of the puzzle is needed: a payment token.  That’s why I see banks increasingly offering services and support for the emerging new breed of sophisticated, reserve-backed stablecoins. Those offered by Gemini, Paxos and the consortium formed by Circle and Coinbase already have much deeper, well-regulated banking relationships than anything Tether could claim. (I see banks preferring these stablecoins over JP Morgan’s JPM coin. Why reward a competing bank’s technology?)  Here’s the thing, though. As a more deeply banked stablecoin ecosystem emerges it will also provide stability to the market for blockchain-native cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Exchanges will have a more reliable, digital source of fiat liquidity.  Eventually, they won’t even need to hold client’s fiat deposits, putting an end to disasters such as QuadrigaCX. All of that will help the maturation of cryptocurrencies generally, enabling their wider adoption as alternatives and competitors to the fiat system.  This brings us to a somewhat ironic conclusion for crypto true believers who pine for an end to the centralized banking system and a digital store of non-fiat value: the road to utopia may be paved in deals with bankers and government regulators.
