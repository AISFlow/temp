42430256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBhh,1552086924,"NEM Foundation Charts Path Forward After $8 Million Rescue, Major Cutbacks","The NEM Foundation is mapping out its survival plans in real time after obtaining a funding injection of roughly $8 million last month and laying off most of its staff.  The request to release 210 million XEM (the native token of the NEM blockchain) from reserves was approved by key members of the community on Feb. 20. In a post published Friday, NEM Foundation leadership laid out how the first installment of 25 million XEM (about $1.05 million at the current price) will be spent.  “I think this is a vote of confidence that the industry is moving forward and that we're ready to pivot to a very new way of working,"" NEM Foundation president Alexandra Tinsman told CoinDesk in an interview Friday.  The move comes after major cutbacks at the foundation, which at its peak in 2018 employed 150 and had a physical presence in 20 countries.  Tinsman confirmed Friday that the foundation had laid off about 100 people – a mix of consultants and full-time staffers – over the past month. The funding proposal published in early February estimated that ""88 staff (69%) will be made redundant"" by the planned restructuring.  ""It’s in the best interest of companies to be fiscally responsible with their platform, their products and their teams,"" Tinsman said. ""We need to be product-focused and that’s what we’ve done. This is a sign of good things to come.”  NEM is launching soon its Catapult blockchain engine, which is designed to power both private and public networks. ""The tech itself is doing things that no other blockchain has done before,"" NEM Foundation interim CTO Jeff McDonald told CoinDesk Friday.  Stepping back, the NEM Foundation announced in January that it was in dire financial straits. The newly elected Tinsman told CoinDesk at the time that the foundation was facing layoffs and severe budget cuts ""due to the mismanagement of the previous governance council.""  Tinsman's leadership team presented a funding ask to the NEM community in early February. Ninety percent of the 573 people who voted supported the foundation's request to tap into the blockchain's XEM reserves. The injection of 210 million XEM is meant to fund the foundation's operations through Feb. 20, 2020.  The NEM platform is primarily used to facilitate the development of enterprise blockchain apps. Its XEM token is currently the world’s 19th largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap.

42430259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBlh,1552082419,German Finance Ministry Calls for Regulated Blockchain Securities Market,"The German Ministry of Finance has recommended that the country recognize blockchain-based securities as a legitimate form of financial instrument and regulate them as such.  In a paper published Friday, the agency said securities can be issued in electronic form and shouldn’t have to be documented on paper. ""German law should generally be opened up for electronic securities, i.e. the currently mandatory documentary embodiment of securities (paper form) should no longer apply without restriction,"" the paper said, according to a Google translation from German.  Legislation should create a framework for regulating these digital instruments, with the flexibility to adjust the rules to the quickly changing reality of blockchain tech, the ministry added. “In view of the fact that the technical standards and requirements can change rapidly, authorization should be provided to regulate the specific technical details by legal regulation.”  The initiative should start with electronic bonds, and only later move to digital shares, the government said, since the amount of regulation necessary for the latter would delay the timely introduction of any electronic securities. The registry of the digital securities should be operated or supervised by the government, the document goes on, “in order to avoid the possibility of manipulation,” the paper said.  Also, “separate regulations should be provided for the acquisition and transfer of electronic securities as well as good faith protection.” If digital securities are used to trade on the country's trading venues they should be registered with the country’s central security depository (CSD), the ministry said. Retail investors should generally be able to buy tokenized securities only through an intermediary financial institution, the paper said.  Notably, the document said digital securities can utilize blockchain but do not necessarily have to:  “The use of blockchain technology should not be privileged, especially with regard to the state-of-the-art development of the sometimes high energy requirements of public blockchain technologies and their climatic effects.”  The paper also touches the matter of so-called utility tokens, contemplating that these might be exempt from the requirements placed on securities issuers.  “As a rule, utility tokens do not constitute securities, investments or other financial instruments under the German Securities Trading Act and in most cases will not be electronic bonds in the future,"" although ""it could be determined by law that a public offer of utility tokens may only take place if the provider has previously published an information sheet,” the document says.  Legislation on the way  The ministry's recommendations come as a draft bill on security token offerings (STOs) is in the works at the German parliament.  “The technology sounds very interesting, but people don’t really understand it,” Senator Thomas Heilmann, a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Germany’s ruling political party, told CoinDesk, adding that the CDU faction in the parliament supports his initiative.  The bill now exists in the form of “discussion materials” and has been discussed by German lawmakers and government bodies behind closed doors, said Richard Lohwasser, the CEO of blockchain startup Lition, which has been advising Heilmann on the new legislative proposal.  As it stands, without comprehensive regulation of security tokens in Europe, dealing with them can mean a whole range of problems: holding a token doesn’t mean holding equity from a legal standpoint, dividend payments are not legally compliant, and if a token gets sold the buyer doesn’t acquire legal rights to receive dividends, Lohwasser explained.  As a financial center of Europe, Germany can secure also a leadership position in tokenized finance, the Finance Ministry’s document states. The country might also set the tone for the future E.U.-wide security token regulations.  The implications can be important for the global blockchain community, not only Germany, Lewis Cohen, a lawyer at the New York-based law firm DLx Law told CoinDesk, concluding:    “Even if the German capital markets are not that significant right now, especially from the point of view of companies here in the U.S., the fact that policymakers in Germany are taking active steps to encourage the use of security tokens will be noticed, and lessons will be learned, around the world. The German experiment, if you will, is important for creating a model, in which the wider blockchain community can learn what works well and what doesn’t work as well.”          CORRECTION (March 11, 10:00 UTC): An earlier version of this article contained a translation error. The passage has been corrected to note that the finance ministry said the registrar of digital securities could be run or supervised by the government, not just the former.

42430243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBJh,1552077902,SEC's 'Crypto Mom' Sounds Note of Caution About National Action Plans,"A blockchain-friendly member of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) sounded a note of caution in response to an industry lobbyist's call for a national strategy for the technology.  The Digital Chamber of Commerce's National Action Plan calls on the federal government to ""make blockchain technology a priority,"" by publicly supporting development in the space, adopting a formal light-touch regulatory approach, creating clear policies and regulations based on what the technology does (rather than the type of technology used) and preventing a ""regulatory patchwork"" by coordinating state and federal efforts.  ""If we want the United States to be a leader in advanced technology we have to take action,"" Perianne Boring, who founded the Chamber, said in her opening remarks at the organization's D.C. Blockchain Summit this week. ""It is time the United States introduced a national strategy for blockchain.""  Boring brought the action plan up again the next day, during a fireside chat with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, whose dissenting vote to approve a bitcoin ETF earned her the nickname ""crypto mom"" last year. While Peirce said she appreciated the action plan, calling it ""helpful,"" she added a few caveats about such efforts.  ""What types of action would you like to see the government take?"" Boring asked Peirce of the plan. The Commissioner's response focused on the need for innovation to come from the private sector, rather than having the federal government facilitate large-scale cooperation across the country.  ""When you try to get national action plans ... not [the Chamber] specifically, but people think ‘oh wouldn’t it be great if we coordinated this from the government’ and that has gotten us into lots of problems in the past,"" Peirce said, adding:  ""We need to have clear regulatory guidelines, that’s something I think you’ve been very forthright in calling for, which I think is really important. We do need to let people know where they stand, but then within that we need to let people do what they want to do and try not to have too much government partnership with the private sector.""  The government should just set up those guidelines and ""let the innovation happen on its own,"" she added.  'Come in and tell us'  That said, Peirce encouraged the technologists and entrepreneurs in the room to pipe up.  What innovators can do is reach out to the SEC and other government agencies and let them know where specifically they need clarity, Peirce said, adding that, ""you all need to come in and tell us where the pain points are, where the old regime doesn’t fit, and then we can move forward with guidance.""  In her comments, the Commissioner explained that she would like to see Commission-level guidance issued which clearly outlines where the legal lines are and how blockchain projects might interact with those lines, ""but we need from you examples of where that would be helpful.""  Part of the hangup between developers in the blockchain space and the SEC may be the speeds at which each group typically works. Relative to the SEC's perspective, the agency is ""moving quickly,"" but from a blockchain project's point of view, the regulator may be moving very slowly, Peirce said.  She highlighted the SEC's FinHub division, which is focused on interacting with blockchain and other fintech startups. On the branch's website is a submission form, which Peirce hopes technologists will use. To date, only a handful of projects have actually provided feedback:  ""We’ve gotten … maybe five or six letters and I was pretty disappointed by that. It does take work on your part but we really need people to be writing in.""  UPDATE (March 9, 04:30 UTC): This article has been updated to include additional quotes from Hester Peirce.

42430246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBNh,1552075206,Your Guide to Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Events at SXSW 2019,"It all started with a keynote conversation with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2016.  South by Southwest (SXSW) organizers say that was the first inkling that cryptocurrency could play a leading role in the annual innovation conference in Austin, Texas.  Now, in the midst of a prolonged bear market, 2019 will be the first year SXSW will feature an official blockchain and cryptocurrency track, from March 14–16.  The Gemini co-founders returned in 2017 and are back again this year, too, speaking Friday evening in a featured session. (The Winklevoss talk takes place well ahead of the official crypto track due to scheduling issues, according to a festival spokesperson.)  SXSW is all about being on top of the zeitgeist, Todd Hansen, SXSW's head of conference programming, told CoinDesk. ""It finally, really in a mainstream way, broke through, because everyone was talking about it,"" he said, explaining cryptocurrency's prominent place in this year's conference.  Hansen told CoinDesk that blockchain programming at the 2018 event saw a strong response from festival crowds. Of course, that was just months after BTC had touched $20,000 and initial coin offerings had reached a fever pitch.  In that spirit, one company ran a tongue-in-cheek side event on March 11, 2018 called the Initial Taco Offering. For those unfamiliar: SXSW has gotten so big that there's a whole separate level of programming in off-agenda events that occur across downtown Austin. They range from super exclusive parties to open-to-all workshops.  Despite layoffs late last year, the crypto firm with the biggest presence at SXSW 2019 appears to be Brooklyn-based ConsenSys. The ethereum-focused venture studio made its first foray to Austin as a company in 2018.  ""When we saw Joe Lubin and Laura Shin fill the same 2,000-person auditorium as Elon Musk a few days later, it was a signal that blockchain and Ethereum were transcending tech and finance circles,"" ConsenSys spokesperson Kara Miley told CoinDesk in an email.  SXSW saw the signal too.  This year, the blockchain track starts as the rest of the tech-industry programming tapers off. The organizers are hoping that by running blockchain programming concurrently with the start of the music event it can bring in a second wave of professionals to Austin, effectively extending the innovation summit.  Top sessions  With SXSW undertaking its first official foray into crypto, CoinDesk wanted to flag a few highlights.  People who come mainly for the tech conference but want to dabble in blockchain can stop by the ConsenSys blockchain house, which will run from March 10–14. For a more casual introduction to the topic, ConsenSys will show a short documentary Monday night about using ethereum to clean trash out of Manila Bay.  Attendees can also go deeper and experience the blockchain as an extended game. PricewaterhouseCoopers is running a three-hour demonstration that will get participants to play-act as nodes on a ledger. Sadly, it's already maxed out for RSVPs.  As a mainstream tech festival, guests at SXSW care about UX. Getting crypto's usability up to a level that's actually attractive to non-techies is a recurring theme in the space. There are two notable design events taking place: consulting firm IDEO will run a workshop on Thursday, March 14, and ConsenSys is organizing a design workshop on Wednesday, March 13 featuring uPort and Coinbase.  ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin will appear in a keynote session again this year, this time in conversation with Manoush Zomorodi of the Civil-backed podcasting company ZigZag.  Another of crypto's big companies, Ripple, will also be featured in a keynote session. CTO David Schwartz will present ""Blockchain Beyond the Hype: The Ripple Effect.""  For those hungry for a little more drama, Jimmy Song of Blockchain Capital is taking on IBM's Christopher Ferris in a debate over permissioned vs. permissionless blockchains. Always game for a rhetorical wrestling match, we saw Song debate Lubin at Consensus 2018 on the side of bitcoin maximalism.  With SXSW's music programming taking place nearby, there are also sessions exploring mashups of music and blockchain technology. A cross-industry panel featuring IBM and MIT will dig into progress on the topic. Additionally, a freelance blockchain developer working on Imogen Heap's long-awaited Mycelia project will give a demo of progress so far.  Lastly, SXSW is reputed to be a place where entrepreneurs have a chance to meet investors in a more informal setting.

Miley, the ConsenSys spokesperson, noted that SXSW is a key chance to reach influential users of the old internet:  ""It's a space where technologies can cross the chasm and reach mainstream audiences, and so it's important for leaders of Web3 to showcase the potential of decentralized technology and build bridges with the leaders of Web2.""  But it's not only crypto-native companies telling their story. Established brands have been working with the technology, too. For example, tech giant IBM will have a large presence in Austin.  ""A real shift we're seeing this year is the move beyond the crypto-craze to more enterprise applications of blockchain capability and blockchain business networks,"" Jason Kelley, of IBM's blockchain division, told CoinDesk. ""We're also seeing more evidence of the unlimited potential to tokenize all kinds of assets on the blockchain.""

""We should focus on getting people excited about the real benefits of this technology, on making this technology more accessible, and ultimately, giving people a reason to care beyond promises of incredible wealth,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Like every product we create, we want to communicate this in a way that's fun, interesting and accessible.""  Updated with additional comment from IBM.

Gas fees denominated in gwei are payments made by the user to compensate for the computational energy required to process and validate transactions on the ethereum blockchain.  Suggesting that a flat, “one-off” payment of 1 gwei ($0.01 is about 73,000 gwei) for transactions sent to ethereum wallets could collectively raise up to $2 million in a year, Buterin wrote:  “At the cost of only increasing average user gas costs by [roughly] 7 percent, it would raise up to [$2 million per year] in sustainable, non-institutionally biased, market-based funding for client/wallet developers. For reference, that would cover all [Ethereum Foundation] grants to date … with room to spare.”  Stressing that he wanted to encourage this fee as a norm – not a mandate – in the ethereum ecosystem, Buterin explained there’s already a high degree of trust between users and their ethereum wallets given that “a bad [wallet] could steal all your money.”  Community responses thus far to Buterin’s proposal have been mixed, with one user pointing out that bitcoin wallet MultiBit had tried and failed to implement such a fee.  “Users were not willing to pay for something that was previously free. No one would upgrade,” tweeted Ken Hodler. “Eventually, the fee was removed. Without a good way to pay for support and engineering, development on the wallet stopped.”  CORRECTION: A quote by Vitalik Buterin has been removed from this article after admission its statements were aboutEthereum Improvement Proposal 1559, not the wallet fee proposal made on Twitter.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has indicted Ruja Ignatova and Konstantin Ignatov on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, claiming the two defrauded investors out of ""billions of dollars"" using a fraudulent cryptocurrency. Konstantin Ignatov was arrested on wire fraud charges at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this week as part of the investigation.  According to a press release, prosecutors are alleging that OneCoin is a pyramid scheme, where members receive commissions to recruit other individuals to the project. These recruits are required to purchase crypto packages, and OneCoin currently claims to have 3 million members worldwide.  While OneCoin claims its tokens are mined by servers operated by the company and that its price growth is organic, neither of these are true, the release says.  Further, Ruja Ignatova allegedly said in an email that she has an ""exit strategy"" from the company.  Noting that these charges are allegations at the moment, SDNY U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said ""these defendants created a multibillion-dollar ‘cryptocurrency’ company based completely on lies and deceit,"" adding:  ""They promised big returns and minimal risk, but, as alleged, this business was a pyramid scheme based on smoke and mirrors more than zeroes and ones. Investors were victimized while the defendants got rich.""  While Konstantin Ignatov has been arrested, Ruja Ignatova remains at large. Another defendant, Mark Scott, was arrested last year in Massachusetts.  Ruja Ignatova faces charges in India as well for her role in the project.  International crackdown  Authorities across a number of nations – including Belgium, the U.K., Uganda, Italy, Nigeria, Germany, India, Hungary, Belize, Vietnam, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, China and Samoa – have been warning or cracking down on the OneCoin project since 2016 on similar pyramid scheme or fraud concerns.  Prosecutors in China have charged more than 100 individuals with deceiving investors, and have successfully convicted several of these defendants. Indian authorities have likewise arrested some of the project's promoters.  Promoters in other countries have faced fines or cease-and-desist orders. Payment processors for the project have been shut down by finance watchdogs in multiple countries, and regulators have similarly gone after the project's trading system.

42430254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBdh,1552059026,Connecticut Lawmakers Seek to Legalize Blockchain Smart Contracts,"The U.S. state of Connecticut could soon legalize the use of blockchain smart contracts in business.  The Commerce Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly filed house bill 7310 on Friday, proposing that blockchain smart contracts should be authorized for commerce in the state.  According to the bill:  “No contract relating to a transaction shall be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely because such contract is executed through a smart contract.”  The bill would, in effect, give equal rights to firms that use smart contracts on a blockchain or distributed ledger with those that use more traditional methods to secure information in connection with a transaction.  Elsewhere in the U.S., Ohio passed a similar bill last August, while a Florida effort to treat blockchain ledgers and smart contracts as legally-binding methods of data storage failed to pass in October.  The Chamber of Digital Commerce, a trade association representing the blockchain industry, last year investigated new smart contract laws and ""concluded that enactment of state legislation regarding smart contracts is unnecessary and potentially undermines the growth of the industry.""  The organization said at the time:  “Existing legal frameworks for defining and giving legal effect to contracts cover smart contract technology, and nothing regarding smart contracts ought to change existing definitions or the application of current contract law. Additional laws are largely unnecessary and will only serve to confuse the application of current law.”  Connecticut State Capitol image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/08/connecticut-lawmakers-seek-to-legalize-blockchain-smart-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcad99c0ee451c62c60071a6af229113ede0fa77-1500x878.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In November 2017, the firm also launched a bitcoin exchange-traded certificate that moves investors’ holdings between bitcoin and U.S. dollars with the help of a machine learning algorithm, aimed at curbing the cryptocurrency’s volatility.  In early 2018, Swissquote launched a multi-cryptocurrency certificate on the SIX Swiss Exchange, offering exposure to bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin.

Probably the most unusual role is a global security strategic partner who ""will serve as a liaison and thought partner between Global Security and the selected key business partners, in this case: Facebook’s Blockchain organization.""  The job descriptions don't disclose much about any future product, but hint at ambitious goals:  ""Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don't have now - that could be things like healthcare, equitable financial services, or new ways to save or share information.""  Friending blockchain  Ahead of the current hiring spree, Facebook has been hinting at a keen interest in blockchain for some time.  According to a recent report by the New York Times, Facebook has been working on a token that will be used across the company's media platforms, which include Facebook itself, WhatsApp and Instagram. The token will be a kind of a stablecoin pegged to a basket of several fiat currencies. Fifty engineers at the company are already working on the token and it's expected to be released in the first half of 2019, the newspaper reported.  In a recently posted video interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said blockchain technology might allow the company to re-imagine the way users sign on to the social media platform, replacing the current system called Facebook Connect.  “Basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice to log into places without going through an intermediary,” Zuckerberg said.

Security Council expert panel report.  Nikkei Asian Review, which has obtained the report, reported Friday that this is the first time the panel has detailed North Korea's illicit cryptocurrency activities.  The country has had severe economic sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programs, which have impacted its exports of coal and thus its foreign exchange earnings, according to Nikkei.  Cryptocurrencies, the panel said, give the regime “more ways to evade sanctions, given that they are harder to trace, can be laundered many times and are independent from government regulation."" It also suspects that North Korea is using blockchain technology to avoid being tracked.  The panel estimates that North Korea carried out successful attacks on Asian cryptocurrency exchanges at least five times between January 2017 and September 2018, with losses totaling $571 million.  The same figure was also reported by cybersecurity vendor Group-IB last October, which attributed the losses to North Korea’s infamous hacking group, Lazarus. The group managed to steal the cryptocurrencies through 14 hacks on crypto exchanges, the firm said.  In February 2018, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) also attributed the theft of tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies in 2017 to North Korean hackers.  The panel recommended that UN member states ""enhance their ability to facilitate robust information exchange on the cyberattacks by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with other governments and with their own financial institutions,"" to identify and prevent such attacks.  The report will soon to be formally submitted to the Security Council, Nikkei said.

42430257,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBnh,1552042810,Bitcoin Struggles to Pass Price Hurdle But Bull Outlook Intact,"View  Bitcoin's short-term outlook remains bullish while prices are held above $3,658 (the low of the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27).  A break above $4,000, however, could be preceded by a pullback to $3,750 if another rejection at a newfound resistance of $3,900 ends up breaching the bullish higher low of $3,826 on the hourly chart.  A UTC close below $3,658 would confirm a short-term bearish reversal, although that looks unlikely.  Bitcoin's (BTC) repeated failure to beat resistance at $3,900 is a slight cause of concern for the bulls.  Having bounced up strongly from the 100-day moving average (MA) support on Tuesday, bitcoin was expected to make a quick move toward the psychological hurdle of $4,000.  In the last two days, however, the bullish momentum faded near $3,900 – the high of the candle with long upper shadow created on Feb. 28.  Further, the spike to a 12-day high of $3,924 seen earlier today was short-lived with prices quickly falling back to lows near $3,860.  BTC's inability to force a convincing break above $3,900 may invite selling pressure. That said, the short-term outlook would turn bearish only if prices drop below the Feb. 27 low of $3,658.  As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,880.  Hourly chart        BTC witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakout on the hourly chart at 07:00 UTC. The follow-through, however, was bearish with the following candle closing back inside the triangle pattern.  Still, the failed breakout has not done significant damage to the bullish view, as prices have again bounced up from the 50-hour moving average.  A deeper pullback to $3,750 could be seen if another failure at $3,900 is followed by a break below the bullish higher low of $3,826.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC bounced strongly from the 100-day MA support on Tuesday, restoring the short-term bullish view put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27.  The bullish outlook would be invalidated if prices see a UTC close below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low). That would expose levels below $3,500, although the drop could be short-lived as the longer duration indicators are flashing early signs of bull revival.

42430251,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBXh,1552041013,Revolut App Now Lets Users Auto-Trigger Cash and Crypto Exchanges,"Mobile finance app Revolut has launched a new feature allowing users to “auto-exchange” cash and cryptocurrencies.  The firm announced Tuesday that its over 4 million users can now automatically exchange, say, U.S. dollar (USD) to bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) to XRP, based on a pre-set target rate. Fiat-to-fiat exchanges are also possible.  Once a target rate is set in the app – either above or below current rates – Revolut said the exchange will trigger once the target has been reached. It warns, though, that the achieved rate could be ""slightly different"" from the target due to exchange rate fluctuations.  ""If the rate never hits your target, no currencies will be exchanged,"" the firm said.  With the move, the app has effectively added the ""trade trigger"" feature available on more professional trading platforms, rather than offering simply a buying and selling service at the current market or platform rate.  “Auto-exchange is perfect for trying to get the best exchange rate ahead of your holiday or protecting yourself from market volatility,” Revolut added in an email to customers on Thursday.  The feature comes with some limitations, however. You can exchange only up to €10,000 ($11,198) per day to or from any cryptocurrency, the firm said. There is also a daily cap of 30 auto-exchange transactions.  Also, at times of high volatility, if the exchange rate moves more than 0.75 percent on either side of your target rate for fiat currencies, or more than 5 percent on either side of your target rate for cryptocurrencies, Revolut said it won’t carry out the exchange.  Revolut started offering cryptocurrency trading services in July 2017 with the addition of bitcoin initially. Later, in December 2017, the firm added litecoin and ether support and in May of last year it added XRP and bitcoin cash.  Last December, the firm received a banking license from the European Central Bank. Revolut said at the time that the license will ultimately allow it to offer users an account to manage all their finances from a single place through its upcoming venture Revolut Bank.

U.S.-based Quantstamp announced Wednesday that it is setting up a subsidiary in Japan following a “significant” investment from Nomura Holdings and Tokyo-listed internet group Digital Garage.  Chuzaburo Yagi, senior managing director in charge of innovations at Nomura Holdings, said:  “As blockchain technology is adopted in the financial world, smart contracts will play an increasingly important role. Security assurances through auditing and certification will become increasingly indispensable.”  Quantstamp’s new limited liability subsidiary in Japan aims to help the country’s startups and corporations in using ""secure"" blockchain technology. Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that can be implemented on blockchains to enforce specific sets of rules.  The market for smart contract-based applications is “strong” in Japan and will “only be growing,” said Quantstamp’s co-founder and CEO Richard Ma.  Founded in 2017, Quantstamp provides an automated tool for developers and users that helps “identify and secure vulnerabilities” in smart contracts, as well as auditing services for large-scale blockchain projects aimed to ensure security. It joined seed accelerator Y Combinator back in 2017.  Quantstamp said its services have so far been used to secure more than $500 million of transaction value.  Last May, Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet startup Ledger and investment firm Global Advisors to explore building a digital asset custody solution.  While, in January 2018, Digital Garage subsidiary Crypto Garage announced that it is working with bitcoin infrastructure startup Blockstream to test the issuance of a Japanese yen-pegged stablecoin.

On Friday, media outlets in South Korea reported the partnership between Enjin, the Singapore-based company behind ENJ, and Samsung's flagship smartphone S10, was confirmed, which ignited Korea’s investor base to jump in.  When contacted for comment, Enjin's VP of marketing, Simon Kertonegoro, told CoinDesk:  “While I can confirm that we have an official partnership with Samsung, I’m not at liberty to disclose any other information at this point.”  In late February, Samsung presented S10 at MWC Barcelona 2019, and showcased the phone's Blockchain Keystore feature, which will house private keys to cryptocurrency assets – a function that has drawn attention thanks to the flagship product's predicted reach of 45 million users in 2019.  During the showcase of Blockchain Keystore, the company also displayed a picture that included the logo of the Enjin crypto gaming platform. Many have been speculating since then the possibility that the Enjin wallet will be integrated with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore on S10.  ENJ is a cryptocurrency for virtual goods, namely in-game items that can be exchanged, traded or swapped cross platform with the potential to create entirely new in-game e-commerce ecosystems utilizing the ERC-1155 token based on the Ethereum blockchain.    Where it all began    Rumors began circulating Feb. 25 with this image aligned to the Samsung Blockchain Keystore and a leaked video of the Samsung Mobile Business Development Summit featuring Enjin’s logo.  Since then price action has given way to speculation as investors piled on to take advantage of the bullish announcements.    Daily chart    That sparked a frenzy of self-perpetuating investor interest as it rose 206 percent before closing out 116 percent up on the previous day.  ENJ also experienced another major spike on March 5 after announcing their Blockchain Software Development Kit (SDK) is due to launch on March 14, which helped price close out 27.5 percent higher while March 8 put those gains to shame rising another 76.1 percent over a 24-hour period to where it currently stands.

42430261,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqBth,1552021230,Ethereum Block Count Spikes as Difficulty Bomb Diffuses on Schedule,"The rate at which new transaction blocks are being added to the ethereum blockchain is back on the rise after the network's successful upgrades, Constantinople and St. Petersburg, last week.  According to blockchain analytics site Etherscan, the daily block count increased more than 1,500 blocks within a 24-hour period after the upgrades, implemented as hard forks, were accepted onto the main network.  The spike in block numbers is a direct result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1234 activated last Thursday, which was designed to effectively disable a piece of code in the software known as the “difficulty bomb,” for a period of 12 months. Meant to encourage the platform to transition to a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, the code has incrementally been increasing the mining difficulty of the ethereum network and slowing block creation since December of last year.  Now delayed, the effects of the bomb look to have rapidly reversed. Etherscan reports within just a day of hard fork activation, block creation times on ethereum have decreased from roughly 19 seconds to 14.  Core developers are now looking ahead to a new set of EIPs for inclusion in the next ethereum hard fork, Istanbul.  The timeline for Istanbul has yet to be solidified by ethereum developers, though former core developer Afri Schoedon suggested back in January possible mainnet activation for sometime in October of this year.  Still, as highlighted by Taylor Monahan, CEO of crypto wallet tool MyCrypto, in a recent interview with CoinDesk, preparations for a hard fork a are getting increasingly difficult as the ethereum ecosystem scales to include more companies, developers and users.  “I’m always worried whenever there’s a fork because there’s so many moving pieces,” said Monahan. “You have the miners. You have the hardware or the nodes. You have Geth, Parity, Harmony and all the different client softwares. You have the exchanges, wallets and everything in between. There’s a lot of places where things can go wrong.”  Such concerns have also been voiced by major enterprise companies considering how to extend their services to incorporate the buying and selling of ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether.  Smooth activation  The latest hard fork activation on ethereum, however, was comparably smooth.  Likely due to the multiple attempts for its release as Monahon points out, the large majority of stakeholders on ethereum don’t look to have had any difficulty upgrading to the new software.  Ethereum blockchain analytics platform Alethio reports that no large fluctuations in either transaction volume or number of smart contract message calls were identified from when the hard fork activated to present day.  As seen on Etherscan, the ethereum network hashrate – a measure of the total computational power being contributed by miners to create new blocks and validate transactions – also barely saw a notable change after activation of Constantinople and St. Petersburg  This indicates that most miners on the ethereum network upgraded their computer servers (also called nodes) to mine on the newly upgraded chain, as opposed to a chain running older ethereum software.  At present, the hash rate of the ethereum network according to hard fork monitoring site ForkMon is 132,986 GH/s. Comparatively, those miners who are still contributing hash power to the non-Constantinople and St. Petersburg activated chain have a combined hash rate of 1,777 GH/s.  As a result of the remaining hash power on the old version of the ethereum blockchain, a total of 19 wasteful blocks have been mined since hard fork activation on Thursday according to Ethereum Foundation security lead Martin Holst Swende.  “These blocks have been mined on the old mainnet chain, presumably having failed to update the miner software for the Constantinople fork - a waste of money,” wrote Swende in a public GitHub note.  As such, while the majority of the nodes on ethereum did upgrade successfully, an important caveat to note is that a small but persistent number of miners have yet to migrate to the current upgraded blockchain.  To these small but select few, Ethereum Foundation security lead Swende urges in a public tweet:  “A few ethereum miners are wasting energy on [an] old chain. Please update ASAP.”  Charts image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/08/ethereum-block-count-spikes-as-difficulty-bomb-diffuses-on-schedule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94db3419c864170fef7bd93209458531d3ab5995-2560x1703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
