42378789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkWH,1466711912,Ex-Ethereum CEO: Foundation Should Not Intervene to Save The DAO,"""I think they're trying to patch up the side of the Titanic.""  So says Charles Hoskinson, the former CEO of the ethereum project when asked about the ongoing crisis surrounding The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed last week after a debilitating code exploit. Though he's since moved on to a new project in the industry, Hoskinson was among a limited number of fiduciaries for ethereum before departing in mid-2014 over a disagreement about how the project should be structured.  At issue, according to Hoskinson, was his desire for ethereum to form a VC-backed entity to develop the protocol, and then to use a non-profit organization to launch a crowdsale afterwards. However, Hoskinson said project participants moved forward with the creation of the Switzerland-based Ethereum Foundation, and he soon departed.  Now, Hoskinson says he disagrees again with how that organization, as well as Slock.it, a Germany-based startup that authored code for The DAO, are moving forward to save the troubled project. Hoskinson said the decisions made by the two groups are driven by ""greed and arrogance"", adding that the Ethereum Foundation should not have become involved in the situation in the first place.  Since the hack, members of the Foundation have moved to develop what could ultimately constitute a fork or rule change of the ethereum network, though this has yet to be decided.  ""The Foundation should not have gotten involved, or had its officers get involved. It was a clear conflict of interest,"" said Hoskinson, adding:  ""They picked winners and put themselves in a situation to benefit from it.""  Pyrrhic hope  Hoskinson went on to argue that Slock.it failed to properly vet its work, and that as a result, this both imperiled the funds that had been invested and implicated other members of the ethereum community.  He added that he believes the situation could ultimately spark class-action lawsuits.  He told CoinDesk:  ""They instead rushed into an unproven model, chained everyone's brand to it and then tried to hype the hell out of unaudited code for an experiment. Now, the Foundation has to try to clean up the mess with some Pyrrhic hope that they can avoid legal concerns.""  The DAO launched earlier this year with a mission to allow people who purchased voting tokens with ether to cast votes on how they wanted collective resources to be spent.  Still, as a result of initial enthusiasm in the idea, over 23,000 people invested more $150m in the effort before the vulnerabilties in the code resulted in the loss of a significant amount of the funds.  Knee-jerk response  Hoskinson said that he believes the response to the DAO exploit by the Ethereum development community should have shown more restraint in the immediate aftermath.  ""[Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin] made a rookie mistake. The very first thing you do is stall productively. You acknowledge there is a problem, set a date to provide more info and turtle up for 48 hours,"" he said.  A better path, he said, would have involved working actively with stakeholders, exchange operators and other members of the Ethereum community to jointly develop a solution to be presented in a concerted effort.  ""Simply knee jerk 'we are going to fork' isn't a good call,"" said Hoskinson. ""Even if you end up doing it, you need consensus from the community.""  Hoskinson's new firm, IOHK, specializes in building cryptocurrencies and blockchains for academics, governments and businesses. He said the company has 27 employees and 12 cryptographers.

42378782,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkMD,1466704754,Dutch Central Bank Presents Results of Cryptocurrency Experiments,"A senior official for the central bank of The Netherlands has presented the results of two cryptocurrency tests designed to explore how bitcoin’s blockchain might be adopted by national banking institutions.  The experiments by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) sought to simulate bitcoin both in its early days and in the year 2140, when the final bitcoins are expected to be mined. The bank presented the results at the third-annual Dutch Blockchain Conference, held just outside Amsterdam earlier this month.  The tests, conducted in 2015 but not reported until earlier this year, utilized an experimental digital currency called DNBcoin.  In a speech given at the event on 20th June, the head of the central bank's market infrastructures policy department, Ron Berndsen, explained that researchers within the institution wanted to get a hands-on experience working with the technology.  Berndsen told attendees:  ""The general idea was that by adapting the Bitcoin software ourselves we could learn deeper how an actual implementation of the blockchain really works than if we would only perform desk research and go to conferences such as these, no matter how interesting.""  Bitcoin in the beginning  To create the simulation environment, the DNB put together a working group of in-house experts who would act as fictional participants in a digital currency system.  To do so, the bank ""bootstrapped"" a team of “intrinsically motivated” members of the bank, said Berndsen. The group then adapted the open-source bitcoin software to replicate what its members believed the bitcoin ecosystem might have looked like in the first two months of the digital currency's existence.  Using five networked laptops, the DNB team mined their first DNBcoin block – known as the genesis block – and quickly generated “thousands” of more blocks. Along they way, they sent coins to one another, testing the ins and outs of the process like setting transaction fees.  The bank’s network created new blocks, along with freshly minted DNBcoins, about every three minutes, compared to the roughly 10 minutes expected in the bitcoin network, said Berndsen.  In the year 2140  Though the end of bitcoin's lifecycle is more than a century from now, the DNB wanted to simulate what those conditions might look like as well.  “The second DNBcoin prototype takes the other extreme of bitcoin by jumping to the year 2140, the year when the last fraction of the 21 million bitcoins will be issued,"" Berndsen said in his speech.  For this experiment, the central bank team needed to mine all of the DNBcoins in advance. To do so, they were created using a single laptop before opening the network to other computers.  To cut back on the amount of power needed to mine the DNBcoins, the team began with an initial block reward of 1 billion DNBcoins, then programmed the system to quickly lower the number of coins rewarded per block.  Berndsen explained:  ""In doing so we were able to generate 3 billion DNBcoins in 30 seconds. In addition, we observed that after all DNBcoins had been generated, blocks could still be mined and added to the blockchain. The reward was reduced to zero but transaction fees were still collected by the miner who finds the next block.""  While the first two prototypes were built with the specific aim of learning more about how central banks might use virtual currency, a third experiment is currently being developed to explore other aspects of blockchain.  Specifically, Berndsen listed digital assets, trust, network resilience and the ""intelligence to initiate or trigger transactions"" as areas that will “probably” be tested in the third experiment.  Obstacles to central bank adoption  Berndsen said that central banks are “increasingly” interested in blockchain because of the distributed ledger technology’s potential to improve financial market infrastructure.  But specific to the DNB, Berndsen named blockchain's potential to impact all three of its ""primary tasks"": to promote the smooth functioning of the payment system, provide supervision and oversight and inform monetary policy.  Before central banks can adopt blockchain, Berndsen named interoperability, industry fragmentation and self-interest among financial incumbents as three barriers that need to be overcome.  Berndsen concluded:  ""History teaches us that when looking ahead into the distant future, it is wiser to predict that something is possible, rather than that something is impossible. The blockchain technology offers a number of advantages over existing technologies. But there are also some drawbacks and barriers to overcome.""

42378787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkSV,1466690747,Poland to Explore Blockchain Tech in Government Digitization Effort,"Poland's Ministry of Digital Affairs is taking steps that may find it promoting digital currencies and blockchain technology.  The agency announced an expansive digitization plan last week that comes amid a broader drive among European regulators to understand the emerging tech. Called “From paper to digital Poland"", the effort will seek to promote digital public services, the development of cashless solutions and the implementation of electronic identification (eID).  Notably, one of the areas of focus will be ""blockchain and cryptocurrencies"", a program that aim to ""find regulatory, legal and economic solutions"" that will make it possible for digital currency projects to compete in the European nation.  Potential rules, while in their early stages, will aim to keep users safe and give the regulators the right to oversee such projects.  The project, while similar to others internationally, still represents a significant change in tone for the Polish government on the emerging technology.  Since the declaration from a representative of Poland's Ministry of Finance that bitcoin ""is not illegal"" in December 2013, the government has remained relatively silent on matters relating to cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain tech.  However, in February, Poland's Ministry of Digital Affairs issued a strategic document where it included bitcoin and blockchain alongside the Internet of Things as accelerating technologies that could foster country’s development.  The announcement was followed by the intensive dialogue between the Ministry of Digital Affairs and Poland’s bitcoin and blockchain tech industry. The first working meeting found Minister Anna Streżyńska and other public officials opening a dialogue with representatives of the Polish Bitcoin Association, digital currency firms, academics and lawyers last month.  A second meeting is now scheduled for July.

42378778,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkJh,1466685827,Mizuho Tests Digital Currency-Powered Settlement,"Mizuho Financial Group announced today that it has tested the use of a digital currency-based, blockchain settlement system.  The project, built in partnership with IBM, is notable given the emphasis financial incumbents have placed on using distributed ledger solutions for settlement in which information, not any finite digital asset, is shared among participants.  For example, the news follows reports that blockchain post-trade provider Cryex is struggling to gain regulatory approval for a similar, cryptocurrency-based settlement service.  However, the company's release did not discuss regulatory challenges with the project, instead focusing on illuminating its design and intent.  Mizuho’s test was created through the use of IBM’s blockchain services platform, announced in February.  IBM's summary of the news reads:    Today Mizuho Financial Group announced it is working with IBM to use blockchain technology for payment settlements using the bank's own virtual currency in a project that will explore how payments can be instantaneously swapped. This is one of several ways the bank is exploring the use of blockchain and creating a platform across the bank using the Linux Foundation Hyperledger code.      By putting blockchain through a number of rigorous tests, the bank is gaining confidence in its use and sharing their learning with the financial community. With the virtual currency pilot, the bank expects to better understand how the settlement process can be simplified in a private, secure and permissioned blockchain network.    Using its own virtual currency that trades 1:1 with the Yen in a secure environment could potentially provide better tracking and control of the exchange of funds, and eliminate some of the expenses associated with the exchange of paper-based currency.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/23/mizuho-tests-digital-currency-powered-settlement,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42378784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkRF,1466657983,Colu Raises $9.6 Million to Promote Blockchain-Based Local Currencies,"Tel Aviv-based blockchain startup Colu has raised $9.6m, a fundraising that comes amid a shift in its business model that finds it focusing on local currency issuance.  The Series A round, backed by Aleph, Spark Capital, Digital Currency Group and former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer, follows a $2.5m seed round in early 2015 that came at a time when the startup was focused on building out its underlying technology.  While Colu was formerly focused on developing colored coins technology, a top-level protocol on the bitcoin network that allows bitcoins to be augmented to represent other assets, CEO Amos Meiri said the company has now honed in on a specific use case that was the most in-demand among its users.  Meiri told CoinDesk:  ""There are a lot of other use cases for colored coins, in music, in the Internet of Things, but what we saw after a while was that more than 60% of the use cases were for local currencies. This is where our market is.""  In particular, Meiri cited bitcoin startup Bitt’s use of Colu’s technology to launch a version of the Barbadian dollar on the bitcoin blockchain as a turning point in the project.  As a result of the success of this effort, Colu is now launching two similar projects in neighborhoods in Tel Aviv.  There, Colu has created local currencies on its platform that it contends are gaining traction with users and merchants, and Meiri indicated that Colu is building services for these efforts that will make its technology easier to use.  ""We have the wallet and we have a control panel where the manager of the local economy can issue a distributed currency, gain access to data about the economy and manage it from one place,"" he said.  The company said it will look to launch local currencies in other cities around the world, including Amsterdam and Silicon Valley.  In statements, investors suggested that this strategy would allow Colu to capitalize on trends in the “new digital economy”.  “Their scalable solution has created a way to make blockchain based currencies accessible and immediately available to the market,” Santo Politi, partner at Spark Capital, said in a statement.  Tools and services  Such a positioning may seem surprising given the recent traction shown by the alternative blockchain platform ethereum, which was developed in part to enable digital currencies to be more easily launched.  However, Meiri sought to position this project as one that wouldn’t be able to reach Colu’s target market given that it is providing tools for currency issuance “not just code”.  Meiri pointed to recent issues with the ethereum platform, including the ongoing debate about the ease with which users will be able to use the technology to create advanced smart contracts, as potential indicators that its thesis on the market is correct.  “The only blockchain you can really count on right now is the bitcoin blockchain. This is the only real solution that is working and it’s working for specific use cases,” he said.  Meiri also indicated that a combination of permissioned and public blockchains would be needed to deliver the service, which he said makes Colu a better platform for users who may want to launch local currencies.  Central bank play  The announcement also comes at a time when another set of currency issuers is beginning to demonstrate an interest in blockchain technology, national central banks.  While Meiri didn’t shy away from suggesting the project could one day scale to support even larger use cases, he said the emphasis today would be on developing its tech on a smaller scale.  “We’re not waiting for central banks. It could take three to five years,” he said.  Still, Meiri hinted that Colu has strategic partners that it is working with that could allow it to scale its local currencies from single neighborhoods to whole cities.  More immediately, Meiri said the funding will help expand the Colu team from 23 employees today to more than 30 by the end of the year as it seeks to bring its technology to more users.  Meiri concluded:  ""For us, the funding is all about finally bringing the technology to users.""

42378791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkbJ,1466649725,Bitcoin Price Drops Below $600 As ‘Brexit’ Hopes Falter,"The price of bitcoin fell $100 during a five-hour span today, dropping 15% to reach a low of $551 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The move represents a continuation of the recent price correction that began when bitcoin hit a high of $774 on 18th June, a move market observers suggested was indicative of the idea that the digital currency was “overbought” after reaching two-year highs.  Such a sentiment continued to be voiced by market observers today following the day’s sharp price drop, with blockchain advisor and consultant George Samman indicating the currency's value increased ""too fast"" this month, and that as a result, price support is now weakening.  Still, sources suggested that the decline is a response to the increasing likelihood that the UK will likely vote to stay in the European Union ('Bremain'), an outcome that could be made official as soon as late Thursday night in US, Friday morning UK time, reports suggest.  The comments echo the widely held belief that bitcoin is a ""safe haven"" asset that benefits from times of macroeconomic uncertainty in which its strengths as an investment vehicle whose value is derived solely from a global market are best on display.  For example, traders have cited the ‘Brexit’ vote, as well as economic uncertainty in China as factors that propelled the price to its highest level in 28 months this June.  In statements, Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund; investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham; and Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX, all cited the coming ‘Brexit’ vote as the defining influence on the decline.  Hayes told CoinDesk:  ""The drop below $600 indicates that many traders believe that 'Bremain' will prevail. The vote is still too close to call with various polls indicating 'Brexit' and 'Bremain' in a dead heat.""  Hayes predicted the digital currency could rise to $700 should Britain vote to exit the EU, but linger at $550 if the country decides to remain in the economic union.  In turn, Samman voiced his belief that the $560 price level would be one to watch going forward, naming it a key indicator of confidence that could determine future price movements.  Still, Lingham took a more positive stance, asserting optimism will prevail following the ‘Brexit’ vote, and that the price will soon return to the $600 to $700 range.
