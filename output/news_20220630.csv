Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −27.8% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC −9.5% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE −8.7% Currency  Bitcoin Plummets Amid Latest Crypto Industry Woes  Crypto investors looking for bad news to justify a continued retreat from bitcoin had more than enough on Thursday.  There were the dual spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) rejections in the U.S. late Wednesday, one of which prompted an immediate lawsuit by Grayscale Investments, a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group. There were the Singapore central bank's reprimand of floundering crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital for misleading it with allegedly false information, a CoinDesk report of bitcoin miners facing margin calls, of crypto futures exchange CoinFLEX continuing to halt withdrawals and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) deeming crypto assets possible threat to traditional financial systems a ""matter of urgency.""  There was even ex-Monero developer Ricardo “Fluffypony” Spagni agreeing to surrender to U.S. Marshals Service for extradition to South Africa.  Already rocked by four days of discouraging economic indicators, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which had held on stubbornly above the $20,000 threshold for much of the past two weeks, fell below $19,000 and was recently down nearly 6% over the past 24 hours. A number of analysts earlier in the week had been expecting bitcoin to break its support even as they admired its resilience.  ""Negative crypto headlines have been nonstop and fresh concerns that the regulatory environment will be rather harsh going forward has really kept sentiment down,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, also plummeted and was recently trading just above $1,000, down almost 7%. Other major altcoins assumed various shades of red, including the tokens from troubled protocols Terra (UST) and Celsius (CEL), which tumbled over 40% and 19% at one point. MATIC and DOGE were both off about 8%.  Cryptos' Thursday drop went steps further than major stock indexes, which closed with modest losses. The tech-focused Nasdaq, whose performance digital assets have tracked in recent months, fell 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each declined by less than a percentage point. The S&P finished the first half of the year with its biggest downturn since 1970, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bitcoin has dropped over 60% this year.  Mark Lurie, the CEO of crypto software provider Shipyard Software, saw a deeper significance in the decline, rooted more in the U.S. central bank's increasing single-mindedness to tame inflation, even at the expense of recession, than the Securities and Exchange Commission ETF rejections and other events. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his commitment to monetary hawkishness while acknowledging anew the possibility of recession as the money supply tightens.  ""Powell signaled the Fed’s resolve yesterday to tame inflation, even at the risk of a recession,"" Lurie wrote to CoinDesk. ""This was already priced into the broader markets, and most institutional crypto investors already expect further downside and a long recession. But retail is often a bit more hopeful and may finally be getting the message.""  However, Lurie remains wary of the Fed's purpose. ""The bigger question on the horizon is whether the Fed will keep its resolve when the costs become clear,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,785 -0.8%  DJIA: 30,775 -0.8%  Nasdaq: 11,028 -1.3%  Gold: $1,807 0.6%  Insights  Speculating on Tokenized Carbon Offsets Won't Help Prevent Climate Change: Consultant  Tokenized carbon offsets were once a favorite of Web2 investors trying to dip their toes into the Web3 world, while also maintaining a certain distance from what critics call the worst parts of blockchain.  Mark Cuban was at one time a big evangelist of Toucan Protocol’s Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) protocol, and spent tens of thousands of dollars bridging carbon offsets onto BCT. Cuban also invested in KlimaDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that wanted to create a lucrative market for carbon by pumping up BCT.  It’s hoped that if there’s a lucrative and liquid market for carbon, with its value being pushed up through speculation, projects that capture carbon could easily get funding because their offsets would be that much more valuable.  “You can’t speculate on carbon offset assets. That’s not how the science works,” Taipei-based carbon consultant Nate Maynard, who also hosts the sustainability science podcast ""Waste Not Why Not,"" told CoinDesk.  Worse, as Maynard highlights, a significant portion of these carbon credits are from projects that are eight to 10 years old. Buying credits from these projects is useless by international carbon accounting norms because the project has been already financed and is in operation.  “If you're buying credits from 2016 for emissions that you're doing in 2021, people are going to look at that, and when you get it reviewed then you have to explain it to your stakeholders why didn't we buy offsets from something that has a more tangible impact,” he said.  In May, Verra, a hybrid standards agency and registry responsible for carbon credits, said it would disconnect the Toucan protocol, which powers BCT, because of BCT's purchases of retired credits for the purpose of speculation. Robin Vix, Verra’s chief legal, policy and markets officer, called what BCT engaged in “mind frying.”  Besides, there are too many other problems in the carbon offset and accounting world that blockchain can’t solve, ironically involving trust.  Carbon offsetting involves all sorts of trust issues to verify the authenticity of the data coming from the project. Outside audits are expensive and out of the reach for many of the projects in the developing world.  Maynard gives an example of an offsets project he’s familiar with in Myanmar at a mangrove. Mangrove trees are well-known carbon sinks; every tree planted can remove hundreds of kilograms of carbon throughout its lifetime. But if this is going to be commodified and traded, it needs to be verified ⁠– and that was going to cost the project close to $1 million, an impossible figure for a budget of its scale. But at the same time, corporations (the usual customers of these offsets) are requiring verification of real carbon mitigation or removal.  “The blockchain doesn't solve this trust issue, maybe in some ways just locks in a lack of trust. Because if something is done and then it's put on the blockchain, everyone goes, ‘well, it's on the blockchain,’” Maynard said.  Because of the issue surrounding trust, the industry is moving to prioritize high-quality offsets and many verified renewable energy certificates effectively cover carbon offsets for many corporations.  As for BCT and KlimaDAO, which derives its value from BCT, they aren’t doing that well, to put it mildly. BCT is trading at around $2, down from a high of $8.60 at the end of last year. KlimaDAO has also suffered a similar fate losing nearly 99% of its value down to $3 from $3700.  Cuban, however, made off handsomely. Analysis of on-chain data by Protos shows that Cuban made almost $2 million in profit from KlimaDAO and BCT tokens, largely through figuring out an arbitrage play between the two.  But what did this do to offset carbon emissions?

These actions could include “pursuing strategic transactions” and “restructuring its liabilities,” among other strategies, the company said. “These exhaustive explorations are complex and take time, but we want the community to know that our teams are working with experts from many different disciplines,” Celsius wrote.  On June 12, Celsius announced it was freezing withdrawals and transfers in response to “extreme market conditions,” fueling rumors that the platform had become insolvent. The move left 1.7 million users unable to redeem their assets, and sparked fears that funds would be locked indefinitely.  The firm has hired restructuring consultants from Alvarez & Marsal, an advisory firm, to explore the possibility of bankruptcy filings, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke to the Wall Street Journal last week.  The lender’s financial issues come amid a wider crypto market crash. In May, algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its sister coin LUNA imploded spectacularly in a $40 billion collapse, destabilizing the cryptocurrency market and spurring $300 billion in losses across the cryptocurrency economy.  The crash has been driven, in part, by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to fight sky-high inflation through a series of aggressive interest rate hikes, which has fueled a bout of risk-off selling of digital assets.  Prior to the crash, Celsius experienced massive success in its fundraising, accruing $750 million in its latest funding round in November 2021 at a valuation just north of $3.25 billion. As of May 2022, the firm had lent out more than $8 billion to clients and had $12 billion in assets under management.

42421130,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWBx,1656626472,Vitalik's Mom Offers Advice on How to Make It in Crypto,"Crypto, as big as it once was, often feels like a family affair – and sometimes that’s literally true. Natalia Ameline is the mother of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, but she may be better known for her personal contributions to the crypto industry.  She’s the founder of CryptoChicks, an educational non-profit dedicated to supporting women, and a leader of Metis, a startup that’s building a promising scalable layer 2 companion system for Ethereum that’s run as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  “I want to be part of something great,” Ameline told CoinDesk in an interview. For her, that means being a part of a DAO and investment collective working to expand the Ethereum ecosystem.  Like other scaling systems such as Arbitrum and Optimism, Metis uses a novel technology called Optimistic roll-ups to essentially create a more efficient version of Ethereum. Although all part of the same family tree, layer 2s often develop quite distinct ecosystems – and Ameline has high ambitions that a host of non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance applications and other crypto tools will make their home on Metis.  See also: Ethereum’s Rollups Aren’t All Built the Same  “You need to have a lot of perseverance and a lot of patience,” she said when asked what it takes to find success in crypto. It’s those qualities she sees in Vitalik that help explain his success: He was willing to “stick around” and put the time in, she said. “It wasn’t easy.”  CoinDesk caught up with Ameline for “Future of Work Week,” to hear more about her contributions to crypto, the changing nature of work and how her son’s invention is changing the world. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.  Considering your background in business administration accounting, what does your day-to-day look like doing investor relations at a DAO?  I am a lead on the ecosystem fund, which we call Genesi, that invests in projects building on Metis. We look at projects that come to build on Metis, which fit what we're looking for, select the best projects and present them to investors.  Genesi is a bit unusual – It's essentially a joint project by investors of Metis. Everyone [involved] was super passionate about our ecosystem and looking to support it so they got together and formed an investment fund. It’s maybe more like an investment club.  We’re trying to create a DAO, and will actually be operated on-chain in the future. We're building infrastructure for that. But at the moment, Genesi exists offline, if you will.  What is missing from DAO tooling today?  I think one of the tools that will really help a lot is actually reputation power, which is something that Metis will launch shortly – a product called Matrix. It's a reputation power system based on the concept of soulbound tokens that will allow you to have your digital identity online.  It’s a bit like an on-chain resume, where you will have tokens for you to participate in different activities – contributing to different deals or open source projects, going to university or doing work for some charity.  The idea could be useful not just for individuals but for companies. It also could become part of your credit score. It's really like your identity on-chain. And once DAOs are equipped with that you also will be able to see the ranking of contributors.  Do you think DAOs are already changing how we work?  People don't want to work for someone, they want to work for themselves. Some people are forming these cooperatives. For example, one of the projects we'll talk about is like a cooperative of developers. So they all formed a DAO. The DAO can subcontract to any companies that are looking for developers.  This work can become part of your on-chain history, and then you build your resume that way. You will be able to see on-chain what exactly individuals have been working on, how successful they were, what their rating is, etc.  There are many different opportunities there. I think a lot of them maybe haven't even been explored yet. Somebody asked me, what's a great use case [for crypto]? It's something that hasn't been developed yet! We're very early. I keep saying that.  I really think that this gig economy that everybody is talking about is going to be a big thing. Younger people just want to do their own thing, they want to work independently, they want to travel, they don't want to have to be connected to any particular one entity. They want to be the owners of their time.  And I think working in cooperatives like this really helps. Because you can work when you want, how you want and with whom you want.  Do you consider yourself as someone with power or influence? What do you think of your own success or influence in crypto or the bigger world?  No, I don't consider myself in that way. I positioned myself as a member of the team. I want to be part of something great that we're building, and I am super happy that I can contribute to Metis.  If we step back to CryptoChicks, I'm super happy I am part of it and co-founder of it. We were able to, and continue to be able to, help women around the world to learn about what crypto technology has to offer. A lot of them got into the business.  As the co-founder of CryptoChicks, what do you think about women in crypto now? Is it hard for women in this industry?  I think the situation with women in crypto has improved a lot. There are many organizations around the world that are working on similar goals as CryptoChicks. There are so many more females who are not just part of the scene, but they are also active members of projects.  See also: Meet Vitalik Buterin's Mom. Her Mission Is Inclusion, Not Ethereum  How could crypto fundamentally change how we work?  Crypto is already providing alternatives. Traditional fundraising is very different from what's in crypto. Back in 2017, there were a lot of ICOs (initial coin offerings) that were put up. We're raising money now for communities on distributed platforms. Crypto democratizes access to money. Instead of getting it from one fund, you really can run a global fundraiser, it simplifies the way you can do it.  I think it democratizes the labor market, too. Right now, you don't need to work in a certain country to do a certain type of job in crypto. As long as they qualify to do the work, nothing prevents you from getting employed. Also, you don’t need to wire money through the complex bank account system. You can do it pretty fast. You can transfer it from one country to the next without any issues, which is convenient for companies.  What do you think of Vitalik’s success?  I'm super happy for him, obviously. I think he accomplished a lot for somebody of his age. I think he owes his success also for perseverance and patience, and sticking around and putting a lot of time into it. It wasn't easy. You really have to love what you do. And I think Vitalik really enjoys what he does. He's passionate about it, and he works tirelessly on it.  What advice would you give to someone trying to make it in crypto?  I would say that you need to have a lot of perseverance and a lot of patience. If you got into crypto as an investment, you really need to be able to kind of stick with it. I see a mistake a lot of people are making: They will invest and when the market turns the wrong way they get out, sometimes at a loss. And they never want to go back anymore because they got burned. It’s painful.  I think with anything in life, in order to succeed you really need to study it. And you need to stick around and persevere despite your experiences. So you do need a lot of patience. And you do need to be able to say right now is a bear market, but we'll just keep working. We'll keep focusing and we will get there.  I think people should not be afraid to try new things. It's hard to make a jump and go into the unknown. My suggestion would be to try as many things as you can. I think when you grow older, the only experiences that you remember [should not be] how you sit in the office and [at] the same desk for the last 40 years.

VET Price Drops 30% In Downtrend,"The crypto market continues on its downtrend, and VeChain (VET) follows after expiring some relief over the last weekend. The cryptocurrency recently breached a major level of support and seems poised to expand its downside price action. Related Reading | Fed Announces Inflation Warnings As Bitcoin Whales Remain In Wait Mode At the time of writing, VET&apos;s price trades at $0.022 with a 3% and 32% loss over the last 24 hours and the past month respectively. According to crypto analyst Justin Bennett, VeChain lost a major area of support when it broke below $0.024. As seen below, this area was the last line of resistance for a &apos;neckline&apos; or a trendline that saw VET&apos;s price after an increase in previous selling pressure. Not everything is lost for the bulls, the analyst believes, as long as VeChain is capable of holding above $0.021. This area is a &apos;much more significant support for the market&apos;. In case of further downside action, VET&apos;s price could drop into this support line before seeing some relief. If the price manages to get back above the neckline, it could support a bullish continuation. However, traders should wait for confirmation if VET&apos;s price can return to $0.024 and then to $0.026. Beyond that point, $0.028 seems like a very important area of resistance.

42422971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0Ph,1656624407,Do Rate Hikes Matter? Bitcoin Traders Learn How Fed Moves Markets in Twitter Era,"The last time inflation was as high as it is now, in the 1980s, Paul Volcker was chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ronald Reagan was president. There was no internet, no social media, no Twitter; sure, there was TV and radio; but for the most part, any decisions policymakers made on interest rates – the primary economic tool officials used to bring down inflation – would be read about the following day when the newspaper arrived, sometimes via the mail.  These days, the Fed is effectively telling traders about interest rate increases before they are even announced.  With soaring consumer prices again in the headlines as a national concern, Fed officials’ every word is disseminated and digested instantaneously and then priced into markets in real time. The resulting dynamic has increased not only the power of officials like the current Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, to affect markets from stocks to bonds to bitcoin – but also to draw instant scrutiny and feedback, with lots of second guessing.  For an example of how this works in practice, look at the sequence of events and news leading up to the Fed’s last rate hike earlier this month. On June 10 (a Friday), the consumer price index (CPI) – the most widely tracked inflation gauge – showed that inflation had unexpectedly accelerated in May to a new four-decade high.  The following Monday, the Wall Street Journal, known to be in close contact with Fed officials, reported that the U.S. central bank was considering a 75-basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike; previously, the officials had signaled that a 50-basis point increase was likely.  Shortly after the report, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which analyzes the probability of rate moves at upcoming meetings of the rate-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, showed that traders saw a 94% chance of a 75-basis point hike at the next meeting, up from 35% odds just one day before that.  “That was a little unusual because they got spooked by the May inflation number, so they wanted to do 75 basis points, and they wanted the markets to be prepared for it, so they leaked it,” said Steven Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard, an economic forecasting firm.  Representatives from Dow Jones, owner of the Wall Street Journal, didn't immediately return a request for comment.  The Fed met for a two-day closed-door meeting on June 14-15 to discuss next steps. To no one’s surprise, the FOMC raised the fed-funds rate by 75 basis points.  During a press conference after the decision, the first question came at Powell: How did the rapid change of plans play out? He responded that it's important, now more than ever to “provide even more clarity than usual.”  “We got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, 'Well, this is the appropriate thing to do,'"" Powell elaborated. ""So, then the question is, What do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is, that’s not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did.”  Powell has acknowledged that markets already know what the central bank’s next step will be.  “The forward rate curve is pricing in a rate path that looks a whole lot like the summary of economic projections that my colleagues and I submitted in June,” Powell said at a meeting at the European Central Bank forum on Wednesday. “That's the market understanding and finding credible what we're reading.”  The dynamic almost raises the question of whether the eventual rate hikes even matter. From the standpoint of markets, the impact of the Fed's pronouncements on future rate increases are already starting to affect the economy.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve is now forecasting a 1% slowdown in gross domestic product in the second quarter. Given that GDP fell by 1.4% in the first quarter, that would mean that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. Mortgage rates have also soared and are already hitting the housing market.  During a testimony in front of lawmakers earlier this month, Powell said: “Financial conditions have already priced in additional rate increases, but we need to go ahead and have them.”  ‘Forward guidance’ by the Fed is not new, but different  This “forward guidance” stance by the Fed isn't new. Ben Bernanke, who served as Fed chairman from 2006 to 2014, said at a Brookings Institution event last month that “monetary policy is 98% talk and 2% action.”  But the Fed’s forward guidance under Powell is very different from Bernanke’s Fed, which left room to maneuver in case of unpredicted economic circumstances – or unexpected data like the worse-than-expected inflation report in May, which caused the Fed to change its original rate hike plan.  “I think it has backfired a little bit because it tends to tie their hands, and so you ended up with this embarrassing situation a few weeks ago where they told everybody 50 and then at the last minute they made it 75,” said David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and former Wall Street Journal economics editor.  Today’s Fed is much more specific  “I think it is a matter of emphasis,"" said John Silvia, former chief economist for Wells Fargo and founder of Dynamic Economic Strategy. ""Both guidance and interest rates moves have been in vogue since Bernanke, but the forward guidance really came through with Powell.”  During the Bernanke era, this new transparency by the central bank came with controversy among traders who believed that it weakened the effectiveness of the tightening if the system isn’t shocked.  The communication philosophy changed “from a view that central banks are more powerful when they surprise the markets to central banks are more powerful when they explain to the markets what they're thinking,” Wessel said.  “They say we’re thinking about doing 50 basis points at each of the next two meetings, that specificity is different,” he added.  This new level of transparency is also likely a result of the Fed wanting to protect today’s volatile markets, which are already suffering from macroeconomic uncertainty, which means that traders have to watch every word the Fed is saying, because “they do get the tightening without actually having to raise rates,” Blitz of TS Lombard said.  Because bitcoin is now trading in sync with traditional markets, all this means that crypto traders are now hanging on every word that drips from the mouths of Fed officials.  “We pay close attention to some of the major proxies that the Fed uses to signal prior to meetings,” said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Global Trading, a crypto firm. “In particular, they seem to favor the economics correspondent at the Wall Street Journal to communicate their intentions and reasoning to the market.” (Genesis and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.)",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/30/do-rate-hikes-matter-bitcoin-traders-learn-how-fed-moves-markets-in-twitter-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0444ba82ccff23c8fed6476d3b638a6772cb1ce6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422973,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0Th,1656621060,New York Environmental Regulators Deny Greenidge’s Power Plant Permit,"The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has denied bitcoin mining operation Greenidge Generation’s application to renew an air permit required to continue operating in New York.  Regulators said Greenidge’s application was inconsistent with the climate goals laid out by the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which aims to reduce New York’s greenhouse gas emission by at least 85% by 2050.  The decision comes on the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), deciding that the Clean Air Act – the most powerful anti-air pollution law in the country – does not give the federal agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The decision limits federal authority to tackle climate goals, leaving them in the hands of individual state authorities.  Greenidge has been under fire from environmentalists for its use of fossil fuels to power its proof-of-work (PoW) mining operation on Seneca Lake in upstate New York. In its rejection letter to Greenidge, the NYSDEC cited the “dramatic” increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the Dresden-based facility since the Climate Act took effect. The plant is powered by natural gas, though it was originally a coal-fired facility before Greenidge’s parent, Atlas Holdings, refitted it.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Greenidge said the decision would not “have any impact on our current operations in Dresden.” The company said it will continue to operate under its current air permit, which is still in effect, “for as long it takes to successfully challenge this arbitrary and capricious decision.”  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul took to social media to celebrate the decision, tweeting:  “I applaud NYSEC’s decision, which will stop future increases in greenhouse gas emissions at Seneca Lake.”  Hochul has not yet signed a bill passed by the New York state Legislature that would impose a two-year moratorium on certain types of crypto mining operations.  Instead, crypto mining advocates are hoping Hochul will opt to sign a different bill sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman Clyde Vanel that would create a task force to study the environmental impacts of the cryptocurrency industry in New York.  Unions, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers – which has members employed at Greenidge’s Dresden facility – have pushed back against both the proposed mining moratorium and Thursday’s decision by the NYSDEC.  “It is a sad day in New York State, when we can throw away good paying jobs in a hi-tech field,” Mike Davis, a member of the IBEW Local 840 chapter, wrote in a statement shared with CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/30/new-york-environmental-regulators-deny-greenidges-power-plant-permit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdeae909650fd617d095af4a06662f38bf0e3bab-2976x1984.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422974,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0Xh,1656620936,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Heads for Record Half-Year Loss of 59%,"Hi, I'm Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price fell for a fifth straight day, heading toward the worst half-year loss on record. An adverse regulatory decision late Wednesday from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission squelched what little hope traders might have had of a quick rebound.  As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands just below $19,000, down 5.6% over the past 24 hours.  On the last day of the month, the one superlative in the market wasn't much to brag about: The January-June stretch marked bitcoin's worst six-month stretch on record, down 59%, based on data going back to the early 2010s.  Thursday's leg down came after the SEC rejected the application by CoinDesk sister company Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a bitcoin-holding exchange-traded fund. Other dismal industry news continues to pile up: CoinFLEX withdrawals remain halted as the company continue talks over a ""recovery token.""  And while $20,000 had been seen as a key pivot point for bitcoin's price, analysts are now daring to discuss an even more pessimistic milestone.  ""Bitcoin could be vulnerable to one more ugly plunge that could have many traders fearing a fall towards the $10,000 area,"" Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Polygon's MATIC token slid 10% and ether (ETH) lost 8.6%.  In traditional markets, a slowdown in consumer spending rattled investors and raised fears anew about a coming recession while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was headed for its worst first-half performance since the 1970s.

42374418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRyn,1656617791,"EU Agrees on Landmark Crypto Authorization Law, MiCA","BRUSSELS — European Union (EU) policymakers have struck a deal on landmark legislation to regulate crypto assets and service providers throughout the bloc's 27 member nations.  The policymakers, who represent the world’s third-largest economy, have been haggling for nearly two years over the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework. As it stood on Thursday, the legislative package sets up requirements for crypto issuers to publish a kind of technical manifesto called a ""white paper,"" to register with the authorities and to keep proper bank-style reserves for stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of an asset such as sovereign currencies like the euro).  Stefan Berger, the parliamentarian in charge of seeing MiCA through the EU's complex legislative process, tweeted confirmation that policymakers had reached an agreement. The news was also hailed by the European Commission's Mairead McGuiness as she left the talks, which dragged on for nearly seven hours.  “I think everybody's now aware that you can't have an unregulated sector,” McGuinness told CoinDesk, referring to turbulence seen in recent weeks in crypto markets.  “We're glad that we're leading on this,” she said, adding that “we do think there needs to be international cooperation because it's important that we don't regulate on our own.”  McGuinness has previously called for the U.S. to cooperate on crypto regulation, and there are recent signs that the Biden administration is considering its own stablecoin laws.  McGuinness also suggested this is not the end of the story, after the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde said further laws would be needed to deal with new areas like crypto lending.  “No legislation is ever set in stone, and no legislation in the area of crypto could be,” McGuinness said. “Those who are in this space are thinking of being innovative will now do it in a way that sits within our regulation rather than in the Wild West.”  One official familiar with the talks told CoinDesk that, under the final deal, non-fungible tokens (NFT) would be excluded from the scope of the law altogether unless the NFTs can be split up or fractionalized – meaning multiple people can own parts of an NFT.  Lawmaker Ernest Urtasun tweeted that the deal would include a cap on large stablecoins that become widely used as a means of payment, meaning that they can’t exceed 200 million euros of transactions per day.  MiCA was originally put forward by the European Commission in September 2020 in an attempt to address a slew of crypto fundraising projects called initial coin offerings (ICO) that often proved bogus. The law needed approval from EU governments and lawmakers to pass – which it now has.  MiCA has been broadly welcomed by the industry because it can increase credibility, promote adoption by conventional banks and offer crypto companies a single license to operate across the bloc.  Read more: NFT, Private Wallet Fates Hang on EU Crypto Talks This Week  But many grew increasingly anxious over later attempts by lawmakers to extend the reach of the law to cover decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs as well as limit the environmental impact of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that underpins bitcoin.  In the last phase of talks, the focus was on whether NFT service providers – which include marketplaces such as OpenSea – should need to seek regulatory authorization to operate within the bloc.  The law also introduces tough requirements for stablecoin issuers. The stablecoin rules were initially proposed as a reaction to libra, the cryptocurrency proposed by the former Facebook, which finance ministers worried would usurp governments’ role in controlling money. Though libra (later renamed diem) is now no more, the idea of strict regulations for stablecoin issuers has gained favor following the dramatic collapse of terraUSD last month.  The legislative deal comes as U.S. lawmakers consider rules of their own, particularly for the stablecoin market. It also follows hot on the heels of controversial anti-money laundering measures that the EU agreed to impose on crypto service providers Wednesday.

42421501,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW6f,1656616924,Welcome to a Day in the Life of a 'Chief Metaverse Officer',"Mentioning the metaverse to most people my age will often elicit a bemused expression and the statement they have no idea what the metaverse is. Mentioning that a former tax partner and current partner emeritus is now possibly the first “chief metaverse officer” in the world … well, need I say more?  An explanation: Prager Metis has always had a significant entertainment clientele and a related business management division. During the recent non-fungible token (NFT) boom, many clients were looking to get into the space. Others were already minting NFTs.  Jerry Eitel is the chief metaverse officer at Prager Metis. This article is part of “The Future of Work Week.”  In discussions about their opportunities, we saw our opportunity to expand our business and our brand into the digital frontier. Although someone might have considered it trendy or a way to seek attention, it was a natural extension for us to open the first Certified Public Accountant (CPA) office in the metaverse.  Even before we purchased virtual land in Decentraland and paid a designer to build our office, there were many new ventures going into the metaverse. Some were extremely successful. Some were extremely well funded. Many were fledgling. Mainly, we saw that many new roles were being created like Discord and community managers. My role is just another new role.  Read more: Young Web3 Believers Unfazed by Battered Crypto Market  Being tech-forward can be a competitive advantage. By getting into the weeds of the metaverse, we were able to talk the talk with NFT startups and investors. We understand the complexity of the blockchain when it comes to accounting and tax, both domestically and internationally.  A day in the life  On the most mundane and annoying level, I am doing some accounting for a startup, Banquet Labs, in which many of our partners are invested. There are multiple wallets, multiple cryptocurrencies and multiple NFTs involved.  I try to keep my finger on the metaverse pulse. Often I traverse various Discord communities (a gamer-focused chat platform I had no idea existed until about a year ago). I also search the internet on the various virtual worlds or go into their platforms to see if there is anything new.  There are scheduled meetings with prospective clients and potential business referral sources. Someone might see my name somewhere and send me an email. We set up a Teams or Zoom meeting and we see if it makes mutual sense for us to go further.  Also, many of our partners refer us business. I am always on these initial meetings and operate like a quarterback passing opportunities off to our tax and audit partners. What works very well for us is for me to discuss what we have done, how we are living in this space and for the tax and audit specialists to also explain their experience in the space.  When meeting specifically with potential metaverse clients, it helps to see how we are fully invested in the digital world and understand the complexities of accounting, auditing and both domestic and international tax in the digital space. We talk the talk about virtual land, MetaMask wallets and making payments in crypto.  Learning process  Having been in this role for several months now, the most significant thing I’ve learned is that while this role may appear to be highly technical, I am most impactful in my position when I am building connections. In addition to being the point person for those already in the space, I see my role as providing clarity for those looking to enter this virtual landscape and to help them understand the ways in which they can leverage virtual reality to reach a wider audience and break down barriers to accessibility.  I have met with individuals and companies across many industries including digital assets, sports, art, entertainment, music, fashion, hospitality, real estate and insurance either toying with the idea or actively seeking to enter the metaverse.  Read more: ‘I Don't Follow Trends’: Multicoin’s Kyle Samani on How to Make It in Crypto  The task is to help companies expand by working with them to understand and lessen the gap between the metaverse and our real world. We can do this because we already have a significant digital practice and a very strong and experienced team in place working with clients ranging from small NFT start-ups to one of the largest crypto exchanges.  Although the majority of my day is spent meeting with prospective and existing clients, a portion of my responsibility is also going to be focused on working on our grand opening in Decentraland. As our metaverse client roster expands, so too are we.  But beyond retaining new talent, we believe it is critical to first invest in the upskilling of our own. This includes training employees in metaverse operations related to their job function and providing education about Web3 and the evolving markets capabilities.  The challenging part of leading an organization’s metaverse sector is the platform’s relatively new emergence. There are no set guidelines on how to be successful, but we will endeavor to ensure our organization and staff are fully immersed and knowledgeable, because, as in any industry, hands-on experience with the metaverse is invaluable.  Creative potential  The most interesting aspect of my job is the variety of people I meet on a day-to-day basis. I have worked in accounting and real estate for the past 35 years with clients from around the world, but for the most part they tend to operate in similar business-focused industries. The amazing thing about the metaverse is the creative opportunities it provides and, thus, the creative people drawn to the platform.  In the past six months, I have communicated with many entrepreneurs and entertainers and also with their teams. The metaverse is malleable in nature, and it is also my job to show traditional industries and traditionally “non-tech” companies how they too can flourish and benefit from the platform. Most notably, my role as CMVO has provided our firm with the opportunity to work with clients operating in world social causes from the environment to the empowerment of underserved communities.  For example, Banquet Labs worked with The Female Quotient, a women’s workplace equality group that has entered the metaverse to ensure women have the necessary resources to leverage the power of Web3 in business and beyond. They offer spaces for women and minority groups to connect, offering expanded access to professional networking opportunities and educational experiences.  It is my belief that although the crypto and NFT markets are down now, this is an asset class that is ultimately going to prove to be both socially responsible and financially rewarding.  Working as the bridge builder between the real world and the virtual universe has been an incredible eye-opening experience in the ways the metaverse is allowing people access to opportunities and information and resources that were at one time unavailable to them due to the barriers of the real world.

USD Coin All Exchanges Reserve Has Been Climbing Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there have been signs of selling from Bitcoin investors for moving into USDC. The USD Coin &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of the stablecoin currently present in wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means investors are either depositing their USDC to exchanges right now, or shifting to the stablecoin from other cryptos. Investors usually move into stablecoins like USD Coin when they want to escape from the volatility associated with cryptos like Bitcoin. On the other hand, when the value of the reserve heads down, it implies the amount of USDC on exchanges is decreasing at the moment.

The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, an intergovernmental group composed of the heads of several financial regulators, met Thursday to discuss recent stablecoin activities and future legislation. This legislation would be introduced by the House Financial Services Committee, the official said.  Thursday’s meeting was planned to let regulators and other participants review recent events in the stablecoin sector, including algorithmic stablecoins, the official said. It was also meant to involve the participants in the efforts to move legislation this year.  This legislative package, which has yet to be finalized or introduced, would define stablecoins for the purposes of U.S. regulation and address how they’re used. It would also preserve existing regulatory authority over the sector, the official said.  How stablecoins are issued is another detail the participants in the meeting discussed.  Thursday’s meeting was constructive, the official told CoinDesk.

42394512,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAUVr,1656611229,Everything You Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs,"A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the value of bitcoin. ETFs can be bought, sold and traded on traditional stock market exchanges instead of cryptocurrency trading platforms. It is a solid way to give mainstream investors and speculators bitcoin price exposure through a reliable vehicle with which they are likely already familiar.  Exchange-traded funds are not a new invention and are common in the financial sector. ETFs can be found to gain price exposure to different assets and industries, including commodities and currencies, or can be set up to focus on companies that are environmentally friendly or focus on diversity.  Currently, the United States has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, though investors can invest in bitcoin futures ETFs. The difference between the two is a spot bitcoin ETF is backed with actual bitcoin (BTC), while bitcoin futures ETFs are backed by bitcoin derivatives.  The addition of a bitcoin ETF would expand the pool of available options to U.S. investors. Recently, news that asset management giant BlackRock could be filing for an ETF application have renewed interest and optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF could be approved in the U.S.  See Also: BlackRock May Have Found Way to Get SEC Approval for Spot Bitcoin ETF  What are the benefits and drawbacks of a bitcoin ETF?  Although anyone can buy bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange or through a bitcoin ATM, an ETF would offer various benefits, including:  Convenience: An ETF doesn’t require learning how to use a crypto wallet or opening accounts at crypto exchanges.  Users do not own BTC directly, gaining price exposure without asset ownership through investment vehicles they are more familiar with and tax rules they know.  Portfolio diversification: An ETF can hold more than one asset. A bitcoin ETF could hold actual BTC, bitcoin-related stocks and other assets as part of the fund. Even if it only holds BTC, investors gain an option to diversify their portfolios held in traditional markets.  Although these benefits are significant, a bitcoin ETF can only do so much. There will always be some things one may consider to be a disadvantage:  Fees: ETFs often have management fees baked into the fund, meaning that a percentage of the money in the pool is going not to investments but to pay the people/company managing the fund. Check out what the “expense ratio” listed on an ETF is before investing – you want it to be as low as possible, under 1% ideally.  No actual bitcoin ownership: A bitcoin ETF cannot be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies as holders do not own the asset but merely gain price exposure.  More rigid trading hours: Crypto can be bought or sold 24/7, but financial exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are open only Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. ET to 4 p.m. ET, so if there is significant movement in BTC’s price overnight you can’t do anything about it until the market re-opens.  Inaccurate pricing: A bitcoin price increase/decrease may not be reflected in the ETF value in real time, especially if the ETF has multiple holdings.  Accessing bitcoin ETFs  While the U.S. has yet to approve any kind of bitcoin ETF, it exists in other regions. The growing popularity of the cryptocurrency industry has enabled various providers to issue a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in other countries. Notable examples include:  Canada: 3IQ Coinshares, Purpose Bitcoin and CI Galaxy Bitcoin  Europe: 21Shares Bitcoin ETP, BTCetc - ETC Group Physical Bitcoin, VanEck Bitcoin ETN, Iconic Funds Physical Bitcoin ETP and Bitpanda Bitcoin ETC  Brazil: QR Capital's Bitcoin ETF  Jersey: WisdomTree Bitcoin  While there isn't a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. yet, there are bitcoin futures ETFs and ways to invest in ETFs that focus on bitcoin-invested or adjacent companies. These ETFs may hold companies that invest in bitcoin such as Tesla (TSLA) or support mining infrastructure or other technology.  Read More: How to Invest in Bitcoin Without Owning Bitcoin  Bitcoin ETF progress in the U.S.  Many people look toward the United States to get truly excited about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Gaining approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proven challenging, with over a dozen applications and proposals rejected over the past few years.  The SEC allowed the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund in October 2021, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and approved Teucrium's Bitcoin Futures ETF in April 2022. That progress has rekindled hope in the minds of some cryptocurrency investors, but as of writing, the prospects of approval for a spot bitcoin ETF still seem low.  Grayscale Investments had hoped to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot bitcoin ETF, but the SEC rejected its application as well as Bitwise’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF on June 29, 2022 (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company).  The SEC stated concerns around preventing market manipulation and others as reasons for its rejection in its filing. Grayscale, in response, has filed a lawsuit against the SEC asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC's order.  While there are a few companies who have re-filed applications to the SEC for approval of bitcoin ETFs, the June 2023 application by BlackRock may be the best shot for U.S. investors hoping for a spot bitcoin ETF in the near future.  Is a bitcoin ETF better than owning bitcoin?  There is no clear-cut answer to this question. Every investor has different needs and expectations. For example, a bitcoin ETF does not represent BTC ownership but it still offers the necessary price exposure. Moreover, an ETF can be more useful to those who prefer a more passive price exposure, users who are wary of bitcoin, or traders looking to diversify their portfolios conveniently.  On the other hand, owning bitcoin is good for those who want to engage in regular trading, spend BTC as a currency, or venture deeper into cryptocurrencies through trading or other means.  Anyone can buy bitcoin from an exchange, broker or ATM after verifying their identity, whereas spot bitcoin ETFs have yet to gain SEC approval. Futures-based ETFs exist for bitcoin, but only price exposure may not be sufficient for everyone.

42421503,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW8j,1656609838,Hedge or Cause? Unpacking Bitcoin and Inflation,"It shouldn’t be controversial to say that bitcoin (BTC) benefited from the huge money prints the U.S. and other governments made during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. monetary supply ballooned in the first two years of the third decade of the 21st century – and some of that capital surely spilled into digital assets.  At the time the CARES Acts were passed (which pushed over $3 trillion into the economy), there was a popular but mostly untested hypothesis that bitcoin would act as a hedge against inflation. Because bitcoin is limited to just 21 million coins, some argued it would function like gold and could be used to hedge against rising prices.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Inflation happens when there’s more money chasing the same amount of goods, causing prices to rise. As it happened, crypto – along with most other speculative asset classes – saw a dramatic rally as the money printers “went brrr.” Now, as the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes rates to curb the highest inflation in decades, BTC is on pace to record its worst quarter ever.  See also: Bitcoin Drops to Nearly $19K as Fed Renews Inflation Warnings  To be fair, it seems like everyone is learning on the spot. “We now understand better how little we understand about inflation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday. As prices began to rise last year, the Fed’s position was that inflation would be “transitory,” the result of an economy jolting back after pandemic closures.  There’s still little consensus – officially and among us civilians – about what caused inflation. In truth, there’s likely a multitude of factors that contributed to this unique economic moment. Barry L. Ritholtz, co-founder, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management LLC., recently published a list of 15 inflation drivers.  This list spans from the U.S. CARES Acts to the more recent war in Ukraine, as well as other factors including just-in-time delivery and semiconductor factory slowdowns that economists have noted created supply shortages across the global economy. At the bottom of Ritholtz’s list is, interestingly, crypto.  Bitcoiners may not have the hedge they wanted, but they do have a solid economic theory that printing money will devalue a currency. Further, in terms of asset inflation, the Fed has been pursuing “quantitative easing” – where it would enter markets with the aim of forcing financial institutions to make more loans and drive riskier economic activity.  In other words, the U.S. government’s fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s monetary policy created buyers who took on increasingly risky bets. This is at least part of an explanation for why speculative industries, including the nascent digital asset sector, become so valuable. Built on viable tech but still finding durable use cases, crypto grew into a $3 trillion behemoth at its height mostly based on speculation.  Ritholtz places a fair amount of burden on consumers for rocketing inflation, arguing that the Fed’s zero percent interest rates (ZIRP) – a policy essentially in effect since 2008’s Great Financial Crisis – ”did nothing for inflation for a decade-plus.”  “Consumers who continue to buy homes and cars despite substantial price increases are not suffering from inflation, they are (in part) a driver of inflation,” he wrote. “Pre-pandemic, consumers spent 38.7% on goods, but a whopping 61.3% on services. In 2020, the demand for goods rose 20% globally, but production increases were barely 5%. Prices rose accordingly.”  At a small scale, this might have happened in crypto, too. There’s evidence to suggest that people put their $1,200 stimulus relief checks directly into exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken (just as average Americans reportedly used these relief payments to buy all sorts of goods and services – from AMC stock to new bikes).  But Ritholtz doesn’t seem to be blaming the small guy for crypto’s insane overvaluation and any inflationary effects that may have caused. He pointed to anecdotes like Lamborghinis being sold out for two years and sales of $100 million mansions “as hedge funds and VCs cashed in” their crypto holdings.  See also: How Web3 and Bitcoin Billionaires Will Revolutionize Charity | Opinion  Indeed, crypto functions in a way pretty similar to fiat currencies in that they can become valuable based primarily on collective belief. The difference is that crypto gives everyone a money printer, by enabling anyone to make a token and convince buyers it could have utility. To the extent that this activity drove inflation is an open question. There were plenty of reports of crypto founders buying yachts and New York City properties, having made a real fortune on virtual goods.  Many first-time bitcoin buyers were likely convinced by arguments that as the Fed debased the U.S. dollar the world would need an alternative reserve currency. There was a period of time where bitcoin’s price rose alongside inflation, causing something of a “positive feedback loop.”  The idea of digital gold, or bitcoin being resistant to inflation rather than being swept up in it, was – as crypto often says – a “narrative.” That doesn't mean bitcoin could not appreciate in price later, especially if more people again see the value in owning a programmatically scarce digital asset. But, at this moment, the story might be that bitcoin caused inflation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/30/hedge-or-cause-unpacking-bitcoin-and-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed8bec67ffcdde8f7ff6a1c422f54957027cd46-1815x1361.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) described the case as its “largest ever fraud scheme case involving bitcoin.” It alleged MTI’s key figure, Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, accepted 29,421 BTC from 23,000 Americans “and even more throughout the world” for a commodity pool scheme he wasn't licensed to run.  Victims of the scheme believed they were investing their bitcoin in a high-tech investment club “to grow your bitcoin,” charging documents said, citing MTI’s statements. Steynberg allegedly said MTI’s algorithms created “passive income” with 10% returns a month. Referring friends and family yielded a bonus, the documents said.  The reality of MTI was less savory, the CFTC alleged.  Steynberg failed to make proper disclosures, lied about the existence of a “trading bot,” never made a profitable forex swap and provided clients with phony account statements, the regulator said.  His alleged scheme ran from May 2018 until early 2021 when MTI entered bankruptcy proceedings and liquidation in South Africa. It faced mounting regulatory pressure in the U.S. and in South Africa beginning in 2020.  Steynberg himself is an international fugitive, court filings said.

Rather than waiting on the federal government to codify rules, states could move forward with standards of their own, such as liquidity requirements, as a condition for all crypto trading platforms to have an operating license, Loadholt said Thursday. The federal government is more likely to regulate crypto through enforcement actions rather than through legislation, he said.  “The reality is that this is still a market that is evolving and most policymakers are still trying to learn it,” Loadholt said. “But in terms of who can act faster and who can actually move faster, it's going to be a state regulator.”  Loadholt’s comments come after U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) proposed a crypto-friendly bill earlier this month. That bill seeks to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets across the U.S.  Read more: Key US Senators Introduce Crypto Bill Outlining Sweeping Plan for Future Rules  The collapse of stablecoin terraUSD (UST) last month, as well as crypto lender Celsius Network freezing customer withdrawals this month, could be examples lawmakers use as calls to action.  In the short term, Loadholt said, there will be “far more action around licensing” because of the need for some guardrails that can address investor concerns. He suggested that in the longer term, a majority of the industry could disappear, while those that can afford to comply with regulations are likely to keep operating.  “Ultimately, the industry should want to feel like they have the confidence that no matter where they invest, that they’re safe,” he said.

42422983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0nh,1656607706,"Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market","Margin calls are coming for cryptocurrency miners as the bear market continues to claim victims.  CORRECTION (June 30, 4:47 UTC): Clarifies maturity dates for MARA and CORZ promissory notes. Removes mention of of Galaxy's mining loans amount.  The private and publicly listed crypto miners have racked up debts anywhere between $2 billion to $4 billion to finance the construction of their gargantuan facilities across North America, according to data compiled by CoinDesk and industry participants.  As the value of the miners’ output dramatically falls along with the price of bitcoin (BTC), they have to make tough decisions about how to survive – including selling off hard-earned coins and equipment.  “It was painful but necessary,” Alex Martini, CEO of mining hosting firm Blockfusion, told CoinDesk, regarding the selling of “millions” of dollars worth of bitcoin reserves to service the firm’s debt. Now Blockfusion has a cash reserve to last about six months, but “if the market doesn’t turn” the company “will be forced to do another round” of liquidations, he said.  Blockfusion is far from alone in this predicament. With the bitcoin price at its lowest levels since 2020, global processing power on the network, or hashrate, near all-time highs and energy prices climbing, miners’ profit margins are shrinking.  Older machine models are becoming unprofitable and turned off – the hashrate decreased by 11% between June 12 and June 27, data from Blockchain.com shows.  Miners once steadfast on their “hodl” strategy (holding bitcoin rather than selling it), are now being forced to liquidate their crypto holdings to pay for operating costs and loan installments.  Bitcoin mining revenue in dollar-denominated terms per kilowatt hour (kWh) has more than halved since the start of the year, data compiled by Upstream Data President Steve Barbour shows. Using newer-generation machines such as the Antminer S19 Pros and Whatsminer M30S+ can make a big difference because they bring in double the revenue of older models like the Atminer S9, according to Barbour’s data.  The miners that use the latest machines and have low electricity prices – less than 6 cents per kilowatt hour, keeping their overall cost of mining a bitcoin below $10,000 – can still make ends meet and fulfill their loan obligations, said Brian Wright, Galaxy Digital’s vice president of mining.  CoinShares investment analyst Alexander Schmidt told CoinDesk he thinks “the majority of listed miners” are still profitable even with the price of bitcoin around $20,000.  “Miners who don't have leverage and run the new generation [machines], and there's some of those in the United States, they're probably still fine” in terms of profits, said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry Digital. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Who racked up debt?  Adding debt into the equation paints a darker picture.  Publicly listed bitcoin miners have borrowed at least $2.16 billion, based on data compiled from a June 14 investor note from securities firm B. Riley Financial and including a $37 million loan disclosed by Bitfarms on June 17.  On the higher end, public and private miners have borrowed a total of $3 billion to $4 billion in loans backed by mining computers, estimated Chief Economist and Chief Operating Officer of mining firm Luxor Technologies, Ethan Vera.  Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA) are among the most leveraged miners based on their debt-to-capital ratios. However, their debt obligations are mostly secured and unsecured promissory notes that don’t mature until 2025 through 2026.  The debt to capital ratio is an indication of how high a company’s debt burden is relative to its equity. The higher the ratio, the bigger the risk.  Northern Data, a German hosting firm, has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.84, according to data reported to the German stock exchange for 2020, the highest among miners surveyed by CoinDesk.  However the ratio doesn’t accurately depict the company’s finances today, Northern Data’s head of investor relations Jens-Philipp Briemle told CoinDesk via email. The miner acquired some of its creditors in 2021 paying off debts and at the same time managed to reduce a significant portion of its debt through the sale of a 300 megawatt site in Texas. The company has outstanding debt of EUR 20 million ($21 million) which it expects to pay off by August 2022, Briemle said.  Companies ideally don’t tap into their assets to pay off their debts, instead relying on their revenues to cover payments. Many miners are likely not bringing in enough revenue to pay off their monthly debt installments for these loans, regardless of what prices they bought machines at, considering common loan terms, said Bulovic.  For example, as of the end of the first quarter, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) had outstanding borrowings of $70 million to pay off by the year end, but incurred a net loss of $30 million in the same quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The miner did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this story.  Loans underwater  Miners that borrowed money to finance their expansion plans are now having to make tough decisions. Many “of those loans are underwater today” and borrowers need “significant revenues beyond the financing to remain current,” said Neil Van Huis, partner at BlockFills, which was one of the first firms to give out equipment financing loans to miners in 2020.  Equipment financing loans like the ones miners take out are “underwater” when the value of the loan exceeds the value of the underlying asset, such as bitcoin mining machines.  At the height of the market, when bitcoin was over $60,000, companies were purchasing miners at $90, $100 and even more per terahash, Bulovic said. That adds up to as much as $10,000 per machine. “The larger price tag means that the loan amount was higher. That means that the monthly payments are higher,” he said.  Firms that placed orders for mining rigs “at the height of the bull market for peak prices with a significant deposit,” are now “in a difficult spot to follow through,” said Jamie Leverton, CEO of Hut 8 Mining (HUT). “In due course, we’ll see some defaulted loans, unclaimed miners, and acquisition targets,” Leverton said.  Miners that were 100% financed, are less than two years old and are small without beneficial economics are likely to be the first ones to see defaults on the associated loans, said Van Huis.  Giving out bad credit  Miners’ difficulties in paying their installments engender risk for the overall ecosystem, as they leave lenders exposed to defaults. Hut 8 Mining’s Leverton said she expects miners to go into arrears. Miners have to prepare for the bear market during bull times, thinking about how to manage the cycles, treasuries and balance sheets, she said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas, last month.  According to Van Huis, lenders BlockFi and NYDIG have given out “horrible credit” that miners will have a hard time repaying given current market conditions. These companies do not disclose how many mining loans sit on their balance sheets, so it’s hard to estimate how exposed they are.  After days of speculation over its finances – including a supposedly leaked balance sheet that purported to show the company suffered a net loss of $221 million amid 2021’s bear market – BlockFi announced it got a $250 million credit line from FTX. Many called it a bailout. The lender has not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment on this story.  Companies like “Celsius, BlockFi, specifically BlockFi and even NYDIG, when they were financing people at 75% to 80% LTV [loan to value] at $65 per terahash or higher, many of them were much higher towards $80 a terahash” have built “horrible credit for the industry because all of those loans are underwater today,"" Van Huis said.  Loan-to-value ratios are used to assess the risk of a loan by comparing its value with that of the underlying collateralized asset. The higher the ratio, the higher the risk, which often translates into a higher interest rate.  Broadly speaking, in the past couple of years interest rates for equipment financing loans for bitcoin miners usually are in the double digits, between about 10% and 19%, publicly traded miners’ filings with the SEC show. (For comparison, even after recent increases, home mortgage rates in the U.S. run in the low to mid-single digits.)  An $80 price tag for a terahash of mining power looks high considering that application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are now selling for below $60/TH, according to data from Luxor’s Hashrate Index. This suggests that not only were the initial loans given out risky, but that the value of the underlying assets has significantly decreased as the value of ASICs has diminished.  “Some lenders took on more risk than others,” in terms of the protections that they have in place in cases of defaults and how they calculated LTV, Wright said. LTV can be calculated with the value of bitcoin or machines at the time the loan is given out, but a lender should consider what the actual liquidation price will be when the time comes, he explained.  BlockFi and NYDIG were giving out very large loans quite late in the cycle, said another industry insider who did not want to be named while commenting on other companies. This would mean that the price per terahash and therefore the monthly installments are higher. There are lenders in the market that are “very exposed” and “very worried,” the insider said.  BlockFi declined to answer a list of specific questions from CoinDesk. Chief Risk Officer Yuri Mushkin said the firm “runs a diversified lending business to the crypto ecosystem,” of which “mining-backed loans are only a portion.” Mushkin added, “These mining-backed loans are collateralized, and we follow the same prudent risk and underwriting practices that we implement across the rest of our institutional business.”  NYDIG didn’t respond to CoinDesk requests to comment on this story.  The New York-based lender signed off on a $70 million loan for Argo Blockchain in March and a $37 million credit line for Bitfarms on June 14. Along with the loan, Bitfarms said it was selling off 1,500 BTC. Just a week later, the miner said it had sold another BTC 1,500 to pay off its other debt from Galaxy.  Read more: Bitfarms Looks to Boost Liquidity With Sale of 1,500 Bitcoin, New Loan  TeraWulf also took on a $15 million loan in the form of a convertible promissory note on June 13.  If the “economics don't change, it's just a matter of time until some miners default” while at the same time “lenders have relatively little recourse” to “save themselves” because the value of collateral, usually mining machines or bitcoin, is dropping every day, the insider said.  Celsius recently halted withdrawals for customers without much explanation, triggering investigations from authorities in several U.S. states.  BlockFi, like Celsius, was working with funds raised from depositors, which means it has to pay them back, whereas NYDIG raised money through equity, so it will just take longer for it to recoup those funds, said Van Huis.  Only about 6% of Galaxy Digital’s $5.3 billion assets are related to mining, or $301 million, according to a quarterly earnings report. A spokesperson declined to comment on the mining figures for Galaxy's lending activities.  Hodl no more  Miners have been selling bitcoin to exchanges at record paces. In May, bitcoin miners sold over 100% of their monthly production, compared to 30% between January and April, said Jaran Mellerud, senior researcher at Arcane Research.  On-chain information platforms like CryptoQuant and CoinMetrics have noted record flows of coins from miners to exchanges over the past few weeks. This is not necessarily an indication of selling; it could mean that miners are staking their tokens or preparing to sell, Wright explained.  With tight liquidity, miners that pledged bitcoins they mined as collateral to get equipment loans might not be able to monetize them for anything other than paying off their debts. In these cases, the collateral is likely held by the lender, and will only be sold in the case of a margin call, Bulovic said.  This was the case for Blockfusion, which had a margin call at $29,000, according to the firm’s CEO. A margin call occurs when the value of a borrower’s collateral falls below a certain threshold, determined in agreement with the lender. In that case, the borrower has to come up with the funds to exceed that threshold, which sometimes means selling assets at unfavorable market prices–such as BTC below the $20,000 mark.  Blockfusion had to choose between posting more collateral or selling its bitcoin, Martini said, adding that most miners he knows “lost their collateral.”  At the same time, firms that raised money by taking on debt or diluted their stock by issuing more shares have restricted their ability to grow at this time because they have to either post additional collateral or liquidate their bitcoin holdings, said Matthew Schultz, executive chairman at CleanSpark, a bitcoin miner that bought existing contracts for 1,800 machines this month from another peer.  “We were presented with the same opportunity as everybody else,” Schultz said. CleanSpark had the chance to leverage bitcoin “for the benefit of a little bit of cash flow and then to see competition raised to the point that it becomes almost unrealistic,” he said. But the company avoided that, and has the second-lowest debt to capital ratio among surveyed miners.  To secure a $35 million loan from a venture capital funder earlier this year, CleanSpark instead collateralized its bitcoin mining rigs.  Machine free-for-all  Bitcoin miners that posted their machines as collateral are faced with a different set of problems. With miners looking to offload their machines for much-needed cash, the prices of ASICs have significantly dropped.  Ideally, miners would sell older machine models but there is no market for them at the moment because they are unprofitable, said CleanSpark’s Schultz, so they are “forced to sell newer equipment” or leverage their bitcoin.  Rack space is a limiting factor for those looking to buy up rigs.  If a firm that mines for its own account went bankrupt, it couldn't mine at its site because it would be out of cash, so even if a lender wanted to take over the machines, they would have to find a hosting site to plug those machines in, Van Huis said. But all hosting sites are at maximum capacity, he added.  One U.S.-based mining hosting firm told CoinDesk that it has been getting an increasing number of calls from near-desperate miners looking to house cheaply bought rigs. But the host’s facilities are completely full so it can’t take any of the offers.  In an even more precarious spot are mining firms that took out loans secured with future orders, meaning contracts for machines that have yet to be delivered. These miners have to pay off rigs that aren’t making them any money at the moment.  Lenders and borrowers saddled with big loans “against purchase orders” are in a “tough position” because not only has the value of the machines significantly dropped, but the equipment is not even in the U.S. at the moment, Wright said.  “I don’t see how you can survive that,” Van Huis said.  Some miners may have to take on additional loans to buy rigs for which they already put down deposits.  “A sample set of public miners still owe $1.9 billion this year, for the ASIC purchases that they've committed to,” said Galaxy Digital’s head of mining, Amanda Fabiano, during a panel discussion at Consensus 2022.  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  Regardless of what collateral miners used, its value has decreased in the past few months, Galaxy’s Wright said. “I haven't actually seen a big difference between miners that pursued bitcoin-backed loans, as opposed to ASIC-backed loans,” he added.  Long-term consequences  Industry sources to whom CoinDesk spoke agreed the industry will consolidate in the coming months as weaker players are forced to offload assets.  This will not only bring opportunity for other players in the form of cheap ASICs, but will make it easier for those still participating to mine bitcoin.  “As less-efficient miners go offline, the lower network hashrate will directly benefit high efficiency machines with low shutdown prices,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Joseph Vafi wrote in a June 20 research note.  The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block and reaping the rewards automatically readjusts to keep the time required to around 10 minutes. The higher the network hashrate, the higher the difficulty.  The next difficulty adjustment is expected to make it easier to mine a block, as miners have dropped off the network.  Mining rig deliveries are still coming online, which will drive up the hashrate later in the year, said CoinShares analyst Alexander Schmidt.  At the same time, rising natural gas prices are putting additional pressure on margins for companies like Marathon Digital and Hut 8 that rely on this resource. “Miners powered 100% by renewables may benefit from lower competition,” Canaccord Genuity’s Vafi wrote.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/29/crypto-miners-face-margin-calls-defaults-as-debt-comes-due-in-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fe21d3c13aafbf5a49e7ff4b6c7e89bfb6bd6d5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRxX,1656604479,EU Watchdog Wants to Address Threat Crypto Assets Could Pose to Financial System,"The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has deemed it a ""matter of urgency” to consider the need for additional regulatory measures and policy steps to address the potential threat that crypto assets could pose to the financial system.  The body, which is responsible for ensuring the stability of the financial system in the EU, said in a statement on Thursday that while crypto assets currently have a limited hold on the financial system, ”these risks could materialize quickly and suddenly.”  Crypto’s recent boom and bust has caused regulators to pay closer attention to the market. The digital assets market had a market capitalization of around $790 billion at the start of 2021 and then peaked at almost $3 trillion in November before plunging to $1 trillion as of June 30, according to CoinGecko. Recently, regulators have become more concerned about the risks that crypto poses because of the recent collapse of terraUSD (UST) and troubles faced by crypto lenders such as Celsius.  The ESRB also hopes to identify crypto’s possible systemic implications on the EU financial system, as well as consider potential legal actions and regularly monitor the digital asset sector.  The EU is not the only one looking into how to mitigate risks posed by crypto assets. The U.K.’s Treasury published a consultation paper in May in which it said it planned to legislate that the Bank of England, its central bank, would have the power to supervise stablecoins that could impact the wider economy.  The ESRB said it planned to make proposals on how to ensure a European and global regulatory standard was developed to better safeguard against crypto assets that could one day pose systemic risks.  The EU is already in the process of producing a legislative package for crypto assets called Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) that would be transportable across all 27 member nations. The EU has reaffirmed its “support for a quick adoption and implementation” of MiCA.

42394040,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjA5,1656603188,How I Made It in Crypto: The Play-to-Earn Guilder,"Spraky practically lost his voice during a video chat with me from the Philippines in late June. It’s been spent talking with hordes of members from his play-to-earn gaming community, whom he’s met while traveling around the country from Baguio to Cebu City.  Still hours from his home in Nueva Ecija, Spraky (the name he goes by in Web3) has been hosting gaming tournaments and meetups for the locals in these areas who’ve joined Yield Guild Games (YGG). Their aim is to become part of a larger community that’s learning the ins and outs of crypto by playing video games.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  “We’re planning to do this every month in different major cities here in the Philippines,” he said. And even though it’s temporarily cost him his voice, it’s a part of his job he really loves. He’s one of those lucky guys who genuinely enjoys hanging out with the people he works with. “We’re staying in our community because we love our community. We love to hang out with everyone.”  Spraky, a former head of engineering at his local water utilities plant, quit that job for his many side hustles after he first discovered blockchain gaming around November 2020. He’s now a guild relations manager for the Philippines at YGG, a sprawling organization that owns non-fungible token (NFT) assets in games including Axie Infinity, CyBall and Fancy Birds.  YGG lends those assets out to players who can’t afford or don’t care to buy them – so they can still play-to-earn in the games – and takes a 20% cut for community managers and 10% for YGG overall. The remaining 70% goes to the players.  Spraky describes YGG as a “guild of guilds,” or a “DAO of DAOs.” In other words, it’s a large organization of play-to-earners (with about 30,000 current members in 28 countries around the world) that’s split up into numerous subguilds. Spraky manages “all of the subguilds inside YGG Philippines,” yet another larger subguild within the wider YGG universe. This means the bulk of his job entails him talking to and socializing with his community members, whether via Discord or IRL meetups, like those he’s been hosting this past week.  Like many others who’ve played-to-earn in the Philippines, Spraky first got into Web3 by playing Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns across the country were especially strict, with many stuck at home or within a several-block radius – a particular problem for many in the Philippines who either work outside of the country for better financial opportunities or rely on family members who do. As of August 2020, unemployment in the country had reached a high of 17.7%.  Read more: ‘I Don't Follow Trends’: Multicoin’s Kyle Samani on How to Make It in Crypto  “A lot of people lost their jobs,” Spraky said. “So how they put food on the table was by playing [Axie Infinity].”  Spraky first encountered the Axies on Facebook – he came across a picture of someone playing the game, sparking his curiosity and an ensuing Google search. It led him to this very publication, where CoinDesk contributor Leah Callon-Butler had written an article about how people in Spraky’s very own Nueva Ecija were earning money by buying, breeding, battling and trading these little NFT-backed, blobby creatures that don’t quite resemble the amphibians (Axolotls) for which they’re named. Rather, they each have a set of unique, whimsical traits (like pumpkin-shaped fins and thorny caterpillar tails) that can make them more or less rare – which in the NFT world tends to translate directly to value. All kinds of people in Nueva Ecija had begun playing the game to both earn much-needed income and distract themselves during the economic devastation and isolation brought on by the pandemic, selling the assets they earned in the game in exchange for cryptocurrency, which they then turned into their local pesos.  This had been going on about 20 minutes from Spraky’s home in a more rural part of Nueva Ecija, but once Spraky learned about the game, he immediately “became really active within the Axie community,” he said. His playing-to-earn eventually translated to a full-time gig.  “I didn’t know anything about crypto back then,” Spraky admits, but he was welcomed into its sphere in part by the Filipino GameFi influencer Kookoo Crypto TV, who Spraky says invited him to join the YGG community. Spraky started spreading the word in his IRL community about the ability to earn via Axies – a somewhat tough sell, since a group of people in his area had been known to use crypto to scam others back during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017. But he and two friends cofounded Axie University (which YGG eventually helped scale due to the demand) to help communicate that this was different.  “As the community builders in our area, it's our job to introduce to [people] how to play Axie and how many opportunities can come [from that],” he said.  Today, Spraky does this by waking up and immediately hopping on Discord to check messages from his YGG community members. He uses the platform to chat with his team about how to support other managers in their network, checking in on YGG’s in-game NFT inventory and hosting events where play-to-earners can come to learn strategy and hang out virtually with one another.  At YGG, the lending of in-game blockchain assets is known as “scholarships,” and recipients are “scholars.” During the crypto bull market, when Spraky first got into his role, finding and retaining scholars was easy and enjoyable – Spraky did it for free on YGG’s behalf for months until he was officially hired this past December. There was plenty of buzz around the profitability of the play-to-earn grind, and it netted real profits for many, particularly in the Philippines. People would come to him, messaging him and his team members to figure out how they could get in on the windfall.  During the bear market, like most other crypto assets, the value of in-game NFTs like Axies has tanked, so joining a play-to-earn guild doesn’t have quite the same appeal. Instead of expanding the community, Spraky’s been working on keeping members “engaged” with events including bingo nights, singing contests and giveaways – it serves to keep up the community’s spirits and display how there are perks to being involved other than the earning potential. “It's not just about how much you earn,” Spraky says. “It's about how we have each other in our community.”  He also reminds scholars not to consider playing-to-earn as their primary source of income, and he walks the walk. Spraky’s many gigs span the virtual and physical worlds – he has a car paint shop with his family, buys NFTs, does crypto staking and participates in liquidity pools. (Though there was some reporting on people in places like the Philippines who were able to buy two houses during the earlier days of the pandemic purely from their play-to-earn income, Spraky notes that many of those people’s stories were more nuanced – they were also yield farming, staking and investing in tokens that ended up taking off.)  Instead, Spraky aims to emphasize the opportunities that learning about crypto through play-to-earn can bring. “We turn our scholars into investors,” he said, adding that some have even gotten jobs at other Web3 companies because of their experience playing blockchain-based games. Another strategy these days is to encourage players to buy up in-game assets while they’re cheap.  “At the end of the day, we're playing a game,” Spraky said. “Games were meant to be played to have fun, so we always tell our scholars that we’re playing this because we love the game.”  What Spraky really loves, though, is Web3 at large and the community of people he’s gotten to join because of it.  “We're staying here because the environment in Web3 is very different from a traditional corporate job,” he said. For example, he explains how YGG is helping MetaGoons, another Web3 gaming organization that’s essentially their competitor, because the Web3 ethos, as far as he’s experienced it, is about “promoting collaboration and healthy competition.”  “It's really like I'm not working,” Spraky added, “I didn't know crypto like, two years ago… [now] I really love being here in this space.”  More from Future of Work Week  The Crypto Jobs Boom  It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.

The Southern District of New York (SDNY) federal court will hold a press conference on Thursday at 11 a.m. ET to announce the news.  Ignatova was the leader and public face of the OneCoin project, which was started in Bulgaria in 2014. Ignatova told investors the OneCoin cryptocurrency could be mined and had actual value.

FTX had talks with Celsius over an acquisition but walked away on account of a ""$2 billion hole"" in the lender's balance sheet, according to the report, which cited two people with knowledge of the matter.  Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange also found Celsius hard to deal with, one of the sources said.  Celsius's woes have been among the major touchpoints of the recent troubled conditions in the crypto market. On June 13, the lender paused withdrawals citing ""extreme market conditions,"" raising concerns about its solvency.  The lender's CEL token is down over 13% on the day, according to data by CoinMarketCap, having dropped from around 73 cents at 13:00 UTC to under 62 cents less than an hour later.

In theory, it may eventually eliminate the need for inflation. The policy was invented by a team of crypto economists at Sifchain. One of the main goals of Protocol Monetary Trade Policies is to help attract external liquidity while increasing total value locked (TVL). It does this by incentivizing a cryptocurrency token such as ROWAN, creating an attractive option to earn rewards in.

42374430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZSCd,1656594897,First Mover Americas: BTC Down 40% in June; SEC Rejects Grayscale’s BTC ETF Application,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin suffered its worst monthly returns yet, down 40% in June.  Market moves: In a much scrutinized move, the U.S. SEC rejected the digital-asset manager Grayscale’s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund. Within an hour, Grayscale had filed a suit against the regulator over the decision.  Price point  Pessimism took over the crypto market in June, and bitcoin (BTC) suffered its worst monthly returns, according to data going back to 2013. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded down 40% on the month.  June has been historically volatile for bitcoin, but this month has redefined the worst case.  BTC was trading around $19,000 at press time, after dipping to $18,900 briefly. The cryptocurrency is down 5% over the last 24 hours.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Grayscale's application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) Wednesday. Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  Florian Giovannacci, head of trading at Covario AG, said that, looking forward, if equities can find a floor with less troublesome inflation data and crypto lenders stop “falling” one after the other, July might look brighter for the crypto market.  “Unfortunately I am afraid we might only get one of the two,” Giovannacci said.  Data from Coinglass shows that the previous worst-performing month was in November 2018, when bitcoin dropped by 37%.  Altcoins also took a large hit in June, with ethereum (ETH) losing 47%. Avalanche’s AVAX lost 40%, polygon (MATIC) was down 35% and solana (SOL) took a 31% hit.  Data from CryptoCompare shows that since May, total assets under management (AUM) across all digital-asset investment products has fallen 36% to $21.6 billion. (The data goes through June 23.)  The AUM in bitcoin funds specifically fell 33.7% to $15.9 billion; however, they continued to gain market share, currently at 73.6% of total AUM, up from 70.1% in May.  The AUM in ethereum-focused funds dropped 46.7% to $4.54 billion, according to CryptoCompare.  Market moves  By Nikhilesh De  Grayscale Sues SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Application Rejection  Grayscale Investments has sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) barely an hour after the regulatory agency rejected its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust product to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The SEC rejected Grayscale's application earlier Wednesday, citing concerns about market manipulation, the role of Tether in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and the lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement between a ""regulated market of significant size"" and a regulated exchange, echoing concerns the regulator has expressed for years in rejecting other spot bitcoin ETF applications.  Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  In the filing, Grayscale simply asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC's order.  The investment firm announced it was prepared to sue the SEC in the event of a rejection earlier in 2022, saying it would file a proceeding tied to the Administrative Procedures Act. To that end, Grayscale tapped former Solicitor General Don Verrilli, who has experience in APA proceedings.  “Grayscale supports and believes in the SEC’s mandate to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation – and we are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC's decision to continue to deny spot Bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement Wednesday.  Essentially, the company will argue that the SEC has to allow products that are like other products already trading, in this case bitcoin futures ETFs.  Verrilli told reporters earlier in June that the SEC's approval of futures ETFs indicate the underlying market must be seen as reliable.  ""This is a place where common sense has a really important role to play. You've got a situation now in which you have certain kinds of exchange traded funds, one that is focused on bitcoin futures, and the SEC has approved that, the SEC is given it the seal of approval,"" he said. ""In order to do so it had to make a determination that that giving this approval was consistent with the securities laws, and in particular, that that there wasn't a sufficient underlying risk of fraud and manipulation.""  To date, only a handful of bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved to trade. Spot bitcoin ETFs trade based on the price of bitcoin itself, while futures-based ETFs trade based on the price of CME's bitcoin futures product (which in turn is tied to an index). Bitcoin ETF proponents argue that the futures markets are still based on the underlying spot bitcoin price, while the SEC notes that CME's futures market is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a fellow federal agency.

The data, which includes trade volumes, wallet analysis and minting dashboards, is sourced from the network’s two most popular marketplaces, Magic Eden and OpenSea, which collectively host more than 95% of all Solana NFT transactions.  The Ethereum-heavy platform has been eyeing Solana support for months, first integrating certain analytics from the blockchain back in April.  “We’ve been working on this most of the quarter as hard as we can, really,” Paul Harwood, head of product at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an interview. “It feels like we're quite far ahead from the rest of the ecosystem. I think we have scanned way more contracts than most people, and we're doing it all on-chain all in real time.”  While the world of Solana NFTs lacks the star power and attention brought by Ethereum’s blue-chip projects, its popularity among traders has never been better. The blockchains are now neck and neck in average daily transactions, with Solana’s edge coming from its significantly lower transaction costs.  Nansen wouldn’t disclose its active user numbers, but a representative told CoinDesk the platform’s suite of NFT services, dubbed “NFT Paradise,” has become increasingly popular in recent months.  While the NFT industry as a whole has grown beyond incipience, analytics platforms serving its enthusiasts remain a work in progress, with data from even the most popular sites, such as Dune Analytics and DappRadar, having a tendency to be inaccurate.

Unfortunately, the crypto could not sustain the recovery above $21K and lost more than $500 some hours later. The change in Bitcoin price resulted from mixed reactions in the market concerning regulators&apos; stance on crypto.

42421520,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWNB,1656593400,Facts or Feelings? Bitcoin Allocation Makes Sense Even in Nasty Bear Markets,"Whenever bitcoin moves into a bear market, the victory laps commence.  My personal favorites are those who have been “anti-bitcoin” for years, often academic types who told you when the BTC price was under $100 that it was a scam. Then they state how they were right when the price of bitcoin is $20,000 – the irony is rich.  I’m not writing this for the bitcoin bulls or those who can’t be intellectually honest, but for those who fall in between bull and bear. I’m also not here to argue the fundamentals of bitcoin as a store of value; there are plenty of great articles on the why and how of that. Instead, I’d like to look at bitcoin from an investment standpoint alone and allow the math to reveal whether or not it deserves a long-term allocation for clients.  For starters, a financial advisor always preaches long-term investing. As Warren Buffett said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" The rules seem to change when making points about whether or not to own bitcoin – it’s often measured in quarterly returns instead of years – but how about we look at three- and five-year time horizons? (That’s still too short for Buffett, of course, but the numbers only look more favorable for bitcoin the further we go back.)  By looking at these figures while bitcoin is down over 60% from its all-time high (at the time of this writing) it should drive the point home for everyone.     The two-year return on investment (ROI) of bitcoin surpasses the eight-year ROI of the S&P 500, which is telling considering how well the S&P 500 has done over the past decade.  Now, what about risk? An investment that has drawdowns of -93% in 2011, 85% in 2013, -83% in 2017 and 72% year to date cannot be investable. The standard risk metrics like Sharpe or Sortino ratios would show that right? Wrong – let’s dive in. (All data shown is as of June 20, 2022.)  The Sharpe Ratio is the measure of risk-adjusted (really volatility-adjusted) returns. It’s a way to measure how much return an investment generated for the risk (volatility) endured over some time horizon. (Higher is better.)  The Sortino ratio is a measure very similar to the Sharpe ratio. The big difference is it does not penalize an asset for upward volatility as that volatility is not unfavorable. Whereas Sharpe ratio measures the asset's performance against some benchmark per unit of bidirectional volatility, Sortino measures per unit of downside volatility only. This can provide a more real-world indication of the asset's desirability. (Again, higher is better.)  What do you notice? Even during one of the largest drawdowns in its history – bitcoin is less risky than bonds over the last three and five years. Gold has also been the better diversification tool than bonds when comparing it to correlations to the S&P 500 and has a positive return. Should we not be telling clients not to own bonds?  Read More: 5 Ways Bitcoin Can Play a Role in a Portfolio  The upshot: A blend of stocks, bonds and bitcoin has outperformed stocks and bonds. Let’s say, for whatever reason, you couldn’t own spot bitcoin and only had access to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The GBTC currently trades at a 35% discount to its net asset value (NAV), has lagged the spot price of bitcoin, and has a 2% management fee attached to it. We will use it as the proxy given the wide availability of its ownership – again, spot would only improve the following figures. (Disclosure: Grayscale is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.)  So, how about we take a quarterly rebalanced portfolio with 55% allocated to the S&P 500, 35% in U.S. Aggregate Bonds, and 10% in the GBTC, and compare that to the S&P 500 and the ageless 60/40 stocks-to-bonds portfolio.  So what do we see? When looking at the risks of downside only (Sortino ratio) the blend outperforms from a risk perspective. Not to mention on the five-year figure there is a measurable total return outperformance at over 5% annualized – a lower drawdown versus the S&P 500. Lastly, risk metrics outperform the 60/40 portfolio. All while seeing two 70%+ corrections along the way.  Wrapping up  Bitcoin has loud and often obnoxious supporters, and you might even consider me in that camp. But the rationale for an allocation for bitcoin is undisputed when examining the facts and figures of it as an asset. For too many, the view of bitcoin as an investable asset becomes a false binary: all or nothing. To really examine it, you have to put the emotion around periods like the current downturn aside and ask the most basic investment questions: What is your time horizon?  The U.S. Aggregate Bond Index has provided a 1.34% total return over the past 10 years, and a negative return for year-to-date, one- and three-year periods. Why aren’t there calls for the removal of bonds as an investable asset class? Rates are low and inflation is high, leading to corporate and sovereign debt approaching or hitting all-time highs. Bonds have been a staple for years as a source of diversified returns but have been on the back of falling interest rates since the early 1980s.  Yet with bitcoin, the treatment is usually that of a YOLO meme stock. The stark contrast seems to stem from a belief that bitcoin is not real or that it will not survive, and not enough advisors have spent time educating themselves on what bitcoin is and does as a network and an asset. The truth is the same fears used around volatility for bitcoin could be used to prevent investors from owning stocks. Yet advisors often remind clients of the ""why"" for stock ownership and that being a long-term investor will benefit them.  Financial advisors that want the best outcome for clients would be wise to review the data and run the numbers on bitcoin. There are facts and then there are feelings, and the facts point to bitcoin being a significant contributor to returns for any true long-term investor.

42421505,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWAn,1656591163,How DAOs Open Doors for the Unbanked,"Consider the millions of people in advanced economies who began working remotely for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tens of thousands of people whose jobs previously limited them to high-cost cities, such as San Francisco or New York, moved to lower cost areas, taking their salaries with them. For the first time, they had an opportunity to build wealth that wasn’t swallowed up by astronomical rents and other living expenses.  Could it be that a similar trend across the world might take hold as Web3 tools become more widely adopted? Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are borderless entities that unlock a global workforce, drawing skill and talent from all corners of the world.  Ryan Berkun is the founder and CEO of Teller Finance. This op-ed is part of ""Future of Work Week.""  This means that people who live in countries without advanced financial sectors don’t have to be limited to the business or employment opportunities that are physically close enough to pay them in their local currency. And it might have serious implications for the 1.7 billion adults worldwide the World Bank estimates lack a bank account – greatly increasing their difficulty in finding good-paying work, safely accruing capital and making significant investments.  See also: How the Crypto Community Can Make a Big Impact | Opinion (2020)  DAOs offer the world’s unbanked a mirror image of the same dynamic as the Great Migration. For the first time, they can make a better living than they could otherwise find in their local economies, without having to move somewhere else to find it.  DAOs foster fair, merit-based compensation  DAOs enable advancement based on merit. One way this is achieved is through allowing members to remain anonymous; this way, contributions are valued solely on their merits without getting mixed up in the social dynamics and biases too often implicit in traditional workplace structures. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review discussed how anonymizing applications to use the Hubble Space Telescope resulted in more women being approved for scarce time slots to use it.  DAOs offer the possibility of this kind of anonymity on a grand scale, with massive implications for removing biases based on ethnicity, nationality, gender and other identity characteristics that aren’t related to the value of an employee’s contributions.  While this is fairer for everyone, it is particularly important to the unbanked. It removes the downward pressure on compensation created by the perception that the unbanked lack viable economic alternatives.  Furthermore, transparent blockchain transactions mean DAOs can promote compensation commensurate with the value workers generate, helping to create competitive salaries within and across the crypto ecosystem.  DAOs help the unbanked generate wealth  It is extremely difficult to build wealth without a bank account to securely store and accrue value that earns interest. For unbanked individuals living in countries with unstable economies, this challenge is compounded, especially in countries with extreme hyperinflation like Venezuela, Sudan, Zimbabwe and Yemen.  The best atmosphere for wealth generation is a stable, predictable and fair investment climate, governed by rules rather than the whims of individuals. Transparency International’s annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is a good working proxy for the state of a country’s investment climate. The CPI rates 180 countries by their people’s perception of public sector corruption on a scale from 0 (“highly corrupt”) to 100 (“very clean”).  According to the World Bank study referenced above, nearly half of the world’s unbanked population resides in only seven countries – Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan. Not one of these countries scores above a 45 on the CPI. All but two of them are in the bottom half of countries ranked.  DAOs can contribute to creating a more ideal environment for wealth generation by offering the transparency and clarity on governing systems that many economies lack. A DAO’s code is open source, meaning that anyone can go through it and learn exactly what it will do.  See also: Can Bitcoin Deliver on its Promise to the World's Unbanked? | Opinion (2014)  Even if one isn’t a developer, most major DAOs choose to be audited by reputable security experts. This means that DAOs are predictable and fair in the way they allocate returns on investment. Also, since a DAO’s members interact with it directly – not through the traditional financial system – they are protected from any theft, graft and corruption that might be occurring among their local public officials or private bankers.  In addition, because DAOs and the DeFi ecosystem are global, the unbanked can make investments worldwide. They can be paid or hold savings denominated in various cryptocurrencies – even in stablecoins pegged to the world’s leading fiat currencies or backed by a basket of other assets. This can be a huge boon to those whose local currencies tend to be weak or lose value.  The unbanked have historically suffered many disadvantages, but DAOs may offer a turning point. Through mass adoption of these Web3 protocols, the unbanked can gain meaningful access to opportunity, fair compensation and a real chance to generate wealth.

42422976,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0Vh,1656590985,Societe Generale Selects Swiss Crypto Custody Specialist Metaco for Security Token Push,"French lender Societe Generale (GLE) has selected Swiss cryptocurrency custody firm Metaco to work with the bank’s digital asset subsidiary SG FORGE.  The SocGen Metaco partnership will, for now, focus on security tokens, an area of expertise for the bank, which structured the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) 100 million euro ($103.8 million) digital bond in 2021. SocGen’s security token focus comes amid the broader context of a forthcoming EU pilot regime exploring regulated security tokens, according to a press release.  Over the past couple of years, banks and large custodians have been steadily preparing for a world of digital assets. Switzerland’s Metaco is a common denominator for many institutions exploring crypto, most recently with Citigroup (C) (also focused on security tokens), and previously with the likes of BBVA (BBVA), Zodia Custody, DBS and UnionBank Philippines.  Metaco CEO Adrien Treccani recalls that at some point last year traditional banks started getting really serious about digital assets, around the time MicroStrategy (MSTR) began buying bitcoin (BTC) and Elon Musk tweeting about crypto.  “The series of banks that were already working on certain topics suddenly transformed from innovation pilots to concrete go-to market strategies,” Treccani said in an interview. “You will start seeing a series of announcements involving very big custodians. It’s almost FOMO [a fear of missing out] as these large banking players know that their future somehow depends on this capability.”  Speaking in general terms, Treccani said the French market today is more about security tokenization than cryptocurrencies. Germany, by contrast, is more focused on cryptocurrencies, while the Asian market is moving much faster into decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “The American market is heavily regulated, and it’s only the last 12 months that it has dramatically accelerated,” Treccani said. “But I would argue cryptocurrencies are very much within scope in general.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/30/societe-generale-selects-swiss-crypto-custody-specialist-metaco-for-security-token-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b761befaf759c488768452dc2a2da24173ce52f-837x628.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A powerful weekly candle from 13 June sent BTC down 33% for the week. Buyers managed to keep the range of $19,000-$20,000 under their control. However, this fact did not give buyers any inspiration. This is perfectly visible on the next weekly candle from 20 June. During this period, the price moved in a narrow 10% consolidation. Trading volumes during the trading week from 20 June were high enough and even this did not allow buyers to carry out a bright counterattack. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GXyHVSzI/ The trading week from 27 June saw a continued Bitcoin fall. Sellers were able to update the local lows of the previous week and re-extend the range of previous historical highs. If buyers give the range of $19,000 without problems, the BTC price will hit $13,000 in July.

42413286,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8Hwq,1656588985,JPMorgan Says Crypto Market Deleveraging Cycle Won’t Be Lengthy,"The collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) indicates that the ramifications of this year's cryptocurrency market slump continue to reverberate, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a report Wednesday.  While it is hard to assess how much more deleveraging still needs to happen, the bank said, its indicators suggest the process is already well advanced.  Multiple failures among companies in the industry should not surprise given the backdrop of deleveraging and the 70% drop in digital asset market capitalization since November, the report says.  The entities that employed higher leverage in the past are now the most vulnerable, the bank said. “Whether it is miners having borrowed to expand operations using their bitcoin as collateral, or corporates such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) having borrowed in the past to invest even more heavily into bitcoin, or hedge funds using futures to lever their positions, or retail investors borrowing via margin accounts to invest in various cryptocurrencies.”  The failure of 3AC is a manifestation of this deleveraging process, the note says, adding that the process seems well advanced, “making the bottom formation process in crypto markets more volatile.”  Bitcoin (BTC) miners are another source of stress for crypto markets, JPMorgan said, given the pressure to sell their tokens to deleverage or to cover the cost of their operations. Selling of bitcoins by miners intensified in June and will likely continue into the third quarter, it said.  The weakest crypto companies, those with high leverage and lower capital levels, are the most challenged. Conversely, those with the healthiest balance sheets are most likely to survive and will emerge stronger once this current phase is over, the report says.  JPMorgan identifies two reasons to suggest that the cycle may not be very protracted: Stronger crypto companies with more robust balance sheets are stepping in to help contain contagion, and the continued healthy pace of venture capital (VC) funding, an important source of capital for the digital assets ecosystem.

42374428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZS8r,1656586606,"Banks’ Bitcoin Holdings Should Be Capped, Basel Committee Proposes","Conventional banks should have a cap on their holdings of unbacked crypto assets to safeguard financial stability, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said Thursday.  The international standard setter is having another go at setting out how much capital lenders need to hold for their crypto exposures, after a first consultation published last year met with an outcry from the industry for being too conservative.  International rules, toughened after the 2008 financial crisis, require lenders to have capital reserves that can be used as backup in case assets such as loans turn sour. It also stops banks from having significant exposure to any one entity since the bank’s fortunes could then hinge on the collapse of one corporation.  Those requirements should also apply to crypto, the committee said.  “The large exposure rules of the Basel Framework are not designed to capture large exposures to an asset type, but to individual counterparties or groups of connected counterparties,” the consultation document said. “This would imply, for example, no large exposure limits on cryptoasset where there is no counterparty, such as bitcoin.”  But the Committee seems to have softened its position on crypto holdings where the bank is able to insure against its risk after a receiving a barrage of complaints that its previous approach was too cautious. The original plans meant a bank with an exposure to crypto of $100 has a minimum capital requirement of $100, essentially ruling them out from any incentive to get involved in crypto markets.  Under the new plan, lighter rules would apply to cryptos that have an equivalent liquid derivative such as an exchange-traded fund, given the possibility to ""hedge"" exposures.  But for the riskiest class of crypto assets, which includes those that aren’t backed by conventional reserves or asset-pegged stablecoins that aren't satisfactorily stabilized, there would be an exposure limit set at 1% of Tier 1 capital, or the core capital held in a bank's reserve, the document said. For large banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), 1% of Tier 1 capital can amount to billions of dollars.  The proposal implies the 1% cap would apply to unbacked cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC), and for cryptocurrencies like algorithmic stablecoins which are backed by other cryptocurrencies and stabilized by an algorithm. In May, an $18 billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD collapsed, prompting regulators to fast-track oversight.  The cap also applies to total holdings of crypto assets classified as high risk. For instance, if a lender has 0.6% in algorithmic stablecoins and 0.5% in bitcoin, it has breached the 1% limit.  The committee is seeking comments on the plans by the end of September, and says it will monitor the fast-moving and volatile market in the meantime.

Banking trade body UK Finance has warned that more and more victims are losing millions to scammers every day last year. Cases where a victim is tricked into sending money directly to criminals, jumped by more than a quarter in 2021 to almost 196,000. Fraud victims lost £583m over the course of the year, equivalent to £1.6 million a day, and a rise of 25 percent from the year before. However, more than £171 million was lost to investment scams alone, a daily loss of more than £470,000, more than 50 percent higher than the year before. Most victims will never recover funds lost to scammers. Of the £583 million loss last year, just £271 million or 47 percent was returned to consumers, although this is a slight improvement in 2020. Young People&apos;s Interest in Crypto Numerous studies show that young people are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies than in stocks, bonds, or other share-based items. A JPMorgan report from last year highlighted that during the pandemic, older investors in the US turned to gold, while young people were more likely to eye bitcoin. Part of the allure of crypto, according to some, is that there is a measure of the risk-taking, thrill-seeking behavior often ascribed to youngsters in investing in a market so novel, so volatile, and so heavily promoted by celebrities.

Other large cryptocurrencies also weakened, with ether dropping 9.9% in the past 24 hours and Solana’s SOL falling as much as 11%. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 4.3%.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to increasing interest rates to curtail inflation. Speaking at the ECB meeting, he said he was more concerned about the challenge posed by inflation than about the possibility of higher interest rates pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.  “Is there a risk we would go too far? Certainly, there’s a risk,” Powell said. “The bigger mistake to make – let’s put it that way – would be to fail to restore price stability.”  Powell said the Fed had to raise rates rapidly, Reuters reported, adding that a gradual increase could cause consumers to feel that higher prices of commodities would persist. About a week ago, his comments suggested rate hikes could soften before next year.  U.S. equity market futures fell following Powell’s comments, with S&P 500 futures dropping 1.59% and those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 falling 1.9%. Asian markets were in the red with Japan’s Nikkei 225 declining 1.54% and the Asian-focused index Asia Dow falling 1.14%.  Central banks across the globe are weighing interest rate increases amid surging price pressures. Spain reported a 37-year record inflation of 10% earlier this week, while India and China are grappling with the risks of economic contraction.  Such concerns add to already critical selling pressure on bitcoin. The crypto has traded similarly to risky technology stocks in the past few months and has fallen 58% this year.  Contagion risks from within the crypto industry, such as the possible insolvency of crypto lenders and the blowup of prominent crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, have further caused downward pressure on the asset that was otherwise conceived as a potential hedge against inflation.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/30/bitcoin-drops-to-nearly-19k-as-fed-renews-inflation-warnings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c274c4dc9dabdf102d4e9d2518e8e519af8c4b93-832x624.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exploited ""Horizon"" bridge allowed users to exchange assets such as tokens, stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), among the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Harmony blockchains.  A bounty offered to individuals who could provide information about the attacker to Harmony was increased to $10 million from the previous $1 million. The ETH address to return the funds is 0xd6ddd996b2d5b7db22306654fd548ba2a58693ac.  Harmony team has also offered “one final opportunity” for the attackers to return the assets with anonymity: “The final term is they retain $10 million and return the remaining amount, in addition to the team ceasing the investigation.”  Meanwhile, security firm Elliptic linked the attack to North Korean hacker group Lazarus in a release Wednesday.  “There are strong indications that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may be responsible for this theft,” Elliptic researchers said. “Based on the nature of the hack and the subsequent laundering of the stolen funds.”  Elliptic noted that the movement of stolen funds occurred mostly during Asia-Pacific nighttime hours and that the attack used techniques that were “frequently used” by the Lazarus Group.  Lazarus is believed to have stolen over $2 billion in crypto assets from exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Elliptic said. It added that the Horizon Bridge hacker has so far sent 41% of the $100 million in stolen crypto assets into the Tornado Cash mixer.  Earlier this week, the attackers transferred over 36,000 ether, worth $44 million at the time, to Tornado Cash over several transactions, as reported.

42422978,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1z0dh,1656583528,Singapore Central Bank Censures Three Arrows Capital for Alleged Misleading and False Disclosures,"Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), reprimanded embattled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital for misleading it with allegedly false information.  The hedge fund, which is also known as 3AC, failed to disclose ownership information and exceeded the threshold set for assets under management, the regulator said in a statement published on Thursday.  3AC was allowed to manage funds for 30 investors up to S$250 million ($180 million) when it registered as a fund management company in Singapore in 2013. The fund, however, exceeded its allowed assets under management for a prolonged period; between July and September 2020 and November 2020 and August 2021, the central bank said.  The firm had notified MAS that it had transferred the management of its fund to an unrelated British Virgin Islands entity starting September 2021. But this representation was misleading because it failed to disclose that Zhu Su, co-founder of 3AC, was a common shareholder in both entities and served as a director in the Singapore company, MAS said.  The hedge fund also didn't notify the regulator of changes in directorships and shareholding positions for its directors and co-founders, Su and Kyle Davies, within the required timeline, the statement said.  The fund, founded in Singapore in 2012, has seen heavy losses during a market rout that has had bitcoin (BTC) hovering at around $20,000 in recent weeks, down from nearly $69,000 last November.  Three Arrows Capital was reported as possibly insolvent mid-June after it incurred at least $400 million in liquidations. British Virgin Islands ordered 3AC's local entity to liquidate on Wednesday.  The fund also said it was moving to Dubai in May, but CoinDesk couldn't find any evidence that it had set up in the emirate in June.  3AC didn't immediately respond to request for comment.  The crisis at 3AC has leaked into other crypto firms such as crypto broker Voyager Digital (VOYG), which issued a default notice on Monday, after the fund failed to meet its loan obligations. VOYG shares fell 60% when it disclosed its exposure to the hedge fund last week, totaling 15,250 bitcoins ($293 million) and $350 million USDC.

It's been stubborn, clinging fiercely to its perch above $20,000, the support level that has grown increasingly important for investors gauging the current crypto winter's staying power.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down a fraction of a percentage point over the past 24 hours but still resilient at about $20,200, even amid the latest angst-provoking industry news, including a report of an order by a British Virgin Islands court for the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Bitcoin has dropped four consecutive days and dipped for a few short spells below $20,000 earlier on Wednesday before rising.  ""The news cycle has been pretty awful for crypto markets,"" Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email, adding: ""Concerns are growing that the collapse of Three Arrows Capital could trigger further market contagion.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $1,100, down over 3% for the same period and about 13% from its high last week when cryptos surged on encouraging comments from U.S. central bank chair Jerome Powell. Other major cryptocurrencies spent their day in the red, most of them significantly so, with BTT off more than 7% at one point and GRT and APE, each down over 4%.  In a slight twist from its pattern throughout much of the year, cryptos veered from major equity indexes, which were flat on Wednesday after Powell said inflation could continue to rise, a result of the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to address price pressures even at the expense of recession.  Three Arrows debacle continues  Powell's comments offered little comfort for crypto investors already wrestling with the ongoing Three Arrows debacle. The firm has suffered heavy losses in the recent sharp downturn and faces the possibility of insolvency after incurring at least $400 million in liquidations. Crypto brokerage Voyager Digital (VOYG.TO) issued a default notice to 3AC this week after the fund failed to make required payments on loans of 15,250 bitcoins and $350 million in USDC. Voyager's shares plunged after it disclosed its exposure to 3AC.  3AC has been an active investor in the digital asset industry in recent years with investments across non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance, layer 1 blockchain firms and crypto companies.  Meanwhile, a CoinDesk report found that private and publicly listed crypto miners have racked up debts anywhere between $2 billion to $4 billion to finance the construction of their gargantuan facilities across North America and faced hard decisions about how to survive. And a report by financial services giant Deutsche Bank said the free fall of crypto markets could continue because of the system’s complexity.  Oanda's Moya was pessimistic about bitcoin, noting its struggle ""to hold onto the $20,000 level"" and ""the risk"" of miners having ""to unload some of their holdings as they’ve overcommitted with [graphic processing units].""  ""The big transition to a proof-of-stake (POS) for the Ethereum blockchain is a game changer that could hurt miners who financed a lot of hardware,"" Moya wrote. ""If bitcoin breaks below the recent low around $17,500, there isn't much support until the $14,500 level.""

The short positions are worth “hundreds of millions” of dollars, according to crypto trading fund Genesis and have gained since May’s implosion of terraUSD (UST). These include funds such as Fir Tree Partners and Viceroy Research, that have previously bet against tether, citing the issuing company's opacity about the asset’s actual backing and the lack of audited reserves.  “There has been a real spike in the interest from traditional hedge funds who are taking a look at tether and looking to short it,” Leon Marshall, head of institutional sales at Genesis said earlier this week, as reported. Genesis and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.  There are also concerns of traders being able to cash out U.S. dollars from tether. “Traders are naturally concerned about being able to cash out of tether,” said Jeff Mei, chief marketing officer at blockchain solutions provider ChainUp, in a Telegram message. “They are seeking safer and more transparent stablecoins such as USDC to transfer their assets to.”  But how are traders betting against a coin priced at $1? As per Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at USDT issuer Tether Global, the bets are occurring on futures tracking USDT and on liquidity pools on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  “Goal: create enough pressure, in the billions, causing ton of outflows to harm Tether liquidity and eventually buy back tokens at much lower price,” Ardoino explained in a tweet earlier this week.  Exchanges like FTX offer USDT futures to traders, allowing traders to bet on price gyrations as the token falls, or gains, fractions of pennies around the $1 level. Data shows the USDT futures product show over $65 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, with open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – hovering over the $400 million mark as of Wednesday.  On DeFi applications, shorts on USDT are possible by borrowing the tokens and exchanging them for USDC, another U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. The strategy here is that if and when USDT falls, the original loan can be paid back at a cheaper cost with the difference pocketed.  Data from DeFi lending protocol Aave shows the rate to borrow USDT is a yearly 2.48%. This means one would pay $2,480 a year on borrowing $100,000 worth of USDT. If USDT were to drop to, say, 90 cents, a trader could repay the loan with $90,000 worth of USDT, pocketing just over $7,500 after fees.  Traders shorting USDT say the asset could lose value if its reserve backing is proven false. The stablecoin is backed by fiat currencies and equivalent asset investments such as commercial paper, bank deposits, bonds, gold and cryptocurrencies, according to issuer Tether Global.  Shorters say Tether Global has been misrepresenting these reserve funds. Tether, however, denies such claims and maintains it holds “100% of the backing.”  Data shows massive outflows from Tether have already taken place in the past few months. In mid-June, investors pulled $1.7 billion from tether in one week, as reported. Meanwhile, Tether’s market capitalization has fallen by over $20 billion since mid-May, CoinGecko data shows.  Meanwhile, some like ChainUp’s Mei suggest short-selling tether isn’t necessarily a bad move.  “Short selling is a natural part of market price discovery. When there is a market downturn, many weaknesses that were previously hidden start to surface,” Mei said.

According to FATF, only 11 of 98 surveyed jurisdictions are enforcing and supervising the controversial measure known as the “travel rule.”  In 2018 proposals, modified in 2019, FATF said crypto service providers have to verify their customers' identities. The identity checks are supposed to allow authorities to track illicit funds, just as they do in the conventional financial system. However, many in the industry have complained the rule violates privacy and is poorly designed for payments taking place on a transparent blockchain.  While a quarter of the countries supposed to be passing laws are now in the process of doing so, around one-third have not even introduced a bill, FATF’s report said, citing figures from a March survey that has now been made public.  “Countries that have not introduced Travel Rule legislation should do so as soon as possible, and FATF jurisdictions should lead by example,” the report said.  Read more: No AML Checks For Most Transfers To Unhosted Crypto Wallets, EU Policymakers Decide  FATF’s 39 direct members include the U.S., U.K., Germany and China, but it is also responsible for monitoring activity in smaller jurisdictions, such as Bermuda and Cyprus.  NFTs and DeFi  Now the watchdog’s gaze is turning to other parts of the crypto world – and it cites “increasing concern” about the sectors of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi), alongside worries that illicit funds may escape from regulated providers to noncompliant actors or private self-managed wallets.  “Open sources suggest that DeFi is increasingly used for money laundering,” the report said, saying it would continue to monitor the market. It also said criminals can misuse NFTs for abusive behavior like wash trading, where artificial transactions push up market prices.  On Wednesday, the European Union (EU) agreed on the main policy lines of a bill to introduce the travel rule into its own 27 member countries. The agreement saw EU policymakers largely pull back on plans to expand the scope of money-laundering checks on payments to unhosted wallets or digital wallets held off of crypto trading platforms. Industry players like Coinbase (COIN) have previously criticized EU plans to track even the smallest payments to unhosted wallets, which it said would curb innovation and privacy.  Further EU talks on crypto licensing rules, including whether to regulate NFTs, will follow later Thursday.

5320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=494519,1656578611,Ethereum Rising Gas Fees are Still Concerning But Presents Opportunity For Decentralized Exchanges,"Paying gas fees is a crucial component of exchanging crypto and mining digital assets yet remains a significant cost barrier for transactions. A prime example is the major cryptocurrency Ethereum, whose network incurs inherently high gas fees due to its high volume of transactions and token evaluation. The term gas is used to define the amount of Ether (ETH) needed to perform a specific transaction allowing users to interact with the network. These fees are used to compensate miners for the energy required to verify a transaction. The gas price is highly volatile and dependent on a multitude of factors. The primary factor that represents gas fee price fluctuation is transaction congestion.

42422150,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tfU,1656576389,"Messari Research: DCG’s Barry Silbert Wins From SEC ETF Stalemate, but Investors Lose","As the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount – the value of the shares versus the underlying asset – continues to trade in the double digits, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected the company’s application to convert it into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  While Grayscale has filed a lawsuit against the SEC to try to force its hand to change this, Messari Research’s Ryan Selkis has laid out a few scenarios in a note that he sees as possible outcomes.  (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns CoinDesk.)  Should GBTC be converted into an ETF, it would be a massive loss in fee revenue for Grayscale because the firm takes a 2% fee on the underlying assets regardless of the discount.  “A ‘winning’ case and ultimate ETF conversion would eviscerate Grayscale's revenue by more than 50%. An ETF would mean an open redemption window, and a likely reduction in fees in order to retain AUM (assets under management). We’re talking about $200 million+ per year in profit reduction for DCG,” Selkis wrote.  So the question is whether Grayscale is pushing for the ETF in good faith, or is it one big pantomime ordered from the shadowy lair of Barry Silbert?  Selkis doesn’t think converting the trust to an ETF is likely to happen, at least during Gary Gensler’s tenure. Part of this has to do with premium harvesting trades that took place when GBTC traded at a premium and not a discount, which Three Arrows Capital used with extreme leverage.  “What's interesting is that there's a non-zero chance that the SEC blocks Grayscale purely out of spite, and because they don't want to reward what they view as historically bad behavior,” Selkis wrote. “The bad Grayscale Trade was 3AC’s first step toward insolvency. 3AC owned a huge chunk of GBTC with leverage – up to 6% of the trust at one point.”  Selkis thinks that the most prudent and realistic path to ""fixing"" GBTC comes via something called a Regulation M exemption.  Regulation M revolves around redemptions of trusts and funds. This is the series of rules which prevents Grayscale from offering a redemption program as it is prohibited from repurchasing shares at the same time it is offering shares through private placements. In 2016, a legal scuffle between Grayscale and the SEC over these rules caused Grayscale to close the redemption mechanism.  But Selkis doesn’t think Grayscale will initiate this as it will mean giving up hundreds of millions in fees. Why would it? Instead, GBTC shareholders will need to sue for it in order to force DCG's hand away from maintaining the status quo. DCG might not want this, but there is a pathway for them to be forced. The SEC would be receptive to the suit as it would keep a GBTC ETF off the market while its shareholders are made whole from redemptions at a market rate – what Selkis calls an appropriate punishment for a fund that “just helped fuel a shadow banking [and] crypto lending contagion.”  “Assets would absolutely gush from the trusts until the GBTC discount closed in full versus [net asset value]. Grayscale Trusts could theoretically unwind to zero,” Selkis wrote.  In the end, this is still a long shot, Selkis believes, but “for the past 18 months, Grayscale and Gensler have won, while investors have lost. Reg M relief could be the move that reverses the toxic trade. Potentially, for good.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/30/messari-research-dcgs-barry-silbert-wins-from-sec-etf-stalemate-but-investors-lose,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/340640a8c2f7bca2d331c110165fd60475be5e1b-1623x1217.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422153,r2LAFyEJPPW5TW9PoT4tiX,1656552304,Grayscale Sues SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Application Rejection,"Grayscale Investments filed suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) barely an hour after the regulatory agency rejected its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust product to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The SEC rejected Grayscale's application earlier Wednesday, citing concerns about market manipulation, the role of Tether in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and the lack of a surveillance-sharing agreement between a ""regulated market of significant size"" and a regulated exchange, echoing concerns the regulator has expressed for years in rejecting other spot bitcoin ETF applications.  A spot bitcoin ETF is comprised of bitcoin or assets related to bitcoin's price. Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  In the filing, Grayscale simply asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC's order.  Read more: SEC Rejects Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application  The investment firm announced earlier in 2022 it was prepared to sue the SEC in the event of a rejection, saying it would file a proceeding under the Administrative Procedures Act. To that end, Grayscale tapped former Solicitor General Don Verrilli, who has experience in APA proceedings.  “Grayscale supports and believes in the SEC’s mandate to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation – and we are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC's decision to continue to deny spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement Wednesday.  Essentially, the company will argue that the SEC has to allow products that are like other products already trading, in this case bitcoin futures ETFs.  Verrilli told reporters earlier in June that the SEC's approval of futures ETFs indicate the underlying market must be seen as reliable.  ""This is a place where common sense has a really important role to play. You've got a situation now in which you have certain kinds of exchange traded funds, one that is focused on bitcoin futures, and the SEC has approved that, the SEC is given it the seal of approval,"" he said. ""In order to do so it had to make a determination that that giving this approval was consistent with the securities laws, and in particular, that that there wasn't a sufficient underlying risk of fraud and manipulation.""  To date, only a handful of bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved to trade. Spot bitcoin ETFs trade based on the price of bitcoin itself, while futures-based ETFs trade based on the price of CME's bitcoin futures product (which in turn is tied to an index). Bitcoin ETF proponents argue that the futures markets are still based on the underlying spot bitcoin price, while the SEC notes that CME's futures market is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a fellow federal agency.

42374410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRoj,1656547748,SEC Rejects Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application,"Grayscale Investments’ application to convert its $13.5 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday despite the company’s extensive efforts to win approval.  Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  The SEC stated in its decision that the application failed to answer the SEC's questions about preventing market manipulation, as well as other concerns.  The decision joins the SEC’s rejection on Wednesday of Bitwise’s application for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, which is comprised of bitcoin or assets related to bitcoin's price.  Like Bitwise, Grayscale initially filed its application in October but the decision was delayed multiple times as the SEC requested additional information and comment from the public. The final deadline for the SEC to render a decision on Grayscale’s application was July 6.  Proponents of a spot bitcoin ETF approval have argued the product would offer a low-cost and easily accessible way for individuals and institutions to invest in bitcoin. Optimism about an approval began to grow following the approval of several bitcoin futures-based ETFs last fall, and then that of two more futures ETF approvals earlier this year based on the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the same act under which spot bitcoin ETFs have been filed.  For its part, Grayscale has argued forcefully that it is inconsistent to approve an ETF based on bitcoin futures but not allow one based on the underlying investment.  Some of its efforts have included marketing to urge members of the public to voice their support to the SEC, a May meeting with the SEC and the strengthening of its legal team with the addition of Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who previously served as a solicitor general in the Obama administration.  The denial comes as a blow not only to Grayscale, but for the broader crypto industry after a long campaign in hopes of proving to the SEC the product contained sufficient investor protections.  Few analysts and observers were anticipating an approval, however, noting that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been consistent in wanting to see more oversight of crypto exchanges before approving a spot bitcoin ETF.  Investors and crypto observers will now turn their focus to what Grayscale can and will do now to win approval for a conversion. CEO Michael Sonnenshein said on June 27 the company will be “preparing for all possible post-ruling scenarios.” And on that same date, Grayscale said it would be working with market makers Jane Street and Virtu Financial to help convert GBTC into an ETF if its application was approved.  GBTC was trading at an approximate 29% discount to net asset value ahead of the denial, down from 34% a week prior.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/sec-rejects-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-application,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
