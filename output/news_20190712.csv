42403064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXLI,1562965334,Crypto Prediction Market and Derivatives Platform Veil Is Closing,"Veil, the crypto-focused prediction market and derivatives platform, is closing its doors.      Launched in January, the Veil web interface allowed users to place bets on Augur prediction markets, offering an instant settlement API to pay out on clear outcomes.      The startup's co-founder, Paul Fletcher-Hill, wrote in a Medium post:    “We believe that cryptocurrencies and the decentralized web will have profound effects on our future. But today the community of users is small, and we think there are higher impact products and services we can build for the immediate future.”    The company announced that trading on the non-custodial platform will be suspended on July 24. Additionally, the company will disable the capability to build new predictions markets starting today. Conversely, the firm's code will continue to be available open-source on GitHub in the event that other developers want to pick up the torch.      This comes four months after the firm announced at the New York Token Summit it would be unveiling an AugurLite fork and a market to bet on the 2020 Presidential elections.      At the time, reactions were mixed, with some calling AugurLite a “centralized” version of the prediction-enabling Augur protocol.      Fletcher-Hill explained that Veil's lack of success could be attributed to a difficult onboarding experience, as well as its failure to find a happy medium between decentralization and regulation. ""It’s hard to offer something in between that people find valuable."" He also wrote:    ""We tried to do too much. Prediction markets are a generalized form of betting, derivatives, insurance, and more. Focused versions of any of these verticals may be better for users than the generalized form.""    Hill Street Labs, the investment studio behind the platform, is retaining the development team, who plan to announce a forthcoming project.      For now, Veil suggests users withdraw their open positions in expired and active markets, and convert their “wrapped” Veil Ether into ETH.      To facilitate the transition the company has removed settlement fees and will host 45 minute interviews with users over the course of the next month.

42403072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXTA,1562957974,"CEO of BitFunder Exchange Gets 14 Months in Prison for Fraud, Obstruction","Jon Montrol, the operator of defunct bitcoin-denominated trading platform BitFunder and WeExchange deposit service, was sentenced for securities fraud and obstruction of justice, according to a statement from the Southern District of New York.      Montrol, of Saginaw, Texas, also known as Ukyo, will serve 14 months in prison for defrauding investors of his “Ukyo.Loan” scheme, transferring funds without investor’s knowledge or consent, and lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) agents during their investigation.      In July 2018, Montrol pleaded guilty for such activities. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:    “Jon Montroll lied to his investors and, after his lies caught the attention of the SEC, lied to them, too. The sentence he received serves as a reminder that this Office will not overlook those who violate their obligation to be honest with investors and the regulators working to protect them.”    In July 2013, BitFunder’s software was said to be hacked, enabling the theft of 6,000 bitcoin from Montrol’s companion fiat-to-crypto platform, WeExchange.      Per the DOJ's statement, Montrol allegedly failed to communicate the lost monies with investors or regulatory authorities. On one occasion, he promoted the operation as “commercially successful” instead of insolvent. Montrol repeated similar claims to the FBI and “provided the SEC with a falsified screenshot” of investor’s holdings as they began to investigate the exploit.      Montrol’s deception continued on the stand where he provided “materially false and misleading answers” regarding his businesses and the hack.      Additionally, during the investigation it was found Montrol used WeExchange as a personal bank. The attorney’s office wrote at the time:    “Montrol exchanged numerous bitcoins taken from WeExchange into United States dollars, then spent those funds on personal expenses, such as travel and groceries.”    Similarly, shortly before BitFunder shuttered, Montrol began offering a new product, Ukyo.Loan, described as a “round-about investment.” Attorneys also noted that Montrol referred to the investments as “a personal loan.”      Despite his businesses’ insolvency, Montrol continued to advertise Ukyo.Loans netting him 978 bitcoin.      Montrol was also ordered to three years of supervised release and to pay a $167,480 forfeiture.

42403071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXSB,1562952606,IRS Confirms It Trained Staff to Find Crypto Wallets,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may consider subpoenaing major tech companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft in search of taxpayers’ unreported cryptocurrency holdings.  That's according to a slide deck presentation from an IRS cyber training session, which details a number of ways the agency's criminal investigators might find potential crypto tax cheats.  ""Issuance of a Grand Jury Subpoena should be considered for Apple, Google, and Microsoft for the Subject’s complete application download history,"" says the slide deck prepared by James Daniels, the program manager for cyber crimes at the IRS' criminal investigation unit.  ""Each application’s function should be explored to determine whether or not the application can transmit, or otherwise allow, transactions in bitcoin,"" Daniels wrote. If so, it should be checked whether the app allows only peer-to-peer transactions, or also transactions with crypto-related businesses.  The deck was leaked on Twitter this week by a certified public accountant (CPA) named Laura Walter. The IRS confirmed to CoinDesk that the slides were genuine.  Justin Cole, director of communication and education at IRS' criminal investigation unit, said the materials were presented to agency staff at an event at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., on June 5-7.  ""The training material has been used around the world to various law enforcement partner audiences and was again given at this forum in a room that included partners from dozens of countries around the world as well as various press members,"" Cole wrote in an email.  He would not say whether the IRS will definitely implement the suggested measures. ""I can’t discuss specific investigative actions that the agency may or may not take in the future,"" Cole said.  Searching social media  Daniels' presentation also suggested that the IRS request information from “those who know the financial habits of the Subject, including, but not limited to, bank tellers, family and friends of the Subject (if feasible), and establishments the Subject frequents that may accept bitcoins.”  Social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, also should be searched for public mentions of crypto-related information, as well as vendors that accept bitcoin, the deck says.  “A Grand Jury Subpoena should also be considered for (and may already have been obtained during the normal course of the investigation) the Subject’s financial accounts, including, but not limited to, the Subject’s bank, credit card, and PayPal records,” the document goes on, for the further analysis of transactions.  If it becomes clear that the subject of an investigation owns bitcoin, all wallet addresses and balances should be identified, Daniels wrote.  If they use an exchange or online wallet service these companies can be subpoenaed for the user’s balance, addresses, and “any identifying information,” including “any linked financial accounts, login times and information, correspondence, and transaction details,” the slide deck says.  However, the reliability of this approach “has yet to be extensively tested,” Daniels acknowledged. “As such, it may not be advised to send a Subpoena for records if not critically necessary.”  The taxpayers under investigation themselves shouldn’t be sent subpoenas, as this “may be detrimental to the seizure of any bitcoin balance.”  The IRS’s subpoena power applies in civil cases as well as criminal ones, noted Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. ""While this presentation was given by the criminal investigation unit and clearly indicates that criminal investigation will use that tool, there is nothing preventing the civil side from using it as well,"" she said.  However, Zarlenga pointed out, the IRS is required to notify taxpayers before it subpoenas third parties, so people will likely know if the tax agency is looking for their bitcoin.  The IRS is getting ready to issue new guidance on reporting crypto for tax purposes, the first to come out since an initial notice published in 2014. A number of questions on how exactly crypto should be taxed have come up since then, often with multiple possible ways to tackle them.

Cuban referred to the Menlo Park-based social networking company’s foray into distributed ledger tech as a “big mistake.” He continued to discuss the danger of introducing a destabilizing force into already unstable economies or political situations around the world. The Dallas Mavericks owner cited specifically:    “Some despot in some African country that gets really upset that they can’t control their currency anymore.”    Facebook’s project is intended to be a global initiative, a means to extend financial services and access to the more than 1.7 billion unbanked people around the world.      The Libra Association writes in their white paper:    “All over the world, people with less money pay more for financial services. Hard-earned income is eroded by fees, from remittances and wire costs to overdraft and ATM charges… When people are asked why they remain on the fringe of the existing financial system, those who remain “unbanked” point to not having sufficient funds, high and unpredictable fees, banks being too far away, and lacking the necessary documentation.”    Cuban suggests he is “not a big fan” of Libra because of the potential, reactionary impacts of extending financial access to the underrepresented. “That’s where the real problems start occurring,” he said.

In a press release on Friday, the company said it's reached an ""agreement in principle"" to acquire designated contract market (DCM) and swaps execution facility (SEF) registrations with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from a firm called trueEX.      The deal is pending approval from the CFTC, the firm said.      If the bid is successful, the aim is to launch a ""fully-regulated"" cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that would list trueDigital's bitcoin physically deliverable swaps, which the firm states ""have been self-certified with the CFTC.""      Going forward, the company plans to add additional crypto derivatives.      TrueDigital CEO Thomas Kim said:    ""A trueDigital owned and operated regulated exchange is the natural step in our evolution toward achieving our goals. Adding the exchange to our ecosystem delivers a complete end-to-end offering, currently unavailable today, that encompasses tokenization, payments, market data and settlement for the benefit of our clients and partners.""    With the move, trueDigital would become one of very few entities offering regulated crypto derivatives in the U.S. If the deal goes through, its main rival would be LedgerX, which launched a bitcoin derivative offering in October 2017.      TrueDigital has previously launched an OTC reference rate for bitcoin and ether.      It has also teamed up with Signature Bank to launch a blockchain-based digital payments platform.

The amount was worth around $23.8 million, Binance said, though CoinDesk found the total higher at $26.4 million at time of writing. At press time, BNB was worth almost $32, up 5.95 percent over 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.      The burn transaction can be seen here and in the image below.

""The eventual total supply of BNB will still be 100,000,000 BNB.

We have been developing our business and processes strongly. I am very happy that we have reached this point and received the Payment Institution Licence.” Heidi Hurskainen, CEO of Prasos Ltd.    In the announcement, Prasos said it also plans to register under the FSA as a virtual currency provider in accordance with new Finnish legislation that came into force on May 1, 2019.

42403066,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXMH,1562929299,Pullback Over? Bitcoin Bounces $600 From $11K Price Support,"View  Bitcoin's bounce from the support of the 10-candle moving average (MA) on the three-day chart may have opened the doors for a retest of recent highs above $13,000. The MA has consistently reversed pullbacks since February.  A failure to hold above that support level ($11,167 currently) would validate the bearish candlestick pattern seen on the daily chart and allow a drop to support at $10,769.  A UTC close below $9,615 (July 2 low) would confirm a bearish reversal.  Bitcoin has bounced up from historically strong price support, raising the prospects of a renewed push toward recent highs above $13,000.  The cryptocurrency market leader had been on the defensive in the Asian trading hours today, looking set for a drop below $11,000 after a failure to capitalize on a falling wedge breakout seen yesterday.  The move below $11,000, however, remained elusive with the cryptocurrency finding takers around the three-day chart 10-candle moving average (MA) support – then located at $11,150 – and rose to a high of $11,797 soon before the press time.  The $600 bounce from the 10-candle MA could be a sign the pullback from the weekly high of $13,200 has ended.  The 10-candle MA has consistently acted as strong support, reversing corrections throughout the rally from February lows near $3,500 to June highs near $13,800, according to Bitstamp data.  So, if history is a guide, BTC could rise all the way back to the July 10 high of $13,200 in the next few days.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,673 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The 10-candle MA on the three-day chart is now located at $11,167.  3-day chart  This year, BTC first found acceptance above the 10-candle MA on Feb. 9 and the technical line has acted as strong support ever since.  For instance, the cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner along the average line for almost a month before witnessing a 21 percent rise to levels above $5,000 in early April.  The 10-candle MA also fueled strong price gains in early May and June (marked by arrows). What's more, the sell-off from the June 26 high of $13,880 ran out of steam near the key average on July 2 and prices rose back to $13,200.  All-in-all, there is a strong reason to believe that the latest bounce from the 10-candle MA will be extended further toward recent highs.  Daily chart  BTC closed below $11,550 yesterday, confirming buyer exhaustion signaled by the previous day's bearish outside day candle. Even so, the cryptocurrency is better bid at press time, as mentioned above.  The focus would shift back to the bearish outside reversal if prices fall back below the 10-candle MA, currently at $11,167. In that case, the support at $10,769 (July 5 low) could come into play.  The outlook would turn bearish only if prices print a UTC close below $9,615 (July 2 low), invalidating the bullish higher lows pattern.

The social media giant currently has almost 40 posts open for roles at Libra and its wallet app Calibra – mostly taking a focus on data professionals.      In addition to the bunch of data scientists and engineers that would study the ways people use Calibra, Facebook is now seeking a professional researcher with a PhD degree in economics to ""initiate and execute projects around topics such as auction design, economic incentives in consensus protocols, market concentration, and macroeconomic aspects of the Libra currency,"" the job description says.      Giving some insights into the initial design and functions of the Calibra wallet, the ad states:    ""The first product Calibra will introduce is a digital wallet, which will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp and as a standalone app. The first version of Calibra will support peer-to-peer payments and a few other ways to pay such as QR codes which small merchants can use to accept payments in Libra.""    The total number of jobs open within the Calibra team now stands at 13 – a third of the total 38 Libra-related jobs Facebook is currently looking to fill, including senior positions like technology communication director, an SEC reporting director and a director of payments partnerships.      The Calibra job descriptions reveal some of the future ambitions of the project, which is aimed to become a universal global payment system, according to lines like this:    ""In time, we plan to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.""

Questions over that issue will be likely raised during imminent hearings at the U.S. Congress and Senate banking committee, scheduled for July 16 and 17.      Facebook recently addressed the data privacy concerns in a document titled ""Customer Commitment,"" assuring the world that it won't abuse the vast trove of user financial information Calibra will have at its disposal.

Announced by the Litecoin Foundation on Thursday, the partnership will kick off on Sept. 5 – the start of the 2019 NFL season – and sees the Dolphins accept litecoin as their ""official cryptocurrency.""      In effect, that means that fans at home games at the Hard Rock Stadium will be able to pay with litecoin and bitcoin when buying tickets for the Dolphin’s 50/50 raffle, which gives half of proceeds to the Miami Dolphins Foundation and its charitable causes.      The crypto payments will be made possible by a third partner in the deal, Aliant Payments.      Charlie Lee, litecoin creator and managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, said:    “This collaboration propels Litecoin in front of an audience of millions of people around the world at a time where adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to gain momentum and the ecosystem is able to support real world use cases in ways previously not possible.

42403061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXJK,1562918425,Bitcoin Could Help Stop News Censorship – From Space,"A loose group of developers are testing out the idea that the combination of bitcoin and orbital communication might provide a means for stopping governments or other powerful entities from suppressing news they don’t like.  Censorship is a worldwide problem, with one of the more recent examples include a new law strengthening the Russian government's control over the internet, which pundits worry will be used to censor information that reflects poorly on it. As such, technologists have long tried to chip away at this problem with technology that ranges from privacy browser Tor to the walkie-talkie messaging app Zello, the latter of which Venezuelans used to read information that's uncontrolled by the government and to organize protests a few years back.  A more recent effort is being waged by a small but global group of developers who are sending messages using satellites paired with software from the bitcoin technology startup Blockstream, initially deployed with the grand goal of allowing people worldwide access to bitcoin even if they didn't have internet.  Passionate hobbyists around the world have re-purposed this technology to send out news that -- theoretically -- can’t be censored by corporations or governments.  Bitcoin plays a crucial role in this scenario because the messages themselves need to be paid for. That's because users can't send as many messages as they want, given the space limitations for such content. And using bitcoin, which by design is censorship-resistant, makes more sense than a paying with other digital payment systems, which could hypothetically be shut down by the same parties that are trying to censor the messages.  One pseudonymous bitcoiner going by the moniker SafetyFirst has broadcasted dozens bundles of news, a package he dubs ""BlockSat."" They're calling it a test for “proof of news,” a play on the phrase “proof of work.""  The idea is that once the messages are aired, the messages are distributed across the globe. Anyone, as long as they have a satellite receiver that costs approximately $100, can receive them.  As SafetyFirst argued in a tweet:  ""The future of open access to information is happening right in-front of our eyes.""  In a message to CoinDesk, he elaborated on the idea: “It seemed like info you can receive without any third party interference would be of value to parts of the world where information controls (by the government or anyone) try to stifle […] access to news, information, or anything in between.”  Why space is censorship-resistant  Using satellites to stop censorship is actually far from a new idea.  For example, in 2012, hacker activist Nick Farr put out a call to action that led to the creation of the Hackerspace Global Grid (HGG), an effort to fuel research of uncensorable communications via satellite. Hobbyists then deployed miniature satellites, called CubeSats, into space.  ""Since the founding of the Chaos Computer Club, we stand for the human right of free (at least) worldwide communication. [Glass] fiber located on federal territories could become a problem for unhampered communication. People in charge could shut them down to produce a congestion. The task of the Hackerscene is to establish communication ways, that do not stop at borders. The creation of earth near networks, where governments cannot interact with, is one big role for free communication,"" the original call to action explained.  Let’s go back to how they work. As CoinDesk explained in an earlier article about such transmissions, users are mostly using the simple website spacebit.live to send the messages by satellite with just a small fee paid in BTC.  “The news is immutable in the fact that anyone worldwide with a basic satellite dish, some software, and a little knowledge can receive it. No controls on internet, cellular data, or state control can stifle it. There are numerous oppressive countries that censor everything from whole sites to certain keywords. In a world of companies kneeling to these demands, it seems only right to provide people with all the available information,” SafetyFirst contends.  That said, since Blockstream is in control of the satellites, there's a degree to which they and the companies it's leasing satellites from are in control. But SafetyFirst argues that, at the very least, the satellites offers a worldwide alternative.  Countries often shutdown the internet in times of turmoil (in fact, the dictator of Chad has shut down the internet for over a year). When this happens, people still have satellites as an option for retrieving information these entities might be trying to hide.  To this end, SafetyFirst notes that he's been trying to help users send their messages anonymously. “This is the [...] reason I created a hidden service (darkweb) .onion link so they can broadcast over the satellites without fear,” SafetyFirst explains. This website can only be accessed on special privacy-minded browsers, such as Tor or Brave.  Where bitcoin fits in  Again, bitcoin factors into this arrangement because the messages need to be paid for, explains Grubles, community manager for Blockstream.  The number of messages that can be sent are limited by available bandwidth, according to Grubles.  The fees have generally been very low thus far. It costs just a few cents to send a message to space right now, since the system is not hitting this limit. But in the event that more people start trying to broadcast messages at the same time, there's a bidding feature. If there are too many messages trying to be sent at once - the one that pays the most bitcoin wins.  ""The bandwidth is limited so we let users choose to expedite their data in the event there is more demand than available bandwidth,"" Grubles said.  And when paying to send controversial or politically charged message, bitcoin makes more sense than, say, PayPal, which generally has an identity tightly linked to it and could face sanction or funds freeze.  Philosophically, the leaderless online money seems almost like a natural fit as it's a currency that is worldwide, not being limited to a particular country, and unable to be censored by any particular company. If you need a currency to pay for the messages, one can see why it's a natural link.  Farr noted this, arguing: ""I think tying bitcoin to it is one of the best use cases for the original vision of bitcoin: A way to unify a global effort.""  It's also important that the satellite system runs on a particular new type of bitcoin: lightning.  Lightning allows users to send ""micropayments,"" small payments, which current financial apps just can't handle, because processing fees are too high.  ""Lightning is great for this since you can pay and quickly broadcast a message if needed, and also pay very small amounts of bitcoin if your data, or message, is small,"" Grubles added.  Too crazy an idea?  That said, just because the pairing bitcoin and satellites to send out messages that are harder to censor is possible doesn't mean people use it.  Farr was quick to note this. While he called a decentralized network of satellites -- like the one he helped to start at HGG -- is the ""holy grail of censorship resistance,"" he also stressed that: ""[L]ike the search for the holy grail, it's an incredibly complex set of problems to solve that really elude even very well coordinated hobbyist efforts.""  While it's ""technically viable,"" he said, there are other problems.  ""I think we're at the point where the obstacle is coordination. I see this piece as a part of the way to get there,"" he told CoinDesk, noting that people have been working on this type of satellite technology for ""a decade now.""  That said, he noted that the open-source operating system Linux started off feeling like a very unrealistic effort as well.  ""Before Linux proved it could be done, we never would have thought a global worldwide effort of folks could come together and create an operating system, for free. Now that operating system runs the world. Once all of those disparate groups get coordinated, once there are so many cube sats in orbit, interoperability standards and pieces liking together existing old tech (like Linux drivers for old devices), we're basically there. Once launch capabilities are no more difficult to put together than a data center, you'll see this plan come into place,"" Farr added.  Now Linux is by far the most popular operating system in the world. That kind of success that, perhaps, is why bitcoiners are still so optimistic about the technology.  ""I really believe all in all the satellites can be a new age of information sharing. Just look at this guy posting about his worries for Hungary today,"" SafetyFirst said, pointing to an article broadcast over Blockstream Satellite where a blogger outlined some political concerns in the country.  SafetyFirst added:  ""I have no idea if his concerns are valid, but I do think it's a great thing he has an outlet to post where it can be seen and cataloged.""

42403077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXY5,1562911269,Bitcoin Unaffected as Markets Shrug Off Trump’s Critical Tweets,"Donald J. Trump has just tweeted his disapproval for cryptocurrency.  On Thursday evening, the US president stated in a tweet that unregulated crypto assets possess the ability to facilitate unlawful behavior, so far the markets have been slower to react.  Having rose from a local low of $11,187 to $11,532 late evening on July 11, BTC was on the up moments before Trump's tweets began.  In under an hour on June 12 at 00:15 UTC, BTC began to cool, dropping back toward its local low before another surge brought prices back to the $11,400 level.  BTC is currently changing hands at $11,384 so it seems as though for now, the president's tweets are having no effect on short-term traders.  Late Thursday evening the president took to Twitter to offer his sentiment on digital assets, highlighting his administration's stance on crypto.  I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.  It’s a charged response to the ongoing debate over how to adequately regulate Facebook’s proposed Libra project and the subsequent push-back being felt on a global scale. As a result the markets have begun to digest the onset of definite regulation and increased attention from policy makers by reflecting that in BTC's price.  While the move down may seem like an eggregious reaction, the event is not unlike others felt in the past.  For instance from June 26 to July 2 of this year, the price of BTC fell more than 29 percent from a top of $13,800 down to $9,600 before a sharp rally brought prices back above $12,000 in quick succession.  Time will tell on whether Trump's anti-crypto sentiment is reflected in his administration's stance, impacting BTC's long-term price or whether this is another bump in the road for global digital asset adoption.

42403063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeXKJ,1562892225,US President Donald Trump Says He's 'Not a Fan' of Bitcoin,"Donald J. Trump tweeted Thursday that he is ""not a fan"" of cryptocurrencies, saying they were ""not money"" and referencing their price volatility relative to the dollar in his first public comments on crypto since becoming president of the United States.  Trump also criticized Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project in subsequent tweets, saying it “will have little standing or dependability” and suggesting U.S. regulators would subject the social media giant to regulation:  ""If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National [...] and International.""  (Facebook subsidiary Calibra, which is supposed to develop an open-source wallet for the cryptocurrency, has registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.)  Trump has criticized Facebook in the past for its actions in banning right-wing figureheads, alongside other social media outlets. To date, however, he has not discussed Facebook's cryptocurrency plans. The company first publicly released its white paper and supporting documentation for Libra last month.  The 45th president held a ""social media summit"" earlier on Thursday, addressing these concerns.  Regulators and lawmakers across the U.S. have taken notice of Libra, with both the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee scheduling hearings next week with Facebook's blockchain lead David Marcus.  The Senate committee in particular has previously expressed concerns about Facebook's track record with user data and privacy, writing an open letter to the company in May. Marcus responded to the letter earlier this week, telling the lawmakers that Facebook would not itself collect any personal financial credentials.  On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also said that Libra should not be allowed to move forward unless and until the company addresses anti-money laundering and know-your-customer concerns, among other issues.  Financial stability is also a factor that Powell addressed, with lawmakers in both houses questioning the fact that Facebook has set up an entity in Switzerland affiliated with the project.  Facebook declined to comment on Trump's comments.  'Unlawful behavior'  In his tweets Thursday  , Trump took aim at the potential for using cryptocurrencies in illegal activities, citing drug trafficking in particular.  ""Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,"" he said.  In a final tweet, he added:  ""We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!""  While Trump himself had yet to weigh in on cryptocurrencies prior to Thursday, his Treasury Secretary has been a strong proponent of greater cryptocurrency regulations.  Steven Mnuchin has been calling for greater crypto regulation since the beginning of 2018, calling on the G20 to take up the issue during an (at the time) upcoming meeting in March.  This year, the Financial Action Task Force published guidance for central banks, calling for stringent know-your-customer information collection practices. The U.S. Treasury Department held the FATF presidency until the end of June.  “We will not allow cryptocurrency to become the equivalent of secret numbered accounts [and] we will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities,"" Mnuchin said in remarks prior to the rules' publication.  In contrast, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has previously called for a more lenient regulatory framework, saying, ""if we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences.""
