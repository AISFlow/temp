42384429,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXNGn,1597437652,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bounces to $11.8K as Ether Option Traders Go Bearish,"Bitcoin is up Friday while ether options traders are overwhelmingly bearish.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,823 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,517-$11,865  BTC slightly above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin is back on the move Friday, breaking above $11,800 after a Thursday of relative quiet on the spot market.      Read More: As Wall Street Goes Topsy-Turvy, Crypto Traders Are Bullish as Ever      “Crypto has had a good run for about three weeks in a row, since late July,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “There is a current resistance level of $12,500 for bitcoin, which looks pretty normal as markets, even crypto, cannot go up in a straight line day after day.”      Indeed, over the past month, bitcoin reached a high of $12,130 before dipping. That signaled a retrenchment will be likely before a move to further highs in 2020, according to Lifchitz. “A slight pullback could be even in the cards in the next couple of weeks but without any special bearish event, this shouldn't be worrisome and the next major move from here should be up,” he added.      The bitcoin options market appears to agree with Lifchitz. Options with August 20 maturity show trader’s are giving bitcoin a 75% probability of being over $11,000, while only a 21% chance of hitting $13,000 by next Thursday, according to data aggregator Skew.      Traders may be temporarily distracted by more shiny objects at the moment. Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter market cryptocurrency trader, says decentralized finance, or DeFi, is taking the spotlight from bitcoin – but that it won’t last. “Where I see opportunities right now is in DeFi tokens, which are performing incredibly well,” he told CoinDesk. “I feel the bulls will be coming back soon for bitcoin, though.”      Read More: CME Rises in Bitcoin Futures Rankings as Institutional Interest Grows    Ether options bearish    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday trading around $442 and climbing 12.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

But that’s not necessarily bullish for ether. Trader sentiment appears to view ether’s valuation as unsustainable. An overwhelming number of options bets are on sub-$410 ether.      Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank, said some traders are probably concerned the current Ethereum-powered DeFi frenzy won’t be able to keep going for the rest of 2020. That contributes to the bearish sentiment. “Perhaps some traders are feeling that Ethereum has come too far this year,” he said. “With high gas fees, will it result in a problem for the DeFi ecosystem in the weeks ahead?”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green Friday.

42384426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXNBl,1597428820,A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not.,"People from the world’s two largest economies could soon have a much harder time communicating with each other. Literally.    The U.S. may soon banhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-wechat/ WeChat, the multi-purpose messaging app for more than 1 billion Chinese users, in addition to shutting down TikTok’s American operations. The ban could be disruptive for 19 million active WeChat users in the U.S., including Americans who regularly communicate with China. Popular messaging apps such as Telegram and Facebook’s WhatsApp are blocked in China, further limiting communication channels.    President Donald Trump’s threat highlights how governments can, by targeting centralized companies, disrupt the communication of millions of people. This should be the perfect moment for borderless, decentralized apps that can’t be easily shut down. But it’s not.      Decentralized apps use blockchain technology to store data in a distributed manner, rather than having it be controlled by a single company. But technical immaturity, legal limitations and ambiguous regulatory frameworks prevent decentralized apps from becoming serious competition for centralized platforms such as WeChat and Facebook’s Messenger, industry watchers said.      “The daily chat activities are still happening in the Web 2.0 world,” Mable Jiang, a Beijing-based principal at Multicoin Capital, a U.S. investment firm with a focus on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, said in an email. “The User Interface/User Experience needs to be as good as the Web 2.0-based ones, and this point in fact is the universal hurdle for any decentralized applications to be adopted.”      Decentralized technology experienced exponential growth with large investments through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), in which tech companies raise capital through token sales. Status, an Ethereum-based messaging company that aimed to be the answer to WhatsApp, raised over $100 million in June 2017, while Telegram, which aimed to launch Telegram Open Network (TON), a public blockchain project that could be applied to its messaging app, managed to raise a staggering $1.7 billion. Telegram later had to abort the project due to a legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      “Decentralized technology has improved tremendously over the past three years in terms of performance and user experience,” said Jonathan Zerah, head of marketing at Status. “However, much of the technology is still in its infancy and requires much improvement to be compared to legacy systems and web2 messaging apps.”      Blockchain-based messaging apps currently have only the most basic functions such as text messaging and audio chatting, and that might not satisfy all the needs of users, said Jason Wu, CEO of Definer, a decentralized financial services startup.      “If people want to video chat, they would probably use Skype or Zoom via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which is otherwise unavailable on decentralized messaging apps,” Wu said.      Read More: TikTok and the Great Firewall of America      Another reason why it is difficult for decentralized messaging apps to reach large-scale adoption is that many users on WeChat and Messenger might not view privacy, which is a top priority for decentralized apps, as their biggest concern.      Centralized messaging apps might store and analyze their users’ data to come up with new features that make the user experience more convenient. Facebook has long attracted controversy for using personal data to sell ads, and it’s well-known that WeChat messages could be accessed by Chinese authorities. But concerns about privacy have not caused users to abandon these platforms en masse.      “Many of the issues of decentralization lie in the tradeoff of security and privacy for convenience,” Zera said. “I think there needs to be better systems in place for identities and growing one’s network without sacrificing personal privacy and the privacy of their contacts.”      Popular encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram have better privacy protection, but they are not decentralized. While these companies claim they can't read your encrypted texts, user data is stored in a centralized system and the companies have the ability to shut off their services.      Downloads of Signal and WeChat have spiked since the ban. WeChat users in the U.S. scrambled to install the latest version of the app before it is removed from the app stores, while people in China sought alternatives like Signal in case they can’t use WeChat to connect with people in the U.S.      The U.S. has not yet released specific guidelines on how to implement a WeChat ban. Some possibilities might include removal from apps stores in Apple’s IOS and Google’s Android operating system, or barring these two companies from providing access or updates to users in the U.S.    Government control    One argument for decentralized messaging apps is their technical resistance to government surveillance and censorship, as user data is encrypted and stored in a multitude of private servers.      “Centralized technology creates choke points and attack vectors for third parties to exploit,” Zera said. “They become susceptible to financial exploitation and even blatant censorship.”      However, a government can still retain a certain degree of control over decentralized apps, at least for now.      “With the current internet infrastructure available and general reliance on internet service providers (ISP), decentralized applications are not actually free from government control,” Zera said. “Oftentimes, an internet connection is still required to access decentralized applications, which are ultimately operated by centralized corporations or even governments – this has been proven in eastern Europe and other parts of the world.”      Following Belarus’ controversial presidential election result on Sunday, the country experienced a national internet outage. Major social networks and message sites including Viber, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were down, as were local news outlets.      A decentralized mesh network is one way to resist dapps’ reliance on the Internet.      Read More: GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet      In a general sense, a mesh network is a local network topology that enables infrastructure devices to connect to many other nodes in which data can be routed between users in the network.      A New York-based startup, GoTenna, aims to build a mesh network of bitcoin micropayment devices that can also relay mobile communications such as text messages. The device, which resembles a cylinder-shaped game controller, can function as a bitcoin hardware wallet that transacts bitcoin without an Internet connection. The base technology for this network is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and the app in the device is based on the Android operating system.      While it remains to be seen whether a meshnet can be adopted in a transnational scope, crypto payment technology has already been used for censorship and surveillance-resistant communications.      Some decentralized messaging apps are based on crypto payment systems, where people can use their built-in digital wallet to transact major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether. Status has an ethereum-based wallet and another decentralized messaging app Juggernaut uses the Lightning Network as its base technology and has a built-in bitcoin wallet.      These crypto-native messaging apps are partly designed to help crypto holders make transfers and payments more smoothly while securing their communications in the apps. But mass adoption will require scalable base blockchain technology.    National security    Borderless decentralized technology still has organizations behind it, and these organizations must be incorporated in a particular country. That means a government can exercise its legal power to surveil and control these organizations, according to James Cooper, an international law professor at California Western School of Law in San Diego.      ICOs, which were a common way for decentralized tech companies to raise capital, have been heavily scrutinized by financial authorities across the globe.      The encrypted messaging company Telegram raised $1.7 billion from its ICO in late February 2018, in part to build a more decentralized messaging system. Since then the Russia-originated company has battled the SEC in the U.S.. The SEC believes most tokens are essentially securities and companies that launch ICOs have a legal obligation to register with the commission and disclose how exactly they are going to use the investment to develop their technology.      Telegram refused to disclose the information out of concern that the disclosure could potentially lead to government regulation and surveillance of its system. Telegram eventually agreed in June to stop its TON project and return money to investors, as well as pay a $18.5 million penalty to the SEC.      Read More: Inside The Hype Machine- Behind The Scenes Of The Ico Boom      From a legal perspective, decentralized messaging apps are no less vulnerable to a country’s national security law than popular apps such as WeChat and TikTok.      “Decentralization in the end is trying to skirt much of state regulation, but I would encourage people to pay attention to the rules and the laws because national security trumps all,” Cooper said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/14/a-wechat-ban-should-be-the-moment-for-decentralized-tech-but-its-not,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7ef7192ded5af518fbaea9b07f4c6dd1582fa07-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXNI3,1597425628,Money Reimagined: How a Dangerous Idea Could Work,"The Cato Institute’s George Selgin recently quipped that economists who are neither gold bugs nor advocates of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) are distinguished on Twitter by their relatively low follower numbers (himself included).      The joke, for which I owe a hat tip to Nathaniel Whittemore’s podcast interview with Selgin on The Breakdown, seems especially relevant right now. Demands for COVID-19 fiscal stimulus are driving an increasing number of liberals to embrace MMT’s no-limits position on government spending while hard-money conservatives, disdainful of government expansion, are pouring money into gold as a hedge against runaway inflation and general monetary breakdown. As both extremes garner all the attention, it’s difficult for nuanced, middle-ground voices to be heard.      But that middle position is exactly where I’m going with this column, inspired by having just read “The Deficit Myth,” the influential new book by MMT’s most prominent advocate, Stephanie Kelton.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Some of my words might attract scorn from the bitcoin community’s “digital gold bugs,” who tend to view MMT’s suggestion that governments ignore deficits and manage spending by printing money as crazy talk. Unlike them, I think MMT’s take on the relationship between government and money is essentially accurate and that it’s a useful point of understanding in our ongoing debates over how best to deliver economic stimulus in the COVID-19 era.      But I’m also going to say that, within the current analog financial system, MMT’s policy prescriptions would be a recipe for disaster. Without the discipline of fiscal responsibility, especially without the political accountability of having to fund spending with unpopular taxes, what’s to stop sovereign money issuers from doing what they’ve done through history and debasing their currency?      As per the arguments in last week’s newsletter about Argentina, the very act of removing fiscal constraints would undermine the thing that matters most for a currency to function: trust.      The bigger question, then, is what can be done to enhance trust so that unencumbered government spending can be appropriately deployed to encourage sustainable economic prosperity for all citizens. How might cryptocurrency and blockchain tools help?    Uncle Sam can’t go bankrupt    Kelton and her colleagues get some things right.      To start with, they convincingly demonstrate the budget of a sovereign, currency-issuing government is incomparable to that of, say, a household or a company. There is no way for a government to go bankrupt, not in the literal, legal sense. And if its debts are owed in its own currency, there is no reason to expect they won’t be repaid, at least in nominal terms.      That basic but important insight exposes the common misconception that governments are constrained by a fixed pool of resources that can only be increased through taxation or borrowing. MMTers say the unique sovereign power of currency issuance renders the idea of nominal funding limits false. Thus, they show the harm done by rigid rules such as balanced-budget requirements and debt ceilings.      Kelton argues this misconception stems from traditional economics, which frames the sequencing of government fiscal activity backwards. Taxation is not a mechanism for raising funds for future expenditures but a way for a government to compel people to use the currency that its spending initially brought into existence. Taxation assigns utility, and therefore value, to the currency, she argues.      Using the acronyms “TAB(S)” and “S(TAB),” Kelton argues the sequencing is not “taxing and borrowing precede spending” but “spending before taxing and borrowing.” No longer conceived as fundraising tools, taxation and debt issuance should instead be viewed as policy levers for managing income distribution, influencing borrowing rates in credit markets and moderating the overall flow of money in the economy.      The third of those goals is critical, MMTers say, because governments must respect the “inflation constraint,” the one thing they view as a real, tangible limit on government expenditure.      Far from approaching inflation with reckless abandon, MMTers are obsessive about it. They insist governments be singularly focused on preventing a destructive acceleration in prices from undermining a currency’s store of value and hurting savers at the expense of borrowers.    Fine in theory but in practice?     So much for theory. The core problem with MMT, as I see it, is that all state agencies, not just central banks, now have to be trusted to fight the inflation bogey. They must measure it, predict it and preemptively stop it. That’s easier said than done.      More important, they have to be properly incentivized to do so. Because governments are currently sitting on a mountain of rising debt (see the Global Town Hall below), they’re incentivized to encourage inflation, not fight it. Because debt payments are fixed in nominal terms while incomes and tax revenue vary with changing prices, inflation inherently helps the borrower (in this case the government) and hurts the lender (bondholders).      Having inflation as the only constraint exacerbates a principal-agent misalignment. It’s bad enough that government leaders and lawmakers already inoculate themselves from political pressure through gerrymandering and other forms of voter disenfranchisement. Now, without the duty to raise taxes to pay for their spending and with the opportunity to inflate away their debt obligations, it’s easy to imagine a further dereliction of their public duty.      All that’s needed for inflation to set in is the wrong message. If people believe their government is going to become profligate, their inflation expectations will get baked into preemptive price rises, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.      The issue, again, comes down to trust. It may well be a myth, per Kelton, that “taxing and borrowing precedes spending.” But that story serves a purpose if it helps people retain trust in their government. After all, as the historian Yuval Harari explains, it’s our capacity to tell stories and organize ourselves around them – not the veracity of those stories per se – that allowed homo sapiens to build civilization and take over the world.    An alternative    This risk of trust failure means an MMT approach is not viable within our current system of government. It would invite the kinds of monetary problems suffered by Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina and Turkey into relatively stable economies such as the U.S.      But what about in an era of central bank digital currencies? Perhaps CBDCs could offer more transparency and accountability to MMT-guided policymakers, allowing them greater expenditure leeway within the bounds of the inflation constraint.      The rich data generated by a digital monetary system could help officials better estimate money supply, demand and, importantly, velocity (the rate of exchange) – all factors that contribute to inflation but are traditionally hard to measure.      Further, blockchain-based smart contracts could be instituted to automate monetary policy adjustments according to changes in these data inputs.      Of course, those automated systems could be overridden by the central bank, most easily if the CBDC is based on a closed, single-authority model. But if the systems are audited by a third party, perhaps by the International Monetary Fund, central banks and the government institutions they answer to would face a difficult political backlash if they were shown to be abandoning the model.      In return for the policymaking freedom that MMT affords them, bolder governments might even adopt permissioned or even permissionless blockchains to lock in these contractual systems and demonstrate their commitment to protecting the value of their currency.      So, you see, interesting ideas can still flourish in the middle path between the extremes.    Bitcoin's luster grows    By Galen Moore, CoinDesk senior research analyst      Bitcoin has never looked more like ""digital gold"" than it does now.      Consider: Despite the popularity of the ""gold 2.0"" narrative, for most of its recent life bitcoin has shown a negative correlation with the price of the yellow metal.      If that surprises you, it shouldn't. Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, a venture bet on a future technology that most people in the world have never used. Unlike most such investments, bitcoin is fairly liquid. It makes sense that in times of crisis, it's one of the first things sold to raise cash.      That's what happened in March, apparently, and bitcoin's safe-haven narrative took a hit. Following March 12, bitcoin started to show a stronger correlation to gold. It also moved in tandem with U.S. stocks. ""In a crisis, all correlations go to one."" (If you're sick of hearing that line repeated, you're not alone.)      Look what's happened in the past two months. Bitcoin's positive correlation to gold is stronger and more consistent than it has ever been, at any time in the past. And its correlation to the S&P 500 is falling back into non-correlated territory.      It's one thing to say bitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge. It's another to be actually looking hard for the inflation hedge with the highest potential earnings out there. Notably, this week, as overbought gold saw a correction, bitcoin held strong. The rest of Q3 will either jumble bitcoin's ""digital gold"" narrative again, or will solidify bitcoin (market cap $216 billion) as a contender against gold, an asset that has a valuation in the trillions.    Global town hall    PRAYING FOR BENIGN INFLATION. Whatever you make of MMT, demand for fiscal discipline constrains a government’s ability to maneuver during challenging economic times. In a note to investors this week, David Kelly, J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s chief global strategist, laid it out in stark terms. Predicting a ballooning in U.S. fiscal deficits from $984 billion last year to $3.5 trillion in 2020 and $3 trillion in 2021, Kelly forecast total federal debt would swell from 79.2% of GDP to 106.5%, “just below the 108.2% of GDP peak reached in 1946 as the U.S. government faced the colossal debt racked up in fighting World War II.”      Kelly demonstrated how sensitive those debt numbers are to changes in economic conditions. He first described a relatively benign scenario in which continued low inflation allows the Federal Reserve to maintain its easy monetary policy and sustained economic growth restores government tax collections. If nominal GDP growth runs at 5% over the next decade, fiscal deficits are kept below $1 trillion, and interest rates on federal debt stays around 2%, the debt-to-GDP ratio would drift down to a 93.3%, Kelly wrote.      While still historically high, that “might be sufficient to sustain the confidence of global investors in both U.S. government debt and the value of the dollar,” he allowed. On the other hand, if nominal growth runs at just 4%, fiscal deficits average $2 trillion, and average rates are at 4%, federal debt would reach 133.6% of GDP, “requiring an even tighter fiscal policy at the end of the decade.”      This serious debt challenge is repeated across every large industrialized country. It may well be the trigger for an entirely new global financial and economic order to arise.      DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. At 10:10 p.m. ET on Wednesday this week, I looked at CoinDesk’s home page and read its “right rail” column of headlines: “Uniswap’s August Volume Topples July $1.76B Record in Less Than Two Weeks”; “Decentralized Finance Frenzy Drives Ethereum Transaction Fees to All-Time Highs”; “Deposits in ‘Monetary Experiment’ Meme Token YAM Break $460M”; “What Today’s Robinhood Rally Has in Common With the Last Crypto Boom”; “Token Sales are Back in 2020.”      Boy, the DeFi mania of this moment sure feels like a flashback to the earlier crypto boom, which, as most readers would remember, pushed tokens to sky high prices before a brutal crash and reckoning in 2018. But which year? I suggested it looked like 2017 in a tweet, but others disagreed. “I feel like this is 2016 ... 2017 is next year and I am already bracing myself,” tweeted Unchained Podcast host Laura Shin. A day later, after YAM’s fundraising spectacle was ended by a bug rendered its unaudited protocol inoperable and destroyed $60 million in value, it was like 2016’s DAO attack all over again. Meanwhile, with banks like Goldman Sachs investing in blockchain development and talking of launching their own tokens, it felt more like 2015. Whatever year we’re in, this rollercoaster sure is addictive.      A MIND CHANGED. Hidden in one of the biggest crypto news items of the week was a dramatic about-face. When business intelligence leader Microstrategy announced it would now treat bitcoin as its “primary reserve asset” and had moved $250 million out of cash and into the cryptocurrency, the bold move was forcefully justified by CEO Michael J. Saylor: “We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value. Bitcoin is digital gold – harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it.” Seven years ago, his views were different. In a tweet from December of that year, one that – bless him – he has never deleted, Saylor wrote, “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” As Bitcoiners like to say, “at first they ignore you, then they criticize you, then they invest $250 million.”    Relevant reads    The Federal Reserve Is Experimenting With a Digital Dollar. This year, the voices from those calling on the Fed to explore the introduction of a digital dollar have grown considerably louder. Now, finally, as Nikhilesh De reports, Fed governor Lael Bainard admits to what, in some respects, was an open secret: it has been quietly experimenting with digital currency technology for a number of years.

42384427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXNEH,1597423033,"Blockchain Bites: Ripple's Rebuff, DeFi's 'Degens' and China's CBDC","Both the U.S. and China are advancing on their central bank digital currency (CBDC) designs, there’s a new smart contract language for Bitcoin and the Department of Justice (DOJ) seized millions worth of crypto from addresses linked to terrorist organizations.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Digital Dollars The U.S. Federal Reserve is actively investigating distributed ledger technologies for use in digitizing the dollar, CoinDesk regulatory reporter Nikhilesh De said. “To enhance the Federal Reserve’s understanding of digital currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is collaborating with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a multiyear effort to build and test a hypothetical digital currency oriented to central bank uses,” Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard said Thursday. While the monetary authority was long looking into a digital dollar, the coronavirus crisis and China’s ongoing experiments with a CBDC have provided impetus to “remain on the frontier of research and policy development.”      Trial Expansion China is planning a major expansion of testing for its digital yuan. The Ministry of Commerce announced new trial sites for the digital currency/electric payment (DC/EP) including in Hebei province, the Yangtze river delta, Guangdong province and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hong Kong and Macau. When the new trials might start was not disclosed, but the ministry reportedly said that the project design is hoped to be wrapped up by the end of this year.      Dark Markets The U.S. DOJ announced the “largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations’ cryptocurrency accounts” on Thursday, including “millions of dollars” and 300 crypto accounts. In a press release Thursday, the DOJ announced it had investigated and dismantled “three terrorist financing cyber-enabled campaigns” involving al-Qaeda, Hamas and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). In al-Queda’s case, the organization maintained a network of Telegram channels and 155 wallets intended to solicit bitcoin to fund terroristic acts.      Ripple Reset? The CEO of Ripple has pushed back against a Financial Times report saying the firm was moving away from using XRP for cross-border payments. CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted late Thursday, ""Ripple has absolutely no plans to ‘reset’ our strategy"" and that banks around the world were already using the XRP token as a cross-border payment solution.” The FT reported earlier that day Ripple was diversifying its approach, quoting Garlinghouse as saying his company aimed to be “Amazon of the cryptocurrency world,” or a platform for everyday consumers not just an interbank settlement layer.      Identity Integration BitMEX will instate mandatory identification protocols for exchange users. Ben Radclyffe, commercial director for BitMEX’s parent company, said the changes are set to remove barriers to entry for some of its target users, improve the security of the platform, and “get ahead of evolving regulation.” Easy registration, high leverage, and bitcoin-only account balances helped BitMEX bootstrap liquidity from all directions and give rise to its reputation as the destination trading platform for unorthodox cryptocurrency traders, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports.    Quick bites  Belarus is back online, with lessons about censorship resistance (CoinDesk)  U.S. Postal Service envisions blockchain-backed mail-in voting (CoinDesk)  Ethereum futures open interest reaches $1.5 billion (Decrypt)  Congressman Tom Emmer to lead the first crypto town hall (CoinDesk)  Doctor Who enters the cryptoverse (CoinDesk)  At stake    The developer team behind Curve DAO was as surprised as anyone when it learned its open-source project went live Thursday.      The anticipated protocol and associated CRV token were deployed on the Ethereum blockchain Thursday at 22:25 UTC, ahead of schedule, when a pseudonymous community member took the liberty of publishing the contracts found on Github.      This premature move cost 19.9 ETH (approximately $8,000), and was an attempt for the developer, who goes by 0xc4ad, to get ahead of trading. “Yo, @CurveFinance ! Saw your DAO is ready to rock and I gots to MAXIMIZE MY ALPHA ! So I went ahead and deployed it for you,” they wrote.      The Curve team members initially told users not to deposit funds on the platform, but quickly announced they had accepted the contract as legitimate.      While the pseudonymous developer was christened “chad” for his gusto, accusations of a pre-mine were leveled at early stakers after it was discovered roughly 20,000 CRV tokens were doled out before Curve's official announcement, Decrypt reports.      Developed by one of the most respected DeFi projects, Curve Finance, this exploit has some asking whether crypto is becoming too reckless.      Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Ventures, said on Twitter this move has shattered trust in the Curve team. ""So we have a team that either makes bad impulse choices to validate a front-runner and reward pre-mining, stores keys incorrectly, wanted a pay day (sic) for them and their friends, or let people get a pay day for bad legal advice,"" he wrote.      The rise and fall of YAM, the memetic BASED and Tendies projects, and now the unilateral deployment of a legitimate monetary experiment are all part of a growing exuberance in crypto not seen since the last bull run.      But it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. As my colleague Will Foxley Smith wrote Thursday in a story exploring this theme:      “These new projects are about leveraging Ethereum’s tech for unintended uses. They’re about making crypto fun again.      “They’re about making money.”    Market intel    Crypto’s Edge? U.S. jobless claims fell to 963,000 last week, according to the latest report, the first weekly figure below 1 million since March. Financial markets saw this as a neutral or negative move, “since it might relieve pressure on authorities to speed up more trillion-dollar stimulus packages,” CoinDesk’s First Mover reports. Crypto, too, seems unconcerned with the larger macro-environment. Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, wrote Thursday, “Bitcoin could be a ‘risk-on hedging-type asset,’ where it performs relatively well in thriving markets, yet acting as a hedge to global uncertainties, displaying financial attributes that fall in between that of equity and gold.”      Post-Halving Publicly traded bitcoin miner Hut 8 announced a sharp drop in Q2 revenue. Closing the quarter with a C$6.4 million gross loss, the rising value of its bitcoin holdings pushed the firm’s net income into the black. The company mined 795 BTC last quarter, a 29% decrease from the 1,116 BTC mined during the prior quarter. Hut 8 has 2,954 BTC on its balance sheet as of the end of Q2 2020. The company also noted it raised C$8.3 million in gross proceeds from its public offering, which will be deployed to upgrade its existing mining equipment. Meanwhile, rival firm Marathon Patent Group will buy 10,500 new Antminer S-19 rigs for $23 million from Bitmain.    Tech pod    Simplified Language Minsc, created by Bitcoin developer Nadav Ivgi, is a new programming language that makes it easier for developers to write smart contracts on Bitcoin. The protocol’s go-to language, Bitcoin Script, is unwieldy and overly complicated, according to CoinDesk contributor Alyssa Hertig. Minsc builds on another alternative Miniscript, unveiled in 2019, to create a simplified and secure programming language.    Op-ed    Staying Clean J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist and writer for a prominent Canadian bank, weighs in on bitcoin’s proposition as digital gold – and found the precious metal can teach the industry about “staying clean.” “Bitcoin suffers from neither a purity problem nor a counterfeiting problem,” he writes. “But it does have its own unique quirk. [T]rackability means some bitcoin addresses may not be as good as others – they may hold funds that were stolen from an exchange, or used to pay ransom, or have been mixed by an anonymizer. These aren’t the sorts of bitcoin addresses that a sophisticated investor wants to be associated with.”    Podcast corner    Pysh’s Dish The prominent podcaster and bitcoin advocate Preston Pysh joins The Breakdown to discuss Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, the inevitability of negative interest rates and the significance of MicroStrategy’s $250 million bet on Bitcoin.

42384409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXMwf,1597421855,Masternodes in Legal Limbo as Regulators Fail to Act,"Grant Gulovsen is an Illinois-licensed attorney in private practice. The views expressed are his and are not intended to be legal advice.      Last November, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Heath Tarbert stated that both his agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission were “thinking carefully” about Ethereum 2.0’s new proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validation model. Nine months later, the SEC has yet to provide any indication about its conclusion on the subject. And, to the extent that so much of the current crypto industry is built on Ethereum, including most of DeFi, this is a problem.      Masternodes – servers on a decentralized network that perform specific services that regular nodes are unable to perform – have always inhabited a gray legal and regulatory area (at least in the context of U.S. securities law). Given the similarities between the staking mechanisms proposed for Ethereum 2.0 and those found in most masternode-based networks, I was hopeful that some guidance from the SEC on Ethereum 2.0 might help clear this up. But the agency’s silence has left many blockchain networks that use or are considering using masternodes in a state of legal limbo.    What are masternodes?    Masternodes are very similar to full nodes on the Bitcoin network (both of which maintain a full copy of the blockchain and perform tasks related to block validation). But masternodes provide other services, such as allowing for anonymous and instant transactions on the primary network.      Dash, which is perhaps the best-known masternode-based network, utilizes both “Proof-of-Work” and “Proof-of-Service” algorithms to pay out block rewards. In the latter algorithmic model, masternode operators are required to deposit a fixed number of tokens in a wallet that is viewable to the network. In exchange for allocating these tokens and providing additional services to the blockchain network, masternode operators are given a percentage of the block rewards in a revolving queue.      As long as the masternode is performing at a minimum acceptable level and the balance in the wallet is maintained, the masternode will remain “in service” and stay in the reward queue. But if it starts failing to perform as required or the balance in the wallet falls below a minimum threshold, the masternode is taken offline and sent to the back of the reward queue.    Projects that utilize or are considering utilizing masternodes are left in a position all too familiar to the crypto industry as a whole.    What does the SEC have to do with this?      The starting point for determining whether something qualifies as a “security” under U.S. law is by looking at the statutory definition of “security,” which can be found in 15 U.S.C. §§77b(a)(1) & §78c(a)(10).      In both statutes, the term “investment contract” is included in the definition of a “security.” As stated by the SEC in its 2017 “DAO Report” and subsequently by several U.S. federal district courts (most recently in the Opinion & Order in the SEC v. Telegram case), in arrangements involving digital assets (which include masternodes) we should consider whether they are “investment contracts.”      So do masternodes involve investment contracts?      In deciding what is an “investment contract,” the SEC applies the HoweyTest, named after the defendant in a 1946 Supreme Court case.    Three tests    The SEC’s application of the Howey Test requires the following three elements to be present for a “contract, transaction or scheme” involving digital assets to be considered an “investment contract,” or security:    An investment of money  With a reasonable expectation of profits  Derived from the efforts of others    Let's consider these in turn as they relate to masternodes.      Is there an investment of money?      To the extent that masternodes require operators to stake a certain number of tokens to be considered “in service,” the answer to whether there is an investment of money involved is clearly “yes.” The fact that the consideration paid is not in the form of cash is irrelevant for purposes of this part of the Howey Test.      Is there a reasonable expectation of profits?      Where masternodes offer block rewards or other financial returns in exchange for staking tokens, the answer to whether there is a reasonable expectation of profits is also “yes.” As stated by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. Edwards (2004), “[T]he commonsense understanding of ‘profits’ in the Howey[T]est [is] simply ‘financial returns on … investments.’”      Are profits derived from the efforts of others?      One could argue that to receive block rewards, operators must (at least theoretically) actively monitor their masternodes to ensure their wallets stay full and the masternode software is updated regularly to avoid being penalized. Thus, the argument goes, any “expectation of profits” would be derived from the efforts of the masternode operators themselves and not any third-party, such as the team behind the network.      But “in light of the remedial nature of the [U.S. securities] legislation,” the federal courts have “adopt[ed] a more realistic test, whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” It is therefore the efforts that affect the failure or success of the network as a whole (and not just individual masternodes) which is the correct focus of the “efforts of others” element.    Is the network 'sufficiently decentralized?'    Ultimately I believe the question of whether profits from masternodes are “derived from the efforts of others” turns on the issue of whether the underlying network as a whole is “sufficiently decentralized.” That was the phrase used by SEC Director William Hinman in his June 14, 2018, speech declaring Ethereum (the non-2.0 version) did not trouble U.S. securities laws.      As Director Hinman stated:    If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized – where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts – the assets may not represent an investment contract.    Thus, the fundamental question is whether the profits derived from staking tokens are ultimately dependent upon the efforts of a central management team (e.g., to generate revenue, drive adoption or further develop the network).      If there is a central management team or entity upon which masternode ROI is dependent, then. absent any additional guidance from the SEC on the subject, there is a high probability operating masternodes on such networks would be considered (by the SEC at least) to involve investment contracts, i.e., securities.      Given this, until the SEC offers the industry some guidance on how it views Ethereum 2.0, projects that utilize or are considering utilizing masternodes are left in a position all too familiar to the crypto industry as a whole: being forced to read tea leaves instead of relying on clear regulatory guidance.

42384421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXN9F,1597418128,Crypto Exchange INX Plans $117M US IPO With Small Israeli Underwriter,"INX has named a low-profile Israeli outfit to underwrite its reported $117 million initial public offering (IPO) later this year.    In an amended filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week, the Gibraltar-based crypto and security token exchange confirmed it had chosen A-Labs Finance and Advisory to underwrite its IPO.  A private company based outside of Tel Aviv, INX's website names digital asset manager Silver Castle as another of its clients.  A-Labs has received a $500,000 fee to underwrite the offering and will receive an additional $500,000 should the IPO take more than $10 million in investment. Should the sale reach the $117 million hard cap, A-Labs can expect to take home a total of $8 million.  A-Labs is only able to promote the sale to non-U.S. investors.  INX's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month – which put the expected IPO price in the middle of its previous target range to raise $117 million in proceeds – didn't name A-Labs as the underwriters.  INX's executive managing director, Alan Silbert, is the brother of Barry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.

42384415,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXN2x,1597417237,Crypto Savings Accounts Are Coming to Fintech Firms That Use Wyre,"Crypto payments startup Wyre is offering white-labeled savings accounts that dole out interest on crypto, the company announced Friday.      Wyre’s client list includes startups including crypto custody firm Casa, wallet provider BRD and traditional enterprises such as banks.      ""Partners of Wyre are able to offer their users a crypto savings account by simply creating a new savings sub-wallet via the Wyre API,"" the company wrote.      The new product’s interest rates are meant to be more stable than interest rates at crypto lenders because Wyre will manage funds between MakerDAO, Compound and two centralized crypto lenders, said Jack Jia, Wyre’s vice president of business.      Like most things in crypto, the interest rates at crypto lenders are vulnerable to market drops or borrower supply. With Wyre’s new savings product, called Wyre Savings API, the company is aiming “to offer stable yield that has the least counterparty risk,” Jia said.      Read more: BRD Partners With Wyre to Build Bank Transfer Wallet Feature      For the new product, Wyre is only working with crypto lenders that have lending licenses, SOC1 and SOC2 audits and work with licensed custodians.      “In the traditional markets we’re seeing a lot of instability and Treasury yields are down,” Jia said. “There are a lot more traditional financial institutions looking for yield.”      In the initial stages of the product’s development, Jia’s team had envisioned releasing the product as a smart contract but chose an application programming interface (API) instead to make it more accessible to businesses unfamiliar with crypto, he added.      As of Aug. 12, interest rates were 2.4% on bitcoin (BTC), 2.4% on wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), 3.3% on ether (ETH), 5.8% on USDC and 5.7% on dai. Wyre has plans to roll out more tokens in the future.

42384428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXNFX,1597409517,"First Mover: As Wall Street Goes Topsy-Turvy, Crypto Traders Are Bullish as Ever","As the coronavirus takes its devastating toll on the U.S. economy, financial pros are increasingly confounded by the markets.      The economy is in its worst shape since the early 20th century, and stocks are soaring. The U.S. government's borrowing is expected to triple to a record $4.5 trillion this fiscal year, yet 10-year Treasury yields are close to historic lows.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      A report Thursday showed that U.S. jobless claims fell to 963,000 last week, the first weekly figure below 1 million since March. But in the topsy-turvy logic of financial markets, the improvement was seen as neutral or even negative – since it might relieve pressure on authorities to speed up more trillion-dollar stimulus packages.      “The good news may be bad news now,” Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, told Bloomberg News.      Bank of America analyst Athanasios Vamvakidis acknowledged last week in a report that it was hard to tell if the dollar's recent slide in foreign-exchange markets was due to ebullience over easy Federal Reserve monetary policies – or fears that the U.S. currency might be at risk of losing its status as the dominant world currency.      What's striking is that, through it all, crypto traders have stayed almost unequivocally bullish.      Bitcoin is up 64% in 2020, more than double the gains for record-breaking gold. Prices for ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, have tripled this year, thanks to the fast growth in decentralized finance, known as DeFi, and in digital ""stablecoins"" linked to U.S. dollars.      John Todaro, director of research at cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock, noted in an email Thursday that the market value of 10 digital tokens associated with DeFi has quintupled this year to almost $10 billion.      Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, wrote Thursday in a report that bitcoin might do well in any of the currently plausible market scenarios: ""Bitcoin could be a 'risk-on hedging-type asset,' where it performs relatively well in thriving markets, yet acting as a hedge to global uncertainties, displaying financial attributes that fall in between that of equity and gold.""      Trading volume on Mexico’s leading cryptocurrency exchange has quadrupled this year. The number of bitcoin ""whales"" holding at least 1,000 bitcoin tokens is at its highest since August 2017, according to CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole.      Mentions are becoming more common in mainstream financial publications. The Financial Times reported Thursday that crypto hedge-fund managers have returned more than 50% through July, compared with the low-single-digit gains that hedge funds generated across traditional asset classes.      Barstool Sports president Dave Portnoy, who has gained a following this year for live-streaming profanity-laced trading sessions to millions of retail day traders, reportedly owns $1 million of bitcoin after meeting with the Winklevoss twins, founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.      It's all become so bizarre that some cryptocurrency analysts acknowledge even they can't really make heads or tails of the markets these days.      ""Ultimately, when it comes to investing in this environment, the risk factor is through the roof,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers Thursday. ""All risk metrics and meters have long been broken, so we really need to approach all investments with extreme caution right now.""      That's probably the safest interpretation.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin printed gains for the second straight day on Thursday, despite risk aversion in the stock markets. Even so, the immediate bias remains neutral, with the cryptocurrency still trapped in an ascending triangle (above left).      The current consolidation could end with a bullish breakout above $12,000, as ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has jumped to fresh multi-month highs, confirming a bull flag breakout, or a bullish continuation pattern on its daily chart. That could be taken as a positive signal for bitcoin, as ether has recently led the market higher with its DeFi-led price rally.      Supporting the case for the bullish breakout in bitcoin is the recent surge in institutional participation. Open interest in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rose to a record high of $841 million earlier this week and is up by over 100% over the last four weeks, according to data source Skew.      A triangle breakout, if confirmed, would shift the focus to resistance at $12,325 (August 2019 high). The short-term outlook would turn bearish if buyers fail to defend the lower end of the triangle, currently at $11,280. That could encourage selling and lead to a deeper decline toward the Aug. 2 low of $10,659.    Token Watch    XRP (XRP) – One of the largest cryptocurrency projects by market value is ""still trying to find compelling uses"" eight years after its launch, according to the Financial Times. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it may take ""years"" to develop ""a lot of utility through XRP."" Michael Arrington, a crypto hedge-fund manager, told the FT that Ripple's efforts to work with banks is ""like Uber trying to disrupt the taxi industry by working with the taxis."" The XRP token is underperforming this year, up 45% versus bitcoin's gain of 59%.      Band Protocol (BAND) – The much-awaited ""oracle"" token started trading Thursday on the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, according to CoinDesk's Danny Nelson. The token's price has surged more than 10-fold since the start of May, according to CoinGecko. Oracles provide price feeds for semi-automated DeFi lending and trading platforms. As previously reported by First Mover, the Band Protocol is being watched closely by cryptocurrency traders and analysts as a potential rival to Chainlink, whose LINK token has also jumped 10-fold in price this year, and is most valuable among digital assets with a market cap of at least $1 billion.      Yam (YAM) – The DeFi protocol was ""a Frankenstein of other DeFi protocols,"" according to the data firm Messari. It was a ""blaze of social media-hosted meme-economy glory,"" wrote Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics. The Defiant, a newsletter, dubbed it the ""YAMpocalypse."" Here's what happened with Yam this week, according to CoinDesk's Will Foxley and Paddy Baker: The project launched Tuesday, and the next day prices for the token shot up to $160. Early Thursday, a critical bug was discovered that effectively killed it, and the market value tumbled by $60 million in 35 minutes. “The longer it takes you to do due diligence in this cycle, the lower your alpha,” Amentum Capital co-founder Steven McKie told CoinDesk.

42384425,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXND1,1597408406,CME Rises in Bitcoin Futures Rankings as Institutional Interest Grows,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has leapt up the listings to become the third-largest bitcoin futures exchange by number of open contracts.    As of Thursday, open interest (or open positions) on the CME stood at $800 million – up nearly 120% from the July low of $365 million.  CME's 15% contribution to the total global open interest of $5.22 billion on Thursday was the third-highest among the major derivatives exchanges.  In first and second positions, respectively, OKEx accounted for 23% of the total open interest on Thursday, while BitMEX contributed 18.6%.  Open interest on the CME had hit a record high of $841 million on Monday.  Increased activity on the CME shows institutional interest in the cryptocurrency is rising, according to industry experts.  A month ago, open positions on the CME were 12% of the aggregate global total.  Back then, CME was the fifth-largest exchange by open interest and BitMEX was the industry leader.  CME’s climb is ""an indication of increased institutional demand for bitcoin,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivative exchange Alpha5.  Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk that institutions prefer to trade futures of any product via an established and regulated exchange like the CME.  “It's a norm – institutions understand each part of the trade cycle when trading on the CME and don’t have to set up new processes to manage risks that they would have to while buying physical bitcoins,” Thomas said.  While open interest on the CME has increased to record highs, daily trading volumes have recently cooled.  The exchange traded futures contracts worth $347 million on Thursday, down 73% from the high of $1.3 billion registered on July 27.  “It means there is less price sensitivity for trades on the CME and implies less risk for extremely high bouts of volatility,” Shah told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Range play continues  Bitcoin is trapped in an ascending channel, as seen on the daily chart.  A UTC close above $12,000 would confirm a breakout and imply a continuation of the rally from July lows near $9,000.  A move below the lower edge of the channel may invite stronger selling pressure.

The Nasdaq-listed mining company announced Friday the new order will see its bitcoin mining capacity quadruple from 3,020 units to over 13,520 rigs.  Only last month, Marathon agreed to purchase a total of 1,360 rigs – 660 S-19s as well as 700 rigs from rival manufacturer MicroBT.  The new rigs will be installed this weekend at the company's facility in Quebec.  Having started expanding capacity in Q4 2019, the company says it expects the additional hashrate will make its mining facility a revenue-earning venture.  Bitmain plans to ship 1,000 previously purchased rigs to Marathon in October and November.  The deal means the Las Vegas-based Marathon will soon become one of the largest operators in the whole of North America, making up 1.2% of total hashrate on the Bitcoin network.

The Association of Cryptocurrency Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore (ACCESS), a group comprising over 400 crypto and blockchain-related businesses, announced the release Thursday.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore ""facilitated"" the initiative, aimed at assisting regulatory compliance and enhance crypto industry conduct; the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) also helped with its development, ACCESS said.  The guidance is designed around the requirements of the country's Payment Services Act, which was updated early in 2020 to require digital asset businesses operating in Singapore to register for a license.  Specifically, it attempts to offer a standardized approach to combating money laundering and terrorism financing through know-your-customer (KYC) best practices.  ACCESS Chairman Anson Zeall said the guidance would point both global and local digital payment service providers ""in the right direction"" and facilitate successful applications for operating licenses under the act.  The code had been two years in development to ensure it's ""in line with both the interest of our members and that of regulators,"" Zeall said in a tweet on Friday.  The code comes amid efforts to align with the Financial Action Task Force's June 2019 guidance for global supervisory frameworks for virtual asset service providers.  The code is expected to ""evolve over time"" collaboratively and will continue to be updated from ""time to time"" to ensure relevance, ACCESS said.

On Twitter late Thursday, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, ""Ripple has absolutely no plans to ‘reset’ our strategy"" and that banks around the world were already using the XRP token as a cross-border payment solution.  The FT reported Thursday that Ripple was ditching its solely bank-focused strategy for a more diversified approach – a platform offering payment services for financial institutions and everyday consumers.  Quoting Garlinghouse, the FT said Ripple would use its XRP token hoard to create whole new use cases and become the ""Amazon of the cryptocurrency world.""  Ripple's primary aim has been its blockchain interbank settlement layer, which makes cross-border transactions cheaper and faster than traditional wire transfers. Clients can optionally convert fiat currencies into XRP.  But the FT said Ripple's biggest partner, the Spanish bank Santander, recently decided against using XRP for its cross-border solution, supposedly because it wasn't sufficiently traded in some of its key markets.

42384413,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXMzB,1597395362,Attorney Ordered to Pay Out $5.2M for Bitcoin Escrow Mishap,"A New York attorney has been ordered to pay over $5 million to a crypto investment firm for dereliction of duty as an escrow agent.    The agent, Aaron Etra, will have to pay more than $5.25 million plus 4% interest ($59,887) for violating his contractual duties to San Francisco investment firm Benthos Master Fund, according to a document filed at the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York on Wednesday.  Etra had been employed by Benthos to act as an escrow agent in 2018 and was entrusted with holding $5 million meant for the purchase of bitcoin.  The firm had arranged the bitcoin purchase agreement with a firm called Valkyrie Group, which had planned to buy 10,000 bitcoin from a Russian oligarch, according to Law360.  When Benthos saw that Etra was moving money out of escrow without authorization, the firm formally requested Etra cease all activity relating to the release of its funds.  Benthos argued to the court that the attorney released $4.6 million of its funds in violation of Etra's ""contractual and fiduciary duties.""  As a result, Benthos claims it received none of its expected bitcoin.  On June 28, 2019, Benthos began arbitration proceedings based on a clause in the escrow agreement.  Despite receiving formal notice of the bid to resolve the issue, and having communicated with the arbitrator via email, the attorney failed to appear at the March 17, 2020, arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator then awarded Benthos $5,254,561 on April 9, 2020, which included damages and the cost of arbitration, plus the pre-award interest.  He had previously been ordered to repay the firm's remaining $400,000.  When Etra attempted to appeal the decision as ""one-sided"" on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan said Etra ""only has himself to blame"" for having failed to appear or provide evidence.  Etra ""was clearly required to arbitrate any disputes under the escrow agreement"" and having failed to do so is now liable, the judge said in a court document filed on Thursday.

The country's Ministry of Commerce said earlier Friday the digital currency – dubbed DC/EP, for digital currency/electric payment – would be trialed in major cities across the most-developed regions.  These include Hebei province, the Yangtze river delta, Guangdong province and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hong Kong and Macau.  The ministry added that some poorer regions in China's center and west may also be able to join the trial if they can meet specific requirements.  When the new trials might start was not disclosed, but the ministry reportedly said the project design is hoped to be wrapped up by the end of this year.  DC/EP is already being out through its paces in regions such as Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu and Xiong’an, and commercial entities are also helping with the initiative.  As CoinDesk reported, several firms owned by Tencent are said to be working with the research wing of the People's Bank of China on testing the digital yuan: food retailer Meituan-Dianping, video-streaming platform Bilibili and ride-hailing startup Didi Chuxing.  The commerce ministry added that the use of innovative technology, such as digital currency and AI, is aimed at boosting the nation's economy, as well as encourage ""higher value"" industries, the WSJ reported.

Registering to trade on BitMEX takes ""less than 30 seconds,"" according to its homepage, where new users outside of restricted jurisdictions are required to enter only an email address, password and pick a country of residence.  That will end on Aug. 28 when verification will be mandatory for all users, a process that will include proofs of location, funds, trading experience, and more, according to Ben Radclyffe, commercial director for the BitMEX parent company, 100x.  The policy change comes with a six-month “grace period” ending in February 2021 to accommodate unverified users completing the process.  Easy registration, high leverage and bitcoin-only account balances helped BitMEX bootstrap liquidity from all directions and give rise to its reputation as the destination trading platform for unorthodox cryptocurrency traders.  The exchange's primary motivations for this change are to remove barriers to entry for some of its target users, improve the security of the platform, and “get ahead of evolving regulation” in the cryptocurrency industry, Radclyffe said.  The change also will help BitMEX to better understand its user base, he added.  BitMEX's corporate strategy has included plans for mandatory identity verification “for a while,” but running the verification system at scale for all users took time, Radclyffe said on a call with CoinDesk, noting a “material technological lift.”  The Eden Island, Mahé-based exchange has prohibited U.S.-based traders from using its platform since 2015, and recently blocked would-be traders in Hong Kong, Bermuda and Seychelles as well.  Notably, a “good number” of BitMEX users have already verified their identities voluntarily, according to Radclyffe. Individual verification should take no more than five minutes to complete, he said. Corporate verification is a more involved process, however.  Over the medium and long terms, mandatory identity verification should increase the volume and liquidity on BitMEX, Radclyffe told CoinDesk, even if, in the short term, some traders decide against completing the process.  Radclyffe also described mandatory identity verification as a “building block” that sets the stage for future BitMEX products and a general “ability to do more.” For example, he told CoinDesk that BitMEX plans to host a “very significant” trading tournament later this year, which will require user identity verification.  BitMEX, known for popularizing the perpetual swap futures contract among cryptocurrency traders, is currently the second largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange by open interest, with just less than $1 billion in open bitcoin futures contracts, according to Skew.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/14/bitmex-to-mandate-id-verification-for-all-traders-as-maverick-exchange-ends-wild-ways,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b3fccec22b5fbd4b528384b5e38615ee5344070-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
