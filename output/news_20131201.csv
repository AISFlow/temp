42425160,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteph,1385932846,Sports Fan Gets $20k in Donations After Waving Bitcoin Sign on ESPN,"In the latest news from bitcoin’s “Why didn’t I think of that first?” department: one lucky college football fan has reportedly received over $20,000 in donations simply for putting his bitcoin wallet address up for the cameras on ESPN’s College Gameday.  Holding up ""Hi Mom Send Money” signs at college sports events isn’t new, but this fan went a few steps further, replacing ‘money’ with a large bitcoin logo and even larger QR code of his payment address. He even used a vanity address generator to insert the characters ‘HiMoM’ near the beginning of the address for authenticity.  A QR code is like a barcode that is used by merchants and individuals to accept bitcoin payments. The square image is translated into the 27-34 alphanumeric characters that make up a bitcoin address when scanned.  Bitcoiners, who never met a QR code they didn’t try to scan, saw the sign on TV and almost immediately began to send donations. When someone posted a screenshot to reddit, even more began to donate with helpful users enhancing the image and even posting the address string itself. Donations skyrocketed after that. At the time of writing, that address had received 103 contributions and over 22 BTC, well over $20,000 despite a dip in bitcoin’s value. A few donations were large, equaling $4,000-5,000 each.  Reddit user bitcoinpitcher2 claimed responsibility for the stunt, saying: “I didn’t expect it to take off like this.""  He apparently proved the claim to doubters by posting a photo of the sign with another ‘Honey Badger of Money’ one with handwriting referencing the reddit thread. Though he appeared to have a good background in bitcoin knowledge, he wrote he was “still learning how to use bitcoins” and like many other suddenly-wealthy bitcoin users, needed fast advice on how to keep wallets secure. Reddit users soon obliged with helpful hints.  Using a slightly different username, the he also posted this to reddit four days before the game:  I'm planning on being at ESPN's college gameday show in Auburn, AL this Saturday. I want to see if I can get a creative bitcoin related sign past security (they might have an issue with a QR code if I go that route). Any ideas? I thought this one was ok: ""HI MOM, SEND BITCOINS!""  After the amount topped 2 BTC, bitcoinpitcher2 promised to re-donate further funds to bitcoin-accepting Florida homeless shelter Sean’s Outpost and a fellow reddit user who accelerated donations by enhancing the QR code. He expressed some concern, however, about the effect the windfall would have on his taxable income.  He wrote:    “(I’m) not a bitcoin millionaire. I read about bitcoins on Slashdot couple years back, did nothing. April 2013 bubble had me take a second look. Bought a bitcoin in July for $101 to get my feet wet and see what all the talk was about. Watched it grow rapidly and thought about the sign as a joke not thinking it would work.      DanielTaylor    from Europe used GIMP to decode the blurry image. He's getting a tip to an address he PM'ed me. I'll be making a donation to Sean's Outpost as soon as I can work out all the tax implications. Hopefully before Monday when the matching offer ends. In the mean time, someone told me I need to learn how to use Electrum. That's next on my radar.”    He admitted donations probably increased after he promised further funds would go to charity, adding later: “I think the big money rolled in because I said that. Now it will go to a good cause.”  Early bitcoin miners and pre-2013 adopters aside, many people could use an extra $20,000 right now — especially those attending college. The public could now see a flood of bitcoin QR codes in public places as others try to emulate the college student.  Like Alex Tew’s Million Dollar Homepage, it’s an idea that will probably spawn imitators but only be truly effective the first time. Bitcoin and reddit users are known to be generous in the interests of spreading the digital currency word, but there won’t be thousands of dollars for everyone who asks publicly.  Then again, it’s another perfect free advertisement for bitcoin itself. Whenever something like this gains widespread publicity, others sit up and take notice how quickly and simply an account was able to receive large amounts of money from hundreds of contributors, without paying anything in bank or transfer fees.

42425157,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHteZh,1385925025,Australian Bitcoin Exchange CoinJar Gets A$500k in Venture Funding,"Melbourne, Australia-based startup CoinJar announced it will receive “Australia’s first major bitcoin investment”, signing a deal with local venture capital firm Blackbird Ventures to the tune of A$500,000 (US$455,000). The money will come from a group of individual investors with years of technology and startup experience.    CoinJar, founded in February 2013 by local entrepreneurs Asher Tan and Ryan Zhou, is a bitcoin buy/sell exchange and online wallet service with a clean and simple interface that allows customers to link certain bank accounts for direct transfers in and out of the system. It has also developed an iPhone app available internationally and CoinJar Checkout, a payment processing system for merchants with daily transfers from bitcoin to local fiat currency.  The company claims on its website to offer the cheapest bitcoin trading solution in Australia with a 2% flat fee for buying bitcoin and 1.1% for selling. It has almost 10,000 current users in Australia and wants to use its extra funding as a platform to expand into other countries.  CoinJar previously graduated from startup incubator AngelCube, a company that offers teams $20,000 in initial startup capital as well as mentorship and networking programs. The new VC recognition should also lend new credibility to CoinJar in the eyes of the more mainstream business community, and draw new attention to bitcoin and bitcoin-related service providers in Australia.  Blackbird Ventures’ managing director Niki Scevak is heading CoinJar’s new investment team. Other contributors include entrepreneur Torsten Hoffman, RetailMeNot founders Guy King and Bevan Clark, game developer Rob Murray, and serial technology investor Chris Hitchen. Hitchen said:    ""Bitcoin is a game-changer, but the process of buying, selling and using bitcoin is still relatively hard. CoinJar changes that by making bitcoin more accessible and, eventually much more useful.      Their approach of offering a secure consumer wallet and merchant payment capability for bitcoin in addition to a liquid exchange is what makes them interesting; as consumer and business adoption of bitcoin becomes more mainstream, CoinJar is well-placed to be a significant participant.""    He went on to say he believes the team, product and vision are all ""strong"" and he's excited to be involved.  CoinJar CEO Tan believes bitcoin is maturing into something real businesses can and should use every day to ease transaction hassles and fees.  [post-quote]  “Bitcoin is moving past a purely speculative play. It is only a matter of time until business and consumers take full advantage of bitcoin as a solution to digital payments,” he said.  CoinJar has already formed partnerships with a wide range of goods and services providers, including Australian utility vehicle producer Tomcar and crowdfunding website Pozible.  It received some unwanted attention and bitcoin-related heat from the traditional finance industry in August, when Australia’s Commonwealth Bank suddenly froze its business account and even shut down both founders’ personal accounts. The bank declined to provide a reason for the actions. CoinJar subsequently received an offer from another of Australia’s ‘big four’ major banks, NAB, to provide new business accounts.  Sydney-based Blackbird Ventures focuses on “inherently global Internet businesses” founded by Australians. As well as providing investment capital it also maintains a network of contacts in Silicon Valley to help local founders make the leap from Australia to an international presence.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/01/australian-bitcoin-exchange-coinjar-gets-a500k-in-venture-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b1898874efb50018bb05eb922898e9926ef922b-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425162,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHterh,1385916600,Why Bitcoin Fungibility is Essential,"What is the essence of bitcoin fungibility and why is it so important?  Fungibility refers to the concept that every unit or subunit remains equivalent and identical to any other unit or subunit. It is the property of a good or commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution.  For instance, one bitcoin is considered the same as any other bitcoin when it comes to price and acceptance. Gold bullion has fungibility with identical degrees of fineness or purity. Government paper cash has fungibility provided that the bills have not been marked or serial numbers have not been 'blacklisted.' In other words, you cannot be held responsible for the historical path of that banknote prior to its acceptance by you.  Herein lies the controversy. Should you care where your money came from and how does a monetary system cope with the resultant risk placed upon the bearer?  Blacklisting  Recently, it has become fashionable in some bitcoin circles to suggest that blacklisting, or the more palatable term of redlisting, can be implemented to discourage the large-scale stealing of bitcoin wallets or even the ransom demands of petty criminals like CryptoLocker. Either way, it boils down to some form of coin validation with the more insidious side effect being government collusion with the coin validators for purposes of linking individuals to all of their transactions.  A related Scottish monetary case from the 1700s suggests that coin validation is a misguided premise. Fortunately, the judges in that case upheld the principle of unrestricted fungibility. Altering the monetary framework through blacklisting, redlisting, whitelisting, or any variant of subjective taint measuring would have catastrophic implications for the integrity of the financial system, thus detrimentally impacting economic prosperity for the whole.  Although opt-in efforts at sanitizing bitcoin or ensuring proper clean coins will inevitably emerge in a free market, that does not mean they are necessarily beneficial for the larger bitcoin economy and the principles of a non-politicized monetary unit.  Technical solutions  Fortunately, the political and market-based efforts to disrupt the integrity of a digital currency will be met with high-powered technical solutions, effectively rendering coin validation techniques useless in a sea of powerful circumvention.  Anonymizing and mixing solutions such as Zerocoin, CoinJoin, and SendShared will proliferate and encompass a larger and larger portion of overall bitcoin transactions despite the politics.  Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell commented on the recent coin validation efforts:  ""To stop this nonsense we have to make it impractical to pull off by changing the default behavior in the bitcoin ecosystem. We consider the lack of a central authority to be an essential virtue, which means that we can't be protected by one either. We must protect ourselves. This means things like avoiding address reuse, avoiding centralized infrastructure, adopting— and funding!— privacy enhancing technology.""  Distributing mining and Hashcash creator, Adam Back, was simply astonished, exclaiming: ""Their technical representatives of Coin Validation should be ashamed. How can someone who doesn't understand a concept as basic as fungibility and its relation to transaction costs, and the difference between identity and coins hope to exist in this ecosystem.""  Harming bitcoin growth  Private sector attempts at promoting coin validation to seek favor with regulators are doomed to failure, because Bitcoin operates as a worldwide network with a border-less monetary unit. At the jurisdictional level, economies that embrace coin validation knowingly erect barriers to the free flow of digital capital and restrict the beneficial properties of bitcoin-induced growth in that particular region. It would be similar to ""blacklisting"" that entire jurisdiction from the world economy.  With the Unites States at an embarrassing 2% of all worldwide exchange volume for bitcoin trading, I cannot imagine that government authorities would want to take any steps which make the jurisdiction even less appealing.  Quite the opposite would be the economically sound position for US regulators to take.  If Director J. Shasky Calvery at FinCEN were sincere about attracting bitcoin-related companies to the US and not inhibiting innovation, she would have FinCEN make a public pronouncement that banks in compliance with existing AML laws and KYC guidelines have nothing to fear from engaging in business with bitcoin companies.  Additionally, FinCEN should state explicitly that it rejects coin validation and any other attacks on unrestricted fungibility for bitcoin, because this would undoubtedly taint the jurisdiction.  This type of leadership action would accomplish two objectives. First, it would serve to establish the longer-term principle that bitcoin trading does not require regulation as a government-issued financial instrument (as other jurisdictions have done).  Secondly, it would lift the cloud of the chilling effect emanating from one of the country's leading law enforcement agencies, which we all know is an obtuse method to control and gain preemptive compliance in an extrajudicial manner.  User reaction  At the economic level for bitcoin businesses, any exchange or merchant that attempted to launch or participate in a coin validation scheme would find themselves largely shunned by the user community. Given such massive disapproval from the bitcoin user community, organized boycotts against certain companies could become a reality.  Conversely, any exchange or merchant that rejected coin validation schemes or redlisting would experience a dramatic increase in business volume. This fact alone should produce a stabilizing effect due to the incentives aligned against the validation trolls.  Protecting the core Bitcoin protocol, including unrestricted fungibility as it relates to bitcoin transactions, mining, and acceptance, requires vigorous defense of bitcoin transactions that are free from third-party validation because such validation jeopardizes overall fungibility and creates transactional friction.  Proactively, I call upon the Bitcoin user community and Bitcoin infrastructure companies to oppose any initiatives that attempt to undermine bitcoin fungibility and to support solutions that promote the broad adoption of privacy enhancing technologies for bitcoin.  However, do not worry, for bitcoin fungibility is inherently protected by design. If all else fails, there is always the ultimate solution to ""fork off"" the debilitating, validation-seeking Govcoin chain and become free again.

42376742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpEt,1385897637,Leaked Documents Show Dutch Rabobank Blocked Bitcoin for 'Ethical Reasons',"Rabobank, the Netherlands’ third-largest retail bank by market share, blocked its customers' transfers to bitcoin exchanges for 'ethical reasons', according to several first-hand customer reports and bank documents leaked to Dutch news sites.  When questioned about the blocks, Rabobank apparently told some customers there were “technical problems” with the transfer, but told others the bank’s own internal Ethics Commission had ruled to disallow bitcoin trading.  Dutch whistleblowing site Publeaks also published an internal Rabobank document first obtained by another website, Tweakers, that appeared to confirm it was the Ethics Commission who had advised its branches not to facilitate bitcoin trading for customers.  Tweakers reported the main reason behind the advice was the lack of government oversight for digital currencies, allowing them to be more easily used for criminal activities like money laundering, child pornography and drug smuggling.  The documents went on to recommend customers engaging in bitcoin trading be labeled as having a “higher risk profile” in general. While the bank did not specify the implications of such a profile, it likely means these customers would find it more difficult to obtain loans in the future and if loans were granted, possibly pay higher interest rates than other customers.  Rabobank denied the leaked report had anything to do with blocking bitcoin-related transactions, saying payment problems were related to technical issues after all. A bank spokesperson clarified the issue further by saying “facilitating trading” did not refer to individual customers seeking to buy bitcoin, but instead to the bank’s unwillingness to grant loans to businesspeople wanting to start bitcoin exchanges.  [post-quote]  The Ethics Commission’s advice was just that, the spokesperson said, and it was not binding upon local branches to follow. Rabobank’s structure is different to other large banking groups in that its network of local branches is actually the parent organization to its central authority. Branches have a higher degree of autonomy than those of other banks, and could decide for themselves whether to follow the Ethics Commission’s advice or not.  Should that advice ever become part of Rabobank’s list of standard regulations in the future, however, branches would be bound to follow it.  It’s actually not the first time Rabobank has shown an aversion to bitcoin-related activities. As far back as December 2012, when bitcoins traded for around $15 each and were still considered a niche hobby for technology enthusiasts, customers reported “strange errors” when trying to transfer money to bitcoin exchanges.  Jouke Hofman, co-founder of local exchange Bitonic.nl, posted in the bitcointalk forums at the time that Rabobank had previously worked with his company to develop a ‘fraud detection system’, but later revealed the bank was developing its own fraud detection system, which soon began blocking some transfers to Bitonic. Customers of other European banks, such as France’s Crédit Agricole and Germany’s Commerzbank, also reported blacklistings and frozen accounts.  Stories of major banks closing the accounts of bitcoin-related businesses and refusing transactions have since become more commonplace, with at least six banks in the US taking some form of action against bitcoin, including Capital One and IAFCU, and payment services companies like Dwolla shutting down their bitcoin operations.  Banks in several other countries have also engaged in some level of anti-bitcoin activity, such as Australia’s Commonwealth Bank, Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada, Barclayshttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20120925.html in the UK and Sweden’s Swedbank.  Reasons were usually vague or not given, but the actions were often justified on ethics and fraud grounds. Commenters have scoffed at such rationales, however, pointing out that large banks including Barclays and Rabobank itself were penalized for their involvement in recent financial scandals such as Libor rate rigging.
