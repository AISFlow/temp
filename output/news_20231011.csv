18676043,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554975,1697065218,Will Ethereum Drop Back To $900? Here’s What This Analyst Thinks,"Following the Terra LUNA network collapse back in 2022, the price of Ethereum followed the general market downtrend. As a result of this, the ETH price had fallen to a new cycle low of $900, before recovering once more. However, now that the altcoin is still deep in the throes of the bear market, questions have arisen once more about the chances of the price returning to its 2022 lows. Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Could Drop To $900 In an analysis posted on TradingView, crypto analyst FieryTrading presents a scenario in which the price of Ethereum could fall back toward its 2022 lows. The analysis in question takes into account the multiple bullish trend lines that the digital asset’s price had fallen through over the last year. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunge Drives Liquidation Above $30 Million, More Pain To Come? According to FieryTrading, Ethereum had one last remaining bullish line which had emerged on the chart back toward the bottom of the June 2022 sell-offs. However, the digital asset hasn’t been able to hold this trend line and they point out that “it’s well over a year old and must carry some weight.” ETH price could fall to $900 | Source: Tradingview.com Due to this, the crypto analyst believes that the digital asset has entered into a long bearish stretch. As this bear stretch continues, which the analyst expects to be even longer, they see a high possibility of the Ethereum price reaching as low as $900 once more, as shown in the chart below. Despite being seemingly convinced about ETH’s price decline, the analysis still needs confirmation. Their explanation which is shown in the chart as well asks to wait for the price to break below the $1,510 level for this to take place. ETH price falls to $1,567 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Bearish Going Into The Bitcoin Halving As the analyst explains, the bearish expectation is not localized to just the Ethereum price alone. It seems to encompass the whole market which the analyst believes has finished out its half bullish stretch and has now entered into the bearish half that often leads up to the halving. As the analyst puts it, this indicates “that it’s the turn of the bears by now.” This school of thought is not new and is actually backed up by historical data. When looking at the charts of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it shows that there was a bearish stretch leading up to the Bitcoin halving. After the event, this trend tends to reverse, which then signals the start of the bull market.

This explorer fuses the capabilities of ChatGPT to ease interaction with the public, proof-of-stake blockchain. Algorand is a smart contract platform similar to Ethereum, allowing users to deploy decentralized applications (dapps). In a Medium post on October 10, the team said the plugin aims to solve challenges facing Algorand indexers and eventually simplify exploring the smart contract platform. Ordinarily, users rely on indexers through which users can search and query the blockchain. This is because indexers have to create a searchable database holding all data, such as transactions, blocks, and more. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto CEO Delivers Bad News For The Altcoin Besides offering an interface for users to explore Algorand, the AlgorandExplorer supports “semantic conversational searches, enriching data with logs and related transactions,” allowing on-chain searches to “reason with data” more effectively. The explorer will integrate a language translation tool, meaning users from across the globe can explore Algorand using their native language. Still, the AlgorandExplorer is under development. Eventually, in the coming version, the GoPlausible plans to include more enhancements, including Algorand Request for Comments (ARCs) and technical documentation. Algorand is far from the only platform investing in AI; a few months ago, Solana announced their integration of a ChatGPT plugin focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The plugin, the foundation said, facilitates the buying and listing of NFTs. At the same time, it can interpret data and find the floor price of NFT collections listed on the blockchain. The floor price is the lowest price an NFT in a given collection can be sold. The ALGO Sell-Off Continues: Will Prices Sink To New Lows? While the move by the Algorand Foundation could see more users explore and analyze transactions on the smart contract platform, there has been no significant impact on prices. The ALGO sell-off was made worse by allegations made by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June that ALGO and other coins, including Axie Infinity (AXS) and Cardano (ADA), are unregistered securities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See A 50% Rise Based On This, Analyst Explains Presently, ALGO remains under pressure, consolidating within a tight range defined by the sell-off recorded in August. Based on that formation, the coin is technically bearish and trending within the bear bar of August 17, a bearish engulfing bar that had high trading volume. Thus far, looking at trackers, the coin is down by over 70% in the past year of trading. From the daily chart, ALGO is also edging lower, wiping gains posted in the first week of October. Technically, ALGO is edging closer to all-time lows registered in August, a net negative. The primary supports remain at $0.08. If broken in Q4 2023, the odds of ALGO sinking even lower, completely reversing gains of 2021, will be on the table.

Palestinian Islamic Jihad received $93 million in crypto between August 2021 and June 2023, Elliptic said. Hamas received about $41 million in the same timeframe, the report read.  Crypto is often seen as a subterfuge financing method for groups and nations cut from the U.S. controlled global financial system. North Korean hackers, for instance, have gained millions of dollars in crypto from hacking various protocols and projects. Because of the privacy-preserving nature of many cryptocurrencies, these flows of funds are hard to track, raising anxiety among government agencies.“  ""This is not an easy task,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the WSJ.  CoinDesk reported this June that Hamas’ militant wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, had received up to $100,000 in bitcoin (BTC) since the beginning of 2021 – with a spike in donations in May, when Israel and Hamas exchanged rocket attacks. Binance was at the center of the transactions, according to data from three blockchain analytics firms and CoinDesk’s analysis.  Still, crypto is not the main source of money for Hamas and affiliated groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon. Iran is by far the largest funding source, to the tune of $100 million a year, according to the U.S. government.  “Crypto is a very small part of Hamas’ fundraising strategy. It’s mostly state-sponsored,” Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs of blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, told CoinDesk. “There’s a focus on it because you are trying to cut off financing by any means.

Bitcoin late in the afternoon on Wednesday was down 2.5% over the past 24 hours, underperforming the CoinDesk Market Index’s (CMI) 1.75% decline.  Among large-cap cryptos, the Ripple Labs-related [XRP], litecoin [LTC] and Polkadot’s native token [DOT] fell 2%-3%. Ether [ETH] outperformed BTC and the CMI, declining 0.7% to near $1,550. Crypto derivatives traders who bet on higher prices with long positions suffered $50 million in liquidations during the day, CoinGlass data shows. BTC constituted $22.5 million of the liquidations, marking the second-highest reading this month.  The weak price action of crypto occurred as traditional markets continued to post gains, with the Nasdaq advancing 0.7% and the S&P 500 adding 0.4% – both indexes now on a four-day winning streak. Bonds are having a winning streak of their own, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield lower by 10 basis points to 4.56%. It closed last Friday at 4.80%.  In economic news, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for September came in a bit stronger than expectations. The minutes from the most recent meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) showed most expect one more rate hike before the monetary tightening cycle is complete.  What’s next for BTC price?  Some analysts noted BTC’s remarkable steadiness over past weeks amid falling U.S. stocks and bond market rout. However, that trend appeared to fizzle out after the crypto failed to break above a heavy resistance at around $28,000, a confluence of the 200-day and 200-week moving averages.  Popular trader XO said in an X post that “narratives will shift bearish” for bitcoin as “spot holders will start unwinding in fear or lower prices,” hinting at a potential fall below $25,000.  Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, noted in an X post that bitcoin broke down from its upward trend starting at its rally from $25,000, and could retest lower levels.  He said that BTC could potentially find support at the upper bound of its downtrend from summer, otherwise it could fall further to $24,000-$25,000.  Despite a potential decline in the short-term, bitcoin could be primed for higher prices in the long run.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol opened voting Tuesday on a proposal to authorize its founders Tyler Ward and Troy Murray to do whatever’s necessary to comply “with the Order of the Securities and Exchange Commission,” including the payment of “disgorgement.”  BarnBridge sought to build fixed-income products for savvy on-chain crypto investors. But the team’s efforts stopped in July when they revealed the project faced an investigation from the SEC.  It’s not clear what law the project may have broken but the SEC’s involvement indicates BarnBridge was likely providing some sort of securities product to U.S. investors – at least in the eyes of U.S. investigators. The current DAO vote indicates the project’s founders intend to comply with regulators’ demands – a prospect that could mean shutting down.  The proposal includes provisions that would liquidate the treasury “and allow Ward and Murray to distribute the tokens,” although it does not say to whom. BarnBridge’s treasury sits above $200,000 in various cryptocurrencies according to public data on two wallets. Some of that cash is also earmarked for legal expenses by the proposal.  While BarnBridge isn’t the first so-called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to face SEC action, it may well be the first to respond by asking its community for permission to proceed.

42392334,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg59Od,1697057486,The Protocol: Bitcoin Might Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under ‘BitVM’ Plan,"Bitcoin tech is suddenly in the spotlight after the publication by ZeroSync’s Robin Linus of his “BitVM” paper, which outlines a plan to easily add smart contracts to the original blockchain. The announcement has generated enthusiasm in Bitcoin circles, since smart contracts are the key innovation behind the second-biggest blockchain, Ethereum, not to mention its hordes of imitators.  Also:  Israeli crypto firms scramble to deal with Hamas war.  More blockchain startups cut jobs as crypto winter drags on.  Avalanche blockchain now used to track cannabis.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  BITCOIN’S NEW PARADIGM? This week’s publication of a research paper outlining the design for BitVM, “a computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts,” got bitcoiners buzzing on social-media forums. The big idea is that Ethereum-style smart contracts and might be coming to Bitcoin, raising the possibility of a existential transformation of the originally payments-focused blockchain – perhaps even a bigger development than the advent of NFTs earlier this year via the Ordinals protocol. “Bitcoin is about to become a lot smarter,” according to one post on X. “Something really interesting cooking,” wrote another. The author of the BitVM paper is Robin Linus, a core contributor to ZeroSync, a Swiss non-profit that’s building tools for Bitcoin developers to use zero-knowledge proofs – a type of cryptography that has become one of the hottest trends of 2023 in the Ethereum ecosystem. “BitVM is an amazing breakthrough because while there are many gaping holes right now in the BitVM, they are mostly solvable,” Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq.io, a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, wrote in a post on X. One person went so far as to inscribe Linus’s paper onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitVM relies on computations performed off-blockchain and then verified on-chain using a setup similar to those found in so-called optimistic rollups on Ethereum. The details are quite technical, as evidenced by an article on the topic in Bitcoin Magazine that delved into the arcana of “NAND gates.” A poster on X put up a white flag, asking “Can you explain BitVM in plain English?” and then giving only two choices, “No” and “No way.” There were memes aplenty.  HARSH WINTER: In the last edition of The Protocol, we recounted the rounds of layoffs coursing through the blockchain industry – at Chia Network, Chainalysis and Yield Protocol. Such moves come as digital-asset markets have stalled over the past several months, prolonging what many experts describe as an unusually harsh “crypto winter.” According to the analysis firm Messari, fundraising for crypto startups has hit a three-year low. Well, over the past week, there’s been more job cuts. CoinDesk broke the news this week that Blocknative, a provider of tools on the Ethereum blockchain, had reduced headcount by a third, which works out to about a dozen people. Last week, the crypto custody firm Ledger cut 12% of staff, or about 88 jobs, citing “macroeconomic headwinds” that are “limiting our ability to generate revenue.” Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, eliminated an unspecified number of roles, even though it closed a $450 million funding round just 18 months ago, Unchained reported. In a statement on Yuga’s website, CEO Daniel Alegre wrote that the company had “a number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies.” It bears pointing out that the broader economy doesn’t seem to be suffering in the same way; the U.S. added 336,000 jobs in September, double analysts’ forecasts, a government report last week showed.  ISRAELI CRYPTO FIRMS DEAL WITH WAR: The past week’s surprise attack on Israel by Hamas fighters has upended the daily routines of crypto firms based in the Middle Eastern country, known as a haven for startups and tech companies. Several Israeli crypto executives and developers told CoinDesk they weren’t experiencing severe business disruptions, especially since many of them work remotely. But already, many employees of the firms are getting called up to reserve duties in the army. There were the personal elements such as the stress – digesting the scope of the damage, and the tragedies – as well as coping with bare supermarket shelves and repeated siren warnings. One of the largest projects so far to come out of the disaster is Crypto Aid Israel, a campaign led by Israeli crypto firms to gather crypto donations to help citizens who have been affected or displaced by the ongoing war. Separately, a local media outlet reported that Israeli police have frozen cryptocurrency accounts linked to Hamas, working with the crypto exchange Binance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hamas along with the militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their Lebanese ally Hezbollah received more than $100 million combined in crypto funding into their digital-currency wallets over the past couple years.  Avalanche social app Stars Arena, which became a sudden sensation when it launched a week ago, generating enthusiasm in the market for the blockchain’s AVAX tokens, suffered a reversal of fortune on Oct. 7 when it got drained of nearly all locked funds, some $3 million worth. The episode was attributed to a “major security breach with the smart contract.” WAIT THIS JUST IN: On Wednesday, the smart-contract address that launched the attack encoded a message into a blockchain transaction: “I would like to cooperate.”  Thorswap, a decentralized cross-chain crypto exchange, shifted into “maintenance mode” after the infamous “FTX Exploiter” used a series of Ethereum transactions to move funds onto the platform; project says the action was taken after “consultation with advisors, legal counsel and law enforcement.”  ALSO:  Activist crypto investors scored a $2.5M bounty after mounting a campaign on FloorDAO.

Crypto Startup Fundraising in Deep Chill  The job cuts. The stall-out in this year’s bitcoin price rally. Those are just a couple signs of the prolonged crypto winter. Here’s another: a continued decline in funds raised by blockchain startups. Crypto firms raised $2.1 billion in the third quarter, down 36% from the prior quarter to the lowest in almost three years, according to a report last week from the analysis firm Messari. As the overall pie shrinks, investors are increasingly putting their money into early-stage startups rather than later-stage deals – “indicative of strategic bear-market positioning as investors attempt to fund projects with asymmetric upside that can return greater multiples when market sentiment eventually shifts in a positive direction,” according to Messari.

42392324,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg58UD,1697056128,Crypto Bills May Depend on U.S. House GOP Battle Over Scalise Speaker Pick,"House Republicans quickly nominated a replacement for the speaker of the House, current Majority Leader Steve Scalise, but a floor vote may be more of a challenge, and legislation to fund the government and to regulate crypto may hinge on the outcome.  Several GOP lawmakers have already declared they won't be voting for Scalise, though others who ousted Kevin McCarthy are on board.  The U.S. House of Representatives won’t get back to work on crypto legislation if Republicans can’t unify behind majority choice Steve Scalise – or some alternative – after the party’s ousting of Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) derailed the congressional agenda.  The GOP nominee to replace him, Rep. Scalise (R-La.), so far may be short of the 217 supporters needed to elect him as speaker in a floor vote, as a handful of Republican lawmakers openly stated their intention to favor a different candidate on Wednesday. Until Scalise hits his number, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) – currently the No. 3 rank in the House – remains unable to pursue Scalise’s majority leader spot, which could potentially further elevate one of Congress’ most avowed fans of crypto.  The uncertainty over Scalise also keeps Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the stand-in speaker, from returning to his chairmanship of the House Financial Services Committee, which has been shepherding the leading crypto legislation in this session. When Republicans eventually pick a speaker, industry lobbyists have suggested McHenry may have built up some goodwill for taking the party’s reins, and he could spend some of that on getting floor votes for two crypto bills that cleared his panel.  The unprecedented ousting of Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last week left the chamber in some disarray. The Wednesday nomination of Scalise over Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the favored candidate of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in Congress, left some hard feelings in the party. Some Jordan supporters posted on X.com that they’ll keep backing him over Scalise, and at least one took issue with Scalise’s budget position.  “I let Scalise know in person that he doesn’t have my vote on the floor, because he has not articulated a viable plan for avoiding an omnibus,” Rep. Tom Massie posted on the site formerly known as Twitter.  Jordan reportedly offered to nominate Scalise himself on the House floor, and some among the Republicans who rose up against McCarthy – including Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) – indicated they’ll vote for Scalise, so it’s possible the rest of that conservative block can still be moved.  For the digital assets industry, one of the major immediate impediments to crypto progress is the speakership uncertainty. The next roadblock will also be a new speaker’s priority: funding the federal government. Congress has until Nov. 17 to work out a spending package – potentially another temporary extension – to keep the government functioning.  After that, lawmakers can return to the regular course of legislating, which could include consideration of digital assets bills, assuming Scalise didn’t make other hefty legislative promises to secure support in the speaker vote. Two crypto-focused bills are on deck in the House. One would set up government guardrails for U.S.-issued stablecoins and the other would establish a wide-reaching system of regulations for crypto markets.  Even if the House eventually approves one or both of the bills, their fate in the Senate remains problematic. Key lawmakers there – including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee – are highly critical of the industry.

Mining companies are struggling with high energy costs and low prices for their product, causing a shift in the debate between owning Bitcoin or mining stocks. The upcoming 2024 halving event is highly anticipated, as previous halvings have preceded significant bull runs in the Bitcoin market. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) finds itself in a consolidation phase after an impressive rally, largely due to the recent shifts in the crypto landscape. Data by YCharts When I wrote this article Riot was, for me, one of the biggest bargains in the market. The stock has since rallied, and I parted with my position before the strong selloff (and regrettably part of the upward move). To many, this seemed like a breather for a crypto sector that's weathered storms of late. While investors will be encouraged by the recent stability in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices, which currently hovers above its 5-year average, many will also be bullish about the imminent halving phenomenon's potential to push token prices to new heights. Data by YCharts This optimism, however, is juxtaposed against mining giants grappling with escalating energy expenses and less-than-enticing prices for their primary commodity. Compounding the challenges for miners is the heightened scrutiny on crypto exchanges, accentuated by events like the FTX (FTT-USD) downfall. While there's a clear demarcation between crypto exchanges and the short-term price action of Bitcoin (and associated mining outfits by extension), adverse news stories inevitably cast shadows on the broader industry. Previously, Bitcoin's wild price surges overshadowed many of the structural issues within the mining sector. Its recent price stabilization, although a positive sign for its long-term prospects, has taken the shine off many mining equities. This leads to an intriguing investor conundrum: invest in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency or its miners? Bitcoin Halving: A Primer and its Market Resonance For those immersed in the Bitcoin world, ""Bitcoin halving"" is a seminal event. Having taken place thrice since 2009, this procedure critically impacts the quantity of new Bitcoins in the market. Unlike the whims of central banks that can fluidly change money supply, Bitcoin's inherent deflationary blueprint is unique. The halvings of 2012, 2016, and 2020 decreased miners' rewards consistently. As we inch closer to 2024, there are more and more murmurs about the impending halving on April 25th, where the mining reward will decline to 3.125 BTC per block. Though it sounds detrimental for miners on the surface, it's fundamental to Bitcoin's longevity and value. Draw a parallel to gold: mining it becomes tougher over time. Similarly, each Bitcoin halving event ensures the cryptocurrency's increased scarcity. Given its finite supply of 21 million coins, each halving inches us nearer to this ceiling. Historically, such events have often ushered in substantial bullish trends, but these runs can take some time to happen - which some miners may not have. This dynamic poses a dilemma for potential mining stock investors. Cryptocurrency mining corporations frequently hold substantial amounts of tokens, anticipating higher future prices. While halvings typically signal a bullish trend for Bitcoin, the reduced rewards necessitate miners to ramp up hash rates and, subsequently, energy consumption. Given the historic profitability challenges in the Bitcoin mining domain, the evolving landscape suggests that investors exercise prudence. Riot Platforms has commendably maintained consistent production figures despite disruptions. The real story here, however, is Riot's strategy of liquidating most of its monthly production. Metric September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 Bitcoin Produced 362 333 410 460 Average Bitcoin Produced per Day 12.1 10.8 13.2 15.3 Bitcoin Held 7,327 7,309 7,275 7,265 Bitcoin Sold 340 300 400 400 Bitcoin Sales - Net Proceeds $9.0 million $8.6 million $12.1 million $10.6 million Average Net Price per Bitcoin Sold $26,379 $28,617 $30,293 $26,456 Deployed Hash Rate 10.9 EH/s 10.7 EH/s 10.7 EH/s 10.7 EH/s Deployed Miners 98,694 95,904 95,904 95,904 Power Credits $11.0 million $24.1 million $6.4 million $8.4 million Demand Response Credits $2.5 million $7.5 million $1.8 million $1.7 million Author's estimates This move significantly bolsters their liquidity stance, a much-needed respite, especially recalling the liquidity issues that plagued the industry not too long ago, culminating in unfortunate episodes like Core Scientific's (CORZQ) bankruptcy. Data by YCharts Historically, mining entities opted for heavy dilutions to safeguard their Bitcoin reserves. With the recent industry-wide valuation crunch, there's been a discernible shift towards selling tokens as they're mined. Yet, Riot has impressively grown its treasury, with production consistently outpacing sales over the past quarter. Furthermore, their average net selling price for Bitcoin has remained robust at around $26,000, even though it pales in comparison to Bitcoin's peak of $67,000 in recent memory. Navigating Uncertainties: A Glimpse into Riot's Future A pressing concern for Riot and the industry at large is the unmistakable vacuum left by Bitcoin's stagnation. This standstill in Bitcoin prices has allowed the inherent challenges of crypto mining to surface, casting a cloud over the once-bright investment prospects of several mining companies. A cursory look at recent financial data reveals a series of concerning EPS misses for Riot, indicating that this trend may persist unless Bitcoin undergoes another significant rally. Seeking Alpha Predicting the next big surge in the crypto domain is akin to reading tea leaves. The trade has taken on a speculative hue, especially as murmurs of an impending recession grow louder, even amid seemingly buoyant unemployment figures. Data by YCharts It's essential to note that a recession could be particularly devastating for the crypto realm. In such scenarios, investors often liquidate non-essential assets, with cryptocurrencies likely being high on the chopping block. This is to reinforce liquidity in preparation for uncertain economic times. Furthermore, one must exercise caution before heralding a recession's end. Drawing parallels from the past, peak unemployment rates post the 2008-2009 recession didn't manifest until 2010, well after the Federal Reserve ceased its tightening measures. Absent a substantial upward movement, Riot might find itself leaning on external sources such as dilution or financing to bolster its coffers. The issue? In a recessive environment, tapping into these resources becomes increasingly challenging. That said, Riot's impressive cash balance, a testament to its steadfast leadership, shines as a silver lining. This financial buffer positions Riot favorably to weather economic storms. The crux, however, lies in discerning the valuation at which it emerges on the other side. The Takeaway While the broader crypto landscape has been tested by Bitcoin's price stagnation and intensifying challenges in the mining sector, Riot's operational strategy offers a promising blueprint. Their decision to regularly liquidate a substantial portion of their monthly production safeguards their liquidity, a crucial move given the industry's historical liquidity pitfalls. It shows that management is focused on survivability, which I agree with. The problem is that the solution for Riot's profitability challenges is completely out of the company's control. This gives a speculative feel that is often acceptable with crypto miners. There are potential tailwinds on the horizon, like the possible proliferation of Bitcoin ETFs, but there are also some notable challenges. I believe we will see some prolonged cooling down in the space for this reason, and will look forward to lower prices to rebuild my position.

42392322,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg589h,1697049090,Jim Cramer Doesn't Know Bitcoin,"“I can’t go out with bitcoin because I can’t be in something where Mr. Bitcoin is about to go down big.”  So said Jim Cramer today live on national TV.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The veteran blow-hard, former trader and CNBC host was talking about hedge investments at a time of inflation and economic turmoil. He told his audience that they would be better putting money into gold, the traditional safe-haven, rather than crypto. “The charts…suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin’s bouncing. And if you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she says you should stick with gold,” he said.  See also: Jim Cramer Expects Lower Bitcoin Price  Bitcoin is currently trading at about $26,000, down from about $28,000 five days ago, and well off its $68,000 peak during 2021’s bull market. But it’s up 68% this year and the first cryptocurrency is still dominating the market. Recent analysis from CoinDesk Indices shows bitcoin gaining this year (along with ether) as regulatory pressure puts a damper on altcoins.  Moreover, many observers think Bitcoin’s prospects have never been brighter. A flood of institutional bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) applications, from BlackRock and others, could bring in trillions of dollars into the market, creating an easier and more familiar way for everyday investors to get into the space. Commentators see approved ETFs having a similar impact on bitcoin as the investment vehicle had on the gold prices when those ETFs became available in 2004.  But maybe Cramer knows something that most Bitcoin watchers don’t? Perhaps. Although it could be that Cramer is just over crypto in general. He told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that he sold his BTC in 2021, as China cracked down on mining.  The SBF trial, currently happening in Manhattan, is sapping crypto’s already battered reputation in the public mind and there are so many other ways for investors to participate in speculation these days beyond traditional stock picking.  Other prominent risk investors are more bullish on bitcoin. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC this week that geopolitical tensions and government debt levels make stocks unattractive at the moment, but gold and bitcoin are attractive options.  See also: Kevin O'Leary's Crypto Investing Playbook | Opinion  The stone-clad case for bitcoin is that it continues to show resilience as an asset, a community of HODLers and developers, and as technology. The blocks keep coming, despite a million forecasts of its demise over the last decade and a bit since it was created.  In doom-y times, bitcoin surely becomes more attractive. And a continued regulatory clampdown on crypto could be good for BTC. After all, it’s the only coin that Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler says is not a security, and therefore covered by traditional securities law.  Dear reader, you will have to decide for yourself. This is not investment advice. But here’s one option: you could do the exact opposite of what Cramer says. An ETF designed to follow Cramer’s stock picks closed in August after little interest (and losing investors money).

Recent developments, such as the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) hint at pausing rate hikes and speculations around the approval of more futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., are suspected to be the catalysts steering crypto whale interests, according to Marti, a recognized voice from the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel. Notably, Macroeconomic events have always played a critical role in shaping the dynamics of the financial markets. Cryptocurrencies, while unique in their operations, are no exception to this influence. Related Reading: MakerDAO Secures $6 Billion For Treasury Bill Investments As MKR Dominates 2023 LINK: Chainlink’s Surge Attracts Big Crypto Players Chainlink’s native coin, LINK, is turning heads and emerging as a prime focus for these heavyweight investors. Marti identifies LINK as one of September’s top performers among leading cryptocurrencies, registering roughly 30% growth. Marti says this gain can be attributed to several developments, including Chainlink’s tokenization collaboration with SWIFT, the international payment rail, and a growing interest in the real-world assets sector. Whale activities around LINK have also been quite noteworthy. On-chain data by IntoTheBlock reveals a jump from 30 whale transactions on September 17 to 218 by October 2. A notable transaction involved a purchase of 424,443 LINK tokens, a transaction value of about $3.25 million. This whale spent $3.25M to buy 424,443 $LINK again at a price of $7.67 an hour ago. Which caused the price of $LINK to increase again.https://t.co/pRCcK2tQAa pic.twitter.com/VHe2CTrBTi — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 8, 2023 Diving Deeper: The Rise Of MKR And BCH Maker (MKR), another altcoin, has experienced a significant uptick in large-scale transactions, coinciding with the Fed’s rate halt announcement in September. Marti sheds light on the surge in whale activities around MKR, highlighting that significant transactions leaped from nine on September 19 to a 6-month high of 102 by October 2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a staple in the crypto realm, hasn’t been left out of the whale frenzy either. Marti parallels BCH’s current scenario and its June 2023 bull rally, which propelled BCH to a yearly zenith of $329. Recent on-chain data underscores this enthusiasm, showing whales’ noticeable accumulation in BCH holdings. From September 21 to October 4, there was a notable increment in their total balances, suggesting an acquisition of an additional 150,000 BCH. Furthermore, while LINK, MKR, and BCH have seen positive price trends over the past month—mirroring the whale accumulation metrics—each has also faced its share of downturns. Related Reading: 81 Binance Wallets Withdraw $31 Million In LINK, What This Mean For The Altcoin Notably, LINK and MKR emerged as the top performers among the trio, registering monthly gains of 24.8% and 27.3%, respectively. In comparison, BCH posted a modest rise of 16.2%. Yet, it’s worth noting that over the past week, all three altcoins have experienced declines: LINK decreased by 4.4%, MKR by 2.2%, and BCH by 6.2%.

Tokenization is the term for placing traditional financial assets such as private equity, credit and bonds – often referred to as RWAs – on blockchains. The process is touted as a way to reduce cost and operational friction and improve accessibility and transparency.  Global banks as well as crypto platforms are already taking steps to harness tokenization. JPMorgan earlier today, for example, said it carried out its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction involving BlackRock and Barclays.  There are still many hurdles before RWA’s can reach their full potential, said Zimmerman in his report. Still, the “narrative will be compelling” enough to potentially kickstart “an isolated RWA crypto bubble before there is widespread substantial impact from RWA on the real world.”  Zimmerman explained that Chainlink positioned itself as a key piece of infrastructure to connect blockchains with the outside world via its system of oracles and wide range of partnerships. “It will certainly not be the biggest gainer, but few projects are better positioned to benefit from the narrative,” he added.  Zimmerman advised investors to wait for lower prices to go long, pointing to the long-term support level at around $5.70 to take long positions.

The platform said it had ""reached an agreement with the individual responsible for the recent security breach"" and paid a 10% bounty fee plus 1000 AVAX ($9,333).  Earlier, an on-chain message signed by the smart contract address that attacked the Avalanche-based social app Stars Arena suggested that the entity behind the exploit wants to cooperate.  Last week, the up-and-coming social platform Stars Arena was hacked, resulting in a loss of $3 million in AVAX tokens, despite prior warnings from users about potential security vulnerabilities.  Before the hack, Stars Arena was a darling of the Avalanche protocol, pushing up the AVAX token. Market data shows that the token is down 3% in the last week.  Signing transactions is a way pseudonymous hackers make their mark after an attack.  After Poly Network was hacked in 2021, the attacker teased the community via signed messages and threatened to delay the return of funds. Meanwhile, virtual beggars used the same tactic to panhandle for donations from the attacker.  In March, the individual responsible for Euler Finance's $200 million exploit returned over $120 million to the protocol and issued an apology via signed messages on different blockchain transactions, identifying as “Jacob.”  In 2020, Bitcoin addresses that Craig Wright claims to own were used to sign a public message labeling him a “fraud"" and refuting his ownership of them.

The bank favors mining operators that offer the best relative value in light of their “existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive  JPMorgan initiates coverage of CleanSpark (CLSK) with an overweight rating and a price target of $5.50; Marathon Digital (MARA) at underweight with a $5 target; Riot Platforms (RIOT) at underweight with a $6.50 target, and Cipher Mining (CIFR) at neutral. The bank also upgraded Iris Energy (IREN) to overweight from neutral.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on whether or not to approve a spot bitcoin ETF until this month. The crypto market is hopeful that any approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector.  CleanSpark is the bank’s top pick, offering the best balance of “scale, growth potential, power costs and relative value.”  The analysts said that Marathon is the largest mining operator but has the highest energy costs and lowest margins. Meanwhile, Riot has relatively low power costs and liquidity but is the most expensive stock in their coverage universe.  Among the peers, Cipher Mining has the lowest power costs but is “growth constrained,” the report noted.  The bank estimates the four-year block reward opportunity at around $20 billion at current bitcoin prices. However, the looming block reward halving, expected in the second quarter of 2024, could impact profitability.

18661053,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554978,1697041858,"Bitcoin Could See A 50% Rise Based On This, Analyst Explains","An analyst has explained that a pattern in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) could suggest a potential 50% rise for BTC may be ahead. Bitcoin & GBTC Have Seen A Decoupling In Recent Months In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has discussed the correlation between GBTC and BTC that has been present over the years. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an investment vehicle that holds Bitcoin and allows exposure to these holdings through its shares. The chart below shows the trend in the percentage performance of Bitcoin and GBTC, as well as the correlation coefficient between them, over the past year. Looks like the two assets have diverged recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The “correlation coefficient” here refers to a metric that tells us how tied the prices of any two assets are. When this metric has a positive value, the given commodities show positive correlations as they replicate each other’s moves. The closer the metric is to 1, the stronger this relationship is. On the other hand, negative values imply the assets are responding to each other’s moves by moving in the opposite direction. The strongest negative correlation occurs at a value of -1. Related Reading: Ethereum Could See A Steep Decline If It Closes Below This Level Naturally, when the correlation coefficient is around zero, there isn’t any correlation between the commodities, as their prices move independently. From the above graph, it’s apparent that Bitcoin and GBTC have often had a correlation coefficient close to 1, implying that there has been a robust positive correlation between the two. There have been some temporary periods of deviation, mainly during drawdowns in the cryptocurrency’s price and other significant events like the SVB collapse. The correlation reverted to the norm soon after these, however. Straten says this correlation is especially striking in a 5-year timeframe, where it becomes 100%. The analyst also notes, however, that the two assets have decoupled since June. As is visible in the chart, GBTC has enjoyed some sharp uptrend recently, while BTC has been mostly flat. GBTC’s performance currently stands at +81% during the past year, while Bitcoin is up about 43%. “GBTC will be the first to be approved for the spot ETF before Blackrock and others,” says Straten, referring to what British HODL, another analyst, said earlier. “Price action agrees with this. Irrespective of whether it’s late Q3 or early Q4, it’s a six-month window from now.” Related Reading: Is Ethereum Doomed? Whales Have Sold 12M ETH In Past Year Based on this, the analyst believes that either Bitcoin will have to close up the gap created between it and GBTC since June, which would mean a price jump of around 50%, or GBTC would have to come down towards BTC. Straten believes the latter scenario to be unlikely, however. BTC Price Bitcoin has declined over the past few days as its price has dropped to just $27,100.

42409586,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLC5b,1697040305,The Tech Guru Behind Worldcoin: a Q&A With Tiago Sada,"Worldcoin, the crypto project created by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, has garnered a lot of media attention for its use of ""proof-of-personhood"" and for using its Stanley Kubrick-esque orbs to scan user’s irises.  The user authentication system has prompted many blockchain experts to voice concerns over how it protects privacy of those who choose to use the blockchain.  Tiago Sada, head of product, engineering and design at Tools for Humanity, which is developing Worldcoin, said he initially was skeptical to join the crypto space, and still believes that many of the projects in the industry are scams.  But what sold him on blockchain was Ethereum: ""You were able to digitalize things that you could not digitalize before,"" he told CoinDesk. He’s now on a mission to spread the gospel of the importance of identity and decentralization with proof-of-personhood.  We spoke to Sada a few weeks ago, and asked him questions about Worldcoin and other blockchain topics. Some highlights include:  Sada’s personal story for how he got into blockchain and crypto  Sada’s take on Vitalik Buterin’s criticism of proof-of-personhood  The connection between AI and Worldcoin  Q: Did you have much blockchain experience when you were recruited for this job?  A: ​​So I actually hated crypto when I was building my startup. I thought it was just all a scam, to be honest. And part of my job as a fintech founder, I had to be very good at explaining why it made sense to build the fintech rather than on the crypto route. But after we sold that, and I took a year off just to explore, live in the desert, and a bunch of other stuff, I had a chance to really think about where the future was going and just give crypto another chance.  And to be honest with you, I still think 80% of crypto is not really going to pan out. But there's 20% of it that I think is incredibly profound and incredibly important.  In particular, for me, Ethereum was what really clicked. Just the way you were able to digitize things that you could not digitize before.  And the composability, having gone the route of building a product in the old legacy world, and now just getting to build things in a weekend that you couldn't do before; it's really really crazy.  So that was before I joined the project. I started playing quite a bit in the crypto space, building a couple of interesting projects.  Q: I thought it was interesting how you mentioned you were coming at this from the direction of thinking crypto is a scam, I think you're probably in good company in the Y Combinator world.  And I just wondered first, broadly, whether in the tech community that you are a part of, have you found sentiment toward crypto broadly becoming more positive or less positive In the past six months?  A: I think they've definitely gotten much better in the last six months.  Last year FTX was definitely a low point for the ecosystem. The bull cycle before that was definitely really good for just getting a ton of talent into the space. And I think that what you've seen in the year since FTX is, a lot of the noise has gone away.  The people that didn't believe in this space, they have just gone to explore something else. And so the people that are sticking it out, that are still working on things, are the people that tend to be working on the most interesting stuff because they're in it for the right reasons.  Q: You also mentioned how you're kind of skeptical, broadly from a use case perspective. You said that around 80% of these things are probably going to disappear and I don't think you'll find many people, even in crypto disagreeing with you.  But you're building a platform that is going to be incumbent on there being use cases in the future. And Ethereum, you mentioned, that's also a platform, but it's not itself a use case. So I wonder without being too prescriptive, and just spinning up dapps and programs yourself, what kinds of use cases do you expect to really see take off on Worldcoin or using WorldID as an authentication method?  A: Yeah, I would actually push back on that. Worldcoin and WorldID are built on top of blockchains, and specifically uses Ethereum because that is the best way to build that is the best tech, technological primitive – if you want to build something like this that is decentralized, if you want to build in a way in which you can be a public good, if you want to build it in a way in which it's like fully privacy-preserving.  Most of the integrations actually of World ID, they're just Web2 companies, the same with our users.  We've done one thing where we take a bit of a different approach, is we don't think you should have to understand what a 12-word seed phrase is and what all of these complex primitives are. We think they're super important, and we leverage a lot of those for WorldApp and for World ID, but most of our developers and our users are not crypto developers are not crypto users. They're just people. They're just using an app because they want to send money, or you're signing into a website.  For example, one of our most popular integrations is with Discord. People are just using the World App to sign into Discord. And yes behind the scenes we’re settling with zero knowledge proofs on-chain and that's very, very important, but users and developers don't really get to know that.  So I don't think we are betting on crypto or DeFi as a space replacing or upgrading the current world. But we're really betting on just the need for proof of personhood and identity in the world. Whether that is on mobile apps, whether it is on the Web2, or of course, smart contracts and Web3 applications.  Q: You brought up proof of personhood, and I read Vitalik Buterin’s comments on his concerns over proof of personhood. I wanted to hear your take on his concerns.  A: I think Vitalik’s take is great. We got a chance to discuss a lot with him before he posted that.  I was very surprised that some people took it as feedback on Worldcoin. I would say it's basically by validating most of the hypotheses: and when he says, ‘It should work for decentralization on the project,’ that's something that is being actively worked on. I don't think you will meet anyone that would disagree with that.  I send Vitalik’s blog to people all the time. I think he does a really good job explaining why this is such an important problem, and why there's not too many options other than an approach, basically like what Worldcoin is. It's also not a perfect approach, It has some trade-offs, and he does a good job of laying those out.  We're working with a bunch of people in the community to help solve or mitigate those.  Q: What is the connection between AI and proof-of-personhood?  A: AI is an incredible new tool for humanity. It's like inventing fire.  But inventing fire requires you to have new tools to be able to handle that fire.  Proof of personhood is something that is already important on the internet today. Right? That's why we've had things like captchas. That's why we have things like KYC and all these different things. But the problem becomes both much more important, and much more difficult.  All those existing solutions, they stop working in the day where we need them the most. And I think that from Sam's perspective, he knew he just could see that someone was going to crack this.  And so it was just very important that a system like Worldcoin was built in a way that is decentralized, in a way that is privacy preserving.  If you talk to most people, it’s not even a question of whether a system like this will exist or not. The only question is whether it will be decentralized, whether it'll be open source, whether it'll be privacy-preserving.  Q: I'm sure it was frustrating to see how you all were painted after your launch. I know you guys have taken a lot of pains with the privacy-preserving encryption steps to kind of differentiate what you're actually building from the way that you're being depicted as these people just stealing eyeballs.  Where do you think that that misunderstanding comes from and do you have a game plan to actually explain to people, ‘We don't actually do anything with this data’?  A: I think there's a difference between some very loud Twitter users and just the reality on the ground. One of the first things that we had to test obviously back when the project started was are people excited, or concerned, or skeptical about this? How do they feel about the orb?  And part of the reason why we went to so many places in the early phases was just understanding and hearing people.  It turns out that the average person understands this very well, they're used to biometrics being used in not a privacy-preserving way. Most of these people have face ID on their phones. They use some sort of biometric to authenticate when they get to work, they go through immigration like anyone that gets a visa is used to just giving away all of our biometrics.  So when you hear about a system that does this in a private way, and is much less intrusive, people are usually quite excited about signing up.  So I would just say that the attitude can be very different. And at the same time, I think it's super healthy for them to be skeptical. I think that we are doing something that is definitely and very important for the world and people's privacy.  We've been burned for the past 10 years by big companies doing not so good things for our privacy, so I think people should be skeptical.  Part of why that project has worked and part of why you sometimes see a hater on Twitter and then six months later, they're talking about how great Worldcoin is, it’s because when people understand what is actually happening, they're usually very excited about what the system is.  It's very unintuitive, because they're amongst the most private systems at this scale that have ever been built. And so it takes time with any type of new technology.  Right now we are, frankly, just catching up to meet the demands of early adopters. And so we'll worry a lot more about like later adopters by the time we can get to them.

42409591,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLCM8,1697039100,The Blockchain-Based Solution Poised to Improve Our Financial Lives,"While advances in blockchain technology and tokenization often grab the headlines, there is a more mundane concept that nevertheless may end up being the single most important piece of future financial industry (and commercial) infrastructure – the digital wallet.  A cryptographically protected, blockchain-based digital wallet is a piece of software that points to an address on the internet where tokenized assets can be stored. There is no identifying information on these wallets other than a long string of letters and numbers. The wallet itself contains a digital key that is required to unlock and access the holdings in the user’s wallet, and such keys are only shared when a wallet owner authorizes a transaction.  Today, individuals, many small and medium enterprises as well as institutions operate across a fragmented set of financial accounts that each require separate types of paper-based documentation (often stored in electronic form). For individuals, this includes checking and savings accounts that deal with the entity’s cash; brokerage and investment accounts that deal with retirement, education, healthcare and more; liability accounts that deal with mortgages, loans, lines of credit or credit cards; and a significant number of accounts that relate to the individual’s assets, valuables and collectibles including special documents such as titles, contracts and insurance policies.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Navigating this plethora of accounts is rarely enjoyable or easy. Within each of these account categories, a single entity may have multiple service providers or multiple accounts within a service provider. Account owners must remember their usernames and passwords, authorize their devices and oftentimes manually input account numbers and balances to create aggregated views of their holdings across institutions.  Tokenization of the assets in these different types of accounts would allow multiple types of instruments to sit side-by-side in a digital wallet and enable every user to see the entirety of their wealth in one location. Cash could become spread across a set of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Investments could be comprised of tokenized securities, funds and assets. Liabilities could be represented as tokenized obligations, and assets, valuables and collectibles represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with contractual documents such as the title or insurance policy embedded within the token itself.  Every asset could be custodied for safe-keeping and the cryptographic keys to lock and unlock the wallet either held individually or protected by qualified providers that offer to guarantee and manage the security of the wallet infrastructure. Moreover, an entity’s digital identity could be tied to this wallet and used interchangeably across all service providers and use cases, removing the need for individual know-your-customer compliance and creating an ease of use that is simply not possible today.  Efforts to achieve this vision are already underway. A part of the European Digital Transformation agenda is the creation of a digital identity and wallet system that can be used across the eurozone. Pilots of the European Union Digital Identity Wallet commenced in April. Over 250 private companies and public authorities across Europe are expected to participate. Use cases include financial scenarios but also cover much broader ground such as filing taxes, presenting a driver’s license and showing visas and travel documents.  In the not-so-distant future, a digital wallet may very well sit at the center of every investor’s life.  Disclaimer:  All investments involve risk, including the loss of principal.

42409577,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLBll,1697039100,Stablecoins: Roman Coins or Spanish Doubloons for the Modern Era,"It is easy to see digital assets as something completely new. However, they represent a return to a longer-term historical trend of money being far more international than it is today. Stablecoins and digital assets are a means of unshackling money from inherently national payment systems and placing it on the open internet.  To illustrate the point, we can look back to the 1950s when a hoard of Roman denarius coins, buried by a soldier in 43 A.D., was discovered in Kent, England. What was surprising was that it contained coins from the Roman Republic. This meant that the Roman soldier was being paid in silver coins that were potentially up to 250 years old. The modern equivalent is to pay a U.S. Marine today with Spanish doubloons.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Modern money has a much shorter lifespan and is far less international compared with Roman times. This longevity and mobility meant that the world was divided into much larger currency blocs. In 1800, the Spanish doubloon, also known as the silver dollar, was used across Latin America, the Caribbean, China and large parts of Southeast Asia. The Indian rupee dominated large parts of Arabia and Africa, while the Ottoman lira was used across the Balkans and the Middle East.  By 1900, colonialism had seen the adoption of currencies, or at least local derivations, of the British pound, French franc and others. Latin American independence movements had led to the creation of new nation-states and, with them, their own currencies, thus breaking down these large currency blocs.  After World War II, there was another surge in the number of independent nations with their own currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah and the Pakistani rupee. By 2000, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia led to the addition of currencies such as the Serbian dinar and the Armenian dram, resulting in a global total of over 150 currencies. Since then, the trend has started to go into reverse with the euro as well as the dollarisation of countries such as Ecuador.  Read more: What Fat Tails and Revolutionary Ages Mean for Digital Assets  The arrival of digital assets, which allows money to be placed on the open internet, means that the borders that once separated currency areas are breaking down. Stablecoins are one of the first movers in this evolution. They are, unlike fiat currency or many central bank digital currencies, borderless by design. They can be sent as easily and cheaply as sending a text message or an email and can be held by a recipient in a digital wallet. They are currently issued by private companies, but a limited group of nations may have an opportunity to support the international or regional adoption of their currencies by making them available as stablecoins.  Stablecoins may lead to a return of the historical norm of the world existing in much larger currency blocs, which in turn would make cross-border commerce much cheaper and easier.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Nick Philpott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/11/stablecoins-roman-coins-or-spanish-doubloons-for-the-modern-era,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/116eaf7590bf7059a6e6c4dff8c0b7a2e56c8bbf-640x315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s unclear if “Mr. Bitcoin” was in reference to the ongoing trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, or to bitcoin in general, but Cramer’s bearishness was evident.  Although bitcoin is far off its all-time high of $68,000 reached in 2021’s bull market, the cryptocurrency is still trading up 68% since the start of the year.  Cramer had previously stated in June 2021 that he had sold most of his bitcoin holdings following China’s crackdown on crypto miners. He also said during the same time period that bitcoin had structural issues and its price would likely fall further.

42409573,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLBYX,1697036909,Bitcoin Might Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under ‘BitVM’ Plan,"A research paper published this week outlined a new paradigm to bring Ethereum-style smart contracts to the Bitcoin network.  BitVM, as it is known, was laid out in an Oct. 9 whitepaper by Robin Linus, a core contributor to ZeroSync, which is building tools for developers to use zero-knowledge proofs on Bitcoin.  The goal of BitVM is to enable Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without making the network more complicated for other users. Turing completeness is a computing term for a system that can compute any possible calculation or program.  Under BitVM, computations would be performed off-chain and then verified on-chain, similar to the mechanics of optimistic rollups on Ethereum.  In theory, there should be no limits on the complexity of the computations as they are carried out off-chain, so there is no risk of clogging up the network at the expense of other users.  ""This enables more expressive smart contracts on Bitcoin,"" Linus wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""Particularly, it enables functionality that we thought we'd need a soft fork for.""  The protocol involves two parties: a ""prover"" and a ""verifier"". The prover makes a claim of a specific function producing a particular output when given certain inputs. They pre-sign a sequence of transaction, enabling a challenge-response game between the two of them.  They then make on-chain deposits to a Bitcoin address, activating the contract and they start to exchange off-chain data, with the verifier able to take the prover's deposit if any incorrect claim is made. This should mean that attackers always lose their deposits, Linus wrote.  BitVM's limitations  Linus' proposal triggered a slew of responses on X, with commentators quick to point out BitVM's limitations.  Pseudonymous bitcoin writer Shinobi pointed out that the cost of off-chain data management is ""massive,"" adding that the protocol only involving two parties - the prover and the verifier - is also a ""big limitation.""  Bob Bodily, CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq, wrote in a post on X that BitVM is ""like a very early limited version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).""  ""BitVM is an amazing breakthrough because while there are many gaping holes right now in the BitVM, they are mostly solvable,"" he said. ""Over the next few months I expect many of these holes to get filled in, at which point we will have more capable Bitcoin script without a Bitcoin upgrade.""  Bitcoin Smart Contracts  Attempts to implement smart contract capabilities in the Bitcoin network are of course not new. For some time, Bitcoin developers have been attempting to find ways round the network's limitations due to its simpler scripting language compared to blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.  In December last year, blockchain project Stacks published a whitepaper presenting its digital assets ""Stacks bitcoin"" (sBTC), pitched as a way of bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin.

However, his analysis doesn’t provide any relief to XRP holders as he projects a further decline for the token and its ecosystem. How XRP Price Is Looking On The Charts In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Dixon shared a price chart of XRP dating back to July, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of his analysis, he noted that XRP aligned with the BTC outlook. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies 6 Overlooked Altcoins That Could Be Due For A Price Surge Source: X (formerly Twitter) Looking at the chart, he highlighted the bearish divergence, which indicated that the 5th wave was expected to cause a decline in the XRP price. However, before then, he projected that there is a likelihood of the token experiencing an upward trend to complete wave 4. While Dixon’s analysis suggests a bearish outlook, he quickly noted that nothing was certain in technical analysis, although there is a high probability of this happening. The Elliot Wave Theory, which he used to come to this conclusion, is a popular technical analysis indicator used to predict future price trends. The theory propounds that markets like XRP follow predictable sequences of optimism and pessimism driven by investor sentiment and psychology. Simply put, it agrees with the trend that there will always be a correction or retracement after a particular trend (upward or downward). XRP sitting at $0.48 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Time To Lower Expectations Many crypto analysts have made far-fetched predictions of the XRP price, with one, in particular, stating that the token could rise as high as $10,000. However, a crypto influencer (Crypto Assets Guy) advised those in the XRP community to lower their expectations as the token won’t hit “$10,000, $1,000, $50” or even $10 any time soon. Related Reading: XRP Price Gearing Up For Rebound As Whales Make Their Move He took a more conservative stance by stating that the token could hit a new all-time high late this year or in 2024, suggesting it could add around $3.70 to its current all-time high of $3.84. He believes the XRP community should be more than satisfied if that happens. Meanwhile, many in the XRP community seem tired of these price predictions. This was evident when some expressed frustration after XRP influencer Jack The Rippler posted the headline of an article (dated July 31, 2023), which stated that a Wells Fargo staff had predicted the XRP price to hit $100 to $500 in the next 2 to 7 months.

In my view, the allocation methodology is superior to Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, with more assets and a better diversified weighting. However, there are risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, and the fund trades at a larger discount to NAV than Grayscale's fund. The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) is a diversified digital asset fund managed by Bitwise Investments. The fund aims to provide investors with exposure to 10 different cryptocurrencies in one fund. It's a competing product to Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. In this article, we'll get into how Bitwise's fund is different from Grayscale's large cap crypto fund and we'll assess if it's a fund that investors who want simple and easy exposure to a bucket of digital assets should consider. What Is In The Fund? BITW aims to track the top assets in the crypto market. The fund is rebalanced monthly and I view it as sort of a blended fund that skews to passive over a more active strategy. You're not going to find smaller cap coins in BITW that could help the fund beat the larger cap coins but there is some element of discernment regarding which coins go in and which coins come out. In the table below, I've added a column called cap dominance that takes the total market cap of the 10 coins included in BITW and then divides the individual coin market cap by the sum of the ten coins. This is to show how closely the weight of each asset correlates to the total market cap dominance of the asset. Bitwise's weighting is done well if you're looking for an allocation that is true to market: COIN NAME WEIGHT MARKET CAP CAP DOMINANCE Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) 67.60% $538,446,277,993 67.63% Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) 23.90% $190,179,205,866 23.89% XRP ( XRP-USD ) 3.40% $26,697,163,470 3.35% Solana ( SOL-USD ) 1.20% $9,164,118,961 1.15% Cardano ( ADA-USD ) 1.10% $8,852,372,262 1.11% Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) 0.60% $4,935,590,819 0.62% Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) 0.60% $4,930,072,906 0.62% Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) 0.60% $4,648,607,757 0.58% Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) 0.50% $4,260,520,222 0.54% ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) 0.50% $4,064,447,940 0.51% Source: Bitwise, as of 10/10/23 If you're looking for a fund that will go a bit more out on a limb regarding weightings, BITW may not be it. However, one thing I actually like about the Bitwise fund is there does appear to be some discretion on asset choice. It would be easy for Bitwise to take the top 10 coins ranked by market cap and put them in the fund - however, that's not what is happening here. Even though the 10 coins in the fund are all among the top 20 coins by market cap, Bitwise opted to not include stablecoins or some of the more dubious meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ). Additionally, Binance Coin ( BNB-USD ), Toncoin ( TON-USD ) and Tron ( TRX-USD ) are also excluded from the fund despite each having total market cap ranks near or in the top 10. I happen to completely agree with those exclusions personally and the decision to not include those assets likely comes from the rules-based methodology that Bitwise uses for fund allocations. Among a handful of other eligibility rules, coins in the fund can't have known security issues like bugs or 51% attack vulnerability, they must not be in violation of US securities law, and must not have withdrawal issues that are specific to that crypto asset. There is an element of subjectivity to these rules and they're at the discretion of Bitwise Crypto Index Committee. But again, in my personal view I think the committee largely has it right on which coins are in and which ones aren't. Fund Details & GDLC Comparison As of article submission, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index fund has over $450 million in assets under management. This actually makes it twice the size of Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund. GDLC BITW AUM $245m $451m Shares outstanding 15,867,400 20,241,947 Share Price $8.53 $11.33 NAV 15.46 $22.42 Discount/Premium -44.8% -49.5% Expense Ratio 2.5% 2.5% Assets in Fund 5 10 BTC & ETH Share of Fund 96.8% 91.5% Sources: Grayscale, Bitwise In my view, Bitwise's asset allocation methodology is superior to Grayscale's. I take that view because of Bitwise's inclusion of 5 additional crypto assets and because of the fund's greater allocation to alt-coins. I've not made my issues with Grayscale's GDLC methodology a secret and have actually called the shares a buy entirely because the fund's methodology is so bad. Something else to consider is the discount to net asset value of the Bitwise shares relative to Grayscale's discount. At 49.5%, BITW also trades at a larger discount to NAV than GDLC currently does. All this said, none of this means longing BITW shares doesn't come without considerable risk. Risks First and foremost, the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky. While I personally believe many of these digital assets will actually stand the test of time, the overwhelming majority of them are likely completely worthless. Depending on where each individual investor is in their retirement journey, I'd caution getting overly exposed to cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin. Another risk to consider is BITW shares aren't redeemable. In my view, this is largely why the fund trades at such a massive discount to NAV. Finally, the underlying assets are under custody with Coinbase ( COIN ) and are not actively staked for yield. This is potentially problematic when it comes to assets like SOL and DOT as they have annual inflation rates of over 7%. Additionally, there is an opportunity cost in not staking the ETH held in the fund as well due to the 3.6% staking yield. Investor Takeaways I think the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index fund is probably the better fund of the two when compared with Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund purely on the investment merits. Bitwise has more assets and a better diversified weighting among those assets than GDLC. Bitwise also happens to trade at a larger discount to NAV than GDLC and has the same 2.5% management fee. In my view, the Bitwise committee has done a nice job curating the asset list. I don't take any real issue with the assets in the fund and actually hold 6 of the 10 personally. However, I do think there's an opportunity cost with a fund like this. For a 2.5% management fee, I don't think staking the more inflationary assets in the fund is a large ask. For investors who want a very simple way to get exposure to a variety of cryptocurrencies in something like a self-directed IRA, I think BITW is fine and is probably the better pick versus GDLC. But it's important to mention that crypto IRAs exist. Many of these products offer self-direction by the individual asset in a tax-advantaged account. For investors who have a better handle on crypto and aren't opposed to opening a new account, those kinds of products may be a better fit. At this point, I don't personally hold BITW or plan to hold it. I also take the view that GDLC is probably the better arbitrage play because it is so heavily allocated to Bitcoin and Ethereum rather than altcoins. But that's really more of an opportunistic trade than it is a commentary on GDLC as an investment vehicle. But again, for those looking for a really simple way to get exposed to crypto in a diversified manner, BITW probably does the job the best in the public markets.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH | SHIB,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4640179-bitw-simpler-approach-to-crypto-diversification?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18656387.jpeg

18655170,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554940,1697032841,Ethereum Could See A Steep Decline If It Closes Below This Level,"On-chain data suggests an Ethereum close under the $1,530 level could lead to a significant drawdown for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum Support Levels Below $1,530 Are Very Thin Currently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed what the support and resistance levels of Ethereum are looking like right now. These support and resistance levels aren’t the technical ones, however, but rather ones based on on-chain analysis. The support and resistance levels here are defined based on the density of investors’ cost bases. The “cost basis” here refers to the average price at which an investor acquires their coins on the blockchain. Whenever the spot price interacts with a holder’s cost basis, they may be more prone to make a move. How the investor may react depends on the surrounding price trend. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Doomed? Whales Have Sold 12M ETH In Past Year If the Bitcoin price was earlier under the cost basis of the holder (meaning that they were in a state of loss), the asset recovering back to it could tempt the investor into selling, as they may fear that their coins would go into losses again, so exiting at break-even would seem like the better option. On the other hand, if the price retests the cost basis from above, the investor may decide to accumulate more, thinking that if they were able to go into profits with an earlier buy at the same level, they might be able to do so once more. Naturally, not all investors think like this, but if there are price ranges where a large amount of coins were purchased, behaviors like this might become visible on non-negligible scales. The below chart shows how the various Ethereum price ranges look like right now based on the density of cost bases that they host: The various ETH resistance and support levels according to on-chain data | Source: @ali_charts on X In the above graph, the larger the circle for a price range, the more Ethereum addresses’ cost bases lie inside it. As mentioned before, levels that are particularly dense are more likely to show reactions to retests from the spot price. This means that large circles above the price can act as resistance, while those below can provide support. From the chart, it’s visible that the current Ethereum price range has only modest on-chain support, while the higher levels are pretty dense with cost bases, so a move up would face a potentially large amount of resistance. Related Reading: Tether Continues To Flow Into Exchanges: Why This Is Bullish For Bitcoin What’s worse, however, is the fact that the levels below the current range are quite thin, implying that there isn’t much support down there. “Keep a close watch, as a daily close below $1,530 could signal a steep correction ahead for ETH,” warns the analyst.

The company is expanding beyond its bitcoin-only strategy, too, and will let customers trade Ethereum’s ether (ETH).  Gibraltar-based digital asset bank Xapo has gotten a securities broker license, meaning it will be able to offer customers in Europe the ability to trade S&P 500 stocks like Apple alongside the company’s crypto wealth management offering.  Xapo’s recently granted Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license adds another plank to the firm’s vision, which is much more about straightforward, long-term investing versus the sort of speculative trading strategies crypto is famous for, Xapo CEO Seamus Rocca said in an interview.  “Our target customer is not your stereotypical 25-year-old Gen Z, who wants to trade crypto,” Rocca said. “It’s a slightly older demographic who bought bitcoin a few years ago to hold and to be like a pension pot, or perhaps to buy a property when the price is right. They want a diversified portfolio perhaps with some stocks, a savings account that earns interest, as well as a bitcoin allocation.”  Starting out with a wallet, a cold-storage custody vault and a reserve of 30,000 bitcoin [BTC] back in 2013, Xapo later set up in Gibraltar under its virtual asset service provider (VASP) framework. Since beginning the process in 2019, Xapo has been granted a banking license, obtained principal membership with Visa and Mastercard as well as membership in SWIFT (the global system through which banks send money to each other). This means the firm can engage directly with correspondent banks, not via payment companies or third parties, and have access to money market accounts.  Europe is seeing growing interest from banks, driven to some degree by the Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, regime. But Xapo turned away from institutional crypto adoption when it sold its enterprise custody business to Coinbase back in 2017, preferring to stick to retail and bitcoin’s ethos of financial freedom.  “Banks are adopting crypto, but only for institutional services. Not for people like you and me. That’s where I think we were breaking the mold. We could see the need to build a bank that bridges crypto with day-to-day use cases because traditional banks weren’t going to do it,” Rocca said.  Xapo is used to going against the grain. After last year’s crypto collapses and things like FTX, “everyman and his dog” now wants to use non-custodial wallets. “I think that’s a bad idea, Rocca said. “People don’t keep cash in a suitcase with a four-digit PIN under their bed. Why would you do that with your bitcoin? You can keep it on a laptop or a pendrive, but it’s risky. And when you want to transact with it, you have to cross the bridge to traditional financial services.”  Rocca also revealed Xapo will soon be breaking the mold in another way: namely the firm’s long-standing strategy of only offering a single cryptocurrency: bitcoin.  “We’ve always been bitcoin-only, but so many people have asked us about Ethereum that we’re adding Ethereum to the portfolio,” Rocca said. “So you’ll be able to store Ethereum and buy and sell it at Xapo, probably in about a month.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/11/crypto-bank-xapo-snags-european-broker-license-will-offer-stocks-like-apple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2896cd61890ca7a3663b5361200ea231803be89-555x312.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409587,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLCFW,1697031746,"Chinese Bribes, Thai Prostitutes and an End to the Lies: Caroline Ellison’s Explosive Second Day of Testimony Against Sam Bankman-Fried","Caroline Ellison, one of Sam Bankman-Fried’s top deputies and also his ex-girlfriend, testified Wednesday that she felt relieved when his crypto empire started to collapse because it meant she could stop lying.  She noted the CoinDesk scoop that undid the company, saying the crypto news site’s scoop was based on a balance sheet Alameda sent to lenders to mislead them into thinking the trading firm was on more solid financial footing than it really was – though the numbers were ugly enough to spark the collapse.  Ellison said Bankman-Fried instructed her to use FTX customer funds to repay Alameda’s lenders despite recognizing the risk.  She disclosed an unrelated bribery incident with Chinese officials to retrieve locked funds, highlighting the trust Bankman-Fried had in her.  NEW YORK — Caroline Ellison wept on the witness stand near the end of her second day testifying against her former boss and ex-boyfriend, fallen cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried.  The diminutive and soft-spoken former CEO of Alameda Research described the unraveling last November of her hedge fund and its sister company, the FTX exchange, and the “relief” she felt as revelations about their fraud became public.  “I felt a sense of relief that I didn’t have to lie anymore,” Ellison testified.  Her voice trembled and cracked as she recalled one particular text message exchange between her and Bankman-Fried during what she described as the “overall worst week of my life.""  ""I felt indescribably bad about all the ... people that lost their jobs ... [and the] people that trusted us that we had betrayed,"" Ellison told the packed courtroom as she reached for a tissue.  Bankman-Fried, the defendant, did not look up as she wept, but kept typing on his court-issued laptop.  It was the second day of testimony for Ellison, the former Wall Street trader and star witness in the government’s criminal fraud case against Bankman-Fried.  Read more: Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?  The smoking gun  During her testimony, Ellison discussed the document that caused Bankman-Fried’s companies to collapse: the balance sheet CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported on exclusively on Nov. 2, 2022.  She said that balance sheet was a version of the one Alameda sent to its lenders, designed to mislead them into thinking Alameda was healthier financially than it really was. On Wednesday, she called it a “dishonest” document.  But even the fudged numbers were ugly enough – brimming with FTX’s FTT token and other tokens closely related to Bankman-Fried – to raise questions about how viable Alameda and FTX were.  “It understated the true extent of Alameda’s risk, but it still showed that Alameda was in a fairly risky position,” Ellison said of the balance sheet.  CoinDesk has won three journalism awards for its reporting that set off the chain of events leading to FTX’s collapse.  ‘Sam told me to’  Bankman-Fried told Caroline Ellison to continue repaying Alameda Research’s lenders with FTX customers’ money, which she did despite misgivings, she testified Wednesday.  In May 2022, the Luna crypto token’s decline led to a broader market downturn which caused several of Alameda’s creditors to call back loans that they’d made to the Bankman-Fried–founded trading fund, Ellison testified.  “I was in a constant state of dread,” she said. “I knew we would have to take the money from our [FTX] line of credit and that was money that could be called in at any time.”  Asked why that money was particularly risky, Ellison said it “was coming from FTX customers” who could try to withdraw it at any time.  Ellison said she grew increasingly worried throughout the spring of 2022 that Alameda’s reliance on FTX customer funds could lead to catastrophe for both firms.  “I was concerned that if everyone would find out, then everything would come crashing down,” Ellison said.  In spite of her concerns, Ellison testified that she continued to pay back lenders via Alameda’s FTX line of credit – which meant using FTX customer funds – “because Sam told me to.”  “I thought it was wrong,” she told prosecutors.  Bribing Chinese officials  In the most salacious bit of testimony Wednesday, Ellison said she and a handful of FTX and Alameda executives “paid a large bribe to Chinese officials” to secure funds that had been locked on Chinese exchanges. Neither FTX nor Alameda was involved in the investigation – which Ellison said involved an entity which at one point traded with Alameda, and was being probed for money laundering.  (Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the Bankman-Fried trial, said the bribery anecdote was relayed to the jury to illustrate Bankman-Fried’s “trust and confidence” in Ellison and to speak to “motives” – not because Bankman-Fried was being charged with crimes in relation to alleged bribery. He did not mention that Bankman-Fried is currently scheduled to go on trial again next spring on bribery and other charges.)  After the FTX/Alameda team initially failed to secure the funds through negotiation with the Chinese government via lawyers, Ellison said they then tried – and again failed – to release the funds through a scheme involving the creation of fake exchange accounts using the identities of “Thai prostitutes.”  Ellison said Ryan Salame — another ex-FTX executive who’s pleaded guilty to charges — told her the names.  Finally, the funds were secured after Ellison made a payment of $100 million to a crypto account which, to her understanding, was tied in some way to Chinese government officials. Ellison recalled an incident when an employee protested against the plan in a meeting: Bankman-Fried grew increasingly annoyed with the employee, whose father was a Chinese government official, and eventually told her to ""shut the f*** up.""  In a private “State of Alameda” memo Ellison authored in November 2021, shortly after the payment was made, she included a bullet point titled “-150m from the thing?” under a section detailing “notable/idiosyncratic” financial events. The entry, she said, referenced the payment to Chinese officials: “I didn’t want to put in writing that we paid what I believed were bribes,” she testified.  Before breaking for lunch, prosecutors teased the jury with another memo authored by Ellison – a personal to-do list. It contained the item: “getting regulators to crack down on Binance.”  Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange and, in the aftermath of FTX’s November 2022 collapse, U.S. regulators have accused it of wrongdoing.  “Sam said that he thought that was one of the best potential ways for FTX to increase market share,” Ellison said. “Regulators had been promising him this would happen for a while.”  Duping Genesis  Alameda had by mid-June 2022 borrowed 77% of the $13 billion of customer U.S. dollar deposits into FTX, according to an internal FTX spreadsheet introduced by prosecutors and authenticated by Ellison. Ellison said she asked FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Sing to gather the data for her when she grew concerned about the size of Alameda’s borrowings from FTX.  By this point in June, the data showed Alameda had borrowed 52% of all ETH deposits, 44% of USDT deposits and 25% of BTC deposits into FTX – as well as all of the Australian dollar and BRZ deposits into the exchange. (BRZ is an Ethereum token backed by Brazil’s currency, the real.)  When Genesis, a major Alameda lender, asked Ellison if she could provide documentation of Alameda’s financials, Ellison said she and Bankman-Fried worried that providing accurate financials would “show that Alameda was risky,” so the pair devised strategies to improve the look of Alameda’s financial position. (Genesis, now defunct, is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  At one point, said Ellison, Bankman-Fried suggested Alameda could “put employees’ personal SRM tokens on its balance sheet” and take other measures to inflate the firm’s assets. SRM is a token on the Solana blockchain that Bankman-Fried had created and distributed, in part, to employees, according to earlier court testimony.  Ellison said that she and Bankman-Fried were still concerned that the new balance sheet they’d assembled would scare Genesis, so she went on to create “seven different, alternative balance sheets” for the pair to consider sending to the lender. Ellison walked through some of the balance sheets in court and detailed the different strategies she used in an attempt to hide Alameda’s risky financials.  Read more: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet  “I didn’t want to be dishonest but was afraid to share the truth,” Ellison testified.  A princely sum  FTX considered raising capital from Saudi Arabian Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Salman, Ellison testified.  At that time, around June 2022, Alameda Research got into trouble after a broader decline in the crypto market that summer led several of the hedge fund’s biggest lenders to recall their loans to Alameda, Ellison said.  According to text messages the prosecution showed from June 2022, crypto lender Genesis had asked Alameda to pay back $500 million “in $250 million clips.” In addition to that, former crypto lending desk Celsius also asked for its loans to be repaid.  It was after Celsius’ request that Sam Bankman-Fried said he was considering selling FTX shares to Bin Salman to raise more money to repay Alameda’s lenders, Ellison said.  Someone who answered the phone at the Saudi consulate in the U.S. hung up after a CoinDesk reporter asked about Ellison’s testimony.  Moral ‘framework’  The former Alameda CEO also recalled how Bankman-Fried had said that lying and stealing money were permissible in his worldview.  “He didn’t think rules like ‘don’t lie’ [and] ‘don’t steal’ fit in that framework,” she said.  She recalled becoming more and more used to doing those things and sending false information to business partners or taking FTX customers’ money.  “Over time, it was something I became more comfortable with while working there,” she said.  Vague labeling  To avoid “legal trouble,” Ellison used vague language in an internal FTX document detailing how much Alameda had taken from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange, she testified.  Prosecutors introduced as exhibits spreadsheets created by Ellison detailing Alameda’s financial balances. The documents, according to Ellison, showed that Alameda had taken more than $10 billion from customers of FTX by May 2022.  Asked why this money was labeled “FTX borrows,” Ellison said she was following orders from Bankman-Fried. “I didn’t want to say explicitly ‘FTX customer money,’” she said on Wednesday.  Bankman-Fried “told us not to put things in writing that might get us in legal trouble.”  SBF’s valuable (lack of a) haircut  At one point, prosecuter Danielle Sassoon presented a picture of Bankman-Fried, asking Ellison to describe him. Ellison repled that it appeared he didn’t put much effort into his appearance. “He looked … sloppy,” she said. He “didn’t cut his hair often.”  And there was a reason for that, she recalled. The press and investors frequently took Bankman-Fried’s appearance as a sign that he was a typical Silicon Valley nerd who knew how to code but didn’t care much about fancy designer clothes or cars, which is exactly the image he wanted, Ellison recalled.  “[Sam] said he had gotten higher bonuses because of his hair,” she said. He had told his colleagues at his companies that his hair ""had been very valuable [to his career],"" she added.  It was also better for FTX’s image, Ellison recalled him telling her, which was also the reason behind the two of them switching their cars from “luxury company vehicles” to much cheaper brands like Toyota and Honda.  Blow to defense  Judge Kaplan dealt a blow to the defense this week when he denied multiple requests from Bankman-Fried’s lawyers to mention his charitable giving and the lack of clear U.S. crypto regulations. That crypto exchanges are not regulated like securities trading venues is “irrelevant” and only likely to confuse the jury, Kaplan said.  Kaplan also ruled that the Bankman-Fried jury would not be able to hear about the likelihood of recoveries from the FTX bankruptcy.  After releasing the jury on Wednesday – just before the court adjourned for the day – Kaplan also sided in favor of a government proposal to bar the defense from mentioning FTX's sizable stake in Anthropic, an AI startup whose valuation has surged in recent months. The defense may have hoped to use the investment to show the jury that FTX could have survived if Bankman-Fried's investments had been given a bit more time to play out.  Kaplan wasn't convinced, however. ""This is like saying that if I break into the Federal Reserve Bank, make off with a million bucks, spend it all on Powerball tickets and happen to win, it was okay,"" the judge said.  Day one recap  Ellison began her testimony on Tuesday, and opened by saying she committed crimes with Bankman-Fried by sending balance sheets that misstated Alameda’s assets and liabilities to the crypto hedge fund’s lenders and by taking FTX customer funds and using them to repay debts or for investments, to the tune of around $10 billion.  Things fell apart in November 2022, Ellison said, when asked Tuesday what happened when customers tried to withdraw their funds.  “Initially FTX was able to process some withdrawals, but pretty soon it started running out of money. Alameda tried to send more money to FTX, but there wasn’t enough to cover all the customer claims,” she said. This was “because Alameda had taken it to make our own investments and to repay our lenders.”  Over the course of her first day of testimony, Ellison walked the jury through how Bankman-Fried, despite naming her (and for a spell, Sam Trabucco) as CEO of Alameda, still largely retained control over the firm’s decisions, and how he disregarded her advice on issues like whether to expand FTX’s investment portfolio.  Alameda’s inability to sell large portions of the FTT token came up. Selling the token would have depressed the price enough to dramatically hurt Alameda’s credit with lenders, she said.  “[Bankman-Fried] gave us a lot of instructions about FTT; at various points he instructed us to buy if there was a large amount of selling or if the price was going down too much,” she said.

42409575,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLBVE,1697029916,EU Markets Regulator Warns of DeFi’s ‘Serious Risks’,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) warned of ""serious risks"" of investors being harmed by decentralized finance (DeFi) in a Wednesday report despite the innovative technology being in its infancy.  ESMA, an EU agency that is due to set rules under the bloc’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), promised to look further into the nascent market, which has posed a puzzle for policymakers who are used to pinning regulatory obligations on centralized entities like banks or securities exchanges.  “Although investors’ exposure to DeFi remains small overall, there are serious risks to investor protection, due to the highly speculative nature of many DeFi arrangements, important operational and security vulnerabilities, and the lack of a clearly identified responsible party,” said the report prepared by the Paris-based agency, promising annual reports on the sector.  While in principle, DeFi – which uses smart contracts to automatically execute loans or other financial services – poses less of a risk of counterparties defaulting, the report notes heightened volatility in crypto markets and anonymity that enables dubious behavior like wash trading, in which sale volumes are inflated to manipulate markets.  ESMA last week proposed a swathe of new rules for crypto asset service providers under MiCA, such as the environmental disclosures that will need to be included in issuers’ white papers. A further report on Wednesday highlighted the potentially innovative nature of the smart contracts used in DeFi, noting they can range from financially-motivated Ponzi schemes to operational memory management.  ESMA is not the only regulator wondering how to deal with DeFi projects, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions recently proposed to treat them on a par with conventional finance. In response to a consultation from the French financial regulator, AMF, the lobby group EU Crypto Initiative has recently argued that DeFi needs a tailored approach – with programmers not held legally liable merely because they realize their code could be misused.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/11/eu-markets-regulator-warns-of-defis-serious-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d5bf6cca518e2c8cb5a2c0836821e8233da851a-1257x707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This trend will continue as a critical metric hint at a potential “short squeeze,” a price move set to take liquidity from long or short positions. Related Reading: XRP Price Retest: A Prelude To A Stunning Surge To $2, Predicts Expert As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.48 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recorded a 9% loss in the previous seven days and operated as the worst performer in the top 10 by market cap, closely followed by Solana (SOL). XRP Price Sets Trajectory For Short Squeeze? The crypto market has been experiencing a spike in volatility since October. Following months of sideways movement by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the XRP price broke the trend and ignited new life into the nascent sector. The spike in volatility was recorded when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lost its case against payment company Ripple. A US Judge favored the company and deemed the XRP token outside of securities laws in the country. This event propelled XRP to fresh yearly highs, but the cryptocurrency has been losing some steam. Uncertainty in the crypto market remains high, and any individual bull run seems likely to lose power, as demonstrated by XRP’s latest price action. However, the current status quo is fragile, and fresh data indicates an aggressive move is in the making. A pseudonym analyst shared the chart below, showing the spike in the Bitcoin Open Interest. The analyst claims that the metric stands at a critical point that often leads to sudden moves in the price of Bitcoin, XRP, and other cryptocurrencies. In the short term, this spike in volatility could lead the XRP back to critical support levels. However, the most likely scenario is that the Short Squeeze, the sudden spike in volatility, operates as a tool for prominent market participants to take liquidity off both sides, longs and shorts. Crypto Poised For Downside Price Action On higher timeframes, the crypto market and more prominent cryptocurrencies could become an obstacle to any upside on XRP. According to another analyst, the sector is gearing up for a significant move to the downside. The analyst bases this theory on the upcoming Bitcoin Halving. This event has a profound impact on all other cryptocurrencies, and right now, BTC is at a critical point in which historical data points to a deep retrace back to around $20,000. If BTC follows this trajectory, XRP could return to its pre-SEC victory levels. However, this downside price action might provide bulls with the “perfect” opportunity to accumulate before an overall bull run unleashes its force on the nascent sector.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) blacklisted Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging it was a key tool used by malicious actors to launder money. Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while masking wallet addresses on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Optimism networks. The service itself is not nefarious but was increasingly used by crypto criminals to obfuscate the trail of stolen funds.  The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged the service was used to launder more than $1 billion in illicit funds, including by North Korean hacker group Lazarus.  TRM researchers said that while North Korean hackers have mostly moved to other Bitcoin mixers, some illicit use of Tornado Cash continues.  “Though the government's actions have crippled Tornado Cash’s service, a few illicit actors aren't deterred, showing that while the sanctions were a hurdle, they weren't a full stop for all nefarious activities,” the report stated.  From February to July 2022, transactions worth over $2.8 billion flowed through Tornado Cash, but during the same period in 2023, volumes dropped to $425 million, according to the report.

42409574,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLBbq,1697029200,"Crypto Prime Broker Membrane Labs Raises $20M From Brevan Howard, Point72 Ventures and Jane Street","Membrane Labs, a cryptocurrency-focused trading and lending platform, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round, with participation from big names like Brevan Howard Digital and Point72 Ventures. The capital will be used to help build the type of grown-up trading infrastructure the crypto space needs in order to avoid further disasters.  Other notable names included in the round were Jane Street, Flow Traders, QCP Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, Electric Capital, Jump Crypto, QCP Capital, GSR Markets, Belvedere Trading, and Framework Ventures.  Last year saw multi-billion dollar crypto trading and lending platforms fall to pieces, revealing a chaotic mess of opaque and iniquitous operations carried on behind the scenes. The response from regulators will see crypto come into the daylight and map much closer to traditional finance.  Membrane started out by building a clearing, netting and settlement engine, explained the firm’s CEO Carson Cook. This enabled institutions to choose where and how they custody their funds, whether that’s a custodian or multi-party computation MPC wallet, and then separately have their front office determine where and how they execute trades.  “You can think of us as the glue, a settlement network that connects all of these things together,” Cook said in an interview. “On top of this core infrastructure, we built workflow management for collateral management, loans, OTC trades and derivatives. The permeating theme is to increase transparency and risk management, especially in a post-FTX and post-3AC world.”  The knee jerk reaction to last year’s blowups is to move everything on-chain and lean hard into a decentralized finance (DeFi) type of infrastructure. This is understandable and it makes sense, said Cook, but it won’t fit for all institutions.  “We can do classic settlement which is just sign and send and a lot of institutions want that functionality because they're used to taking on that settlement risk with other desks or other institutions,” Cook said. “We can also offer smart settlement that uses a system of smart contracts as an escrow for the payments between us. So clients can choose to take on the smart contract risk and not have the counterparty risk.”",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/11/crypto-prime-broker-membrane-labs-raises-20m-from-brevan-howard-point72-and-jane-street,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e48c82dbe5c106b9e24fceed14c77ef575c07e0-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18657666,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555003,1697029080,Top ten competitive advantages of PrimeXBT Crypto Futures,"Cryptocurrency trading offers tremendous opportunities that simply aren’t found in other markets. The ability to realise life-changing wealth lies within reach thanks to Crypto’s legendary volatility. But seizing those profits takes more than just blind luck – you need the right trading tools and platform. Not all exchanges live up to the demands of active Crypto trading in today’s fast-paced digital asset markets. The ideal platform needs to provide far more than simple order execution. With new exchanges constantly flooding the scene, only the most innovative and trader-focused deliver an environment to truly thrive. This is where PrimeXBT’s Crypto Futures exchange shines. PrimeXBT packs the must-have features to trade Crypto successfully. Customisable workspaces, built-in charting, Copy Trading modules, and multi-asset support give you an edge across any market condition. PrimeXBT tears down barriers like high fees and minimums, but also offers up to 200:1 leverage to maximise profits. Whether you’re a total beginner or seasoned pro, PrimeXBT has resources to match your experience level. The platform grows with you as your Crypto trading skills progress. Here are the top ten reasons PrimeXBT is the best-in-class choice for unlocking Crypto’s full profit potential. 1. Ever-expanding list of Crypto assets When Crypto Futures first debuted, it featured eight of the largest Crypto pairs including stalwarts like BTC/USD and ETH/USD. But PrimeXBT continually adds support for more Cryptocurrencies based on popularity, trends, and user requests. Now with up to 35+ pairs, traders have their pick of top altcoins like Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, and dozens more. Even meme coins like Dogecoin are available to tap into viral momentum. No matter which ways Crypto markets move, PrimeXBT likely has the assets you need to capitalise on both uptrends and downtrends. The team vets and lists new Cryptocurrencies rapidly, so traders always have the hottest options with enough volatility and liquidity to generate profits. 2. Ultra-low fees help profits stack up You don’t need an enormous bankroll to get started and thrive with PrimeXBT. One of the platform’s greatest strengths is making Crypto derivatives trading accessible and affordable for anyone. Trading fees are at an incredibly low 0.1% per trade, regardless of your account balance. To put this in perspective, fees at other major Crypto exchanges often start around 0.20% and only decrease for high-volume traders. There’s also no minimum deposit or account balance required with PrimeXBT. You can fund your account with any amount, even just a few dollars, to test the platform and make small trades cost-effectively as you learn. Low fees maximise your profit potential on every trade while low minimums help beginners get started the right way. 3. Adjustable leverage up to 200:1 Unlike other Crypto derivatives exchanges offering max leverage between 10:1 to 100:1, PrimeXBT allows you to customise leverage based on the specific Cryptocurrency asset. Conservative coins like BTC and ETH can use up to 200:1, while more volatile assets have 50:1 caps or lower. This prevents you from overextending yourself on riskier altcoins. The adjustable settings let you dial in your preferred risk/reward level on a trade-by-trade basis. Lower leverage provides greater safety, while higher leverage unlocks more profit potential from the same market moves. This allows beginners to minimise risk and maximise potential gains. 4. Fully customisable platform layout PrimeXBT packs an incredible amount of tools, charts, data modules and more into the trading interface without feeling cluttered. The dashboard employs a modular layout, allowing you to drag and drop elements anywhere on screen to create your ideal workspace. Play with multiple configurations to find the most efficient layout for your strategy and workflow. Frequently used tools like the versatile order book, pending orders, and multi-chart windows can be tailored to your needs. Configure the platform to give you the informational edge the markets demand, rather than settling for a rigid, one-size-fits-all layout. Customisation keeps everything you require front and centre. 5. Built-in charting and analysis tools Proper trading analysis and charting can make or break your P&L. PrimeXBT saves you major hassle by integrating charting from the industry leader TradingView directly into its platform UI. Rather than relying on two separate programs, you get TradingView’s real-time data, drawing tools, and indicators, seamlessly built into the PrimeXBT platform, for quick access. With essential charting available natively, you avoid missing profitable trading signals during market moves. Switch through various timeframes, add indicators like Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands, and spot patterns and trends faster, to find more trading opportunities no matter which Crypto you follow. Smooth, in-house charting gives you a distinct edge. 6. 24/7 multilingual customer support Trading never sleeps, and neither does PrimeXBT’s support team. Unlike other exchanges who offer little beyond frustrating bots and delayed email ticketing, PrimeXBT provides 24/7 human support in multiple languages. You’ll speak to a real person ready to assist you day or night, on weekends, holidays, and any other time you need help. This round-the-clock assistance also gives you peace of mind, allowing you to trade confidently anytime knowing an expert can answer questions or provide guidance. Quick and effective support is critical in volatile Crypto markets. PrimeXBT’s stellar team has your back whenever issues arise so you can trade with less stress. 7. Test drive Crypto Futures with Contests If you’re unsure about diving headfirst into real Crypto Futures trading, PrimeXBT lets you preview the platform and markets risk-free. The innovative Contests portal offers simulated trading competitions using demo accounts loaded with virtual funds. Compete to rack up hypothetical profits against fellow traders and win real Crypto prizes. Contests offer an ideal way to experience real market conditions and fine-tune strategies without real money fears. New traders can gain experience identifying trends, planning entries and exits, using indicators, and more, to become completely comfortable with PrimeXBT’s interface and tools. Contests help transform you into a confident trader. 8. Copy the profits of expert Strategy Providers Take the guesswork and effort out of active trading using PrimeXBT’s built-in Copy Trading module. The peer-to-peer Covesting community connects you to vetted Strategy Providers – experienced traders who publish their trading stats and performance data for transparency. Browse Providers’ profiles and track records to find profitable strategies matching your risk tolerance and goals. Click follow to essentially subscribe to your chosen Provider and automatically copy every one of their trades proportionally into your portfolio. It’s an easy way for beginners to leverage experts’ skills or for pros to diversify. 9. Award-winning mobile app keeps you connected PrimeXBT’s mobile apps for iOS and Android devices have earned awards for good reason – they provide a seamless trading experience on the go. The app’s interface is silky smooth, with fast loading times between tabs. You also get full account management functionality in the palm of your hand. Never miss sudden price swings or opportunities thanks to easy on-the-go order placement or modifications. The app’s convenience lets you manage portfolios anywhere, whether you’re away from your desk or travelling abroad. Smooth mobile trading is a must-have perk. 10. Diversify across more than just Crypto While PrimeXBT’s Crypto Futures exchange delivers an unparalleled trading environment focused on digital assets, the platform offers much more. Complement your Crypto portfolio by trading global Stock Indices, Commodities, Forex, and more, from a single account. Diversification protects you from Crypto-specific volatility. Long-term traders can hedge positions to minimise risk. While having additional assets gives you more ways to profit, so you’re not limited solely to volatile Cryptocurrencies. Only PrimeXBT combines Crypto and multi-asset trading for maximum flexibility. Conclusion PrimeXBT’s Crypto Futures platform stands out in a crowded field by offering far more than just an engine to buy and sell digital currencies. Every feature provides an advantage to active traders, from cutting-edge tools and customisable layouts, to a Copy Trading module and multi-asset support. Newcomers can enter the Crypto game for pennies on the dollar, while advanced traders get capabilities to push their skills further. Compared to traditional Crypto exchanges designed for passive holders, PrimeXBT’s cutting-edge functionality and trader focus make it the clear choice for anyone ready to dive into Crypto derivatives trading. The platform can grow with any trader’s experience level and market conditions. PrimeXBT breaks the mould by providing all the tools you’ll need not only survive, but thrive, in Cryptocurrency’s volatile Wild West.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-ten-competitive-advantages-of-primexbt-crypto-futures/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  JPMorgan has carried out its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction involving BlackRock and Barclays, the U.S. banking giant said on Wednesday. JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx blockchain and the bank’s Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN) was used by BlackRock to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds. The tokens were then transferred to Barclays Plc for collateral in an OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives trade. The tokenization of traditional financial assets is a big deal for banks, and it’s an area JPMorgan has been leading the charge with, now joined by the likes of Citi and others.  Coinbase’s legal fight over the status of crypto met a new hurdle Tuesday, as U.S. state authorities and legal experts joined a campaign by federal securities regulators to argue the company unlawfully operated an unregistered exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s action against one of the country’s biggest crypto exchanges has been seen as existential for the future of crypto, with the sector accusing the agency of regulating by enforcement in the absence of new laws from the U.S. Congress. Now, three new amicus briefs, which allow parties who are interested but not directly affected by the case to aid the court’s reasoning, argue crypto is neither significant nor special, and that the SEC can take on digital assets under existing law.  Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, testified that she committed fraud at the direction of her ex-boyfriend and former colleague, FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Ellison, 28, is the government’s highly anticipated star witness in the six-week trial of Bankman-Fried. She was the CEO of Alameda Research, the hedge fund prosecutors say stole billions of dollars from customers of its sister company, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. (Read the government’s indictment here.) Prosecutors began their questioning of Ellison by asking her if she committed crimes and if so, who she committed them with.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows monthly changes in the number of active developers in crypto since 2016.  The tally has declined to 19,630, its lowest level since late 2020.  Per Reflexivity Research, the decline represents an exodus of ""tourists"" during the bear market as ""hard-core believers/builders/investors"" prevail.

This was mainly due to the price decline that LTC experienced after heavy profit-taking from investors who had invested leading up to the price surge triggered by the expectations around the halving. But it seems the tides are finally turning for the coin as one analyst predicts a more than 30% increase in price going forward. Litecoin Price Shooting For The Stars The current crypto market headwinds seem to be working in favor of the Litecoin price which one crypto analyst believes is gearing up for a run-up to $83. In the post, the pseudonymous analyst identified as P_S_trade points to the possibility of the crypto market continuing its growth trend. However, this would be null and void if the crypto market were to reverse back below $27,000. Related Reading: No Love For FTX: Ex-Girlfriend Delivers Scathing Testimony Against Sam Bankman-Fried For Litecoin, the analyst points out that the altcoin has usually been the first to start to see an upside in the crypto market. But this has not been the case, as previously mentioned since high levels of profit-taking have affected the LTC price. LTC chart shows runup to $84 | Source: TradingView.com Even from the current level, the analyst’s chart points toward a possible retracement from here back down to $55. However, once this is completed, the bounce-off from there shows LTC reaching as high as $77 before succumbing to another correction. This decline is also similar to the first instance where it falls to $55 in the fact that it signals another price surge. Following this second correction, the analyst puts the bottom somewhere around $67 before Litecoin continues its ascent once more. The top of this second rally then lands just above $84 on the chart. Although there is no official timeline, the range of trades mentioned by the analyst is the medium term, which could see this run out for a couple of months. LTC price holds shakily at $62 | Source: LTCUSD on Tradingview.com LTC Daily Transactions Continue To Decline While the analyst foresees Litecoin price to surge, other metrics could be pointing in the opposite direction. For one, the daily transaction numbers for the altcoin have been steadily on the decline since the halving event in August. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Fell Toward $1,500 According to data from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily LTC transactions has fallen from over 584,000 in May to just shy of 104,000 transactions by Tuesday, October 10. This points to a lack of interest from investors usually brought on by bear market headwinds. Additionally, the daily transaction volumes, as shown by the token tracking website CoinMarketCap, show a 13.26% decline in the daily trading volume of Litecoin. These bearish metrics could thwart chances of reversal. However, they could also signal the bottom that triggers the start of another rally.

6862,http://blokt.com/?p=40825,1697022029,What Is Proof of Stake (PoS) & How Does it Work? Find Out Here in our Ultimate Coin Staking Guide,"The recent rise of blockchains based on Proof-of-Stake (POS) has provided a new way for crypto holders to increase their holdings for relatively little work. Once unproven and untested, POS is now becoming more and more common among top blockchain networks. The ultimate guide to Proof-of-Stake As an alternative to Proof-of-Work (POW), this POS allows more users to participate in maintaining and validating the network without the need for expensive equipment and high electricity usage. In this article, you will learn how POS and POW are similar , how they differ, and how you can start earning rewards through staking right away. Consensus Both POS and POW are different methods for reaching the same end goal, which is to coordinate agreement in a decentralized network. Consensus simply means a general agreement, but on a peer-to-peer network of computers that have no hierarchy, manager, coordinator, or director, reaching consensus requires the right combination of cryptography , rewards , and punishments. Consensus These computers in the network, also known as nodes, must have some basic set of rules of how to agree or determine what is true. The rule set in which they agree to participate in is called a consensus protocol , mechanism , or algorithm . The nodes are allowed to participate in the network by running software that has the same underlying consensus protocol at its root. In general, the consensus mechanism is how these nodes come to an agreement even if some (normally up to 1/3) of those nodes disagree or behave badly. This is also known as a Byzantine Fault Tolerant system. Proof of Stake (POS) vs Proof of Work (POW) Proof-of-Work (POW) was a breakthrough technology because it provided, for the first time, an effective and reliable mechanism for reaching consensus in a way that was secure and decentralized. Therefore, to truly understand Proof-of-Stake (POS), it is important to understand how POW works. Note: Blokt has created an in-depth Ethereum mining guide, which will help you understand the basic concepts of how its current POW system works. POS vs POW – Source: Shutterstock.com POW Costs If POW works and works very well, then why does there need to be POS at all? The answer is electricity. The primary input of a POW system is electricity and this real material cost to our environment and planet is one of the main reasons why so many of the major existing and upcoming blockchain networks have plans or are already dedicated to alternative consensus mechanisms such as POS. POW Costs Bitcoin was the first application to use POW and did not consume massive amounts of energy in its initial years. However, as the Bitcoin asset became more valuable and thus more profitable to mine, competition increased and so did the electricity needed to mine profitably. Bitcoin mining has now reached the point where the entire mining process consumes more electricity than many small and even some medium-sized countries. Bitcoin Electronic Waste Generation In addition to the massive energy costs involved in POW , the process also requires highly specialized computers called ASICs, which has resulted in massive electronic waste when the ASICs become obsolete or unprofitable. These very real and significant costs to our environment will likely increase as POW blockchain assets like Bitcoin rise in value. Similarities Between POW and POS Like POW, POS requires a minimum amount of participants to secure or maintain the network. If there aren’t enough participants then the network will be easily attacked and not very secure. In addition, the asset on the network needs to have a minimum amount of value. Similarities – POS vs POW – Source: Shutterstock.com The fact that the crypto asset has value makes the network more secure because the POS or POW systems can reward participants with coins produced by the consensus mechanism. The rewards for participating in consensus combined with the transaction fees on the network, which generally go to POS and POW participants, are the necessary financial incentives that keep a blockchain growing. Differences Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake Significant Costs Equipment + Electricity Crypto Asset Hardware ASIC / GPU General Computers Rewards Fixed Variable Cooperative Options Cloud Mining / Mining Pools Delegating / Staking Services Disadvantages High Energy Consumption, High Barriers to Entry Less Proven and Test Participants Miners Validators The primary difference between POW and POS is the activity that participants engage in in order to secure the network. In POW, participants are called miners, and they must solve complex and difficult mathematical equations through a process of trial and error. The mining process relies heavily on powerful computers and large amounts of electricity consumption. In a POW system , new tokens are produced to reward miners thus keeping a fixed supply of new tokens that enter the economy with every block mined. In POS, validators must stake or deposit their crypto assets in order to engage in proposing and voting on the next block in the chain. Instead of investing electricity like miners, validators stake their capital in the form of network coins and the network rewards these validators by producing new coins over time as a reward for validators. Because the barriers to entry are much lower than in POW, nearly anyone is able to participate in POS. Centralization Because it is easier to become a validator than a miner, more people are likely to run nodes and become validators , which means a more diverse and decentralized group are securing the network. In order to be profitable more regularly, miners in POW tend to pool resources into mining pools. As a result, three mining pools already control more than 51% of the Bitcoin network. Best Bitcoin Mining Pools Validators Though there are many different types and designs for POS systems, with a variety of different terms , the most general name for participants in POS is validators. Validators – Source: Shutterstock.com Validators are users who stake or deposit their crypto assets for a certain length of time and run specialized software in order to validate and maintain the blockchain network. What is Staking? Staking is generally done by sending some minimum amount of crypto assets into a smart contract or specific destination that is used for validating. These stakes are coins of the POS network and are essentially deposits that are frozen and cannot be moved for a certain amount of time. This freezing of assets leaves the validator vulnerable to slashing as a way to deter bad behavior. Staking – POS – Source: Shutterstock.com There is normally also a period of time when a validator wants to stop staking tokens, but cannot move them. This time period is called an unbonding period where crypto assets are not being staked, but are also still frozen. All blockchains differ on the length of the unbonding period, which can last from three days with EOS or up to three weeks with Cosmos Hub . Rewards Validators are incentivized to lock up their precious capital because they will be rewarded , generally in both network transaction fees and staking rewards. The reward amount in POS systems is usually variable and can change depending on how many total validators are participating at the same time. Rewards – Source: Shutterstock.com If the rewards are too low, there won’t be enough validators participating and if the rewards are too high, it will cause the value of the crypto asset to decrease because it will increase the supply of coins too quickly. The economic and monetary incentives must be carefully balanced. Punishments In POS , because there is no electricity being sacrificed to secure the network, there needs to be another deterrent used to prevent attackers from trying to cheat the system. Therefore a necessary component of an effective POS system is a penalty mechanism used to punish those that are misbehaving or simply breaking the rules of the protocol. Breaking the rules could mean trying to disrupt the consensus of the system or simply not running the software during the validating process. It does not have to be intentionally harmful. Punishments – Source: Shutterstock.com This penalty or punishment is sometimes referred to as ‘slashing’. Each POS protocol has its own rules for what actions are punishable and how severe the punishment is, but in general, the punishment is removing a part of the stake that a validator has locked into the network. The risk of losing crypto assets should be significant enough to prevent harmful actors in the system. Many POS systems also have reputation systems attached so that good validators who have a long history of good action will be seen as more trustworthy. POS Costs The primary cost in POS is the value of the crypto asset which must be purchased or staked in order to participate in POS. The cost of validating on the network is in running the equipment and software. Though, not nearly as intensive and costly as in POW , it does still require some cost. For example, in Ethereum’s upcoming POS system , the cost of staking is around ‘$120/year for a beacon node and $60/year per validator client’. Costs – Source: Shutterstock.com Besides the material cost, there is an opportunity cost of not being able to access your crypto assets, which can be used in other decentralized financial application such as lending . These alternative uses for your crypto assets may offer higher returns but must be given up in order to participate in staking. Selection Not all validators produce the same blocks at the same time. Instead, validators are chosen individually or as a set to determine which one will produce and validate the next block. Each POS design has its own method of determining, which validator(s) is chosen, but the election process is normally a combination of random selection or the total value of the validator’s stake. Risks Participants have to trust the POS system that they are locking their precious crypto assets into. If the network has a fatal flaw or bug then you could easily lose your staked coins. At the very least, the discovery of a major bug in the system will mean that your coins lose significant value and because you are locked in the system for a certain amount of time, you will likely not be able to sell very quickly. Risks – Source: Shutterstock.com You are also trusting that the POS design’s slashing and punishment mechanisms work as intended and you are not mistakenly slashed. Staking in a network that promises higher yields usually means staking in smaller networks that are less proven and therefore have higher risks. POS protocols have not had to deal with anywhere near the amount of value in existing POW protocols such as Bitcoin or Ethereum so it is a valid argument to say that POS has not been tested against attackers in the same way that POW has been. Known Issues With PoS Some cryptographic researchers have pointed out some pressing issues with PoS consensus. These issues don’t afflict every PoS blockchain, and there are some which have effectively solved many of these limitations – which we’ll discuss later. These issues include: The nothing at stake problem – As there’s no hashing power required to build a PoS blockchain, and therefore no or little computational effort, blockchain validators can exploit the network. They do this by building on all of the past versions of the blockchain, which allows them to claim fees for validating transactions on both the chain that becomes the most used, and any legacy chains which continue to be used. Negative feedback loop – Proof of stake encourages the staking of coins or tokens, which effectively removes them from the circulating supply. This means there are less tokens to be used as digital cash within a blockchain ecosystem, potentially negatively affecting the economics of the underlying network. However, scarcity via staking could also increase the price of the token. Goldfinger attacks – Goldfinger attacks can seek to bribe the node operators or staking pools, rent more stake to launch an attack on the protocol, or build a pool to try and seize a majority. Goldfinger attacks are named after the James Bond villain, who undermined the US Treasury to his own gain. Security – PoS is a relatively new technology, and so the security has not yet been proven. PoS has been in use for some time and so far it seems to be secure, but there is no guarantee as of yet. Certain blockchains have sidestepped these issues. For example, third-gen blockchain protocol Cardano use the Ouroboros consensus mechanism, which uses sidechains to avoid Goldfinger attacks, and solves nothing at stake issues by using forkable strings. Similarly, Tezos uses a security deposit to ensure that double staking or validating on simultaneous chains is prevented. Delegating The easiest way to get involved and start earning rewards in most POS systems is not through validating directly, but through delegating. Delegators participate in POS by staking their crypto assets with a trusted or reliable validator who runs the software and equipment, but pools the capital from different delegators. Compound Your Crypto In other words, instead of running the software yourself, you can send your tokens to a validator who will do it for you for a small fee and share of the rewards. Like with ‘validators’ and even ‘ staking ’, many different terms are used when a user must trust another party to handle the technical staking , but we will stick to delegating . As a delegator, there is a risk in choosing and trusting validators because you will both share in the rewards and the punishments if they occur. As with validating directly, there is the danger of getting punished or slashed if the validator that you are delegating to misbehaves. Delegating can normally be done on-chain so that the validator does not own or control the delegator’s tokens and can only use those tokens in staking. Delegating to participate in POS involves the same basic steps: Step 1: Get Coin Step 2: Download Wallet Step 3: Delegate to Validator Staking Comparison The blockchain networks below are active today and anyone can become a validator or delegator to earn rewards on them. We will describe the unique POS mechanisms of each one as well as how to start staking in them.

Cosmos also easily allows developers to build their own specialized blockchain on their Tendermint consensus protocol, which uses POS. Cosmos – Internet of Blockchains One of the biggest and best crypto exchanges in the world, Binance has created its own blockchain, Binance Chain that is built on the Tendermint protocol. Binance Chain ATOMs The Cosmos Hub is the first hub that will connect many different blockchains and its native token is ATOM . Holders of ATOMs are able to participate in POS to earn more ATOMS as well as vote on governance decisions on Cosmos Hub. Validators There are currently over 100 validators on Cosmos, but there are plans to have up to 300 over time. Validators are chosen based on their own self staked ATOMs and the ATOMs of those who have delegated tokens to them. The top 100 validators with the most self and delegated stakes are chosen as the validators of the system so it is important for a successful validator to attract stakes through delegators. If you want to start running your own validator on the Cosmos network , you can follow its instructions using command line. Delegators All validators in the Cosmos network can be delegated to and this happens as an on-chain function. To become a delegator, you must hold ATOMs and send a ‘delegate transaction’ indicating how many ATOMs to stake and to which validator. The top active validators on the Cosmos network can be seen below: Active validators on the Cosmos network Polychain Labs is the top validator on Cosmos and delegating your ATOMs to Polychain Labs can be done on-chain via the command line interface: How to Delegate Tezos Tezos is a smart contract platform where holders of the Tez (XTZ) tokens are able to participate in POS and governance decisions. Tezos – Source: tezos.com Baking The Tezos POS system works through ‘baking’ in which holders of XTZ tokens sign and publish blocks to the Tezos blockchain . Bakers in Tezos are basically the validators that we have been describing in other POS systems . Bakers get the right to create a new block by being randomly selected. MyTezosBaker – All You Need To Know To Choose A Baker The baker is notified that they have the right to bake blocks weeks in advance and is required to place a deposit or ‘bond’ that changes depending on how many blocks the baker needs to create. The rewards for baking changes depending on the total number of bakers, but the system will create roughly 5.5% of the total token XTZ supply each year in baking rewards. A list of active bakers and tools for calculating rewards based on how much XTZ is staked and which baker is chosen can be found at mytezosbaker.com . Delegating Like Cosmos , Tezos also allows its coin holders to delegate their crypto assets to chosen validators or bakers. To get started delegating, you need to download and use a wallet , which will likely have a delegation feature from which you can choose the baker that you want to trust to bake for you and share rewards with you. Tezos software-wallets Delegating can be done through the Galleon Wallet by following these simple instructions: Dash DASH is meant to be a private and secure cryptocurrency that can be transferred quickly and easily. Dash Digital Cash Dash has a consensus system that is a hybrid of POW and POS so it still has miners maintaining the network. However, we will focus on the POS portion of the DASH protocol, which revolves around a concept known as Masternodes. Masternodes Masternodes are servers that are dedicated to maintaining the DASH network. These Masternodes host full copies of the DASH blockchain and must contain a minimum stake of 1000 DASH in order to earn network rewards. In order to host a DASH Masternode, you will need 1000 DASH , a wallet that stores DASH, and a Linux server . For complete steps on how to run a DASH Masternode, please see the instructions here. DASH Masternode Hosting Service Delegating your stake of DASH to another party to do the difficult technical work is known as a ‘ hosting service ’ in DASH. There are several hosting services available that are recommended on the official DASH website such as CrowdNode , SID Hosting Service , and AllNodes . Masternode Hosting Service TRON TRON is a fork or copy of Ethereum that was redesigned to be optimized for performance. Specifically, TRON is much faster than Ethereum , being able to handle up to 2000 transactions per second compared to Ethereum’s 15 transactions per second. TRON is able to accomplish this speed and throughput because it uses a delegated POS protocol while Ethereum still uses POW. TRON – Decentralize The Web Super Representatives TRON has implemented a delegated POS consensus protocol and staking occurs through 27 validators that are called Super Representatives (SR). Staking in TRON is done through a system of freezing TRX tokens and voting for SRs. You can see all the current Super Representatives as well as the SR candidates on the tronscan.org block explorer: Super Representatives Delegating your TRX to an SR is done by ‘voting’ for them. The top 27 SRs with the most votes gets to participate in the block producing process. To start delegating or voting, you can follow these instructions . EOS Like TRON , EOS is also a smart contract platform that has become scalable by using the Delegated POS system. eosio – Blockchain software architecture Block Producers The EOS delegated POS system relies on 21 elected Block Producers to actively maintain and build the network. The system is also similar to TRON in that Block Producers are voted on or selected by EOS holders . Voting happens in rounds where the 21 Block Producers are selected by EOS holders and the more EOS tokens a voter has, the more their vote is weighted. You can participate in voting on EOS through a wallet such as SimpleEOS , EOS Voter , or Scatter . SIMPLEOS- Your simple and secure EOS wallet For a comparison between EOS, Ethereum, and TRON , check out our in-depth guide. Cardano In July 2020, Cardano completed its move to a fully decentralized blockchain with the release of the Shelley era . The blockchain underwent a continuous hardfork which welcomed the beginning of staking and delegation on the network. ADA holders can currently delegate their stake through the official Daedalus wallet, and soon the Yoroi wallet from Cardano’s partners, EMURGO; and also eventually through Binance! Although staking has been live for less than a month, there’s already almost one thousand stake pools live, making Cardano one of the most decentralized blockchain protocols almost overnight. Staking has proven very popular on Cardano, and although it’s currently too early to give a detailed breakdown of staking rewards here, you can find out how much you could earn through ADA staking by checking out their staking calculator . Ethereum 2.0 Staking Plans Ethereum 2.0 The world’s largest crypto network after Bitcoin is Ethereum and the protocol plans to switch to POS in what is being known as Ethereum 2.0. Though the plans for Ethereum 2.0 are constantly changing, the first step in the POS specification is being planned for completion by 30 June 2019. At the latest specification, a validator would need a minimum of 32 ETH staked in order to participate in POS on Ethereum. The amount of ETH designated as rewards for staking will depend on the total number of validators in the system. Though exact figures are still unconfirmed, resources are available to estimate how much return can be expected by staking a certain amount of ETH . Staking Rewards – ETH validating Adjustable calculators can be used to view interest rates and returns depending on different things like total staked and supply. Since the final release of Ethereum 2.0 is still probably at least a year away, many of these parameters will likely continue to change. The Future of POS The environmental impact and cost of POW have meant that POS is becoming the preferred consensus protocol for both new and existing blockchain networks. By allowing coin holders to participate in maintaining the network and incentivizing them with rewards in the form of native tokens, POS is a simple way to earn money without selling your crypto assets. Future POS – Source: Shutterstock.com As POS becomes more well-known and popular, we will also likely see a rise in staking services that will offer easy user experience and handle all the intricacies and work of staking for the user while sharing the rewards for a small fee.

42409583,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLC2I,1697021250,U.S. State Regulators Intervene in Coinbase’s Unregistered Securities Case,"Coinbase is fighting a potentially existential case from federal regulators who argue it operated an unregistered securities exchange.  Three new legal filings lend support to the SEC case, arguing it has the power to take on crypto.  Coinbase’s legal fight over the status of crypto met a new hurdle Tuesday, as U.S. state authorities and legal experts joined a campaign by federal securities regulators to argue the company unlawfully operated an unregistered exchange.  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s action against one of the country’s biggest crypto exchanges has been seen as existential for the future of crypto, with the sector accusing the agency of regulating by enforcement in the absence of new laws from the U.S. Congress.  Now, three new amicus briefs, which allow parties who are interested but not directly affected by the case to aid the court’s reasoning, argue crypto is neither significant nor special, and that the SEC can take on digital assets under existing law.  While Coinbase has sought to argue the SEC is exceeding its powers, the regulator’s legal position is neither novel nor remarkable, argued the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).  “The SEC’s theory in this case is consistent with the agency’s longstanding public position” and “well within the bounds of established law,” said the filing by NASAA, a century-old body whose 68 members include securities regulators from all 50 U.S. states, adding that digital assets shouldn’t get special treatment.  “There is no practical economic use case identified or widely adopted for the vast majority of digital assets, other than speculation,” the filing said. “While they receive outsized attention from the media and regulators because they are aggressively marketed and fertile ground for fraud, that attention belies the very limited size and significance of this ‘industry’ in the context of the broader U.S. economy.”  A further brief filed by two academic administrative lawyers argued Coinbase was misguided in invoking a legal doctrine that prevents government agencies from making economically significant interventions without clear congressional authority.  “The major questions doctrine simply is irrelevant to this action,” because the Coinbase case concerns enforcement against a particular company rather than quasi-legislative rulemaking, said the filing by Todd Phillips of Georgia State University and Beau Baumann of Yale Law School. “Far from asserting new power to regulate the ‘national economy,’ the SEC brought a specific complaint in federal court.”  The Supreme Court recently broadened the major questions doctrine when it struck down President Joe Biden’s cancellation of student debt – but deploying it for crypto would be “absurd,” creating a different definition of securities for cases brought by private litigants rather than government agencies, the pair said.  Those pro-government filings were buttressed by the New Finance Institute, a public benefit corporation that operates two blogs on finance and financial empowerment, and which argued Congress intended investor protection measures to have a scope broader than merely capital-raising transactions.  “The purchasing of crypto tokens should not be characterized as investments due to the lack of cash flow generation (a long-established prerequisite for any true investment),” the NFI filing said. “Such purchases are still investment contracts, however, because the buying public is denied the full and fair disclosure that they are not investing.”  The SEC earlier this year took cases against a number of crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance and Bittrex, arguing the native coins for blockchains such as Solana [SOL], Cardano [ADA], Polygon [MATIC] resembled conventional financial instruments.  Those have been flanked by state actions from the likes of Alabama, California and New Jersey. Coinbase has sought to have the federal case tossed, arguing crypto lies outside of the SEC’s jurisdiction.",NEGATIVE,ADA | MATIC | SOL,ADA | EXCHANGE | MATIC | REGULATION | SOL,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/11/us-state-regulators-intervene-in-coinbases-unregistered-securities-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe2b42d4ad0257a42ab52d39e8c7168e7112c703-794x447.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traditional investors tend to use a technology investing framework when analyzing bitcoin, which leads them to the wrong conclusion that the cryptocurrency “as a first-mover technology, will easily be supplanted by a superior one or have lower returns,” analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote.  However, “bitcoin’s first technological breakthrough was not as a superior payment technology, but as a superior form of money,” the authors wrote.  “Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset,” the report said, and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to improve on BTC as a monetary good because it is the most “secure, decentralized, sound digital money.”  The success of the Bitcoin network is not mutually exclusive with the success of other networks, the report argued, as the rest of the digital asset ecosystem can service different needs or solve other problems that bitcoin can’t.  According to the report, the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s return profile is driven by two powerful tailwinds: “global growth of the broader digital asset ecosystem and the potential instability of traditional macroeconomic conditions.”  “Bitcoin should be considered first and separate from all other digital assets that have followed it,” and it should be viewed as an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to the sector, the report added.

18646103,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554930,1697018418,"XRP Price Retest: A Prelude To A Stunning Surge To $2, Predicts Expert","Renowned crypto analyst Egrag delivered a fresh and in-depth XRP price analysis across multiple timeframes today. As of press time, the cryptocurrency stands at $0.4825, marking a decrease of about 12% since October 3, when it reached a high of $0.5478. Despite the bearish momentum fueled by the broader crypto market trend, Egrag projects bullishness on higher time frames. Monthly Chart XRP/USD On the monthly XRP/USD chart, Egrag took to Twitter to share his insights, stating: “XRP Monthly Bullish Pennant – Super Bullish Sign: Do you spot the pattern like I do? It’s incredibly bullish!” According to Egrag, trading on a monthly time frame reduces the chance of false signals. He believes that a strong flagpole hints at a rapid price increase, and the ongoing consolidation phase forms the pennant. The current pause in the uptrend could potentially lead to further upward movement, especially if there’s a surge in volume after a breakout. For this scenario to occur, XRP shouldn’t break out to the downside, but stay within the two approximating lines until the breakout north. Related Reading: XRP Price Gearing Up For Rebound As Whales Make Their Move By measuring the flagpole’s height, Egrag anticipates that XRP could potentially surge above $24 (on a longer time scale) if it manages to break out of the bullish pennant pattern. Weekly Chart For the weekly chart, Egrag commented, “It’s evident that XRP is currently undergoing a retest phase following its recent breakout.” This sentiment is anchored in the aftermath of the Ripple Labs case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, where the price broke out of a longstanding trend channel. However, the continued bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market, along with macro-economic pressures halted XRP’s momentum. Egrag points out the importance of the price range between $0.48 to $0.43, suggesting that maintaining above this line is critical. A breach could lead the cryptocurrency to retest the foundational zone between $0.25939 and $0.32630, which has shown robust support since 2017. Related Reading: XRP Is A Better Buy Now Than H1 2023: What’s Keeping Prices Low? Nevertheless, if the altcoin successfully retests and stays above the trendline, Egrag envisions a potential retest of the key resistance at $0.58304. Surpassing this would pave the way for an impressive rally, potentially reaching $2. According to him, XRP would thus penetrate the next higher “steel foundation”, the area between $1.6188 and $2. 1-Day Chart For the daily XRP/USD chart, Egrag’s message was concise: “XRP Army: Don’t miss the forest for the trees.” His analysis for this timeframe focuses on the “wicking” range of $0.3875 to $0.4719, which he sees as the possible dip range if the broader market pressure persists. Only a drop below $0.3875 would negate the bullish pattern. If the cryptocurrency maintains between $0.4719 and $0.5119, Egrag sees no cause for alarm. But for a bullish narrative to play out, the token needs to push beyond $0.5119, aiming for the $0.5738 mark, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Egrag emphasizes that breaching this level is crucial for a broader rally, targeting the 1,618 Fibonacci extension at $1.4694. At press time, the XRP price fell below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and was trading at $0.4856, representing a loss of 3.3% in the last 24 hours.

42409578,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcLBf9,1697018400,"Caroline Ellison Was CEO but Sam Bankman-Fried Was Still Boss of Alameda, Her Testimony Suggests","“He’s wearing a suit.”  So began the testimony of Caroline Ellison, the former business, romantic – and by her estimation, criminal – partner of Sam Bankman-Fried, whom she identified upon prosecutors’ request – albeit in the vaguest of ways.  This bespectacled crypto trader’s unexpected laugh line kicked off perhaps the most lurid testimony yet of the FTX crypto fraud trial. Caroline had found herself deeply involved in many of the allegedly criminal decisions she and Sam made – decisions that ultimately deleted billions of dollars of exchange customers’ wealth. Now, nearly one year after FTX’s collapse, Caroline once again has found herself deeply involved in what’s happening.  Thing is, she couldn’t find Sam.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  For maybe 30 seconds Caroline searched the courtroom for her former paramour. Leaner and sheared, he likely looked different to his longtime colleague-turned-government witness (After all, they probably haven’t seen each other in person since last November.) But Sam was doing her no favors. When prosecutors asked their other witnesses to point Sam out in the courtroom, he sat up straight, tall and high, as if to say ‘I’m over here.’ Not so on Tuesday: Sam stayed low in his chair and stiller than usual until his ex-girlfriend picked him out. Even Bankman-Fried’s parents – whose pained expressions have become a typical feature of the courtroom’s viewing gallery – couldn’t help but to chuckle once she finally identified their son.  The specter of their rocky relationship looms over this trial. Sam, the CEO of FTX, years ago picked Caroline, whom he met during his Wall Street days, to help run his crypto hedge fund Alameda in 2021 (where she began working in 2018). At the time they weren’t dating – they were on a break – but they would again, infusing into their massive financial decisions an imbalanced power dynamic that would make any HR department short-circuit. Their affair is the fluttering strand of subway bathroom toilet paper stuck to their heels. THEY can’t shake it off. YOU can’t look away.  Caroline Ellison would very much like us to look away. She showed up at Manhattan federal court at 9:37 AM Tuesday morning hidden beneath a baseball cap and big shades, attempting to escape the inevitable paparazzi crush that had come to her premiere. Caroline’s relationship with Sam has been talked up in books, exploited in the press. What did she know about the money she says she helped steal?  The answer is quite a lot. In the first day of what’s sure to be a lengthy testimony, Caroline gave the jury a methodical tour of the crypto loans that felled Alameda, FTX and the exchange’s customers, investors and lenders. By her account, it was all about appearances. She discussed the highly illiquid “Sam coins” that made Alameda’s balance sheet look robust to major lenders, including Genesis (a subsidiary of CoinDesk owner Digital Currency Group), which subsequently loaned the hedge fund billions of dollars secured by soon-to-be-toxic collateral: FTX’s own cryptocurrency, FTT.  According to the org sheets, Caroline was ultimately in charge of Alameda. But again, that appearance was more of an artifice, she said. Sam, who owned 90% of the company, had anointed her co-CEO because “he thought it was important to separate Alameda and FTX more optically.” In reality, he retained ultimate leverage over his lover and subordinate. Caroline’s pay remained the same even though she had become CEO of a massive trading operation. And her power was not commensurate with that of a true chief executive.  Through all of this ran Sam and Caroline’s relationship. There, too, their power dynamic was off-kilter. She ultimately broke it off after two rounds because, she said, he ignored her emotionally. “We agreed to keep it a secret” from the rest of the crypto empire’s employees the first time, Caroline said, as if to underscore this “agreement” was mutual. Her follow-up statement revealed it was almost certainly not: “Sam agreed we could make it public” the second time around.  In business, too, Sam seemed to discredit her. When Caroline warned Sam that there was a high likelihood Alameda’s tangled lending practices would lead to an implosion unless they changed the terms of their loans in late 2021, he went ahead with a massive set of venture investments that only further imperiled the operation.  Through all of this testimony, the gallery was quieter than usual.  We’re only at the start of Caroline’s blockbuster look into Alameda’s downfall. The coming days – and the cross-examination – could provide a turning point before the week is out.  Courtroom scenes  Early on in her testimony, Ellison told the jury that Bankman-Fried once said to her that he estimated his odds of becoming president of the United States at 5%. Whether those odds have changed in light of recent events, Ellison did not specify, but her statement elicited muted laughter from the courtroom’s viewing gallery.  Those present to view Ellison’s testimony needed to show up in person – and early. Scoring a spot in the packed courtroom meant queuing outside of the courthouse in New York’s Financial District as early as 4:30 a.m. Tuesday morning. By the time the court opened its doors at 8:00 AM, the line had grown into a motley crew of journalists, self-avowed crypto degens, lawyers, PR professionals and assorted citizens curious to catch a glimpse of Ellison – whose on-and-off relationship with Bankman-Fried has become tabloid fodder in the months since FTX and Alameda collapsed last year.  The FTX-Alameda corporate intrigue even attracted a handful of effective altruists – members of the practical giving community upon which Bankman-Fried, Ellison, and other top FTX-world executives were dedicated adherents. One of the effective altruists who showed up to view Ellison’s testimony said he was a fan of her effective-altruism-focused Tumblr blog, which she wrote under a pseudonym, long before she earned infamy for her role in a massive corporate scandal.  Only the first 20 of the dozens lined up would earn a spot in the court, which was not photographed or televised beyond an internal closed circuit television.  Among those in and around the courtroom Tuesday afternoon were teen-heartthrob-turned-crypto-critic Ben McKenzie, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams and YouTube crime buster CoffeeZilla.  Defense attorney Christian Everdell had a stronger opening round of questioning on Tuesday than he’s had in the first week of the trial, with fewer interruptions from the prosecution and reprimands from Judge Lewis Kaplan, at least for the first hour of his cross-examination of FTX co-founder and former Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang.  The judge also engaged in a somewhat longer question-and-answer session with Wang than he’s done with witnesses so far, asking why the former FTX executive had signed off on loan documents worth tens of millions of dollars, particularly when it appeared the funds were then spent by Bankman-Fried.  “Sam mentioned something about not wanting this to come directly – or something about it being an FTX investment but didn't want the money to come from Alameda. I wasn't entirely clear on what the explanation was,” Wang said.  What we're expecting  Prosecutors told the court at the end of Tuesday’s session that they expect Caroline Ellison’s testimony to go through all of Wednesday. After she concludes direct questions and cross-examination, the DOJ expects to call up BlockFi’s Zac Prince and former Alameda software developer Christian Drappi, an assistant U.S. attorney said.  The names suggest the DOJ will continue with its current trend of alternating between witnesses who were financially or otherwise affected by FTX’s collapse and those who were in a position to know more about FTX and Alameda and their internal operations.  Prosecutors now expect to rest their case within four weeks or so – ending as soon as Oct. 27. The defense – assuming it puts on a case – still expects to take another week and a half after that, suggesting the trial could end as soon as Nov. 9 (court will be out of session on Nov. 10, Veteran’s Day in the U.S.).  Jury deliberations after that will likely take some time to conclude.  There are a number of other outstanding motions that Judge Lewis Kaplan must consider through the trial. The prosecution is still hoping to call an unnamed Ukrainian witness to the stand to testify about how he lost his funds as an FTX customer. The judge wants confirmation that this witness will provide some unique insight, and suggested that the DOJ “better consider alternatives.” An assistant U.S. attorney said he’d get back by the end of the week.  Bankman-Fried’s attorneys also have an outstanding motion asking for clarity on how and to what extent they can discuss issues like the defendant’s charitable giving.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Danny Nelson, Sam Kessler, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/11/ellison-was-ceo-but-sbf-was-still-boss-at-alameda-her-testimony-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JPMorgan’s Ethereum-based Onyx blockchain and the bank’s Tokenized Collateral Network (TCN) was used by BlackRock to tokenize shares in one of its money market funds.

Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies 6 Overlooked Altcoins That Could Be Due For A Price Surge However, any affection or feelings that she may have had for the defendant didn’t seem to hinder her as she lived up to the hype as the prosecution’s star witness, providing key insights into how Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly misappropriated FTX’s customers’ funds through Alameda which she headed before its collapse. During her testimony, she admitted that she had committed fraud alongside the defendant. Specifically, she stated that Sam Bankman-Fried directed her to commit these crimes. As to her involvement, she collaborated Wang’s testimony while stating Alameda (and her, by extension) took “several billions of dollars” from FTX customers and used these monies for investments. Meanwhile, Ellison confirmed that Sam Bankman-Fried was the one who set up the systems and directed the trading firm to take the money. Besides using FTX’s customers’ funds for investments, Alameda also took around $14 million to repay its lenders. She also manipulated Alameda’s balance sheets, making the firm look risky to potential lenders. FTT Token continues downtrend following Ellison's testimony | Source: FTTUSDT on Tradingview.com Prosecution Uses Ellison To Drive Home Major Allegations In its opening statement, the Prosecution alleged that Sam Bankman-Fried diverted customers’ fiat deposits to a bank account linked to Alameda, which Ellison confirmed on the stand. She stated that FTX received money into Alameda’s bank accounts between 2021 and 2022. The total sum deposited was between 10-20 billion dollars. Alameda used some of these deposits to repay loans, investments, and stablecoin conversions like USDC. According to her, this summed up to about $2 billion. It didn’t stop there, though, as the trading firm used the other money for other Alameda-related purposes. Sam Bankman-Fried and his lawyers have, at different times, tried to lay a foundation that SBF wasn’t in charge of Alameda and didn’t know what was going on at the trading firm after he stepped down as the CEO. Related Reading: XRP Price Gearing Up For Rebound As Whales Make Their Move However, Ellison rebutted this on the stand as she stated that things didn’t change much, even when she became the co-CEO alongside Sam Trabucco, as she checked everything with Sam Bankman-Fried and directly reported to him. He also had the power to fire her. Wire fraud on lenders to Alameda Research and conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders to Alameda Research is part of the seven charges brought against SBF. As such, Ellison’s testimony is deemed critical (as someone with first-hand knowledge) in the prosecution’s bid to prove these crimes beyond reasonable doubt.

Earlier this week, traders told CoinDesk they expected prices to move lower as investors shy away from traditional equities and risk assets in favor of gold and oil – whose prices have gained as much as 6% in the past week.  Crypto markets slumped over 1.6% in the past 24 hours, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based guage for tracking hundreds of tokens, shows. Ether fell 2.2% to extend weekly losses to over 5%, while XRP tokens led a decline in alternative currencies with a 3% drop.  Among other major tokens, Polkadot’s DOT and Polygon’s MATIC slumped 3%, while Tezos’s XTZ dropped 8%. Render network’s RNDR was the only gainer among large-cap tokens with a 3% gain in the past 24 hours.  FxPro market analysts said in a daily note that bitcoin’s attempt to break the $28,000 level last week triggered a “wave of selling that took the price back to $27,000,” with the profit taking suggesting investors were not keeping their money held up in risky bets just yet.  “Interestingly, the pressure on Bitcoin came when the risk appetite in traditional markets was recovering,” FxPro said, citing Tuesday’s gains in U.S. stocks. “We attribute this to Monday's US defaulted debt markets rather than the moving of money from one asset to another.”",NEGATIVE,DOT,BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/11/bitcoin-slips-to-27k-as-escalating-hamas-israel-conflict-dampens-investor-confidence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e506191a79fcca67e0e513acd4fdded76660c0ad-3117x2338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release, WOO agreed to cancel shares purchased by 3AC in 2021's Series A fundraise and repurchase 20 million WOO tokens, worth around $3.4 million at current prices. The tokens have been sent to a burn address or crypto wallet that cannot be accessed by anyone.  WOO raised $30 million in its Series A, although the amount of investment from Three Arrows Capital was undisclosed.  Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy in July 2021 following a leverage-fueled implosion that coincided with the collapse of the $60 billion Terra Luna ecosystem, to which the hedge fund had significant exposure.  ""We are pleased to clear the uncertainty related to 3AC from the WOO ecosystem. We proactively collaborated with the liquidators to secure a fair deal to repurchase our shares and both vested and vesting tokens from 3AC's estate. We are looking forward to executing our mission without further distractions from the 3AC fallout,” WOO co-founder Jack Tan said in a statement.

18639606,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554915,1697008397,Legendary Investor Declares Now Is The Time To Buy Bitcoin: Here’s Why,"In a recent interview with CNBC, billionaire hedge fund manager and legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones expounded on his bullish stance on Bitcoin amidst mounting global tensions and economic uncertainties. Jones, an influential figure in the investment world, highlighted the current geopolitical environment as one of the most “threatening and challenging” he has ever witnessed and emphasized the importance of diversifying investment portfolios with assets like Bitcoin and gold. Jones told CNBC, “I love gold and bitcoin together. I think they probably take on a larger percentage of your portfolio than they would [historically] because we’re going to go through both a challenging political time here in the United States and we’ve obviously got a geopolitical situation.” Now Is The Time To Buy Bitcoin And Gold Recent global events have exacerbated these sentiments. Over the weekend, the Israeli government launched a military response against Hamas following an attack on Israel, escalating tensions in an already fragile Middle Eastern region. Additionally, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine and growing discord between China and the US have further rattled global markets and economies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2023: Surges Past Stocks And Bonds With 63% YTD Growth In the same breath, Jones remarked on the US’s alarming fiscal position, stating it’s “probably in its weakest fiscal position since World War II.” Responding to concerns about the potential impact of high interest rates on Bitcoin, Jones delved deeper into the dynamics of gold and market trades preceding a recession. He stipulated, “I think on a relative basis what’s happened to gold, it has been clearly suppressed. But you know that more likely or not we are going into a recession.” Jones underscored a few hallmarks of recessionary trading environments, indicating, “There are some pretty clear recession trades. The easiest are: the yield curve gets very steep, home premium goes into the backend of the debt market and the 10-year, 30-year, 7-year paper, the stock market typically right before recession declines about 12%.” This decline, according to Jones, is not just plausible but likely to transpire at a certain juncture. Additionally, he emphasized the prospective bullish market for assets like Bitcoin and gold during economic downturns, stating, “And when you look at the big shorts in gold, more likely or not in a recession, the market is typically very long; assets like Bitcoin and gold.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Poised To Skyrocket As Endgame Of US Policy Nears: Analyst Jones further prognosticated a substantial influx into the gold market, speculating, “So there’s probably $40 billion worth of buying coming in gold at some point before now and when that recession actually occurs.” Expressing his asset preference amidst the aforementioned conditions, Jones concisely noted, “So, I like Bitcoin and I like gold right now.” Jones’s endorsement of Bitcoin isn’t new as the investor had previously championed the digital currency in several interviews, citing its potential as a hedge against inflation and lauding its immutable mathematical properties. He once remarked, “Bitcoin is math, and math has been around for thousands of years.” By mid-2021, Jones even increased his Bitcoin allocation from 1-2%, labeling it as a “bet on certainty amid uncertain economic conditions.” Jones’s remarks came at a time when the cryptocurrency saw an approximate 63% increase year to date, making it the best-performing asset in 2023. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,116, down roughly 2% over the past 24 hours. Amidst the recent price drop, BTC initially found support at the 200-day EMA (blue line), which the bulls should hold at all costs to avoid further downward momentum.

He hoped to continue Alameda as an investment firm and infrastructure developer, but claimed in the posts that Alameda won’t actively trade.  ""Going forward, Alameda will continue to not do nefarious trading activity on FTX, because it won’t do any trades on FTX. Or anywhere else,” he wrote at the time.  Bankman-Fried’s Alameda was once one of the most influential trading companies that provided billions of dollars in liquidity and investments to tokens and crypto firms. But it drew widespread rumors (which are now allegedly true) that it traded against FTX clients and had unfair advantages.  The house of cards finally fell after CoinDesk broke news about FTT, FTX’s own tokens, making up the majority of Alameda’s balance sheet. This meant investments were valued at more than their actual worth and that any borrowed money was effectively a bad loan.

That's because, according to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, Bitcoin cash saw the most improvement in market liquidity during the third quarter.  Liquidity refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy and sell orders at stable prices. The greater the liquidity or market depth, the lower the slippage – the difference between the price a trader expects to pay and the price they actually pay – and the easier it is for large traders to execute big orders.  Kaiko's liquidity rankings are based on market depth measures, bid-ask spreads, volumes from ""tradable"" exchanges. Overall, there has been a broad-based decline in market liquidity since Alameda Research went bust in November last year.  The chart shows bitcoin cash's market liquidity improved by over 10% since the second quarter, outshining other prominent altcoins and market leader bitcoin.  Bitcoin cash prices fell 23% to $234 in the third quarter, marking a pullback from the second quarter's 145% surge.

18632302,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554867,1696996834,History’s Warning: Is Ethereum Set For A Huge Plunge? Here Is What This Analyst Predicts,"Ethereum (ETH) has maintained its spot as a leading altcoin. However, a recent analysis from Benjamin Cowen indicates that its journey, at least in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC), could have followed a better trajectory. In a space where past trends can sometimes indicate future outcomes, ETH’s price behavior, when viewed against BTC, offers a tale of potential concern. Related Reading: Is Ethereum’s Staking Boom A Ticking Time Bomb? JPMorgan Weighs In Ethereum Stumbling Blocks In 2023 A leading voice in the crypto analytical community, Benjamin Cowen, expressed his lack of enthusiasm for ETH’s performance in 2023 during a YouTube video. The ETH / BTC valuation, a critical metric for gauging relative performance, is the bedrock for his statements. According to his observations from monthly charts, Cowen’s analysis primarily orbits around the ETH / Bitcoin valuation, which has trended downwards. The analyst cites patterns from 2019, a pre-halving year, where ETH’s value relative to BTC fell significantly. That year alone, the ETH / BTC valuation declined by about 49%. According to the analyst, fast forward to 2023, and ETH’s comparative valuation has already plummeted by 20.56%. If Cowen’s prediction and the patterns from 2019 hold any water, Ethereum could be staring down a deeper abyss. Yet, it’s not all bleak. Cowen remains measured, as he acknowledges the change the nature of “The Merge” brought on Ethereum’s ecosystem, believing it is a “game changer.” While Cowen wasn’t overly optimistic, the analyst refrained from forecasting ETH’s next moves, primarily due to the unpredictable ripple effects of The Merge. The Merge: A Game-Changing Variable? The Merge, a much-anticipated Ethereum upgrade, has already marked its influence on the ETH / BTC valuation. Ethereum’s weekly charts have been in a continuous downtrend following its implementation, creating further lows. Cowen recognizes that The Merge, with its deflationary component, could mean ETH might not toe its historical line. This deflationary aspect could be Ethereum’s wild card, making its trajectory even more elusive. Notably, while many parallels might be drawn between 2019 and 2023, such updates as The Merge means that Ethereum’s journey this year might still hold a few surprises.

18627596,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554890,1696989611,Bitcoin Dominates 2023: Surges Past Stocks And Bonds With 63% YTD Growth,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, continues to face challenges in reclaiming the $28,000 level amid rising US treasury yields, a stronger dollar, and geopolitical uncertainties. However, according to a report by the digital asset research firm Reflexivity, despite these obstacles, Bitcoin remains the standout performer among asset classes in 2023, with an impressive year-to-date (YTD) return of 63.3%. This exceptional performance has surpassed returns from US large-cap growth stocks (28%), US large-cap stocks (13%), bonds, commodities, and REITs, according to a report from New York-based Bitcoin investment firm NYDIG. ETH/BTC Ratio Reflects Risk Appetite And BTC’s Strength According to the firm’s latest analysis of the current state of the Bitcoin market, there is a notable importance in monitoring Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market capitalization. Market participants often view this metric as a risk gauge for the broader crypto market. Just as traditional markets experience cycles, with early stages marked by capital concentration in a select few high-quality assets that gradually disperse into riskier assets, the crypto market follows a similar pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Faces Crucial Test: Will $0.055 Withstand The Pressure? The cycle commences with capital concentrated in Bitcoin, then dispersion into Ethereum (ETH) and eventually other altcoins. The cycle concludes with capital flooding into high-risk assets, as witnessed in the memecoin frenzy of 2021. The report’s chart illustrates the rising dominance of Bitcoin, indicating a healthy concentration of capital into the leading asset. Bitcoin’s sustained dominance suggests that the crypto market is stable, with significant capital still flowing into Bitcoin. Alongside monitoring Bitcoin dominance, another key indicator of risk-taking behavior in the crypto market is the ETH/BTC ratio, which compares Bitcoin’s performance to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The chart demonstrates a downward trend in the ETH/BTC ratio since the Merge in September 2022, which, according to the report, both Bitcoin dominance and the ETH/BTC ratio will be crucial to watch for any potential shift from a Bitcoin-dominated market regime into higher-risk assets. Bitcoin Eyes Bullish Momentum After a two-month consolidation period between the $26,000 and $27,000 range, BTC finally experienced a surge of bullish momentum, breaking the pattern and climbing to the upside. However, the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory was halted as it encountered a formidable resistance wall in the mid-term, reaching $28,600 on October 2nd and facing a significant hurdle at $28,700. This resistance level poses one of the final challenges preventing BTC from revisiting the $30,000 mark, last seen in August. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles To Stay Above $0.26: What This Means For Traders Despite the setback, Bitcoin currently trades above its crucial 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), indicating the potential for another attempt to breach previously lost levels. Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely watching the $27,700 mark, as a successful break could signal the formation of a perfect ‘W’ pattern, with a target set at $28,100. On this matter, renowned crypto YouTuber and founder of Crypto Sea, known as ‘Crypto Rover,’ highlights the significance of the $27,700 level as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s next move. According to the analyst’s latest post on X (formerly Twitter), a successful breakthrough could reignite bullish sentiment and pave the way for a push toward the $28,100 target. BTC is trading at $27,300, experiencing a modest decline of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has recorded notable gains of 4.4% and 6% over fourteen and thirty days, respectively.

In a pair of filings Tuesday night, shortly after Ellison concluded her first day of testimony, attorneys made a set of motions requesting the authority to address these issues, noting that Judge Lewis Kaplan has previously asked for advance notification should the defense want to raise the ""advice-of-counsel"" argument.  Ellison ran Alameda, the crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried with close ties to his now-bankrupt FTX crypto exchange. She is his former paramour and the star witness in the criminal fraud case against him. On Tuesday, she testified that she was consulted on FTX's investment portfolio (though she said her advice was ignored).  In one filing, the defense said it wants to question Ellison about her knowledge of whatever role FTX and Alameda lawyers might have played in setting policies, such as activating auto-deletion tools on the messaging app Signal.  The Department of Justice has already asked the judge to block Bankman-Fried's defense team from raising the topic of the current valuation of FTX investments, reiterating this opposition in a filing this week addressing Anthropic AI specifically and saying it was immaterial to the question of whether Bankman-Fried misappropriated FTX customer funds for personal use. The artificial intelligence firm announced several fundraising efforts recently, raising hopes that FTX creditors may receive a larger payout should the bankrupt exchange sell its stake in the AI firm.  Read more: Star Witness Caroline Ellison Says Sam Bankman-Fried Directed Her to Commit Fraud  In the second filing, Bankman-Fried's team argued that the Anthropic news ""reflects ... important context"" about FTX's expected value analysis, and they should be able to ask broader questions about FTX's portfolio.  At the end of the court session on Tuesday, the attorneys and Judge Lewis Kaplan went back and forth over the question of whether these issues should be raised during the trial.  Ellison is also a personal investor in Anthropic, an assistant U.S. attorney said after the jury filed out.  ""This witness who's on the stand made a personal investment in Anthropic and has knowledge of the company's investment in Anthropic, and so in the event that the Court deems this admissible, it might be an issue that we want to raise with her,"" said the prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon. ""We don't think that this is a permissible topic of questioning, but if it is, we may want to ask her questions about it.""  Other outstanding issues include the question of whether the DOJ should be allowed to call a witness from Ukraine to testify remotely.  The judge said he did not want to allow any witness that would be providing cumulative testimony – meaning testimony that's just reinforcing other witnesses' – and, without making a ruling one way or another, suggested that the prosecutors ""better consider alternatives.""

18625325,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554874,1696986036,Ethereum Open Interest Rising: Is This A Signal Bulls Have Been Waiting For?,"Ethereum prices might be stagnant at spot rates, weaving around the $1,540 and $1,560 zone, looking at technical charts. However, amid this period of consolidation and holders worrying about Ethereum’s prospects, Kaiko notes that the coin’s open interest has been gradually rising since September 2023. Ethereum Open Interest Rising: What Does It Mean? As of October 10, Kaiko observes that there are more than 2.2 million contracts, and the number has been rising steadily over the past few trading weeks. With increasing open interest, it can hint that bulls are in the equation, which may support prices now that prices are under immense pressure. In crypto trading, open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts of a given coin. Meanwhile, derivatives are contracts that derive value from the underlying asset, in this case, Ethereum. Herein, the total open interest data is accrued from ETH options, futures, and perpetual futures from platforms where traders can use leverage. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles To Stay Above $0.26: What This Means For Traders There can be different interpretations of open interest depending on the market state. Since open interest includes long and short positions at any time, gauging the directions of how market participants are posting trades can be challenging. Even so, rising open interest indicates that more traders are opening positions, which can be seen as bullish, especially if prices are expanding. Conversely, falling open interest suggests that traders are exiting, which means waning momentum and bearish sentiment. ETH Consolidates Even After Ethereum Futures ETF Approval Based on this, Ethereum remains in a critical position and support. Notably, the coin is moving sideways with low trading volumes. From the daily chart, ETH is around the $1,500 and $1,550 primary support. Though buyers appear to be in control, since prices are boxed inside the June to July 2023 trade range, any break below the support zone may trigger more losses. The general optimism explaining rising open interest could be due to the recent approval of Ethereum Futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple Ethereum Futures ETFs for the first time. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Fell Toward $1,500 This decision saw Ethereum prices edge higher in early October. Though prices have since contracted, institutional investors can now find exposure in Ethereum via structured and regulated products approved by the stringent regulator. It is unclear whether the rising ETH open interest signals strength and if the coin will recover going forward. From the daily chart, ETH has strong liquidation at around the $1,750 level and remains consolidated.

18623037,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=554840,1696982400,Is Ethereum Doomed? Whales Have Sold 12M ETH In Past Year,"On-chain data shows Ethereum whales have sold around 12 million in the cryptocurrency within the past year and have shown no signs of slowing down. Ethereum Whale Holdings Have Been In Constant Downtrend Since 2020 In a new post on X, analyst James V. Straten has discussed how the Bitcoin and Ethereum whales have shown some stark contrast in their behavior. Here is the chart that the analyst has shared, which compares the trends in the holdings of these humongous holders for the two assets over their entire history: How the holdings of the whales differ between the two cryptocurrencies | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X For defining what a “whale” is, the analyst has chosen the 1,000 tokens cutoff for both assets. The graph shows that the holdings of the Bitcoin whales have been in an overall uptrend throughout the asset’s history. Some deviations have been from this upward trajectory, like during the 2021 bull run, where these investors participated in some profit-taking. However, such deviations have only been temporary as the whales have eventually resumed their accumulation.

Nonetheless, the whales have participated in some accumulation since the start of the year; more is needed to retrace the aforementioned plunge. The Bitcoin whales have seen their holdings move sideways in the past couple of years. The Ethereum whales, on the other hand, have participated in a steep selloff during the same period. Since 2020, these holders have shed 20 million ETH from their combined holdings, worth about $31.6 billion at the current exchange rate. In the past year alone, they have sold about 12 million ETH ($18.9 billion), an astonishing figure. As highlighted in the graph, the Ethereum whales showed a temporary deviation phase when they bought at the bear market lows. Nevertheless, this accumulation was quickly reversed as the indicator resumed a sharp plunge soon after. Something worth noting here is that the size of the whales isn’t the same between the two assets. Due to the difference in the prices of the coins, 1,000 tokens of each have vastly different weightages. Based on this cutoff, Bitcoin whales would hold at least $27.4 million worth of the asset, while the ETH whales hold just $1.58 million. A more fair comparison may be made by looking at the holdings of the ETH entities of comparable size to the BTC whales. As displayed in the chart below, the Ethereum whales with between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH ($15.8 million to $158 million) have shown accumulation over the years. Still, this cohort has also sold massive amounts this year. Looks like the value of the metric has sharply declined recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X However, the mega whales on the network ($158 million+) have shown behavior more in line with the aggregate 1,000+ ETH group, as they have distributed heavily since 2020. Related Reading: $29,700 Could Be The Next Big Level To Claim For Bitcoin, Here’s Why These whales have been selling for a few years now | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X Ethereum’s situation looks bleak, at least in terms of the holdings of the whales. The fact that these humongous holders have shown no signs of a turnaround so far may be the most concerning, as they lack interest in accumulating the asset. This differs greatly from the sentiment around the Bitcoin whales, who have been participating in net buying this year. ETH Price Ethereum has registered some decline recently, as the coin’s price is now retesting the same lows as back in August.
