42432732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Ph,1600806003,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Clings to $10.4K; Ether in Smart Contracts Highest Since 2016,"Bitcoin stuck around $10,400 for most of Tuesday. Meanwhile, ether holders are increasingly choosing smart contracts to park the cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,494 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.10% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,357-$10,532  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    After bitcoin prices fell sharply Monday, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency stayed near the $10,400 mark on spot exchanges such as Coinbase Tuesday.      “Bitcoin remains in pullback-mode after having seen an initial reaction to short-term oversold conditions that left strong support intact in the $10,000 area,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “The loss of momentum has been significant, but overbought conditions are no longer an issue and the intermediate-term uptrend that began in March still has a hold.”      Read More: Equity Markets Turmoil Could Push Bitcoin Below $10K, Say Analysts      Momentum has certainly slowed down since Monday, when massive selling and $34 million in derivatives liquidations on BitMEX led to a $507 million volume day on major spot exchanges. Tuesday did not even approach that level, and was at $210 million in spot volume as of 4 p.m. ET.      “We are at 50% of all-time-highs, which is a good area for future consolidation, but the perpetual funding rate for BTC is showing negative,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.      Like futures contracts, perpetual swaps allow traders to long or short a position, taking advantage of movements in a cryptocurrency’s price. The difference is there is no expiration date in the swap, hence the term “perpetual” and the requirement of a funding rate, which rolls over between long and short traders at eight hour increments. Essentially, short traders are paying those going long for exposure when the funding rate is negative.      “This signals there is a lot of indecision in the BTC market,” added Lau. “We could continue to see short term sell-offs and an overall more bearish outlook in the coming months.""      Michael Gord, CEO of cryptocurrency brokerage firm Global Digital Assets, has seen a shift in sentiment heading into a fourth quarter full of precariousness. “I think we’ve got to be close to the bottom,” Gord said. “Leading up to the U.S. election and debates, more institutional holders of bitcoin are preferring to hold cash and determine whether or not to re-enter afterwards.”    Ether supply in smart contracts at 2020 high    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday trading around $343 and slipping 0.44%% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount of ether parked in smart contracts is at its highest level since 2016, when investors plowed into The DAO, an early decentralized finance (DeFi) precursor. The percentage of ether supply in smart contracts is at 15.96%, the highest level since July 25 2016.      Brian Mosoff, CEO of investment firm Ether Capital, says this metric proves Ethereum’s ability to offer DeFi capabilities which its cryptocurrency competition simply does not provide.      Read More: What Is DeFi?      “The ETH in various DeFi contracts is probably an indicator that ETH holders want to continue to hold the asset but are looking for ways to generate yield,” said Mosoff. “This shows how ETH acts as a productive asset, contrasted with bitcoin, where it may be a great store of value but it lacks the productive yield layer that ETH does.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Tuesday, mostly in the green. Notable winners as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    tezos (XTZ) + 6.6%  0x (ZRX) + 3.3%  monero (XMR) + 2%    Notable losers as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT):    orchid (OXT) - 15.6%  chainlink (LINK) - 1.5%  xrp (XRP) - 0.77%    Read More: Uniswap Users Say Uniting Can Strengthen UNI      Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 is closed for holiday Tuesday.

42432726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Dh,1600799472,Supply of Tokenized Bitcoin on Ethereum Now Tops $1.1B: Here's Why,"To the surprise of many, bitcoin (BTC) has been a breakout star in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) moment. Taking the form of wrapped or tokenized bitcoin, the digital asset takes the best of both blockchains – bitcoin’s price value and brand along with Ethereum’s programmability – into one highly in-demand token.      Last week alone, the supply of BitGo’s wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) topped 76,000 after setting an all-time record of nearly 21,000 wrapped bitcoins minted within one week.      The week before held the previous record of over 12,200 tokens minted in a single week, according to Dune Analytics.      Overall, investors have made tokenized bitcoin one of the largest assets on DeFi with nearly 107,000 BTC worth some $1.1 billion minted from seven issuers, mostly lured in by high rates of return on lending when compared to other options such as BlockFi.    Why use tokenized bitcoin?    What bitcoin on Ethereum does is simple: It provides liquidity for growing decentralized exchanges (DEX), such as Uniswap. Bitcoin’s current market cap is five times larger than the second largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), according to The CoinDesk 20. That money can be put to use making more money.      Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks.      DeFi is considered vastly immature when compared to traditional or centralized exchange (CEX) markets. This can be seen in the large price spreads between orders on exchange books between different DeFi markets.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Price differences on markets can be exploited by traders in what is called arbitrage opportunities.      Wrapped bitcoin is often the asset of choice for investors seeking arbitrage. Bitcoin packs a large punch in terms of price value. More money on DeFi trading platforms makes the markets themselves stronger as additional buying and selling options are presented.      But tokenizing bitcoin isn’t without risks, particularly software risk. Investors who want exposure to bitcoin’s liquidity pay higher interest rates to cover the risk of losing an asset in addition to getting exposure to the first cryptocurrencies liquidity.      How this works in practice has taken on a few different forms.    Security of bitcoin investments    Different tokenizing models represent different security assumptions for investor funds.      For tokenized bitcoin, security boils down to the type of custodianship and if the investment is collateralized. Three major models exist: a centralized firm like BitGo; a smart contract system with collateral, such as tBTC; or a complete, synthetic-asset backing employed by sBTC.      BitGo’s Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is the breakout star of the last few months with some $808.5 million in circulation, according to Etherscan.      It’s centralized, meaning deposited bitcoin is held by BitGo. Parties wanting WBTC give BTC to BitGo and then receive an ERC-20 token-equivalent of BTC in return. That ERC-20 can then be sold on secondary markets or plugged into a DeFi application to earn yield.      Keep Network’s tBTC, which launched Tuesday, is similar to WBTC but replaces the centralized BitGo model with a network of nodes, wallets and smart contracts. This network aims at bringing more decentralization to BitGo’s process by allowing both parties – the bitcoin depositor and custodian – to interact trustlessly through software.      Read more: Bitcoin-on-Ethereum Token tBTC Relaunches Following Buggy Debut in May      A few features make this possible, such as the bitcoin depositors being able to choose who holds their bitcoin and a 150% security bond (held in ETH) pledged by the custodians on the off-chance they run to the hills with the deposits.      Ren’s rBTC that makes up about 20% of all wrapped bitcoin in the wild, according to Dune Analytics. It works in a similar manner to tBTC’s node network by having the Ren Virtual Machine, RenVM, act as a trustless agent between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.      Lastly, sBTC is an ERC-20 version of bitcoin. But this time it's backed by another token, the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). Each sBTC is not backed by BTC, but 800% of a BTC’s value in SNX, the token for minting synthetic assets (Syns) on the Synthetix DEX.    An example of how wrapped bitcoin works    Take a recent transaction from Alameda Research (sister firm of the trading platform FTX).      FTX allows users to swap between BTC and WBTC. When users swap bitcoin for wrapped bitcoin, FTX pulls from Alameda’s pool of BTC/WBTC. Users may send BTC to FTX (Alameda) and receive WBTC. When Alameda's pool of WBTC is exhausted, they replenish it directly with BitGo.      Read more: BitGo Weighs Building a Sidechain for WBTC as Ethereum Fees Climb      Alameda is a merchant and part of the WBTC decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning it can initiate mints for new WBTC using BTC. They send BTC to BitGo and create a minting request on the Ethereum chain as a merchant.      BitGo validates the BTC has been deposited to a preminted address and approves a mint of the number of WBTC equal to Alameda’s request. The WBTC can then be used on FTX or swapped with another token atomically (meaning via a peer-to-peer exchange) or even within a DeFi market.      To redeem, the process is reversed: The buyer will send the WBTC back to the merchant who will then provably burn the tokens.    The future of tokenized assets    The wild success of BitGo’s WBTC and WETH (wrapped ether) may lead to more constructions of other coin holdings. Ben Chan, CTO at WBTC co-creator BitGo, told Coindesk in August that the firm was looking at wrapping other cryptocurrencies.      WBTC’s 2020 success has largely been thanks to DeFi, he said.      “What we’ve seen this year is that WBTC traction has been largely thanks to the highly composable DeFi industry,” Chan said.

42432761,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Rh,1600797379,The Currency Cold War: Four Scenarios,"The year is 2030, and you need to buy some new sunglasses. You browse through your options online. You use augmented reality to try on a few pairs, you find one you like, and now it’s time to pay.    This piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.    You have 17 options for payment, including: the digital U.S. dollar (but you’d rather not support the U.S. government and President Ivanka Trump, so you decide against the USD), Facebook libra (but you have reservations about the new Facebook Brain Implant, so no thanks), bitcoin (yet you’d rather not part with your digital gold, as the price of BTC just hit $500,000), Sunglass Coin (the native currency of this sunglass website, which gives you a 10% discount), Parity Coin (a project that seeks to promote gender wage parity), Green Coin (a project that works to combat climate change), and on and on.      This sounds complicated but it isn’t, as your smart wallet instantly computes all of the exchange rates and it’s seamlessly connected to the sunglass vendor’s website.  Or maybe none of this happens. Maybe the currency of 2030 looks a lot like 2020. Or maybe you’re paying in digital Chinese renminbi.      The only thing we know for certain about the future of global currencies: There’s a ton of uncertainty, and many scenarios are in play. As fintech guru David Birch has framed it, the global powers are engaged in a “Currency Cold War,” with China and the United States vying for supremacy. China bolted to a head start with the government-backed DCEP project (Digital Currency/Electric Payment), but we now know the Federal Reserve is experimenting with a digital dollar. And then of course we have the wildcards of bitcoin, the potential juggernaut of Facebook’s libra and thousands of other current and future cryptocurrencies, all governed in novel ways and sometimes acting autonomously.      Which one will win?      And what would the outcome mean for the internet in 2030? We asked a handful of futurists to share some thoughts on a few scenarios, mostly in the name of a fun thought-experiment. The real world consequences are serious, though. “This is not just fun, it’s critically important,” says futurist Ross Dawson. “The world of money could change fundamentally in the next 10 years, and the implications could be massive. This is something we really need to be actively thinking about.”      There are an infinite amount of currency scenarios, but for everyone’s sanity, we’ll consider just four, loosely inspired by the cheeky “Red vs. Blue” framework Birch lays out in his book ""The Currency Cold War,"" with “Red” being a state-sponsored digital currency like China, and “Blue” being a cryptocurrency like Facebook’s libra (i.e., a private coin.)      The scenarios:      Scenario 1: The U.S. dollar wanes, but no one dominant currency emerges in its place. We have countless currencies to use for every transaction. (Birch calls this the “Rainbow Scenario.”)      Scenario 2: China’s digital currency gains dominance – the Red Scenario.      Scenario 3: “USA! USA!” The U.S. retains dominance with a digital dollar – The Green scenario.      Scenario 4: A non-government-backed cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin) gains dominance – the Blue Scenario.      A few obligatory disclaimers: The experts clarify that these are not hard predictions, but rather some possible scenarios that could unfold. (So don’t angrily @ them in 2030 if you can’t buy your beer with Guinness Coin.) Also, each futurist speaks only for him or herself, so the speculation of one should not be construed as the consensus of all.      So how will money impact the Internet 2030, and how did we get there?    The rainbow scenario    The U.S. dollar wanes, but no one dominant currency emerges in its place. We have countless currencies to use for every transaction.      Futurist Brett King, author of the book ""Bank 4.0,"" sees the conditions today that could give rise to a system of jumbled currencies. It starts with the protests and the polarization.      “We’ve had about a 1,000% increase in protests from 2000 to 2020,” King says. “You have the highest levels of inequality recorded in US history, and that’s very similar for economies like the U.K. and Australia.” He also notes a “clear disconnect between the stock market and the economy.”      How could people protest the inequality? How could people express their values, desire for change, and demands for social justice? Potentially through other currencies besides the U.S. dollar. “You might find people choosing cryptocurrencies — or mini-economies within the global economy – where people say, I’m going to make an ethical choice with this kind of currency, or this kind of platform,” says King. Other questions King suggests people might ask of their currencies:    Is this currency a net carbon neutral platform?  Does this currency fit within an ecosystem that is environmentally sustainable?  Is this currency committed to equality, and growth of the middle class?    Birch offers a darker twist. He conjures up a scenario where the many different currencies are splintered, yes, but also the “virtual world” has even greater prominence than today, and that people “withdraw into the virtual world, and begin to lose interest in the physical world.” (Again, he’s not predicting this scenario, and he considers himself an optimist, but he suggests this as one possible outcome).      Birch says that in this world, we’d see a “rise of gated communities in cyberspace, which work much better than gated communities in the real world.” (In gated communities in the real world, Birch dryly notes, you “need shotguns to keep people out,” but online you just need cryptography.)      The dominant currencies on the planet? “The currencies of the communities where I live,” says Birch. “I don’t care about the U.S. dollars anymore, because [in this scenario] I don’t pay taxes. I care about the Reddit Dollar. Or I care about the IBM dollar.” In this world, says Birch, “the nation state begins to crumble a little bit, and we find ourselves in a constant state of cyber war, where our loyalties are no longer national.”    The red scenario    China’s digital currency gains dominance      China is making moves. The nation’s global yuan payment network (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System) already has nearly 1,000 financial institutions, according to the Nikkei Asian Review’s Koji Okuda, and is making inroads in Africa, “due to China's economic clout in the region, especially with its Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative.” And as Ledger Insights reports, “Africa’s payments using China’s currency increased by 123% over three years” during June 2019.      That said, even as China continues to aggressively make inroads with both currency strength and the DCEP, most of the futurists agreed that it’s unlikely that China would gain true hegemony in the next decade, even if the nation continues to gain influence.      They broadly agreed with CoinDesk’s Michael Casey, who wrote in Money Reimagined newsletter, “To be clear, I see very little prospect of a digital renminbi becoming a dollar-like international store of value for central banks. Rather, the DCEP’s programmable qualities could render redundant the very need for a reserve currency intermediary in international transactions, allowing cross-border users to bypass the U.S. banking system.”      And even if China achieves hegemony, it’s entirely possible that the impact would be, on balance, a positive one. “I actually have a positive notion of what China would become,” says Professor Michael Sung, co-director of the Fintech Research Center at the Fanhai International School of Finance at Fudan University. He acknowledges the historical baggage of the Communist Party, but notes, “If you look at China, they went from real communists to a free market in the space of a decade. It went from the #1 polluter in the world to leading the Paris accord.”      Sung, a U.S. citizen, has hope that because China engages in constant experimentation and “micro-adjustments,” the nation does “care about the local population, because it legitimizes their ability to rule.” China is not there yet, but i“going to evolve into something like a Scandinavian, enlightened social democracy.” (Sung elaborates on his bullish thoughts on China’s blockchain projects in an op-ed for CoinDesk.)      Futurist Heather Vescent paints a darker picture. Vescent studies cyber-security and espionage, and is the co-author of ""Cyber Attack Survival Manual."" She points to a likely outcome in a world of Chinese currency hegemony: massively increased surveillance. “In Western countries, we have a split between government and the private sector. Not so in China, which is why Chinese espionage supports their private sector businesses.”      “Imagine if Apple was a Chinese company being run globally, with the Chinese views,” she says. “China’s not going to change their world view when they have products in the United States.” So how does this change the Internet 2030? “Well, you want to be afraid of surveillance?” A scenario of China hegemony would mean surveillance on steroids.      “It’s not just about the digital currency,” Vescent says. “It’s not just the power of the transaction. It’s the value behind that currency. A world in which the Chinese currency eclipses the U.S. currency is a world in which Chinese values eclipse U.S. values.” A world of Chinese currency hegemony, she explains, would be the result of other dramatic shifts in power. (Again, the futurists do not consider this likely.)      Oh, and here’s one final cheery possibility about the Dominant China scenario: Vescent says that if China has digital currency hegemony, that implies it has made massive strides in quantum tech, the next generation of computing. “We will figure out quantum computing, and that will break the blockchain,” says Vescent. “The only question is when it will happen, and by whom. So in this scenario – the Red scenario – assume that China breaks quantum first, and blockchains are no longer secure.”    Green scenario    “USA! USA!” The U.S. retains dominance with a digital dollar.      At first this sounds obvious: This scenario is like today. Done.      Not so fast. Brett King thinks that given all of the competition and headwinds the U.S. could face from the other scenarios (such as China competition), then if it retains its dominance in the next decade, then it must have done SOMETHING pretty impressive. ""How do you keep the U.S. relevant from a currency perspective?"" King asks, musing a bit."" He then imagines a scenario where the U.S. shows renewed dominance with growth in global infrastructure.      First he considers some basic possibilities: Maybe the U.S. creates advances in autonomous shipping, drone delivery, or supply chain tech.      Then he floats what he calls “a really out-there scenario”: climate change leadership. “In the process of all of this [coronavirus pandemic aftermath], climate change starts hitting, and you’ve got trillions and trillions of debt all around the world. Right? So the U.S. goes to the United Nations and says, ‘We believe that all national debt should be forgiven, but that national debt must be committed to climate mitigation over the next 50 years.’ And it will be monitored by the global community.”      King continues, on a roll. “Suddenly, now you’ve got trillions of dollars of capital that can go towards greening the planet, energy efficiency, and all these sorts of things. So the U.S. is heavily incentivized to go into the Sahara, and build massive solar farms that can supply all of Europe. As an example. But something like that would make the U.S. increasingly relevant in the system.”    Blue scenario    A non-government-backed cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin) gains dominance      What would the internet look like if a private (non-government regulated) currency emerged as dominant? “If you could pay anybody anywhere in the world, instantly and for free, we wouldn’t be so dependent on the advertising model of internet content,” says Birch. Micropayments (such as Brave) might finally emerge from niche to widespread.      “If I can pay 25 cents to read the thing I want to read on The New York Times – I don’t have to subscribe to it and use credit cards – they don’t have to show me disgusting adverts for ear wax, so that’s kind of a win-win,” says Birch. Then again, he acknowledges that this is class-based, as “the rich can buy themselves out of this cesspit.”      Birch also highlights the optimist possibilities, as “If you could do business with anyone in the world, hopefully, new products and services would spring up, to facilitate that trade and interaction.”      International uncertainty may drive cryptocurrency usage. “If we have a stable geopolitical structure, where most people and most nations feel secure, then that will not encourage a large rise of non-government digital currencies,” reasons futurist Ross Dawson.      “Whereas if we have a deep social division and disruption – and civil wars in developed countries in the next decade, that’s very plausible, depending on how you define ‘civil war’ – this will fracture societies and trust in government, and could lead to wholesale shifts to cryptocurrencies.”      With apologies to the crypto super-bulls, this is not necessarily the Lambo Scenario or Moon Scenario. Dawson imagines a potential world of “dueling economies” – even within the United States – if a cryptocurrency emerges dominant. One will be the official legal economy that’s regulated by the U.S. government (like today), and the other an unregulated “shadow economy” that’s dominated by the cryptocurrency.      “There will always be national currencies,” says Dawson. “We’re never going to have a time when the government says, “Okay, we give up, we’re not going to do this anymore.” (He later clarifies that maybe “never” is too strong of a word, but certainly not in the next decade.)      So the question is what’s the balance between the shadow economy and the regulated economy? He points to Italy’s shadow economy as an example, which by some estimates is more than 12% of the nation’s GDP – largely the result of tax evasion.      At least in this scenario, bitcoin (or some other cryptocurrency) is finally not just a Store of Value or a speculative investment. It could be widely used to buy a cup of coffee, pay your rent, or, yes, to buy your pair of sunglasses.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/22/the-currency-cold-war-four-scenarios,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50ca25f615c8870855ea55551699f504ff029a01-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Nh,1600797142,Bitcoin Traders Say Options Market Understates Likelihood of Chaotic US Election,"The November U.S. presidential election could be contentious, yet the bitcoin market is pricing little event risk. Analysts, however, warn against reading too much into the complacency suggested by the volatility metrics.      Bitcoin's three-month implied volatility, which captures the Nov. 3 election, fell to a two-month low of 60% (in annualized terms) over the weekend, having peaked at 80% in August, according to data source Skew. Implied volatility indicates the market's expectation of how volatile an asset will be over a specific period.      The one- and six-month implied volatility metrics have also come off sharply over the past few weeks.      The declining price volatility expectations in the bitcoin market cut against growing fears in traditional markets that the U.S. election's outcome may not be decided for weeks. Traditional markets are pricing a pickup in the S&P 500 volatility on election day and expect it to remain elevated in the event's aftermath.      ""Implied volatility jumps around election day, pricing an S&P 500 move of nearly 3%, and the term structure remains elevated well into early 2021,"" analysts at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs recently said.      One possible reason for the decline in bitcoin’s volatility expectations ahead of the U.S. elections could be the leading cryptocurrency’s status as a global asset, said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR. That makes it less sensitive to country-specific events.      ""The U.S. elections will have relatively less impact on bitcoin compared to the U.S. equities,"" said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR.    Implied volatility distorted by option selling    Crypto traders have not been buying the longer duration hedges (puts and calls) that would push implied volatility higher. In fact, it seems the opposite has happened recently. ""In bitcoin, there has been more call selling from overwriting strategies,"" Rosenblum said.      Call overwriting involves selling a call option against a long position in the spot market, where the strike price of the call option is typically higher than the current spot price of the asset. The premium received by selling insurance (or call) against a bullish move is the trader's additional income. The risk is that traders could face losses in the event of a sell-off.      Selling options puts downward pressure on the implied volatility, and traders have recently had a strong incentive to sell options and collect premiums.      ""Realized volatility has declined, and traders holding long option positions have been bleeding. And to stop the bleeding, the only option is to sell,"" according to a tweet Monday by user @JSterz, self-identified as a cryptocurrency trader who buys and sells bitcoin options.      Bitcoin's 10-day realized volatility, a measure of actual movement that has occurred in the past, recently collapsed from 87% to 28%, as per data provided by Skew. That's because bitcoin has been restricted mostly to a range of $10,000 to $11,000 over the past two weeks.      A low-volatility price consolidation erodes options' value. As such, big traders who took long positions following Sept. 4's double-digit price drop may have sold options to recover losses.      In other words, the implied volatility looks to have been distorted by hedging activity and doesn't give an accurate picture of what the market really expects with price volatility.      Moreover, despite the explosive growth in derivatives this year, the size of the bitcoin options market is still quite small. On Monday, Deribit and other exchanges traded roughly $180 million worth of options contracts. That's just 0.8% of the spot market volume of $21.6 billion.    Activity concentrated at the front-month contracts    The activity in bitcoin's options market is primarily concentrated in front-month (September expiry) contracts.      Over 87,000 options worth more than $1 billion are set to expire this week. The second-highest open interest (open positions) of 32,600 contracts is seen in December expiry options.      With so much positioning centered around the front end, the longer-duration implied volatility metrics again look unreliable. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, expects re-pricing the U.S. election risk to happen following this week's options expiry.    Spike in volatility does not imply a price drop    A re-pricing of event risk may happen next week, said Vinokourov. Still, traders are warned against interpreting a potential spike in implied volatility as an advance indicator of an impending price drop as it often does with, say, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) and the S&P 500. That's because, historically, bitcoins' implied volatility has risen during both uptrends and downtrends.      The metric rose from 50% to 130% during the second quarter of 2019, when bitcoin rallied from $4,000 to $13,880. Meanwhile, a more significant surge from 55% to 184% was observed during the March crash.      Since that massive sell-off in March, the cryptocurrency has matured as a macro asset and could continue to track volatility in the stock markets and U.S. dollar in the run-up to and post U.S. elections.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/22/bitcoin-traders-say-options-market-understates-likelihood-of-chaotic-us-election,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/061dbbd87c20d14432d7c8410576b8d5d3c8ddb3-2560x1798.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elsewhere, tech legend and part-owner of the Golden State Warriors, Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital invested in bitcoin (BTC) in 2013, when it was trading around $10. Palihapitiya disclosed the holdings in an investment call as he mulls taking the fund public. The exact amount of bitcoin Social Capital has bought and sold is unknown.      National security? The United States Space Force (USSF), the newest branch of the U.S. military, is looking to blockchain to render its computer systems, on earth and in space, unhackable. Xage Security, which is currently working with the U.S. Air Force, won a contract for a data-encryption system. Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) launched a new R&D laboratory on Monday to study blockchain technology, along with wireless telecommunications, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.      MicroStrategy effect Coming on the heels of publicly-traded MicroStrategy’s multi-million dollar investment into BTC, financial services firm Unchained Capital has released an “advanced business account” for firms that want to hold bitcoin and handle their own private keys. “We have companies that you wouldn’t expect, like your local bakery or your local liquor store that hold bitcoin in treasury,” Parker Lewis, Unchained’s head of business development, told CoinDesk. “They are not Bitcoin-centric businesses, but they hold bitcoin and they hold their own keys; both small and large, like the MicroStrategies of this world.”      UNI unity A group of anonymous Uniswap users is trying to unite the many small holders of the UNI governance token to deal with potential problems in the automated market maker’s (AMM) governance, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reports.

The idea is to create a faction of UNII token holders to counter the power from the founding team and investors, who still hold an outsized amount of control over the decentralized protocol despite a governance token distribution, the group alleges. “We are all minions in terms of voting power,” according to a pre-launched page by the anonymous group.

Acting OCC Comptroller Brian Brookes said that stablecoin services are responsible for “billions of dollars each day” flowing through the financial plumbing.      The statements are also the first indication that certain stablecoins might not be securities under federal law.      Meanwhile, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said the supranational bank is looking into the benefits and risks of a bloc-wide digital currency.      Rather than as a replacement for cash, a digital euro would ""complement"" traditional money and provide an alternative to ""private digital currencies"" for EU citizens. This, she told the EU Parliament on Monday, would ""ensure that sovereign money remains at the core of European payment systems.""      The comments come a month after Lagarde said Europe is losing ground in payments innovation and signals a continued skeptical line over private “stablecoins” like Libra.      Elsewhere, ECB officials wrote the term stablecoin is “misleading,” adding the term “should be replaced by a choice of terminology to shift the emphasis away from the issuer’s promise of stability.”    Market intel    Follow the leader Bitcoin (BTC) is once again taking cues from the stock markets and prices may fall below $10,000 if equities see further sell-off, according to analysts. The top cryptocurrency fell by 4.5% on Monday to register its biggest single-day decline since Sept. 4. That came as global stock markets nursed sharp losses and the safe-haven U.S. dollar gained ground on renewed coronavirus fears and uncertainty over the 2020 U.S. election.

Launched in 2014, the Boston-based firm has a staff of 11 and has raised over $9 million to date.  CEO David Vorick said there are more than 100 applications and 10 web portals already using Skynet as a decentralized storage alternative, including the popular exchange Uniswap. Skynet launched in February 2020.  “It’s just another means of accessing Uniswap, if Infura goes down people can still access the interface,” Vorick said, referencing Ethereum-friendly infrastructure options. “This offers the ability for anyone to run their own portal and get full trustless access to the network. If we turn off all our infrastructure tomorrow, Skynet still exists.”  Paradigm partner Dan Robinson said in a press statement he’s keen to see decentralized storage lead to social networking without distinct silos, like YouTube and Twitter, adding, “The project has enabled a growing ecosystem of builders to quickly prototype censorship-resistant applications and interactive websites.”  In reference to the Skynet app store that popped up following rumors that TikTok might get delisted from popular app stores, Vorick said, “This is a third-party app that comes from the community. … Quick responses to things like TikTok being banned don’t need to ask us for permission.”  This rebrand comes nearly one year after the startup reached a $225,000 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an unregistered token sale in 2014. Skynet users now rely on Siacoin tokens if they run a full Sia node.

Called tBTC, the Thesis-built protocol was first announced in April, and is now ready for a fresh start. BTC holders who want to use Ethereum but worry about censorship risk with BitGo's WBTC are invited to deposit BTC and mint TBTC tokens.      Putting bitcoin on Ethereum gives the godfather cryptocurrency access to the yields of decentralized finance (DeFi) and has taken off in earnest since tBTC's aborted launch. Over $1 billion in bitcoin is now tokenized on Ethereum.      According to Thesis strategy lead Carolyn Reckhow, tBTC already had $24.21 million staked as of early Tuesday morning ($22.69 million is in KEEP, $1.39 million in ETH and $0.26 million in BTC).      The tBTC protocol works on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with users locking up BTC on Bitcoin so that nodes in the Keep network can mint TBTC, staking 150% of the BTC's value in ETH.      The Keep nodes control the multisig that can re-release the BTC if a TBTC token is redeemed. The tBTC protocol has been audited by ConsenSys Diligence and Trail of Bits, Reckhow said.      For additional security, the smart contract also is posting 1 million KEEP for insurance from Nexus Mutual, which Thesis estimates should be worth 200-1,200 BTC in coverage.      “A decentralized version of tokenized bitcoin is key to catalyzing the next stage of growth in DeFi,"" Scalar Capital's Linda Xie said in a press release.

BSX announced last week the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF had been admitted to list on its trading platform.  The ETF is the brainchild of Hashdex, a Brazilian-based fund manager that has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since 2018.  An ETF is a basket of different assets bundled together and traded as a single traditional instrument. The development of such a product for crypto is considered bullish as it makes the asset class more accessible to mainstream investors.  This particular product, which will be denominated in U.S. dollars, will track an index currently being developed by Nasdaq. Its composition is still under wraps, but CoinDesk understands it will give a broad exposure to the asset class.  A total of three million shares are available via private placement at $1,000 apiece. At the time of the initial announcement, 10 shares had been sold.  A number of companies have unsuccessfully tried to get the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF for the U.S.  The SEC has expressed concern that a bitcoin ETF remains vulnerable to market manipulation. Most recently, it rejected an application from Wilshire Phoenix in February.  Like the neighboring Bahamas, Bermuda has expressed an openness to try digital assets. Earlier this month, the government announced a pilot program for a digital token that could quickly distribute financial aid to citizens.  While small compared to either the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, the BSX says its market cap is just under $300 million.  CoinDesk reached out to both Hashdex and BSX for comment but hadn't had a response at press time.  Nasdaq declined to comment.

42384732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlDD1,1600783296,IoT Startup Helium Floats New Hardware Device for Mining Its HNT Crypto Tokens,"Helium’s plan to create a decentralized wireless network may be about to gain altitude.      The company, which aims to create a token-powered wireless network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, announced Tuesday it’s no longer the sole manufacturer of Helium hotspots, which create the Helium network by mining the project’s HNT cryptocurrency.      RAK Wireless, a China-based manufacturer of IoT hardware will begin selling a new, cheaper version of the hotspot, potentially giving the whole enterprise a lift.      Quick refresher: Helium aims to create a new kind of wireless network, one that’s suited for data from low-power applications like tracking location, but also is completely separate and independent from existing telecom networks. While Helium maintains the network, it’s peer-to-peer, meaning it’s created by individuals owning and operating their own nodes.      Enter the Helium hotspot. For over a year, individuals have been able to buy and deploy one of the bologna-sandwich-sized hotspots, which both acts as a node in the network (via low-bandwidth wireless tech called LongFi) and rewards the owner by mining HNT crypto tokens.      Read more: Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities      Until now, the only way to get a hotspot was to buy one from Helium for $495 apiece. The RAK Hotspot Miner, available today in North America and coming “soon” to Europe and Asia, costs $249, or roughly half. It’ll be sold exclusively through Cal-Chip, an online vendor of IoT devices. The components are nearly identical to Helium’s model, according to the company, but RAK can offer a lower price since it can take advantage of economies of scale that Helium can’t.      “This is the first of what we hope will be many third parties building compatible hardware,” Helium CEO Amir Haleem said in an interview. “It’s an enormous step for us because up until now, we’ve been the only manufacturer and we’ve been the bottleneck. We can’t be the only entity contributing to [the network], both from a price point of view but also it doesn’t speak well to the decentralization story.”    Helium hardware    The buyers of Helium’s hotspots have typically been enthusiasts who see the value in a low-power network or companies that want to leverage the technology itself.      A company that wants to use the network to, say, track the location of its rental scooters can exchange HNT for data credits, which Helium also manages, and have a fixed price in dollars. The more hotspots in an area, the better the tracking – which also would likely fuel demand for HNT, which was trading at $1.75 as of press time, according to Messari.      You can see where this is going. With the RAK Hotspot lowering the bar to entry, more Helium owners may start to purchase them just to mine the cryptocurrency. If that happens, and those people are spread out in enough different places, Helium’s dream of decentralized wireless (which it calls, with a straight face, “DeWi”) might start to solidify, turning all those hotspots into valuable investments.      “Building wireless infrastructure this way and having access to the internet be decentralized and not controlled by one entity is a must-have step in the evolution of the internet,” said Haleem. The existing universe of low-power access points and gateways is, quite frankly, a clusterf**k. So it's great to have a third party start to get involved in the foundational infrastructure.”      Read more: IoT App Nodle Moves From Stellar Blockchain to Polkadot      Helium’s technology is promising, but far from ubiquitous. The company says it’s sold about 12,000 hotspots, although public network stats say only 8,641 are active. And while that still sounds like a lot, it takes between 100-200 hotspots to bring a single city “online.”      A few well-known companies, including Lime and Salesforce, have used Helium’s tech, but it’s early days.      In short, Helium needs to rise a lot further to reach its decentralized wireless utopia in the clouds, and its bubble could pop anytime. But at least with RAK Wireless coming on board, the weight of that journey is a little lighter.",POSITIVE,HNT,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | HNT,Pete Pachal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/22/iot-startup-helium-floats-new-hardware-device-for-mining-its-hnt-crypto-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c420a6e1e70419cd1d7324bac57a619661d54a8-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlDFX,1600780379,First Mover: Bitcoin's Latest Sell-Off Gets Crypto Traders Mulling Election Chaos,"In seeking to explain Monday's sell-off across traditional markets and cryptocurrencies, the digital-asset firm QCP Capital rattled off a list of seven major market events that occurred in Septembers past, from the 1929 stock market crash to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.      There might be some deep human connection with the autumnal equinox — when the days turn shorter than nights in the northern hemisphere and summer turns to fall, according to the firm. ""The human nervous system typically undergoes major measurable perturbations"" during this period, QCP wrote Monday in its daily market update.      The outlook is cloudy but there's a risk of a steep plunge similar to the sell-off in March that took bitcoin prices to their 2020 lows just below $4,000. One catalyst could be the upcoming U.S. presidential election, which has become more contentious in recent days following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.      Bitcoin (BTC) on Monday posted its biggest drop in three weeks, retreating from the psychological $11,000 hurdle that the cryptocurrency until just recently had seemed poised to eclipse. There was also an apparent unwind of the recent frenzy in decentralized finance, or DeFi, with associated digital assets from ether (ETH) to Aave (LEND) and Curve (CRV) falling even harder.      ""It got to a point where the market demand just kind of got exhausted, and there wasn't enough new capital flowing to sustain the push higher,"" said John Todaro, an analyst for the digital-asset firm TradeBlock.      Despite recent bets in foreign-exchange markets that massive money printing by the Federal Reserve and other central banks might drive down the value of the dollar, investors apparently sought refuge in the U.S. currency. The U.S. Dollar Index charted its biggest gain in a month.      ""The dollar's not dead, the dollar's a survivor,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant, said in a WhatsApp audio interview. ""It's a real flight to quality, and cash is king, and cash is the dollar, nothing else. The dollar rules.""      Monday's sell-off nearly wiped out 2020 gains for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, though ether, bitcoin and gold are still sitting on substantial 2020 gains.      There's a lot of major factors buffeting the global economy and geopolitical landscape, as the coronavirus continues to spread and the U.S. elections approach. President Donald Trump is pushing to nominate and confirm a pick to the high court prior to the election, even though Republican leadership had previously suggested such a step would be inappropriate.      Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency firm Panxora, says that if the election leads to political turmoil in the U.S., he could see the largest cryptocurrency trading as low as $7,000.      ""The danger to the crypto market is much the same as we saw in March,"" Smith said. ""If you get that big sell-off in risk assets, there will be that liquidation of bitcoin.""      He says central bank money printing should eventually push up inflation, which could be a catalyst for higher bitcoin prices, though ""that's very much a 2021 story.""      ""When we've seen the election past, all of a sudden it's going to become clear just how much money has been pumped into the system,"" Smith said.      A battle over confirmation of Ginsburg's successor could derail any last-ditch efforts to revive any effort to provide new U.S. fiscal stimulus, even amid growing signs that the economic recovery is stalling.      The Federal Reserve could step in to increase its pace of money printing, but any such decision would have to be made on an emergency basis, since the next regular meeting isn't scheduled until Nov. 5, two days after the election.      The Fed has already cut interest rates close to zero and is buying U.S. Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgage securities at a pace of $120 billion a month. Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in prepared testimony for a scheduled Congressional appearance Tuesday that officials ""remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible.""      But Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm, Quantum Economics, told subscribers in a daily newsletter, said that the bar will be high for further action.      ""The Federal Reserve and other central banks have already injected quite a lot of stimulus and are already committed to keeping rates suppressed for a long time to come,"" Greenspan wrote. ""There doesn't seem to be much in the way of action from them for markets to look forward to.""    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin fell by more than 4% on Monday, confirming a bear flag breakdown on the daily chart.      The bearish technical pattern indicates the bounce from the recent low of $9,869 has ended, and the pullback from the August high of $12,476 has resumed.      Analysts foresee a more significant decline in the cryptocurrency if the global stock markets extend Monday's sell-off.      ""Sustained risk-off in broader equity markets will lead to heavy offers across major cryptocurrencies,"" Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds' co-founder and COO, told CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin may revisit September lows"" around $9,870.      Monday's drop has boosted demand for put options or bearish bets. According to data source Skew, the one-month put-call skew has increased to over 4% from -3% on Sunday. The positive figure indicates that put options are drawing higher prices than calls.      However, three- and six-month skews remain negative, meaning the long-term bias remains bullish.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Equity Markets Turmoil Could Push Bitcoin Below $10K, Say Analysts    Token Watch    Uniswap (UNI): Arca Funds chief legal officer argues that tokens probably aren't securities under the SEC's test.

42384720,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlD4D,1600779685,BRD Is Breaking Into the Crypto Compliance Game,"The BRD team is spearheading a new initiative: Blockset, a business-to-business blockchain technology stack with a bent towards compliance, surveillance and security for cryptocurrency companies and government agencies.      After its 2014 launch, Bread was the first Bitcoin wallet to land on Apple’s app store. A couple of years later, the wallet launched a $32 million initial coin offerings and changed its name to BRD in a bid to “unify” its brand. Since then, BRD has expanded its coin support, launched new features like payment IDs, and expanded in-wallet crypto purchases to a motley of fiat currencies.      Now, for its latest initiative, BRD has recently partnered with blockchain analysis/intelligence companies Chainalysis, CipherTrace and Elliptic, along with security firm Unbound Tech. The latter has been instrumental in securing Blockset’s key management features, while the former companies will provide Blockset with regulatory compliance and blockchain monitoring tools.    Blockset: A suit-and-tie tech stack    “Layering these crucial applications on top of Blockset allows us to offer a comprehensive, broad-use offering to financial institutions from a single platform. This also enables our enterprise customers to address many use cases across all their crypto projects from a single vendor,” BRD CEO Adam Traidman told CoinDesk.      Per a Blockset press release, the new tech stack will provide anti-money laundering (AML), fraud detection and other compliance tools along with key management, security measures and data feeds for “financial institutions, government agencies, and cryptocurrency businesses.”      Read more: All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules      For AML and compliance, the software combines Chainalysis’ know-your transaction tools with CipherTrace’s ""Travel Rule"" compliance software. These features, along with risk-management software from Elliptic, will create real-time alerts to flag suspicious or fraudulent activity and “tainted” transactions for Blockset clients.      Traidman told CoinDesk that BRD is marketing its Blockset services primarily to financial institutions and banks that need sound compliance and key-management solutions. Regulators and government agencies are another logical fit given Blockset’s partnership with leading blockchain analysis firms.      According to BRD, SBI Holdings, PayPal, KPMG and Ripple’s developer initiative Xpring have all participated in a private pre-release of Blockset’s technology, along with some 16 other firms.      BRD, which reportedly has over six million downloads and 550,000 monthly active users, “is powered by Blockset,” according to BRD documentation shared with CoinDesk. A BRD representative claimed that the wallet will not use Blockset’s AML and compliance features; instead, Blockset is just used to quickly sync BRD wallets with Bitcoin’s (and other coins’) transaction histories.    Compliance comes to crypto    BRD’s new initiative is another tech stack in the fast-growing landscape of crypto-compliance software.      Some time ago, the Financial Action Task Force recommended that crypto transactions should adhere to the Travel Rule – a banking mandate wherein transactions greater than $10,000 must include fund-sourcing disclosure and payer/payee identity information. Since then, crypto companies have chased solutions to streamline compliance tools for exchanges, brokers, service providers and other market participants.      Read more: Less Than 1% of FinCEN’s Suspicious Activity Reports Since 2013 Mentioned Crypto      “Compliance is of utmost importance for any financial institution. It’s important for banks and enterprises to have the foresight to stay ahead of the regulatory curve. They need the knowledge and resources to protect their clients and themselves,” Traidman told CoinDesk.      Still, critics of the Travel Rule have weighed whether or not it hampers cryptocurrency business with undue burdens and even whether or not such a rule is sustainable at scale.      Indeed, the recently leaked “FinCen files” illustrate the failure of financial surveillance in the legacy financial system as some $2 trillion worth of money-laundered funds were pushed, sans renovation or consequence, through accounts held by criminals, oligarchs and other powerful persons at JPMorgan, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon.      As the same surveillance burden comes to the Bitcoin economy, perhaps the public nature of the blockchain’s digital ledger will make enforcing these mandates easier – if privacy preserving technology doesn’t keep up with the regulatory requirements, that is.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/22/brd-is-breaking-into-the-crypto-compliance-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f419b5aace973f5ff898fc28268b69aee5608e34-2560x1701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Eurozone's primary financial institution said in a report Tuesday that a properly designed and well-regulated digital asset could live up to the name, but that existing examples fell short of the intrinsically stable money substitute that the term ""stablecoin"" implies.  The ECB's 30-page report says the growth of stablecoins in Europe could result in their increasing use as a new payment method or as an alternative store of value.  The term stablecoins refers to digital assets that are designed to have minimal price fluctuations, generally by being backed by or pegged to assets such as fiat currency or gold.  While the ECB says rock-bottom interest rates likely remove much incentive for users to hold value in stablecoins, at least for the foreseeable future, it suggests consumers are still in danger of being confused or misled by the name.  ""As regulatory principles are established and approaches are defined, the term 'stablecoin' should be replaced by a choice of terminology to shift the emphasis away from the issuer’s promise of stability,"" the ECB said.  Unambiguous phrasing would better distinguish stablecoins from fiat currencies and would serve to also differentiate various types of stablecoin – for example, collateralized stablecoins from algorithmic ones – the central bank said.  It might also demarcate private initiatives from those of central banks – known in the industry's lexicon as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  Earlier today, ECB chief Christine Lagarde said a digital euro could become a viable alternative to existing cryptocurrencies and also prevent the Eurozone's monetary sovereignty from falling into the hands of private companies.

42384729,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlDEH,1600772539,"Equity Markets Turmoil Could Push Bitcoin Below $10K, Say Analysts","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again taking cues from the stock markets and prices may fall below $10,000 if equities see further sell-off, according to analysts.    The top cryptocurrency fell by 4.5% on Monday to register its biggest single-day decline since Sept. 4.  That came as global stock markets nursed sharp losses and the safe-haven U.S. dollar gained ground on renewed coronavirus fears and uncertainty over the 2020 U.S. election.  Bitcoin is currently priced at around $10,460, down nearly 2% on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  ""Sustained risk-off in broader equity markets will lead to heavy offers across major cryptocurrencies,"" Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds' co-founder and COO, told CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin may revisit September lows [around $9,870].""  European equities are reporting moderate gains at press time, however, futures tied to the S&P 500 index are down 0.3%, signaling scope for extension of Monday's sell-off.  Historically, September has been a weak month for the S&P 500 and the index performs poorly in October in the U.S. election years, according to crypto analyst Lark Davis.  ""As such, bitcoin could be in for some big bumps over the next six weeks,"" Davis tweeted.  A potential recovery in stocks may have a little positive impact on bitcoin, unless it is accompanied by an uptick in precious metals like gold, according to Dibb.  ""While Nasdaq recovered towards the end of Monday's session, our concern in relation to bitcoin is its heavy correlation with gold and silver, which are trading further down [Tuesday],"" he said.  The 60-day positive correlation between gold and bitcoin strengthened to record highs earlier this month.  Gold is currently trading near $1,900 per ounce, representing a 0.4% decline on the day, and fell nearly 2% on Monday. Meanwhile, silver dropped by 7.6% Monday.  Bitcoin's daily chart (above left) shows a ""bear flag"" breakdown – a sign the bounce from the recent low of $9,869 has ended and the pullback from August highs above $12,400 has resumed.  ""The cryptocurrency has breached the horizontal support of $10,500 (February high) and could slip to $10,000,"" Patrick Heusser, senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG told CoinDesk.  Gold's descending triangle breakdown also suggests scope for deeper declines.  Dibb is also keeping a close eye on the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies.  ""A breakout of the USD from its two-month consolidation will likely lead to continued selling and pressure on Bitcoin,"" Dibb said.  The DXY has largely been restricted to a range of 92.00 to 94.00 since the end of July.  A move above 94.00 would confirm a breakout and may weigh over bitcoin.  Bitcoin's big move from $9,000 to $12,000 seen in the second half of July was accompanied by a broad-based sell-off in the U.S. dollar.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the U.S. Congress on Tuesday and is expected to reiterate the central bank's commitment to holding interest rates low for a prolonged period.  Since the markets have already priced in low rates, stocks may not see a big relief rally.

It also ensures security remains consistent across the entire USSF network, preventing hackers and other malicious entities from identifying and exploiting any weak spots.  Per a release, Xage's CEO Duncan Greatwood said blockchain allowed USSF to ensure effective domain resilience across all assets and data elements on its network.

Rather than as a replacement for cash, a digital euro would ""complement"" traditional money, she said in an introductory speech at the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly on Monday.  The central bank digital currency would further provide an alternative to ""private digital currencies"" for European Union citizens, according to Lagarde.  This, she said, would ""ensure that sovereign money remains at the core of European payment systems.""  The latter comment references fears from regulators and governments that a massively popular cryptocurrency could threaten the power of central banks to control monetary policy and even cause a shift away from the use of fiat money.  Addressing this perceived threat from the as-yet-unlaunched Facebook-backed libra payments project last October, France’s economic and finance minister Bruno Le Maire said libra was usurping the sovereign right of states to issue their own currencies and could undermine the European project.  “Do we really want to give private interests such power, given the consequences it would have on trade and financial stability?” Le Maire said at the time. “I cannot countenance one of a sovereign state’s most powerful tools, monetary policy, falling under the remit of entities not subject to democratic control.”  Last month, in another speech, Lagarde said foreign providers had taken the lead on payments innovation due to the lack of integrated infrastructure in Europe, but a digital euro would allow the bloc to make up lost ground.  She said then that a future digital euro might be used for retail payments and be ""accessible to a wide audience.""

42384725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlD7z,1600738042,Uniswap Users Say Uniting Can Strengthen UNI,"A group of anonymous Uniswap users is trying to unite the many smallholders of the new UNI token in a bid to deal with potential problems in how the automated market maker (AMM) is governed.      The big initiative being promoted by this “union” is UNI Innamorare (or UNII), a token to be used by the Uniswap community. However, while Uniswap forks SushiSwap and SashimiSwap chipped away at Uniswap’s liquidity, this newly launched token promises to help Uniswap’s market grow and potentially consolidate prices for UNI, which is held by more than 80,000 addresses at press time.      It is unclear who is behind the initiative. Its website said that UNII is “backed by unii.finance.” A Silicon Valley-based investor familiar with the matter told CoinDesk that the group includes both UNI retail holders and some sub-communities of Uniswap. As of press time, only around 20 people joined have joined its Telegram group.      The group is asking UNI holders to claim UNII tokens in order to form a party within the UNI community that can counter the power from the founding team and investors, according to a Medium post published on Sept. 20.      The UNII token’s distribution will include two stages: after the initial airdrop of 15% of its total supply of 1 billion tokens, 30% of the UNII will be mined in the first staking pool, which requires UNI holders to stake their UNI and UNII at the ratio of 98:2. In a subsequent staking pool, UNI holders will only be required to stake their UNI and UNII at the ratio of 50:50 in order to mine 50% of the total UNII supply. The even split means that UNI holders are taking bigger mining risks compared with the first stage, which only requires a ratio of 2:98. As they stake more UNI tokens in this second pool, it could theoretically stabilize or even move up UNI’s price, said the same source who is close to the group.      The remaining 5% of the UNII will be reserved in what they are referring to as a “celebration pool” to reward UNII members if UNII becomes one or more of the token-pairs listed under UNI’s liquidity mining pool.      Prices for UNI were traded at $4.37 as the time of writing, down 48.4% from its all-time high at $8.40 on Sept. 18, according to CoinGecko.    When the hottest DeFi project has a decentralization problem    The launch of Uniswap’s governance token UNI on Sept. 16 was partly to tackle a long-existing issue for the venture capital-backed project: it is not 100% community-owned. After the decentralized exchange airdropped a share of its new governance token to everyone that had ever used it (up to Sept. 1), it received instant praise from both its users and the crypto community. However, as some took a deeper look at how UNI was distributed, they began to question just how much control the community will truly have.      Of the total supply of 1 billion UNI tokens, around 40% of them will eventually be allocated to team members, investors and advisors, according to a blog post on Uniswap’s website. That leaves 60% to the community.      While 60% may not sound too bad, the people behind UNII see a big hurdle in the fact that 1% and 4% of UNI total supply are required, respectively, to submit a governance proposal and to vote “yes” to reach quorum.      “We are all minions in terms of voting power,” according to a pre-launched page by the anonymous group, as they explained why a union within the Uniswap’s community is very much needed.      Uniswap is not the only decentralized finance (DeFi) project that uses such governance parameters. DeFi lending protocol Compound also requires 1% of its governance token COMP to submit a governance proposal.    UNII vs. SushiSwap, SashimiSwap and others    DeFi is still in its nascent stage, with many retail investors trading in this market. Returns for this unorganized group of people are impacted most by decisions made in DeFi communities on a decentralized basis.      SushiSwap’s vampire attack on Uniswap became an immediate success as the popular fork touted its full decentralization since its birth. It was able to lure away more than $800 million of crypto assets from Uniswap.      As the so-called “Weird DeFi” projects continue to grow (for example, SashimiSwap) and take liquidity from their competitors, the group behind the UNII initiative is claiming an alternative approach to unite users while at the same time promising to keep the sustainability of the DeFi ecosystem.
