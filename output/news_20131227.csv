42397337,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfJ4,1388155536,Authorities Swoop Down on India's Biggest Trading Platform Buysellbitco.in,"Just three days after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a public advisory which warned against the use and trade of digital currencies, authorities have carried out the first bitcoin raid in the country.  In Ahmedabad, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the premises of Mahim Gupta, the man behind India's biggest trading platform, buysellbitco.in. A separate raid was carried out in another part of the city, although the authorities do not appear to have found the second suspect in the office.  Violation of foreign exchange regulations  During the preliminary investigation, the Enforcement Directorate found that buysellbitco.in was in clear violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, reports DNA India.  “We have found that through the website 400 persons have recorded 1,000 transactions that amount to a few crores of rupees. We are gathering the data of the transactions, name[s] of the people who have transacted in the virtual currency from Gupta’s server that is hired in the US,” said an ED official.  “At present, we believe that this is a violation of foreign exchange regulations of the country. If we are able to establish [a] money laundering aspect then he can be arrested.”  Authorities estimate the total volume of transactions on buysellbitco.in was between Rs20-30 crore, or $3.2 to $4.8m. The unnamed ED official said:  “The biggest threat is that without recording your transaction in [an] official foreign currency platform, money can be transferred like hawala with the use of this transaction. We are examining such instances, if any, here.”  Unregulated transfers  Hawala is an honour-based informal money transfer system regulated by Islamic jurisprudence centuries ago, but in recent years it has come under a lot of scrutiny by national regulators in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.  Since it is informal and unregulated, over the last few decades it has been employed to circumvent international sanctions, launder illicit opium trade revenue and move cash between paramilitary and terrorist groups.  It's easy to see why Indian authorities would feel less than enthusiastic about a digital version of hawala powered by the Bitcoin protocol.  However, although it buysellbitco.in was operating without regulatory approval, which is true of all bitcoin trading platforms based in India, there is no indication that it was involved in money laundering at this point.  For the time being, Indian bitcoin operators appear to be taking the wait-and-see approach. On Wednesday, buysellbitco.in announced that it would suspend operations following the RBI statement. INRBTC also said that it would suspend its services indefinitely. Unocoin also followed suit.  Potential fallout  India is a not a significant bitcoin hub, but with its huge population and booming economy it is potentially an immense untapped market, especially for foreign remittances.  The raid indicates that the RBI warning is more than a simple advisory. For all intents and purposes, exchanging bitcoins for rupees in India is illegal, as it is impossible to get regulatory approval.  As CoinDesk noted yesterday, India faces a number of region-specific concerns that will not be easy to address. The question is whether anyone will be willing to address them at all.  In other words, if nothing changes Indian bitcoin exchanges will remain closed. This does not necessarily mean that anyone using bitcoin in India will be breaking the law, but it will have a significant effect on bitcoin adoption in India.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/27/authorities-swoop-down-on-indias-biggest-trading-platform-buysellbitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f83efe6ec8e72473425292de2c6f7ba8006d4a7-999x621.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfSu,1388136023,5 Things to do With Those Christmas Bitcoins,"It’s the festive season, and if there is a bitcoin fan among your friends and family, then they may have given you some of the virtual currency in your Christmas stocking. If so, what should you do with it?  There are several options for you as a new bitcoin owner. We’ll tell you about them here, but before you start, please don’t do what Bloomberg TV anchor Adam Johnson did. Fellow anchor Matt Miller gave bitcoins to Johnson as a Christmas gift on air. They came in the form of a paper wallet (see below), which Johnson showed to the camera, displaying his private key in the process. Whoops. A reddit user scanned the QR code and beamed the bitcoins to his own address, bragging about it later online. There’s one person who made it onto the naughty list this year.  1. Store them securely  Which brings us to the first thing that you're going to want to do with your new bitcoins: keep them safe. If you've never received bitcoins before, the chances are that you've been given them by someone who created a bitcoin address for you, sent some coins to it, and then gave you the address somehow. It may have come as a long number pasted into an email, or potentially on a piece of paper.  How you store the bitcoins  will depend on what you want to do with them. If you’re going to spend them immediately, then you’ll want to put them into what’s called a ‘hot wallet’. This is a wallet either on your smartphone, your desktop computer, or a website, and it allows you to spend your coins straight away.  But you may also be planning on keeping the bitcoins for longer. The currency’s price is pretty volatile, and some analysts think that it will bounce far higher than it has already. If you want to keep your bitcoins for a while, then consider putting them in cold storage. This is a bitcoin wallet that doesn’t connect to the Internet. No one on the Internet can steal it because it isn't stored on your computer, or on a remote website. The easiest way to do this is with a paper wallet.  If the bitcoin address isn't on a piece of paper, or the gift giver has promised you some coins but hasn’t sent them yet, then you can create a paper wallet at various websites. One site that you can use to produce excellent paper wallets is Bitcoin Paper Wallet. Another example is BitAddress.org.  Sites like these will generate a bitcoin address for you. The address has two components: a public key (which you show to everyone else when you want to receive bitcoins to that address), and a private key (which you use to send the coins). The bitcoin address will be printed out onto a paper wallet for you to keep. Show the public key to the person sending the bitcoins. They will scan the address and send the coins along using their own wallet. It is important that you then keep that piece of paper safe – because if you lose it or show it to someone malicious (like Johnson did), then your bitcoins will be gone.  When you wish to spend these bitcoins, you can import your private key to a hot wallet of your choice. There are many to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some, like blockchain.info, store your bitcoin private keys both online, and on a mobile app. Others, like Kryptokit, restrict storage to your desktop computer only. The wallet will have a way for you to input or scan your paper wallet's private key, transferring it into hot storage so that it is ready to spend. At this point, it effectively has an Internet-connected copy of that paper wallet, meaning that the paper wallet can't be considered as cold storage anymore.  Check out our handy guide to bitcoin storage.  2. Give them away  So, now you’ve secured your coins. What next? In the spirit of Christmas, we thought we list the most obvious option near the top: giving them away. There are several organizations that take bitcoin donations listed here, one of which is Connie Gallippi’s BitGive Foundation. It is a respected organization, with members of the Bitcoin Foundation on its board, which takes bitcoin donations to build up a charitable investment fund. It makes financial contributions to charities that focus on public health and the environment. Most recently, it raised $4,850 for Save the Children.  3. Gamble them  Giving bitcoins to charity might be the right thing to do, but if there is a devil sitting on your shoulder, he may advise you to gamble it away instead. If you fancy a flutter and don't fancy making the trip to Vegas, then you can do it from the comfort of your armchair, in between Turkey-induced catatonia and rounds of rum and eggnog.  There is no shortage of gambling-related sites. SatoshiDice is perhaps one of the most famous. Akin to a large, Internet-based penny slot machine, it works by publishing a variety of bitcoin addresses. Players their bitcoins to one of them, and the site’s computers evaluate them to see if you won or lost, sending back your original bet multiplied by a prize multiplier if you are successful.  'Dice' sites like these allow you to verify the payout either by using the bitcoin block chain, or by using pre-defined numbers which can help you to check that your payout was fair. But for those wanting a more conventional game, there are several bitcoin poker sites up and running, including Satoshi Poker, and Bits Poker. Players do so at their own risk, however. Another poker site, Seals with Clubs, just lost 42,000 hashed passwords in a hacking attack.  4. Spend them  If you are just itching to spend your new virtual currency, there are many places where you can buy goods and services online. We’re still not at the point where you can hand them over the counter at your local boxing day sale, but you can spend them online, and at selected physical merchants. There is a big list of individual merchants organized by category here, but you can also find bitcoin-based vendors on some online marketplace sites like Etsy.  Bitdazzle  is an online marketplace for vendors of all kinds that accept bitcoin, which will enable you to magically turn your satoshis into that bar of lavender and oatmeal goat milk soap you always wanted.  Alternatively, use a service that will enable you to purchase pretty much anything with bitcoins. All4BTC will take your bitcoins and use them to pay pretty much any e-commerce vendor on your behalf. Or, you can buy a gift card from over 200 popular high street retailers, by sending your newly-gifted coins to Gyft.  For more details on your spending options, check out our in-depth guide here.  5. Sell them  Still have no idea what to do with those precious coins? Then flog them. If there is a bitcoin ATM near you, you may be able to sell them there. You can sometimes find bitcoin-related Meetup groups in your area, where people will lurk looking for bitcoins to buy, or items to sell in exchange for them.  You can also take advantage of direct person-to-person sales via sites such as LocalBitcoins.com, where you can find people to trade with online, or in person (be sensible and safe when doing the latter). Or, if you’re in the mood to organize a whole bunch of paperwork over the holiday, you can register yourself on one of the many bitcoin exchanges (there will probably be a local one for your country) and then deposit your bitcoins there. This will enable you to sell the bitcoins to a buyer offering a given asking price.  Whatever you decide to do with your new bitcoins, call the person that gave them to you, and give them a happy New Year’s greeting from us at CoinDesk. We like people that think outside the box. And aren’t bitcoins a much more interesting present than a pair of socks?

42397336,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfI5,1388125216,Mobile Nations Reports Surge in Popularity for Bitcoin Payments,"Mobile Nations, a leading provider of 'all things mobile', started accepting bitcoin payments in early December. So far, the currency has proved to be a success for the retailer.  Mobile Nations  operates store fronts such as ShopAndroid, ShopCrackberry, Windows Phone Central and, of course, the iMore Store. All four stores have been accepting bitcoin since 3rd December.  But how many of its consumers are actually using bitcoin?  Mobile Nations' chief media officer Kevin Michaluk told CoinDesk that a relatively small amount of payments were made in bitcoin, roughly 0.004% of total orders. However, the average size of a bitcoin order is significantly higher than orders via other methods.  “The single largest order placed in our stores in December was actually paid for with bitcoin,” said Michaluk.  He pointed out that Mobile Nations decided to start accepting bitcoin payments in response to demand from the community:  “When our customers ask for something, we take it seriously. We had been receiving requests to accept bitcoin for the past six months or so, on a steady but fairly limited basis.”  Michaluk added that as the value of bitcoin surged in late 2013, calls to introduce bitcoin payments grew louder. Since the surge coincided with the holiday shopping season, Mobile Nations decided to add support for the virtual currency.  “Our tech team looked into the requirements and merchant services available and found the process to be straightforward. Implementation was easy, and a few days later we were ready to accept Bitcoin,” he said.  On the user-end, the system is straightforward. All consumers need to do is add an item to their cart and click the ‘Pay with bitcoin’ button, hassle free.  When asked to comment on the future of bitcoin, Michaluk was cautious. He said he still does not know what the future holds for bitcoin, but he stressed that there is a real community movement behind bitcoin and many customers are asking for bitcoin support.  Mobile Nations was happy to oblige and become part of the bitcoin story.
