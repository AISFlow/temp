34168467,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645425,1727739040,"Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why","Shiba Inu has been on an uptrend recently, after suffering losses for the better parts of the second and third quarters of the year. This recovery going into the new month plays into the high expectations for the meme coin, especially in Q4, when the altcoin’s price is expected to more than double. Using historical data, this report elaborates on why the expectations for the Shiba Inu price are high going into the last quarter of the year 2024. The Most Bullish Month Of The Year For Shiba Inu According to historical performance, the end of September is about to usher in the most bullish quarter of the year 2024 for Shiba Inu. This is especially true for the month of October which has never ended in the red for the meme coin. If this trend holds, then the SHIB price could continue to rise from here. Related Reading: ETH Rally Pushes Profitability To Nearly 70%: More To Come This Week? Data from the CryptoRank website shows that the Shiba Inu price has seen an average return of +283.4% in the month of October. This average return could mean that the Shiba Inu price could triple by the time the month of October is over. Such a rise would put the SHIB price around the $0.00006 level this month. Additionally, if the recovery continues through the end of the year as expected, then the meme coin’s price could be seeing a new all-time high price before the year is over. Also, the last time that SHIB ended the month of September in the green was 2021, and the month of October went on to see an 833% increase in the space of one month. Now, 2024 is about to be the first in three years when the SHIB price is ending in the green again. A repeat of the 2021 trend would also send SHIB toward a new all-time high. Will Q4 End In Green Or Red? While the crypto market has often seen a good turn in Q4, the Shiba Inu price has not been very lucky after the month of October. According to CryptoRank, the average returns for November and December are in the negative with -15.9% and -6.12%, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Could Catapult Price To New All-Time High – Here’s Why This doesn’t bode well for the Shiba Inu price and could suggest a good time to sell for investors. If this follows, then October could be a good time to move out of the altcoin and move back in in December. However, if the Bitcoin uptrend continues into the end of the year, it could see the SHIB price rise into the new year.

Bradford’s Bullish Take On BTC Price In an interview with research and brokerage firm Bernstein, CleanSpark’s CEO noted that historically, post-halving periods have led to several positive adjustments for BTC’s price. It should be recalled that Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving in April 2024, when its block confirmation rewards were slashed from 6.250 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In a note to clients shared today, Bradford remarked: Based on my current analysis, I believe we could see bitcoin peak just under $200,000, sometime in the next 18 months. That’ll likely be a peak. But I do think we’ll see a rapid jump, and then hopefully, an extended elongated period of it being up before we revisit a bear cycle. Related Reading: Historical Trends Put Bitcoin At $400,000 With Shocking Timeline Bradford stressed that he sees Bitcoin’s “extended flat period” as a positive sign. It indicates that a sustained rally to the upside may last longer than usual. However, he cautions that this depends on macroeconomic events and other relevant factors. Adding to his comments, Bradford said he expects a considerable push in BTC price post-election through January 2025. Subsequently, this could help Bitcoin miners with efficient cost structures expand their profit margins. Interestingly, the CleanSpark CEO doesn’t think it’s important who wins the US presidential elections in November 2024. Rather, the reduction in electoral uncertainty after the elections will help investors place more confidence in risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. Bradford opined that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) was late in cutting interest rates after hiking them over the past two years. He concluded that to correct its delayed action, the Fed might cut rates more aggressively in the next 15 to 16 months, leading to further BTC price appreciation. Bitcoin Price Looks For Further Upside, But Challenges Remain After hitting a low of nearly $53,900 on September 6, Bitcoin has rebounded by nearly 10% on the back of multiple positive developments, such as the Fed cutting interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), and increased net daily inflows to ETFs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Biggest September Gains In A Decade: Here’s Why Crypto analysts believe that there is room for further upside in Bitcoin price. For instance, analysts from 10x Research predict that BTC may reach $70,000 in the coming two weeks, followed by a new all-time high (ATH) price. However, there are reasons to temper this optimism. For example, the recent Bitcoin rally has been accompanied by a rapid increase in open interest, indicating the possibility of high price volatility in the near term. Similarly, another analyst highlighted the greater increase in derivatives trading compared to spot trading as a cause for concern regarding a healthy Bitcoin price trajectory to the upside. Bitcoin trades at $63,710 at press time, down 3.2% in the past 24 hours.

34163739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645509,1727728259,Ethereum Faces Network Shakeup: These Key Trends Point to Market Shifts,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently shown signs of a shifting market sentiment and momentum, according to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst named Percival. The analyst disclosed that various market conditions and technological developments have impacted Ethereum’s momentum and have led to mixed views on its future growth trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Trims Gains: Is the Rally Losing Steam? Ethereum’s Market Sees Shift Percival, highlighted that Ethereum has faced a decline in activity due to the rise of other blockchains with greater accessibility, more advanced technology, and faster update cycles. According to the analyst, “the positive Momentum sentiment is far below expectations.” So far, the open interest in Ethereum futures—a measure of capital flowing into derivative contracts—reached $9.2 billion, with a notable inflow of $2.12 billion in August 2024. This represents a 30% rise but pales compared to the $6 billion inflow observed between April and May, reflecting only half of that previous momentum. Another major observation of the analysis was the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” indicating the differential between the price of Ethereum on Coinbase and other global exchanges. A slowdown in selling pressure from US-based investors suggests a possible positive shift in market sentiment. However, the market is still waiting for a significant influx of capital to drive a strong rally for Ethereum. The analyst pointed out that any future price recovery would depend on substantial investment inflows, which have yet to materialize. Furthermore, after the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) announcements, Ethereum’s gas fees surged, hinting at a possible shift of capital from traditional treasuries into decentralized finance (DeFi). The analyst mentioned an instance: the DeFi lending platform Aave, which operates on the ETH network, has seen a moderate rise in fee collection, from $42 million in March to $43 million in August. Ethereum Network Lags Behind While Percival noted that from an economic perspective, Ethereum needs to revert to its max fee pass gas mean, aligning its growth with its intrinsic value, the analyst also suggests that Ethereum currently faces several internal gaps. Although the technology ecosystem around Ethereum is expanding, the network seems to be lagging behind the competition, according to Percival. The CryptoQuant analyst reveals that this disconnect between Ethereum’s capabilities and its technological rivals has led to a significant shortfall in investment. Moreover, the limited inflow of small capital and lack of consistent use suggest that even minor investments are not being sustained over time. Related Reading: Ethereum Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Is Rising Again — What It Means For ETH Price The analyst’s take is further validated by the fact that Ethereum’s network has faced increased competition from alternative blockchains like Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and others that boast higher transaction speeds and lower fees. This has, to some extent, diverted attention and investment from Ethereum to these newer ecosystems.

Executive Director Jerry Brito and Senior Policy Counsel Robin Weisman are out at the end of the year, and Peter Van Valkenburgh will take the helm.  Jerry Brito, the founding executive director of the venerable-for-crypto advocacy and research organization Coin Center will step down by the end of the year, he wrote in a post on the group's website, adding that he'll be retaining a board seat.  The same goes for Robin Weisman, Coin Center's senior policy counsel, who will also stay on the board of directors for the crypto research group, which since its first days in 2014 had been characterized more as a ""think tank"" than a lobbying organization.  The new executive director will be Peter Van Valkenburgh, and Landon Zinda will move into a role as policy director. The note didn't mention a next career step for Brito or Weisman, and a Coin Center spokesman said neither has shared any plans.  ""Peter groks Coin Center’s mission better than anyone, and his depth of knowledge and experience at the intersection of crypto and constitutional law is unmatched,"" noted Brito, a familiar face over the years at Washington congressional hearings and other policy events.  ""Our goal at the outset was to secure time for Bitcoin to reach ‘escape velocity,’ and on that score, I think we succeeded,"" Brito wrote. ""The struggle is not over yet, though.""  The top Coin Center officials leave as the organization is still fighting the Internal Revenue Service's effort to institute crypto tax reporting rules. The change to the U.S. tax code – coming from 2021's Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act – would demand that crypto users exchanging digital assets worth more than $10,000 gather and share information that includes real names, Social Security numbers and addresses.

42390300,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc40PD,1727726702,Uniswap’s Model Is a Science Project That Could Kill DeFi,"Ethereum’s launch in 2015 built off Bitcoin’s formula by enabling developers to play a more active role in designing decentralized applications, likely representing a major turning point in the history of finance by introducing smart contracts and paving the way for decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum quickly blossomed into the hub for the burgeoning crypto industry, with innovative projects inspired by Bitcoin’s manifesto working to remove centralized intermediaries in everything from gaming to lending and borrowing.  Uniswap, one of the largest and most influential decentralized exchanges (DEXs), launched in November 2018 during Devcon 4, where its founder Hayden Adams revealed the platform’s V1. In under six months, Uniswap already had $10 million locked in its liquidity pools, securing the DEX with valuable seed funds as it expanded and upgraded its protocol.  But Uniswap’s model represents a ticking time bomb that could derail much of DeFi’s ecosystem because its approach cannot and will not turn a profit.  The chink in the AMM model’s armor  As an automated market maker (AMMs), Uniswap maintains automated token trading through an algorithmic mechanism to ensure a trade is always available, improving the UX found in first-generation DEXs and centralized exchanges such as FTX or Coinbase. Uniswap’s protocol attracts liquidity providers by incentivizing them with enticing annual percentage rates (APRs) and using their deposits to create funds that facilitate the platform’s trading activity.  This model took off with Uniswap launching a V2 and V3 while adding a governance token ($UNI) in September 2020. Following its success, many other DEXs tried to copy Uniswap’s model, most notably SushiSwap.  They say that imitation is the ultimate form of flattery, but the Uniswap-inspired AMM model isn’t without flaws.  Despite the platform’s continued success and prominence within DeFi, serious questions remain about the sustainability of its business model and those of similar AMMs. From a regular user’s perspective, Uniswap and AMMs generally provide a convenient way to trade a wide variety of tokens. On the flip side, liquidity providers typically fail to retain profits due to the misleadingly-named concept of impermanent loss.  Even if advertised APRs (annual percentage rates) aren’t misleading and are distributed to liquidity providers, a study going as far back as 2021 revealed that more than half of Uniswap’s liquidity providers were losing money due to impermanent loss, which means they would have been better off just holding the tokens independently and not putting them to work at all. This is because the rate of impermanent loss, caused by volatile price fluctuations, is usually higher than the APRs rewarded to liquidity providers.  Things only got worse when Uniswap transitioned to a concentrated liquidity model, which aimed to improve capital efficiency by offering liquidity in specific price ranges chosen by the user. This removed the 50/50 balance in trades, benefiting traders but making it so that liquidity providers are still actively losing money from taking the suboptimal side of every trade.  Let’s take a look at the UNI token itself, which somehow does not generate revenue despite a valuation exceeding $6 billion. With no fee-share coming from LPs, the protocol itself earns nothing from its usage. Since UNI holders are unable to stake their tokens to earn rewards in the form of ETH, they gain no direct financial benefit from the value they drive to Ethereum.  The bottom line is that liquidity providers are unable to get any profit because there is simply no profit to be made. And if LPs aren’t even profitable, it is unlikely there will ever be any profit to share.  So, this raises the question: How can a sector survive, let alone thrive if investors regularly lose money?  Rethinking DEXs  We shouldn’t underestimate how big of a problem profitability is for liquidity providers.  DeFi cannot effectively function without liquidity providers, and their role in strengthening crypto as a whole shouldn’t be taken for granted. A sign that investors are waking up to this problem can be seen from lending protocols surpassing DEXs in TVL.  This should sound the alarm for all of DeFi. If liquidity providers pull their funds en masse from DeFi protocols in favor of more traditionally stable asset classes, it would quickly send ripple effects across the entire crypto industry. So how can DEXs be improved to enable more traders and liquidity providers to thrive while simultaneously enhancing capital efficiency?  Crypto’s overall idea is to reflect, but also replace, traditional finance through maximum decentralization. However, capital inefficiency within the DeFi sector doesn’t allow that to happen, putting it at a clear disadvantage against centralized platforms  In traditional finance, when one deposits money into a savings account, one can expect a reliable ROI from providing liquidity to the institution. But banks carry an implicit trust, whether through consumer protections or centuries of experience in managing assets and navigating volatile markets. DeFi platforms don’t have that same degree of investor confidence. Most DEXs, simply put, don’t have the experience to capture value from their liquidity successfully.  The main problem with Uniswap and similar AMM models is that they never really learned how to profit from the liquidity they collect. Countering this requires DEXs to implement innovative incentivizing mechanisms and boost their transparency to encourage investor and trader participation.  Enhancing transparency, tracking impermanent loss, and setting APRs accordingly is paramount to making liquidity providers feel secure and incentivized. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance supplement their income by providing infrastructure services and earning interest from token custody. Perhaps, DEXs can evolve to the point where liquidity can be hypothecated to earn both chain security incentives and trade fees simultaneously.  DeFi’s novelty holds tremendous promise. By removing third-party intermediaries, DeFi enables investors to earn fees from the liquidity they provide to a certain protocol — a revolutionary concept that even 10 years ago would have been hard to wrap one’s head around. However, capital inefficiencies and inexperience with the nature of markets call for new approaches to ensure that decentralized systems don’t squander the momentum they’ve recently enjoyed. Addressing these challenges now can help bolster all DEXs leading to a stronger and more resilient DeFi.

ByteTree's Charlie Morris contemplated whether the expectation for a strong October is so widespread that it may upend the trend.  Cryptocurrencies fell sharply on Monday with bitcoin {{BTC}} nearing the $63,000 level during the U.S. session, finishing on a sour note of what otherwise was a surprisingly stellar September for digital assets.

Japan's incoming prime minister Shigeru Ishiba said that ""monetary policy must remain accommodative as a trend,"" according to a Reuters report. His comments came after his surprise weekend elevation to the PM role set off a 5% plunge in the Nikkei on Monday.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tempered expectations on Monday that future rate cuts will be as aggressive as September's 50 basis point cut.  “Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,” Powell said. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.” “Overall, the economy is in solid shape,"" he added. ""We intend to use our tools to keep it there.""  When might bitcoin truly break out?  Even with today's dip in crypto prices, bitcoin is on track to finish with a solid positive return in September despite its reputation for being an adverse month. BTC was up just shy of 7% through the month at prices a few hours before UTC midnight, booking its best September performance since 2013, per CoinGlass data.  September's positive return could bode well for October, with every previous green September having been followed by more gains the next month. October is also historically one of the strongest months for bitcoin, earning its nickname ""Uptober,"" by recording positive monthly returns 9 times out of 11 since 2013.  However, Charlie Morris, founder of investment manager ByteTree, contemplated whether the expectation of a strong October is so widespread that it may throw a curveball to investors.  ""The contrarian will always be cautious of an idea that has become too popular because popularity means the money is already invested ahead of the event,"" Morris wrote in a Monday report.  His report further noted that BTC's price historically consolidated for roughly six months after halvings before making new highs, and the current price action is in line with that pattern. Given that this year's event happened on April 19, a breakout to new highs may happen towards the end of October if the pattern holds up.  Options traders, however, expect that a bigger rally will only come after the U.S. elections in November, and are thus positioning for further weakness in the coming weeks, according to Jake Ostrovskis, OTC trader at crypto market maker Wintermute.

Driven by its recent bullish momentum, XRP has succeeded in breaking a key bullish pattern, as a result, a crypto analyst has predicted that it could potentially jump 4X to new highs of $2.6. XRP Price Set Sights On Midterm Target At $2.3 After experiencing slow growth and bearish momentum in the past few weeks, XRP has sparked renewed confidence amongst investors with its latest price surge. Over the last seven days, XRP has skyrocketed by 8.93% and is showing signs of more gains in the future. Related Reading: PEPE Confirms Breakout From Symmetrical Triangle: How Far Can It Go? This bullish outlook is shared by prominent crypto analyst, Captain Faibik, who disclosed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on September 28, that XRP has just broken a unique bullish pattern, indicating a potential for a major price rally. In Faibik’s XRP price chart, a multi-year bullish symmetrical triangle pattern can be seen. This triangle pattern began forming in October 2021 and has extended through to September 2024, with XRP undergoing significant price fluctuations throughout this period. After experiencing its first substantial price surge in weeks, XRP successfully broke out of this bullish triangle pattern. The extent of XRP’s recent price increase is evident in CoinMarketCap’s data, which indicates that the cryptocurrency has jumped by 4.73% in the last 24 hours. This significant price increase suggests that XRP may be aiming to push significantly above its previous consolidation levels of around $0.5. As of writing, XRP is trading at $0.64, underscoring a possible rise in investor interest and demand for the cryptocurrency. By breaking out of this bullish triangle pattern, Faibik believes that XRP could be on track for a massive rally that could push its price by 4X. The analyst has declared that XRP is currently heating up for a massive breakout to mid-term targets at $2.3. XRP Breaks Critical Trendline A crypto and Elliott Wave analyst, identified as ‘XForceGlobal’ on X has highlighted a unique trendline in XRP’s price chart. According to the analyst, XRP has just broken the “multilayer BD trendline,’ and may be heading towards a price increase. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC Battle Far From Over As Regulator Opposes Court’s Decision XForceGlobal has suggested that if XRP can maintain a price above this trendline for a few more weeks, it could witness a price increase between $7 to $10. The analyst has expressed confidence in his bullish forecast, indicating that a surge within this range was inevitable if the right conditions were met. To be more precise, the analyst predicts via a detailed chart that XRP’s price could potentially rise to $8.67, marking a 1,482% increase from its current price of $0.6.

Solana is the third most valuable smart contracts platform, trailing Ethereum and the BNB Chain. Over the years since launching, it has been gulping up more market share from Ethereum, cementing its position. Is Ethereum Superior To Solana? While the prominence of Solana is evident, Sreeram Kannan, the founder of EigenLayer, argued in a post on X that Solana prioritizes low latency and global node synchronization over other core features. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst On the other hand, Ethereum took a different approach, emphasizing the need for stability and decentralization. Accordingly, in Kannan’s view, the first smart contracts platform offers a more comprehensive solution than its competitor. Currently, EigenLayer manages over $12 billion worth of assets on Ethereum, according to DeFiLlama. Although Kannan acknowledges the efficiency of Solana, the founder nonetheless picks out some limitations now that the platform is building a global state machine. At the top of the list is the blockchain’s sacrifice of programmability and verifiability. Meanwhile, the EigenLayer lead thinks Ethereum is excelling, especially on performance, thanks in part to the success of rollups and the resulting wild adoption. This off-chain solution provides instant confirmation and is more performant than web2 applications. At the same time, Ethereum is programmable, enabling EigenLayer to add more features like an arbitrary decentralization of verifiable tasks. As a result, the liquidity restaking platform, Kannan adds, has enabled cloud-scale programmability. Layer-2 Platforms Thriving: Why Is ETH Struggling? The co-founder of Celestia, Mustafa Al-Bassam, also appreciates what Ethereum brings to the table and is absent or underdeveloped in other networks. In a post on X, Al-Bassam said the first smart contracts platform is “underrated.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets 81% In One Day, Are The Bulls Back? Specifically, the co-founder lauded the thriving rollup ecosystem in Ethereum, saying it is “by far the largest and most successful.” As of September 30, L2Beat data shows that the layer-2 ecosystem in Ethereum manages over $38 billion, with Arbitrum and Base among the largest platforms. Even as Base and other Ethereum layer-2 platforms draw activity, ETH, the native currency, is struggling for momentum. The daily chart shows bulls have yet to break above $2,800, although support remains at $2,400. Dwindling upside momentum has been partly blamed on the proliferation of layer-2 scaling solutions. The network becomes inflationary as more activity is re-routed off-chain, and enhancements like Dencun are activated to make layer-2 transactions even cheaper.

42390286,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc3zKX,1727715971,Can We Ever Trust AI Agents?,"The renowned Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner once opined that the ""real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do."" This witty observation underscores a once crucial point: that our trust in technology hinges on human judgment. It's not machine intelligence we should worry about, but the wisdom and responsibility of those who control it. Or at least that was the case.  With software like ChatGPT now an integral part of many work lives, Skinner's insight seems almost quaint. The meteoric rise of AI agents – software entities capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals – has fundamentally shifted the paradigm. These digital assistants, born from the consumer AI boom of the early 2020s, now permeate our digital lives, handling tasks from scheduling appointments to making investment decisions.  What are AI agents?  AI agents differ significantly from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their capacity for autonomous action. While LLMs primarily process and generate text, AI agents are designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents combine various AI technologies, including natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, allowing them to adapt and learn from their experiences.  But as AI agents proliferate and iterate, so too does a gnawing unease. Can we ever truly trust these digital entities? The question is far from academic. AI agents operate in complex environments, making decisions based on vast datasets and intricate algorithms that even their creators struggle to fully comprehend. This inherent opacity breeds mistrust. When an AI agent recommends a medical treatment or predicts market trends, how can we be certain of the reasoning behind its choices?  The consequences of misplaced trust in AI agents could be dire. Imagine an AI-powered financial advisor that inadvertently crashes markets due to a misinterpreted data point, or a healthcare AI that recommends incorrect treatments based on biased training data. The potential for harm is not limited to individual sectors; as AI agents become more integrated into our daily lives, their influence grows exponentially. A misstep could ripple through society, affecting everything from personal privacy to global economics.  At the heart of this trust deficit lies a fundamental issue: centralization. The development and deployment of AI models have largely been the purview of a handful of tech giants. These centralized AI models operate as black boxes, their decision-making processes obscured from public scrutiny. This lack of transparency makes it virtually impossible to trust their decisions in high-stakes operations. How can we rely on an AI agent to make critical choices when we cannot understand or verify its reasoning?  Decentralization as the answer  However, a solution to these concerns does exist: decentralized AI. A paradigm that offers a path towards more transparent and trustworthy AI agents. This approach leverages the strengths of blockchain technology and other decentralized systems to create AI models that are not only powerful but also accountable.  The tools for building trust in AI agents already exist. Blockchains can enable verifiable computation, ensuring that AI actions are auditable and traceable. Every decision an AI agent makes could be recorded on a public ledger, allowing for unprecedented transparency. Concurrently, advanced cryptographic techniques like trusted execution environment machine learning (TeeML) can protect sensitive data and maintain model integrity, achieving both transparency and privacy.  As AI agents increasingly operate adjacent to or directly on public blockchains, the concept of verifiability becomes crucial. Traditional AI models may struggle to prove the integrity of their operations, but blockchain-based AI agents can provide cryptographic guarantees of their behavior. This verifiability is not just a technical nicety; it's a fundamental requirement for trust in high-stakes environments.  Confidential computing techniques, particularly trusted execution environments (TEEs), offer an important layer of assurance. TEEs provide a secure enclave where AI computations can occur, isolated from potential interference. This technology ensures that even the operators of the AI system cannot tamper with or spy on the agent's decision-making process, further bolstering trust.  Frameworks like the Oasis Network’s Runtime Off-chain Logic (ROFL) represent the cutting edge of this approach, enabling seamless integration of verifiable AI computation with on-chain auditability and transparency. Such innovations expand the possibilities for AI-driven applications while maintaining the highest standards of trust and transparency.  Towards a trustworthy AI future  The path to trustworthy AI agents is not without challenges. Technical hurdles remain, and widespread adoption of decentralized AI systems will require a shift in both industry practices and public understanding. However, the potential rewards are immense. Imagine a world where AI agents make critical decisions with full transparency, where their actions can be verified and audited by anyone, and where the power of artificial intelligence is distributed rather than concentrated in the hands of a few corporations.  There is also the chance to unlock significant economic growth, too. One 2023 study out of Beijing found that a 1% increase in AI penetration leads to a 14.2% increase in total factor productivity (TFP). However, most AI productivity studies focus on general LLMs, not AI agents. Autonomous AI agents capable of performing multiple tasks independently could potentially yield greater productivity gains. Trustworthy and auditable AI agents would likely be even more effective.  Perhaps it's time to update Skinner's famous quote. The real problem is no longer whether machines think, but whether we can trust their thoughts. With decentralized AI and blockchain, we have the tools to build that trust. The question now is whether we have the wisdom to use them.

42390304,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc40eb,1727714442,Bitcoin Retail Activity Remains Low Despite Recent Rally,"In previous crypto bull markets in 2017 and 2021, the Coinbase app was ranked number one in downloads versus the current 438.  The amount of bitcoin owned by short-term holders is approximately 2.5 million tokens, a level typically associated with bear markets.  NFT- related gas usage on the ether network has fallen to 2%, down significantly from its peak of around 40% in 2021.  One of the biggest questions in the crypto industry is whether retail is participating in this current rally. Retail entrance often marks a sign of euphoria or greed and, in some cases, is thought to be a leading indicator of a top in the market.  With bitcoin {{BTC}} gaining of late to within 15% of its record high, this article will explore what the retail activity is indicating.  Coinbase Rankings  One important indicator of retail participation is to check where crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) app ranks in app store downloads.  In the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, Coinbase became the number one downloaded app near those tops, and at bitcoin's recent market peak in March of this year, it ranked in the top 5,, according to @CoinbaseAppRankBot.  Coinbase currently is ranked just 438, not far above its lowest level of the year of about 500, indicating a continued lack of retail interest.  On-chain shows very little retail life  Investors who have bought bitcoin within the past 155 days are considered short-term holders (STHs).  This cohort tends to be those chasing the market, buying as the price starts to climb, and history shows peaks tend to correlate with high STH supply. Indeed, five recent major tops in bitcoin going back more than a decade have coincided with peaks in STH supply. This current rally, though, has come alongside a decline in STH supply, suggesting no top as of yet.  Retail activity by volume  Looking at transfer volumes by size, values below $100,000 are typically considered retail volume and anything above that level can be considered institutional.  Analyzing the past three bull runs, peak retail volume typically coincides at the top of bull markets. Currently, total retail transfer volume is only around half of what was seen in the 2024 peak.  Glassnode data also confirms that bitcoin fees are at cycle lows, roughly generating only $500k daily, while active addresses are below the 365-day moving average which shows a lack of daily active users.  NFT gas usage on ether is a ghost-town  Speculative trading on-chain, either through inscriptions on bitcoin, or transactions interacting with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on ether {ETH}}, is another retail participation indicator. In bull markets, we tend to see high fee levels as investors speculate on-chain, with the 2021 market top being a prime example. Currently, however, NFT gas usage on ether is only around 2% versus 2021 when the percentage of gas consumed was at 40%, according to Glassnode data.  Memecoin activity is surging  A different picture is suggested by the action in memecoins, where things are exploding. These tokens are largely a retail-driven category, according to X account @MustStopMurad, which did a presentation on the subject at Token 2049. Murad shows that new memes are up on aggregate by 2,040% and old memes as a whole are up 105% year-to-date.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/bitcoin-retail-activity-remains-low-despite-recent-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f649d1ff299d915ddc18c76bf672f93fa2f5225-1037x570.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34156426,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645458,1727712042,Crypto Guru Warns: Only 6 Years Left To ‘Make As Much Money As Possible’,"Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision and a recognized figure in the crypto community, has issued a stark warning about the rapidly approaching transformations in the global economy, driven by unprecedented technological advancements. In his latest video, Pal, who has long advocated for an understanding of what he calls the “exponential age,” claims that the coming years will bring about the largest changes humanity has ever experienced, due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. According to Pal, we are nearing what he terms the “economic singularity,” a point beyond which current economic, market, and business frameworks will no longer be applicable. “By about 2030, things are going to become not understandable by using the existing frameworks of economics, financial analysis, markets, and that kind of stuff,” Pal explains. Pal He asserts that AI and robotics are advancing at a pace that will soon outstrip human capacity to adapt under current economic systems. Falling birth rates and aging populations across developed nations are leading to a decline in the traditional economic drivers of GDP growth. Moreover, Pal notes that productivity has not kept up with technological capability, and most new debt is simply servicing old debts, not creating new economic value. Related Reading: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4 The most significant aspect of Pal’s warning concerns the role of AI in the economy. He believes that AI will reach and surpass human levels of intelligence across all areas of knowledge, fundamentally altering the landscape of labor and productivity. “AI is basically infinite human knowledge now As these models scale, the breakthroughs come through, and the average IQ of AI goes from 100 to 400, and then on to a million times the intelligence of a human,” Pal states. This immense growth in AI capabilities is expected to lead to what Pal describes as infinite productivity and a near-zero marginal cost of electricity, primarily due to advances in renewable energy technologies. He argues that these factors will lead to massive deflationary pressures as goods and services become increasingly inexpensive to produce. The Key Role Of Crypto Pal is particularly bullish on the transformative power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in this context. He describes a future economic model where “AI agents” perform tasks and transact autonomously using cryptocurrencies, given their ability to operate independently of traditional banking systems.

[…] I think we’ll use cryptocurrency to do that because last thing I checked, AI can’t get a bank account – it’s never going to transfer money over SWIFT, never going to happen,” Pal remarks. Pal urges viewers to recognize the urgency of investing in cryptocurrencies. He advises that the window for capitalizing on these technologies is closing fast, with only about six years left to make substantial gains before traditional economic and market structures transform irreversibly. “We’re going to have to go through this together and we have to be smart and try and figure it out as we go but I do know that this idea of 6 years to make as much money as possible is really important and I do think that the real answer to this, as far as I can see, is cryptocurrency because it is the best performing asset in the world and of all time. So I think that’s the one thing we can lean in, it has a huge future,” Pal says. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $63,588.

42390281,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc3z59,1727711480,MicroStrategy's Next Bitcoin Purchase Is Likely to Take Its Holdings Above Grayscale's GBTC,"MicroStrategy mights soon hold more bitcoin than Grayscale.  The company has used capital markets to continually raise money for additional bitcoin buys, while Grayscale has seen a large exit of tokens since the U.S. spot ETFs were introduced in January.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) could soon have bigger bitcoin {{BTC}} pockets than Grayscale.  The company held a total of 252,220 bitcoins, or 1.2% of the total supply which is capped at 21 million, per its latest regulatory filing on Sept. 20. Grayscale, which held upwards of 620,000 in its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) prior to the launch of the U.S. spot ETFs in January, currently holds just over 254,000 tokens split between GBTC and its newer lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).  Recent capital raises, though, have left MicroStrategy with more than $1 billion which the company has yet to put to work (or at least has not yet announced). Presumably, these funds will be used for more bitcoin, which would add thousands of more coins to its balance sheet and bring its holdings far above that of Grayscale.  This would also make MicroStrategy the fifth largest holder of the cryptocurrency, trailing only BlackRock, Binance, Satoshi Nakamoto and Coinbase. An important distinction, of course, is that BlackRock, Binance and Coinbase hold bitcoins for clients, not for their own account.  Under the leadership of then CEO and now Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy started purchasing bitcoin with cash from its balance sheet in August 2020. Since, it has aggressively used the capital markets to raise billions with which to continually add to holdings. The company's average purchase price is just over $39,000 versus bitcoin's current price of around $64,000. The stack today is worth about $16 billion.  As for Grayscale, which pioneered public access to bitcoin via funds, it chose to keep the fee for its GBTC at a relatively high 1.50% – more than 100 basis points above all competitors – following the conversion to a spot ETF. The result has been a fast bleed in its assets. The Bitcoin Mini Trust, which carries a far more competitive 0.15% fee, has managed to add assets, but holdings stood at just 33,753 tokens as of the end of last week.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/microstrategys-next-bitcoin-purchase-is-likely-to-take-its-holdings-above-grayscales-gbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd81ac431c4bac23f33cd9f6fe2741c1633da3f6-3512x1976.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390302,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc40ZT,1727710432,The Global Rate Cut Cycle Will Power Risk Assets Even Higher,"Global interest rate policy is headed even lower.  As human beings, we tend to focus on the micro. We spend the bulk of our lives figuring out how to better ourselves and achieve our maximum potential. Growing up, we focus on school and sports to get smart, build work ethic, and learn to work with others. And then as adults, we work to provide a better life for our children than the one experienced growing up.  Wall Street isn’t much different. Fund, managers, stock pickers, traders, you name it, all have areas where they’re experts. A fund manager might specialize in a certain investment strategy, an analyst in a specific sector, or a trader in a particular asset class. But most of the time, due to the multitude of opportunities, their focus tends to be on one country.  So, focusing on what’s happening in our immediate vicinity is almost ingrained. But, due to this concentration, we can sometimes miss the big picture events that are happening around us.  Often, I see this with central bank policy. Investors tend to focus on what’s happening at home with our economy and the Federal Reserve. Or, if they branch out, they’ll consider what’s happening in Europe and the European Central Bank (“ECB”).  But many times, investors on Wall Street and Main Street pay little heed to what’s happening in economies outside of those regions. Consequently, they pay even less attention to what’s happening at central banks outside of the majors. I get it, the U.S. and Europe (in aggregate) make up the world’s two largest economies.  Well, right now, based on what I’m seeing, those policymakers outside of the major economic centers are becoming more accommodative. In other words, it’s going to cost less to borrow money moving forward. That means global liquidity should improve, boosting the outlook for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us…  In late 2021/early 2022, the global economy watched inflation growth skyrocket. In 2020, most nations were dealing with pandemic-driven shutdowns. So, to keep people at home, governments provided individuals with all sorts of stimulus.  But then, it got worse. To boost economic output, even more money was introduced. In March 2021, our Congress passed a $2.1 trillion stimulus bill for just this purpose. However, lawmakers didn’t anticipate the savings boom as people worked from home.  Individual savings exploded. At one point, the number jumped to a record 32%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. And after a brief pullback, that same number shot back up to 26%. Those rates haven’t been seen before or since.  Now, all that cash was intended for things like mortgage payments and rent. But people had other ideas. They bought televisions, cars, and whatever they could get their hands on. This caused the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index (“CPI”) to shoot up to 9.1%, the highest level in over four decades.  But it wasn’t just a U.S. based phenomenon. It happened everywhere. Look at this chart of inflation growth in the U.S., Europe, England, and Japan, to see what I’m talking about…  On the left side of the chart, you see inflation growth in these nations is troughing not long after the pandemic, in late 2020/early 2021. Then as stimulus efforts build, inflation takes off. In the middle of the chart, you’ll notice CPI growth starts to peak in mid-2022.  That’s due to the aggressive rate hikes done by the Bank of England (“BOE”), ECB, and the Fed.  On the left side of the above chart, you see interest rates started rising in early 2022. That was several months before inflation growth peaked. And then as we move further out in 2022 and into 2023, we see policy tightening gets more aggressive.  But if we reference our CPI chart, we notice something else is happening… as rates go up rapidly, inflation rolls over. The further we move right on the graph, inflation keeps falling. In fact, by the time the BOE, ECB, and Fed finally stop raising rates, CPI growth in each of those economic regions has been cut in half from the peaks.  Taking it one step more, let’s go back and look at the right side of each chart. In our CPI example, we notice inflation growth in England, Europe, and the U.S. is now around 2.5%. Those are the lowest levels since early 2021 and close to the global central bank target of roughly 2%. As a result, interest rates have started to drop.  So now, let’s look at what’s happening in other parts of the world.  I chose Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland. It’s not that any of them are inconsequential, but if you ask someone to name a major economy, I’ll bet none of those nations come up. In terms of central banks, the Bank of Canada might have a shot, but the Swiss National Bank and Riksbank are afterthoughts.  Yet, according to the World Bank. Canada makes up 2.1% of global GDP, Switzerland almost 1% and Sweden 0.6%. That makes them the world’s ninth, twentieth, and twenty-third largest economies. In other words, they control a lot of spending power.  Look at this chart of inflation growth in those three nations.  It looks a lot like the earlier example…. Inflation took off in 2021… peaked in 2022… and now, it’s at or below the global 2% target.  As a result, they’re all starting to slash interest rates…  The above chart shows us the Bank of Canada, the Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, have all lowered rates three times this year. In addition, they’ve all said inflation growth is slowing more rapidly than anticipated, so they’re prepared to cut even more.  Here’s why it matters.  Like I said above, none of these are economies that come to the front of people’s minds. However, they’re some of the most important in the world. So, the spending power of their citizens is important to global growth. And, at the same time, the investing power of those same people is equally important to global markets.  If each of these central banks has already cut rates three times and it tends to cut more, that means one thing…. the cost to borrow money in each of those nations is getting cheaper. That means fund managers and individual investors in those countries will be more willing to leverage up and take risks.  As those institutions and individuals look for compelling returns, they’ll inevitably turn to cryptocurrencies. U.S. markets will be a popular destination for many of those funds given the economic growth picture and technology revolution that’s taking place. And all that money is put to work, it should underpin a steady rally in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.

One project, BabyBNB, achieved a market cap peak of $132 million shortly after launch and was listed on exchanges like MEXC and Gate.  GraFun introduced the ""Fair Curve"" model to reduce fraud and price manipulation in token launches.  The new GraFun launchpad and trading platform introduced memecoins that bagged over $250 million in volume from their automated deployment to PancakeSwap in the first 24 hours after the platform’s launch, according to one of the developers behind Floki, which is supporting the platform.  GraFun, released Friday on BNB Chain, saw over 5,800 tokens created on its first day, generating around $100,000 in fees for the blockchain. One GraFun-originated project, BabyBNB, reached a peak market cap of $132 million a day after issue and was eventually listed on centralized exchanges MEXC and Gate.     ""Floki is actively supporting GraFun, as we think it is poised to disrupt the memecoin ecosystem on BNB chain due to its innovative memecoin launch mechanics,” developer B said in a message.

Chintai is a blockchain focused on real-world assets (RWAs), regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for dealing in capital markets products.  Asset manager Kin Capital is launching a $100 million tokenized real estate debt fund on the real world asset-centric network Chintai, the parties told CoinDesk exclusively.  The fund holds first performing real estate trust deeds, which are agreements between borrower and lender to have the property held in a neutral, independent third-party trust until the loan is paid off.  The initial offering is a $5 million tranche, with additional offerings planned through 2024 and early 2025. The fund is accessible to accredited investors with a minimum investment limit of $50,000. The projected return of the fund is 14%-15% annually with quarterly distributions to investors.  Fund tokenization is one of the frontiers of bringing traditional investment vehicles, also referred to as real-world assets (RWA), to blockchain rails in pursuit of greater efficiency, lower costs and instant, around-the-clock settlements. Reports by Boston Consulting Group and 21Shares forecast over $10 trillion of tokenized assets by the end of the decade in their optimistic scenarios, while McKinsey has predicted $2 trillion by then in its base case with broad-scale adoption still being far.  Chintai is a layer-1 blockchain for tokenized real-world assets, with its native token CHEX powering the network. Chintai Network Services Pte Ltd, the network's ecosystem development firm, is regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to act as a Capital Markets Services provider and a Recognized Market Operator for primary issuance and secondary market trading in digital securities, according to the project's white paper. The network's other business unit, Chintai Nexus, is based on the British Virgin Islands and deals in issuing non-security tokens. Kin Capital operates a blockchain-based marketplace for real-estate focused investment funds.

42407529,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGtO,1727707423,Trump Inches Closer to Harris on Polymarket as Betting Passes $1 Billion,"This week in prediction markets:  $1 billion has been traded on Polymarket's Trump vs. Harris market, with the vice president in the lead.  Market is skeptical bitcoin's rally will last.  ""Black Myth: Wukong"" was a major hit for China's game industry. But the market doubts it will win Game of the Year.  Polymarket bettors have now put over $1 billion on the question of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will take the White House in November. While Trump appears to be closing the gap – Harris now only leads by one point – swing state markets are telling a different story.  Data from the prediction market site gives Harris a greater chance of winning four of the six key swing states, which is unsurprising as those four have historically leaned Democrat.  Data from poll aggregator 270ToWin shows that Pennsylvania and Michigan went to the Democrats in the last seven elections, with the exception of 2016, where they voted Republican. In the 1980s, these two states were consistently red given the popularity of Ronald Reagan, which led to a clear victory for his vice president and successor, George H.W. Bush.  Wisconsin has caught the interest of many poll watchers who call it one of the more competitive states. Wisconsin voted for Donald Trump in 2016, breaking a streak of Democratic wins, and has often shown tighter races between the two parties.  A recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows that the race in Wisconsin is extremely close, with Harris at 49% and Trump at 47%.  Polymarket, however, gives Harris a clean lead in the Badger State, pricing her at 56 cents a share compared to 44 cents for Trump.  Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 for dollars) if the candidate wins, and nothing if it doesn't, so the market is signaling Harris has a 56% chance of carrying Wisconsin.  It's also important to note that polling in Wisconsin often misses the mark, and the state has been decided by less than a point in four of the last six presidential elections.  So the question could be, which is more accurate: unreliable pollsters or political gamblers? Now that Polymarket has cracked the Apple App Store's list of top magazine and newspaper apps, let's see if these degen politics junkies can give pollsters a run for their money in these swing states.  Doubts about Bitcoin rally  There's a strong bullish case for bitcoin, given the Fed's recent rate cut, the People's Bank of China's liquidity injection, and consistent inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.  Some market observers are basing their bullishness for bitcoin based on the increased buying of call options priced at $75,000 combined with increased sales of puts.  A call option gives the holder the right to buy bitcoin at a set price later, signaling bullish sentiment, while put buying reflects bearish hedging.  However, traders on Polymarket are skeptical about all of this, only giving a 41% chance the cryptocurrency will trade above $65,000 on Oct. 4.  Traders could be considering the possibility that bitcoin is drifting into ""overbought"" territory, a product of a price surge that ran a bit too hot.  CoinDesk reported Monday that this perception, reflected in the Crypto Greed and Fear Index, suggests a potential pullback is in the works, especially with the upcoming U.S. ISM Manufacturing data, which has historically triggered price drops if it signals weaker economic conditions.  Over on Kalshi, the U.S.-regulated, dollar-denominated prediction market, bettors remain generally optimistic for bitcoin's price stability, giving it a 47% chance of finishing the year above $75,000 and a 34% chance of it topping $80,000. Traders are also confident that it will cross its previous all-time high of $73,200 this year, giving this a 58% chance of happening.  Gambling on gaming  The video game Black Myth: Wukong has found success worldwide – a notable achievement for a Chinese gaming industry that was nearly suffocated by Beijing's regulation. But Kalshi bettors doubt it will win Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards.  Bettors on the platform are giving only a 23% chance of the game claiming the title, instead putting their money behind Astro Bot, with a 64% chance.  While Astro Bot has garnered rave reviews, it's not the cultural phenomenon that Black Myth: Wukong is.  Beijing put the brakes on its fast-growing domestic gaming industry in 2021, refusing to grant licenses for new titles after calling the medium ""spiritual opium."" The government had grown progressively more annoyed with the industry's reliance on ""loot boxes,"" in-game spending, and incentives for players to log in daily.  The industry was unfrozen in 2022 after promising to reform itself and move away from freemium titles reliant on cash grabs.  That's when Black Myth: Wukong was born.  Unlike the games China's industry was known for, Black Myth is a narrative-driven role-playing game inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West (which holds the same weight in China's literary canon as Homer's Odyssey does in the West). It's designed to be a slow burn.  The game is a massive hit in China, selling over 4.5 million copies in-country in its first week, and has found a following on the international digital game store Steam where it's the fifth most popular game, with nearly 250,000 concurrent players.  Even Tron's Justin Sun was a fan of the game, changing his profile picture on X to its protagonist monkey.  Which, of course, led to memecoins.  But this doesn't make it game-of-the-year material for Kalshi's bettors.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/trump-inches-closer-to-harris-on-polymarket-as-betting-passes-1-billion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9aa574d7edcf143ec2c8175594fca86b3ea253d-1920x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This upward move marks Bitcoin’s first major break above a local top since March 2024. The timing aligns with the start of October, historically the month with the highest median price increase for Bitcoin, with a median return of 27.7 percent and an average return of 22.9 percent. These strong historical trends, along with the upcoming Q4, which also typically sees the highest average quarterly returns, have bolstered optimism for further gains. However, while Bitcoin has reclaimed key on-chain levels such as the Short-Term Holder Realised Price (currently $62,750), there are warning signs . Spot market buying, which had been aggressive since the September 6th local bottom, has recently flattened , suggesting that the market may be reaching a temporary equilibrium. Additionally, BTC open interest (OI) has surged , exceeding $35 billion, a level that has historically correlated with local price peaks. This raises concerns of potential market overheating, although a modest 5-10 percent pullback could reset OI without disrupting the overall uptrend. Bitcoin remains in a large consolidation range between $50,000 and $68,000, reminiscent of its halving year performance in 2020. If historical trends hold , Bitcoin could be poised for a new all-time high by the end of Q4 2024 or early 2025, supported by declining exchange reserves and reduced passive selling pressure. The economic landscape in the US for August and early September reflects a mixed, yet cautiously optimistic outlook. Inflation has slowed , registering its smallest annual increase in over three and a half years, signalling growing economic stability. This is reinforced by robust economic growth, with the second quarter of 2024 seeing a three percent annualised rise in gross domestic product. However, consumer confidence – recorded before the Fed announced a cut in rates this month – took a sharp downturn in September, marking its most significant decline in three years, largely driven by concerns over the labour market. Despite these anxieties, there is a surprising surge in households planning to purchase homes within the next six months, offering a potential sign of resilience in an increasingly hopeful economic environment. The latest developments in the cryptocurrency industry highlight both progress and ongoing concerns. US businesses now have the ability to buy, hold, sell, and transfer cryptocurrencies, but scepticism lingers over the non-custodial nature of these models, with many in the crypto community feeling that platforms like PayPal , with their centralised approach, undermine the decentralisation that is core to the crypto ethos. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to strengthen US leadership in emerging technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency, as part of her vision for an “opportunity economy” aimed at enhancing the nation’s global competitiveness in the digital era. In the corporate space, Ethena is set to launch a new stablecoin , UStb, backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund in partnership with Securitize. This stablecoin offers a more stable alternative to their existing USDe stablecoin and can be used as margin collateral on exchanges, catering to a different risk profile. These advancements reflect a dynamic landscape where innovation continues to grow, even as debates over the principles of decentralisation persist. Have a great trading week!

34153875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645426,1727706626,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi,"Since their approval in January 2024, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been steadily gaining traction in the United States, with the issuers buying hundreds of thousands of BTC as their popularity spread. This has led to a large stash of BTC by these issuers as BlackRock leads the charge. Given their buying spree so far, the number of BTC being held by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been rising and is almost at the 1 million mark, Spot Bitcoin ETFs Now Hold 924,768 BTC The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a total of 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading back in January 2024. Now, only eight months later, these ETFs have managed to acquire more than 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Combined, this makes the Spot Bitcoin ETFs some of the largest BTC holders. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC Battle Far From Over As Regulator Opposes Court’s Decision So far, the BlackRock IBIT has been one of the largest buyers of BTC, surpassing even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had a 600,000 BTC head start. Currently, Grayscale holds more than 350,000 BTC, making the firm a top Bitcoin holder. Grayscale is still in second place when it comes to the number of BTC held. However, the Bitcoin fund has recorded more outflows than inflows since January, losing more than half of its stash before the Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Now, Grayscale holds less than 250,000 BTC after losing more than $20 billion to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs due to their lower fees. Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs such as the Fidelity FBTC and the Ark Invest/21Shares ARKB has reached almost 50,000 BTC. So far, the funds have been able to garner 924,768 BTC, putting their total holdings very close to the 1 million BTC milestone. In total, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs now boast 4.685 of the total Bitcoin supply. Top Addresses With Largest Holdings The top Bitcoin wallet with the largest BTC holdings still remains the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet with 1.1 million BTC in it. However, this wallet has been long dormant, and often left out of the top Bitcoin wallets list due to its inactivity.

34153269,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24218,1727704191,"Bitfinex Among First to List EIGEN, Native Token of EigenLayer","ROAD TOWN, Tortola, British Virgin Islands – 30th September 2024 – Bitfinex ( https://www.bitfinex.com ), a leading digital asset trading platform, announced today that it would be among the first exchanges to list EIGEN, the native token of EigenLayer , a decentralised restaking protocol designed to enhance security and innovation within blockchain networks. EigenLayer’s platform continues to grow rapidly, raising in February 2024, an additional $170 million in venture funding, and now has a total value locked surpassing $20 billion. By expanding Ethereum’s existing security infrastructure, EigenLayer allows developers to create new services that leverage the protection of Ethereum’s staked assets. This innovation provides new services with immediate economic security, while stakers benefit by earning additional rewards through restaking their assets across multiple platforms. The EIGEN token is designed to empower the EigenLayer ecosystem, offering a complementary role to ETH restaking. It introduces a mechanism to address “intersubjective” faults—behaviours that are not identifiable on-chain but still warrant penalties. This mechanism allows EIGEN to handle these faults without forking the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring the security and integrity of the network. EIGEN also enhances the capacity of what can be developed on EigenLayer, enabling a wide range of applications such as transaction ordering, databases, storage services, oracles, and artificial intelligence processors. At the same time, investors benefit by earning additional rewards via restacking their assets across multiple platforms, driving security and innovation in the ecosystem. “We are excited to list EIGEN on Bitfinex and support EigenLayer’s pioneering approach to staking,” said Henry Child, Head of Tokens at Bitfinex. “EigenLayer’s mission to bolster blockchain protection while fostering innovation aligns perfectly with our commitment to supporting transformative projects in the digital asset space.” Deposits for EIGEN are expected to be opened at 4:00 AM UTC on 01 October, 2024, subject to network conditions. Trading is planned to commence at approximately 5:00 AM UTC on 1 October 2024, contingent upon liquidity requirements being met. EIGEN will be tradable against US Dollars (EIGEN/USD) and Tether tokens (EIGEN/USDt).

SOL price is consolidating and might aim for a fresh increase above the $162 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $155 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading near $155 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key rising channel forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $155 support zone. Solana Price Regains Traction Solana price extended its increase above the $155 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL even climbed above $160 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $162 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $160 and $158 levels. However, the bulls were active near the $155 support zone. A low is formed at $155 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $162 swing high to the $155 low. Solana is now trading near $155 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key rising channel forming with support at $155 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $158 level. The next major resistance is near the $160 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $162 swing high to the $155 low. The main resistance could be $162. A successful close above the $160 and $162 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $175. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Downsides in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $158 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 level. The first major support is near the $154 level. A break below the $154 level might send the price toward the $149 zone. If there is a close below the $149 support, the price could decline toward the $142 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level.

The price is now trading above $0.6250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $0.6500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.6500 and $0.6550 resistance levels. XRP Price Settles Above $0.60 XRP price started a major increase above the $0.60 resistance, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum. The bulls were able to pump the price above the $0.6120 and $0.6250 resistance levels. It even broke the $0.650 resistance. A high was formed at $0.6642 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $0.6550 and $0.6500 levels. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6082 swing low to the $0.6642 high. The price is now trading above $0.6250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.650 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $0.6500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.6550 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6640. A clear move above the $0.6640 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.700 resistance or even $0.720 in the near term. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $0.650 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.6350 level. The next major support is near the $0.6285 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6082 swing low to the $0.6642 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.6285 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.6120 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.600.

34152236,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645456,1727701257,BNB Rally Fades As Price Dips Under $600: Is A Correction Looming?,"BNB‘s recent rally appears to be losing steam, as the price has dipped below the crucial $600 mark. After a strong upward surge that reignited bullish sentiment, the momentum is now showing signs of cooling off. This dip raises concerns about whether the rally can sustain itself or if a broader correction is on the horizon. As selling pressure increases and the market cools, this article seeks to explore whether BNB’s rally is losing steam after dipping below the key $600 level. By analyzing technical indicators, market sentiment, and price action, we aim to evaluate the potential for a deeper correction or a renewed bullish push. Current Market Conditions: Analyzing The Position Of BNB Recently, BNB has taken a bearish turn on the 4-hour chart after struggling to break above the significant resistance level of $605. This failure to maintain upward movement has led to a decline, bringing the asset down to the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Furthermore, a breach below this moving average could intensify selling pressure, while a bounce back might indicate a possible reversal. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests bullish momentum may wane. Currently, the RSI has fallen to around 36%, indicating that the buying pressure is diminishing. An RSI below 40 can signal that an asset is entering oversold territory, which often precedes further declines or the possibility of a price correction. Related Reading: BNB Price Surge Eyes $550 Breakout: Can It Push Higher? Also, on the daily chart, BNB is exhibiting significant negative movement, as reflected by a series of bearish candlesticks. This ongoing downward trend highlights a prevailing selling pressure within the market. Although BNB is currently trading above the 100-day SMA, which is typically seen as a bullish indicator, the strength of the bearish candlesticks suggests that upward momentum may be limited. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a closer examination of the RSI formation reveals that the RSI signal line has dipped to 53%, approaching the crucial 50% threshold. As the RSI approaches this level, it may heighten the risk of additional declines if it falls below 50, reinforcing the bearish sentiment in the market. Will The 100-Day SMA Hold? Currently, BNB is trading just above the 100-day SMA, which has historically served as a strong indicator of market sentiment. If the price breaks below the 100-day SMA, it could trigger increased selling pressure, leading to an extended drop toward the $531 support level. Related Reading: BNB Price Struggles to Hold $500: Is a Breakout Coming? In the event that BNB maintains its position above the 100-day SMA, it may indicate a potential rebound and restore bullish sentiment, allowing the price to begin climbing back toward the $605 resistance level. A successful breakout above this mark could pave the way for more price growth toward other resistance levels, increasing optimism among traders and signaling a more sustained upward trend.

42407524,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGgA,1727701200,Crypto Poll: U.S. Voters More Serious About Demanding Candidates With Know-How,"A poll funded by Grayscale provides the newest snapshot of voters' crypto views, and it reflects an increase in prominence of digital assets as a political issue.  Also out Monday, Coinbase released an analysis of crypto voters, showing the block of voters who care a lot about digital assets could be more than enough to swing the presidential election outcome in several battleground states.  A new industry-funded poll underlines the rising role of crypto in the thinking of likely voters in the 2024 U.S. elections – and the mention of digital assets by the presidential candidates of both major parties suggests the campaigns are aware of that.  The latest look, conducted by Harris Poll and paid for by crypto firm Grayscale, shows a steady increase in voters saying they're taking a candidate's crypto knowledge and stance seriously when considering who to vote for. Of more than 1,800 likely voters, 77% said presidential candidates should be informed about innovative technology like artificial intelligence and crypto, and 56% said they're more likely to vote for candidates who are staying on top of crypto as an issue (though their top issues remain inflation, national security and foreign policy).  The perception among those surveyed is that Republicans have a slight but growing edge over Democrats in being favorable for crypto investors.  Grayscale has fielded a few similar polls since last year, and over that period, a growing number of respondents – now 46% – agree with the concept that crypto and blockchain represent the ""future of finance.""  An increasing share of the voters – ticking slowly up to 21%, or about one in five – hold some kind of cryptocurrency (usually bitcoin) as an investment, according to the poll. Over the series of three snapshots of voter sentiment, those who've purchased crypto are increasingly saying they're doing so because a financial adviser recommended it – 27% of them in this latest poll, which is up seven percentage points from the previous one earlier this year.  But since the first poll in December, the number of voters aware of crypto has risen from a minority of 47% to a slight majority of 53%. About half of those responding said they're waiting for regulations to kick in before they consider putting money into cryptocurrencies.  These insights into crypto voting arrive the day before the vice-presidential candidates are set to debate in New York, marking about five weeks remaining until the polls open on Nov. 5. While crypto has been especially prominent among Republican politicians – most notably former President Donald Trump and his sudden 2024 embrace of the industry – the Democrats have generally taken a more cautious approach. Vice President Kamala Harris made a brief mention of favoring crypto innovation but isn't expected to go much deeper than that.  Read More: Candidate Harris Unlikely to Make Full-Throated Crypto Policy Before Election: Source  The industry has spent unprecedented amounts of money to help its favored candidates win almost two dozen congressional primaries, and its well-known $169 million political action committees have recently spent $40 million in one of the highest-stakes Senate races in Ohio. But so far, the industry's leading super PAC (Fairshake) hasn't picked a side in the presidential contest.  However, crypto investors have a chance to make themselves heard in the race for the White House, according to an analysis released Monday by Coinbase Inc. A look at voter data in the election's battleground states, conducted by Morning Consult, said that the total number of cryptocurrency investors in the seven key states is about 16 times more people than the vote differentials in the 2020 election – when President Joe Biden beat Trump.  The analysis suggested crypto owners are typically younger and racially diverse, and 70% of them earn less than $100,000 a year. Right now, they're evenly split between favoring Trump and Harris, Morning Consult reported, though the crypto owners are slightly more likely to be Democrats or independents than Republicans.  The research firm determined some additional things about crypto owners: 18% are moms with at least one child at home, 41% listen to country music and 71% of Gen Z crypto owners say they ponder digital assets at least as much as they think about Taylor Swift. Also, potentially more on-point for politicians, 81% of crypto owners think the lack of U.S. regulations is getting in the way of wider adoption.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/30/crypto-poll-us-voters-more-serious-about-demanding-candidates-with-know-how,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4703ae1fa6d80c9c7ac868f81023b95fddb9979-4912x2763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407528,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGq5,1727699735,Bitcoin Tumbles Back Below $64K as Surprise Japan Prime Minister Choice Triggers 5% Plunge in Nikkei,"A surprise choice as Japan's next prime minister renewed fears of BOJ tightening, sending markets lower.  Overbought conditions left bitcoin vulnerable to a selloff.  This week brings a number of key U.S. economic reports and Fedspeak which could affect the outlook for rates and prices.  After a quick roughly 14% run higher following the U.S. Federal Reserve's 50 basis point rate cut nearly two weeks ago, conditions seemed ripe for something to set off a sizable selloff in bitcoin {{BTC}}, and the selection of a new prime minister in Japan over the weekend appeared to be the trigger.  In a surprise choice, that country's ruling party selected Shigeru Ishiba to be its next prime minister. Without getting too much into the inside baseball of Japan's Liberal Democratic party, it's commonly believed that Ishiba is supportive of the Bank of Japan's plan to return monetary policy to normalcy, i.e. higher interest rates. Following his selection as prime minister, Ishiba called for snap elections to be held in late October.  Recall, it was the BOJ's very modest rate hike in late July that caused a violent unwind in the so-called yen carry trade and subsequent global panic in financial markets, sending bitcoin plunging from about $70,000 to below $50,000 in the space of a few days.  The selling was so ugly that the BOJ had to send out a former official to try and calm markets by saying the bank wasn't going to hike rates again in 2024.  The selection of Ishiba over the weekend, however, triggered another rise in the yen and a quick 5% decline in Japan's Nikkei stock average, with the selling apparently spreading to bitcoin, which quickly fell from about the $66,000 to as low as $63,300. It's bounced to $63,800 at press time, down about 3% from late Friday.  European stocks are lower by roughly 1% at midday and U.S. stock index futures are showing just modest losses.  Bitcoin vulnerable after big run higher  Prior to the weekend action, bitcoin had been enjoying a strong bull run since the Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in mid-September. Helping the move was China launching its own wave of monetary and fiscal stimulus to help boost that country's economy and markets. After enjoying its best week in more than a decade, the Shanghai Composite soared another 8% on Monday.  A number of indicators late last week, pointed to overbought conditions, among them, said CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten, were perpetual funding rates for bitcoin futures. Van Straten noted that they've risen to levels near those seen just prior to the late July and last August selloffs.  Looking ahead  This week brings the start of a new month and with it a number of key economic reports and central bank talk. Later on Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could comment on the economic and monetary policy outlook in a speech at the annual meeting for the National Association for Business Economics.  Tuesday and Thursday will see U.S. manufacturing and service sector reports from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the main event will be Friday with the September jobs report.  The data could go a long way in influencing the Fed's rate decision at its next policy meeting in early November (right after the presidential election). At the moment, markets are giving about a two-in-three chance of a 25 basis point Fed rate cut, according to CME FedWatch. It was the Fed somewhat surprisingly moving 50 instead of 25 at its September meeting which triggered this most recent bull move. A sizable change in the November rate cut odds might again affect the price path.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/bitcoin-tumbles-back-below-64k-as-surprise-japan-prime-minister-choice-triggers-5-plunge-in-nikkei,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80f2f833ba0f2c369edfb8875c4b8cbd636e7e6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407535,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLH00,1727698005,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Drops 3%, Still on Track for Best September Since 2013","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,051.40 -1.96%  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,664.19 -3.04%  Ether (ETH): $2,612.27 -1.46%  S&P 500: 5,738.17 -0.13%  Gold: $2,638.39 -0.96%  Nikkei 225: 37,919.55 -4.8%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $64,000 during the European morning, losing 3% in the last 24 hours. The drop seems to be a typical bull-market pullback that follows overbought conditions, according to 10x Research. ""We noted that BTC appears to be overbought in the short term, as reflected by the heightened levels of the Greed & Fear index. Current short-term reversal signals have turned bearish, indicating that a pullback is likely over the next few days,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk. The wider digital asset market is 1.8% lower, the CoinDesk 20 Index shows.  September is historically the worst month for the bitcoin price, but it may be about to close its best yet. BTC ended September in the red in eight of the past 11 years. This year, it looks set to close the month up by at least 7%, even with today's swoon. The bullish month puts bitcoin on a strong footing going into October, which, by contrast, is one of its strongest. Where September has seen an average loss of 3.6% since 2013, October has seen average gains of 23%. Some traders are targeting a run to as high as $70,000 in the coming weeks. A green September has always resulted in bitcoin closing higher in October, November and December.  Digital asset funds saw inflows of $1.2 billion last week, the largest total since the week ended July 19, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares. The additions marked the third consecutive week of inflows and were attributed to expectations of further interest-rate cuts by the Fed. U.S.-based funds accounted for $1.17 billion of the $1.2 billion of inflows. The U.S. bitcoin ETF sector received a boost recently with SEC approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's IBIT, the largest of the spot BTC funds in the U.S. Bitcoin funds saw over $1 billion of inflows. Ether products added $87 million to break a five-week losing streak and net ""the first measurable inflows since early-August,"" according to the report.  Chart of the Day  Sui blockchain's native token SUI has more than doubled to $1.73 this month, the highest since April, outperforming other top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value.  Later Monday, about 64.19 million SUI, worth over $100 million, are scheduled for unlock, releasing 2.4% of the cryptocurrency's circulating supply, according to TokenUnlocks.

34149790,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645439,1727695811,Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst,"Solana (SOL) is now trading around a crucial supply zone after an impressive 26% surge since September 18, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of interest rate cuts. This sharp rally has sparked optimism among analysts and investors, who hope Solana could soon reach new all-time highs. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon Many in the crypto space believe Solana is primed for further gains, with some expecting it to outperform the broader market in the coming months. One prominent analyst, Carl Runefelt, has shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the potential for a parabolic move once SOL breaks through its yearly high. With growing attention to Solana’s strong fundamentals and technical strength, the market is closely watching to see if SOL can maintain its upward trajectory and deliver the explosive gains many anticipate. As Solana hovers near these key levels, the next few days could be critical in determining whether it will continue its upward march or face renewed selling pressure. Solana To $200 Before New ATH Solana (SOL) is now testing a key liquidity area, and investors are closely watching for the next price move. After a bullish run over the past two weeks, many expect a surge that could push SOL higher. However, some concerns remain that Solana might underperform this cycle compared to other leading altcoins, which have shown stronger market activity. Prominent crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed analysis on X, highlighting a bullish “cup and handle” pattern forming in Solana’s price action. This pattern, often seen as a signal for continued upward momentum, has a clear resistance level of around $200. Runefelt believes that once Solana breaks past this key level, the price could go parabolic, with the next major target being the all-time high (ATH) of around $260. In his analysis, Runefelt emphasizes that breaking through the $200 resistance will be crucial for Solana’s price action. Once this happens, he predicts a rapid and aggressive move to new highs. The cup and handle formation is a classic bullish continuation pattern frequently leading to sharp price increases, suggesting that Solana could be set for a major breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? With the market sentiment still bullish and Solana testing critical levels, the next few weeks could determine whether the asset will achieve the explosive gains many anticipate. SOL Testing Crucial Supply Solana (SOL) is trading at $156, following a 13% move from last week’s lows. The price has successfully reclaimed the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $154, holding it as support—a bullish signal that could propel SOL to higher levels shortly. However, SOL is facing resistance at the $163 local high, where it has been struggling to break through. Bulls need to push the price past this critical level to trigger a rally toward the yearly high of around $210. This would further strengthen the positive sentiment around Solana as investors and traders look for confirmation of a larger upward move. On the downside, if SOL fails to break past the $163 resistance, a retracement to lower demand levels around $140 becomes more likely. This would represent a critical test for the asset, as a failure to hold support at these lower levels could weaken the bullish momentum built over the past few weeks.

A reading below 48 could yield a deeper price drop, one observer said.  The ISM data is scheduled for release Tuesday.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} faced selling pressure during the European morning, reminiscent of the price swoon seen ahead of the release of key U.S. data in the past couple of months.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value fell nearly 3% on Monday to $63,600, breaching support of a bullish trendline that represented the rally from the Sept. 6 low of $52,600 to last week's highs near $66,500, data from CoinDesk and TradingView show. Futures tied to the S&P 500 were little changed near record highs and the dollar index was steady at 100.30.  The slide seems to be a typical bull-market pullback that follows overbought conditions, according to 10x Research.  ""In last week's report, we briefly noted that BTC appears to be overbought in the short term, as reflected by the heightened levels of the Greed & Fear index,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk."" Current short-term reversal signals have turned bearish, indicating that a pullback is likely over the next few days.""  Thielen added that since June, the first week of the month – when U.S. ISM Manufacturing data is released – has been characterized by 10% price sell-offs. The latest decline is consistent with that pattern.  The September report will be released Tuesday and is expected to show that manufacturing activity continued to contract in the final month of the third quarter, according to FXStreet.  ""The ISM Manufacturing New Orders data shows forward-looking indicators have fallen to near-recession levels. This makes tomorrow's data highly uncertain—if the reading falls below 48.0, it could prompt another Bitcoin drop, while a higher number might fuel a rally,"" Thielen said in a note to clients while maintaining a bullish outlook for the fourth quarter.  Optimism about the fourth quarter largely stems from expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver another 50 basis-point cut in interest rates and China's recent big stimulus announcement.  The market might get a clue of what the Fed plans to do later today because Fed Chair Powell is scheduled to speak on the economy at the National Association for Business Economics annual meeting in Tennessee.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/overbought-bitcoin-drops-below-64k-as-ism-manufacturing-data-looms-10x-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9cbbebd14a1bf30c4d1a4424e383b83a8314021-2710x1440.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges By 81% Data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn shows that the meme coin’s burn rate has surged by 81% in the last 24 hours, with 3.7 million coins burnt during this period. Meanwhile, the burn rate has surged by an impressive 3,600% in the last seven days, with 2 billion coins burnt during this period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Could Catapult Price To New All-Time High – Here’s Why The surge in Shiba Inu’s burn rate is significant, indicating that the bulls are back in the meme coin’s ecosystem. Since an accumulation trend typically leads to a transaction spike, more SHIB tokens are usually burnt as investors accumulate the meme coin. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock also confirms that these Shiba Inu whales have been actively buying the meme coin. Large transactions have surged by over 13% in the last seven days, with trillions of Shiba Inu tokens traded during this period. In the last 24 hours, these bulls have traded two trillion SHB tokens. Meanwhile, the large transactions reached a recent high on September 26, when nine trillion SHIB tokens were traded. Shiba Inu’s price has also reacted accordingly to these bullish metrics, surging by over 26% in the last seven days. This rally is expected to extend in October as the meme coin could be on the verge of a historic run. Shiba Inu has always recorded positive monthly returns in October, and this time isn’t expected to be different. Moreover, the broader crypto market outlook is bullish, which supports Shiba Inu reaching new highs next month. Specifically, there have been projections that Bitcoin (BTC) could reclaim the $70,000 price level in October. Therefore, given Shiba Inu’s strong positive price correlation with BTC, it will run as the flagship crypto moves to the upside. SHIB Can Rise To As High As $0.000081 Soon Enough Crypto analyst Javon Marks has predicted that the meme coin can rise to as high as $0.000081 soon enough. He claimed its price had responded massively after noticing multiple confirmed hidden bullish divergences. In line with this, he added that an extended rally towards $0.000081 looks to be in progress. Related Reading: PEPE Confirms Breakout From Symmetrical Triangle: How Far Can It Go? That represents a price rally of over 300% for Shiba Inu. Marks had also previously predicted that Shiba Inu would delete another zero from its price in this bull run, indicating that the meme coin could still rise higher even after it reaches the $0.000081 price level. Interestingly, crypto analyst Smile recently predicted that the meme coin could rise as high as $0.05 by 2025. However, for its price to get close to that level, a significant amount of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply will need to be burnt.

34144761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645406,1727685014,Record September Gives Bitcoin 82% Odds For An Ultra Bullish Q4: Analyst,"Crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) posits a strong bullish outlook for Bitcoin in the fourth quarter of 2024. Leveraging historical data, Astronomer provides an analysis via X, suggesting an 82% probability of an ultra bullish trend based on the performance of Bitcoin in September. The crypto analyst opens his analysis with an emphasis on the unexpected positive performance of Bitcoin in September. “September is about to close and to the general public’s surprise, it’s looking like it’s going to be green (by a long shot), with the chance of setting the greenest September in 2024, supporting our breakout thesis we have been on for a while now,” he writes. Delving into the sentiment of the market, Astronomer notes a significant disconnect between public perception and actual market positions. “And although we’re not the only ones anymore that are on the full bull thesis, data is and remains data. And after thorough inspection, despite the talking/analysis posts, most are not positioned yet, took profit too early or will cheer for dips and say they are a gift for the reason of wanting one,” he explained. Related Reading: 3 Reasons Bitcoin Price Rally Is At Risk – Details He further elaborates on the sentiment within closed circles: “This observation is not just coming from public posts or Twitter, but also from the array of paid groups partaken in to conduct these analyses. Not allowed to share names or details, but most groups indeed are long and took profit early, are looking for an entry, or are short. So the market’s hand seems to be working.” 82% Chance Bitcoin Will Be Bullish Astronomer’s bullish thesis leans on historical data, particularly the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin price. “The data analysis is fairly simple here: each time BTC had a green September, it was followed by no less than three green months after, i.e., a green October, November, and December. And this has happened 3/3 times since BTC inception,” he asserts, signifying a strong seasonal pattern. However, he is quick to temper this with a critique of his methodology, admitting to the potential pitfalls of low data samples: “Now like I said, I am not the biggest fan of seasonality and our analysis only has 3 data points, which gives us only a 67% confidence to make the claim that the next three months will indeed be green (low data fallacy). But to add significance, by the binary nature of bullish/bearish, there is also exclusivity to the data: if September is not green, 6 out of 8 times, Q4 has not been green each month.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Biggest September Gains In A Decade: Here’s Why He refines his thesis further, “So, by including the exclusivity, a more general and easier to interpret claim, using more data points is that: ‘The direction of September has determined the general direction of Q4 and if September is green and not red, a bullish (not bearish) Q4 has followed 9 out of 11 times. So if September closes above $59k, there is an 82% chance Q4 will be bullish’.” The prediction stirred dialogue within the community. A user @pieceofsheet99 commented skeptically, suggesting the potential for an unexpected downturn: “If September turned out to be green to everyone’s surprise, October can also turn out to be red to everyone’s surprise as well.” Astronomer responded, reaffirming his reliance on historical trends, “Indeed, but that’s not what we have seen typically. So, I personally, as always, stick to the data.” Astronomer’s analysis concludes on a note of strategic optimism, emphasizing the importance of aligning with market dynamics and historical patterns rather than speculative impulses. “How bullish? We will see (time is more important than price), but it’s not about planning for retirement and making fast money. It’s about being on the right side of the trade, time after time after time, enjoying the market stress-free and not having too many regrets through losing money or being sidelined (enjoying the process). And this way, eventually (rather soon), you hit your goals.” At press time, BTC traded at $64,622.

42407523,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGjT,1727681849,Bitcoin’s Bearish September May Be Its Best Since 2013 Ahead of Bullish October,"Bitcoin is set to record a gain of at least 9% this September, defying its historical trend of negative returns for the month, with only two prior instances of positive growth since 2013.  October traditionally favors bitcoin with only two negative months since 2013, and current market conditions, including global monetary policies and U.S. political support, suggest a continued bullish trend potentially pushing Bitcoin toward $70,000 from around $64,000.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} historically worst month may have be its best one yet, with the asset on track to gain at least 9% this September, beating a trend that’s seen it end in the red eight times since 2013.  And that’s putting the asset on a stronger footing going into October, the start of a generally bullish period with some traders targeting a run to as much as $70,000 in the coming weeks from the current $64,000 levels. A green September has always resulted in bitcoin closing higher in October, November and December.  In contrast to September, there have just been two October months where bitcoin has ended in the red since 2013 - chalking gains of as high as 60% and an average of 22%.  Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur during the calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish “Santa Claus” rally in December, a sign of increased demand.  September has recorded an average value depletion rate of 6.56% in bitcoin, as previously reported, leading to traders being generally defensive about betting on higher prices.  But it gained amid a slew of global monetary easing policies, a weakening yen, increased institutional investments in bitcoin and both political parties in the U.S. - which influence market movements - showing a favorable sentiment toward the crypto market ahead of November elections.  The trend is widely expected to continue.  “With crypto correlations staying high to macro assets, particularly against the SPX, we consider the friendly macro background to remain a strong tailwind for crypto prices into Q4,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Furthermore, with the Kamala camp playing lip service to crypto 'support' as part of her campaign rhetoric, we remain bullish on price action in the near term, with targeted put-selling strategies likely to be popular as investors switch into a 'buy-the-dip' mode,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/bitcoins-bearish-september-may-be-its-best-since-2013-ahead-of-bullish-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0c63cfaf32c09f1513d135ba4f492bdedd627f-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Experts Weigh In On Bold Predictions And Market Realities","A recent tweet from Uphold, a digital currency platform, has sparked a flurry of skepticism and exhilaration within the XRP community. The tweet jokingly implied that “XRP just reached $1,000,” which incited a flurry of speculation regarding the feasibility of such a price point. Although some enthusiasts are supporting the concept, numerous critics have promptly dismissed it as unrealistic, citing the substantial market capitalization increase that would be necessary for XRP to achieve that level. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $0.64. A monumental increase in value that has left many perplexed is required for the altcoin to reach $1,000. Related Reading: UNI Surges 30% Amid Ongoing On-Chain Development Talks XRP: The Price Surge Debate XRP now displays a small positive momentum as it moves up approximately 3.6% week-over-week and 11% month-over-month. Still, this keeps it around 80% away from its all-time high (ATH), which does raise certain questions about where this could be heading. It is important to note that the financial blog WallStreetBulls previously asserted that the achievement of $1,000 was not merely a pipe dream, but rather a possibility that could occur within weeks or months. Crypto Tank, an influential figure in the XRP community, has reiterated this bold assertion, contending that skeptics may be underestimating the substantial utility of the crypto in global finance. Everyone saying 1k XRP is a fantasy doesn’t understand how the utility of XRP will drive price to unbelievable levels. Just to give you an idea of how high XRP will need to be I’ll give you some examples… Swift does approx $5-7 trillion in daily volume…. — CryptoTank (@Tank2033js) September 28, 2024 Although there are some who are optimistic, there are still numerous experts who are skeptical. It is not only improbable but also “gaslighting” for XRP to leap from a $33 billion market cap to a $100 trillion one overnight, as a vocal critic recently pointed out. This degree of market valuation would surpass even the most formidable technology businesses, like Apple and Bitcoin. Apple’s market value right now is a little over $3 trillion; Bitcoin’s is almost $500 billion. For others who consider such forecasts as too aggressive, the numbers just do not add up. Related Reading: Lido Surges 15% – Will ‘Uptober’ Bring More Gains for LDO? What May Possibly Spur Up Development? Though some might find the idea of XRP hitting $1,000 improbable, there are elements that could cause significant increase. Given their amazing volatility, institutional investments or positive market mood can help digital currencies bloom. The altcoin would probably need more deep integration into the global financial networks and cross-border transactions if it is to reach such a valuation. XRP’s future seems bright based on current trends. SBI Holdings, a Ripple partner, joined Project Agora, a BIS-led initiative with central banks. By enabling XRP’s wider usage in cross-border payments, this cooperation might significantly enhance its value proposition.

Dealers have seen massive call buying activity at the $75,000 strike price and beyond and put selling, according to Amberdata.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has notched its first three-week winning streak since February, according to data source TradingView. The upswing has been characterized by traders buying call options, offering an asymmetric upside potential above $75,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose over 3% in the seven days to Sept. 29, extending over 7% price increases that occurred in each of the previous two weeks. China's large stimulus announcement and inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, equivalent to more than a month's supply of newly mined BTC, likely helped the cryptocurrency maintain the upward trajectory.  As prices rose, dealers saw massive call buying activity at the $75,000 strike price and beyond on crypto exchange Deribit, according to order flow tracked by Amberdata. Investors also sold put options.  ""This flow pattern suggests a bullish outlook for spot prices (due to the put selling) while also anticipating an acceleration in price movement,"" Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini, said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset, BTC, at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish, looking to hedge against price swoons.  The bullish flow of increased call buying and put selling suggests expectations that prices will soon break out of a six-month-long corrective trend, referred to as the ""expanding triangle"" by veteran analyst Peter Brandt.  A potential break out would mean the broader uptrend from October 2023 lows under $30,000 has resumed.  ""A break above $75K could lead to a swift rally through all-time highs toward $100K, where the last tranche of call buyer activity is concentrated in the December 27, 2024, expiration,"" Magadini said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/30/bitcoin-bulls-eye-75k-and-higher-as-btc-registers-three-week-winning-streak,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/680ae348a9eb3c484bac4bad48907c4d3fa18ee8-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zhu also said that the government must recognize the risks and harm crypto poses to capital markets.  China's former minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, said at a forum hosted by Tsinghua University that the government should study crypto more closely, given remarks made on the U.S. campaign trail.

The price is trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must stay above the $2,600 support to start a fresh increase in the near term. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price extended gains and traded above the $2,650 level. ETH even cleared the $2,700 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $2,728 and the price started a downside correction like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $2,700 and $2,650 levels. The price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,554 swing low to the $2,728 high. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the price could find bids near the $2,600 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,554 swing low to the $2,728 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,650 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $2,685 level. The next key resistance is near $2,720. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,840 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,880 level or $2,920. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone.
