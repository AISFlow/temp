The banking turmoil appears to be aiding Bitcoin's already positive 2023 momentum. A breakdown of what the MVRV ratio is and how best to leverage it is included in the analysis below. It is time to start paying attention to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). There is an indicator in the crypto world called the MVRV Ratio , which is the market value of a given token divided by the realized value of the token. Let’s break down the components: Market value is simple, it is the market capitalization of a token, which is the total tokens outstanding multiplied by the current price of the token. Realized value, in this context, is unique to crypto (as opposed to traditional equity markets) since it is only available because of public, on-chain data. Realized value is the aggregation of the price paid for each token when it was acquired multiplied by the supply of the token. Essentially, realized value provides the token’s aggregate cost basis for all token holders. Below are varying levels of the MVRV ratio and what they indicate, using Bitcoin as an example: MVRV MVRV = 1: the collective Bitcoin holder is at a breakeven level. The current bitcoin price equals the weighted average price paid for every Bitcoin in circulation. MVRV = 2: the collective Bitcoin holder has doubled their investment The highest MVRV ratio for Bitcoin ever recorded was 8.08 on June 4, 2011. The MVRV ratio can be used as a reliable long-term signal to determine when Bitcoin (and the broader crypto market) is overbought or oversold. Below is the chart of Bitcoin price and the Bitcoin MVRV ratio: Bitcoin Price and the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio (Woobull Charts) Currently, Bitcoin has sustained an MVRV ratio above 1 for more than 60 days There have been four previous periods in Bitcoin’s history where the MVRV ratio has broken above 1 and maintained that support level for more than 60 days, similar to the period we are in now. See the orange arrows below: Instances where Bitcoin broke through the MVRV threshold of 1 and sustained it for more than 60 days (Woobull Charts, OneJournal Research) For each of these instances, as well as the current time period (in blue), the below chart summarizes Bitcoin's return over the subsequent 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 1-year, and 3-year time periods: Bitcoin return for each instance of MVRV>1 and sustaining that level for over 60 days (DQYDJ, Chart created by OneJournal Research) The returns speak for themselves. On average, the 90-day return is 84%, 1-year return is 797%, and 3-year return is 2044%. Now is the point in the article where I have an obligation to state that past performance is no indication of future returns. The upside of Bitcoin today is also lower than it was when Bitcoin was in its infancy, a natural tendency for any maturing technology. A Note on Technical Analysis We believe the only technical analysis that is worth paying attention to is long-term focused, and even then it is just a tool. If you're presented with technical analysis that is on a time scale of days and not months or years, run. Technical analysis can be as much art as it is science, and certain technical analysis trends hold true until they don't (see the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model ). Technical analysis can't account for the fact that the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates by 0.25% even when the global banking system is showing signs of weakness, including two significant crypto banks in Silvergate (SI) and Signature Bank (SBNY). It can't account for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting in his press conference today that it is ""the most likely case"" that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates 2023, sending risk assets into a late afternoon selloff. However, with something like Bitcoin that has no balance sheet to conduct fundamental analysis, and on-chain data providing new lenses to analyze an investment's behavior such as the MVRV ratio, technical analysis can help provide signals when Bitcoin stock is overbought, oversold, or in a long-term trend reversal. Conclusion With all the disclaimers aside, the recent banking sector turmoil appears to have built upon Bitcoin’s price momentum from earlier in 2023, and the long-term upside of Bitcoin is still significant. The MVRV ratio would indicate that the foundation for the next Bitcoin bull cycle may be forming as we speak.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589432-time-to-start-paying-attention-to-bitcoin-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10976501.jpeg

42414114,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwLD9,1679526132,"Binance Curb on Zero-Fee Trading May Cost Market Share, Boost TrueUSD Stablecoin: Kaiko Research Head","Binance’s market share may drop after the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume abolished most zero-fee trading after just nine months, according to Kaiko's head of research.  Binance phased out zero-fee buying and selling of bitcoin (BTC) with several asset pairs Wednesday, only keeping the promotion for the trueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin. Binance’s decision may foreshadow a major shift for centralized crypto exchanges, ending Binance’s dominance. Zero-fee trading pairs have represented some 60% of all trading volume on the platform, according to Kaiko data. It may also underscore TUSD’s status as Binance’s favored stablecoin.  After introducing zero-fee trading for some BTC pairs globally last summer, Binance snatched significant share from rivals amid a market rout when exchanges were grappling with low trading volumes and dwindling revenues. The measure helped Binance grow its market share to 72% from 50% in July compared to most liquid exchanges, Clara Medalie, research director at crypto market data provider Kaiko, highlighted.  “Zero-fee trading is unsustainable in the long run, but in the short run enabled Binance to gain massive market share,” Medalie told CoinDesk in an email. “Without zero fees for most BTC pairs, we could expect a short-term drop in market share.”  Read more: Binance Can’t Keep Its Story Straight on Misplaced $1.8B USDC  Emergence of trueUSD  TrueUSD has risen in stature after regulators cracked down on Binance USD (BUSD). Paxos, the firm that issues BUSD under the exchange’s brand, was ordered last month by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to wind down the stablecoin. Subsequently, BUSD’s supply fell rapidly from $16 billion to $8 billion.  “The exchange seems to have crowned a possible successor in TUSD,” Medalie said.  TUSD more than doubled in market capitalization since the announcement of BUSD’s phaseout, surpassing $2 billion, CoinGecko data shows. The stablecoin is managed by Archblock, formerly known as TrustToken, and its intellectual property was acquired by a little-known Asian investment conglomerate Techteryx. Reports alleged that crypto billionaire and Tron founder Justin Sun might be behind TUSD, but the firm denied allegations earlier.  See also: Tron Founder Justin Sun Sued by U.S. SEC on Securities, Market Manipulation Charges  The BTC-TUSD trading volume had recently grown tenfold compared to Tuesday, Dustin Teander, an analyst at crypto research firm Messari, said in an email. However, the asset pair’s $50 million spot trading volume in the past 24 hours is dwarfed by the dominant stablecoin USDT’s $6 billion and BUSD’s $1 billion volume, he added.  Mike van Rossum, founder of crypto trading firm Folkvang, said it’s still early to tell how much Binance wants to push TUSD as the “de facto standard” on its platform, adding that making trading free is a powerful tool.  “If people end up trusting TUSD – very uncertain right now – this zero-fee promo can easily grow into the biggest market by volume,” he said.  A Binance spokesperson said in an email that the exchange’s goal “right now is to identify a diverse set of stablecoin products to offer users, particularly products that are transparent, regulated and have strong relationships with banking institutions in markets that support innovation.”  “TUSD is the first of what will hopefully be many new stablecoin products being offered to users,"" the spokesperson added.  The stablecoin market weathered turmoil earlier this month as several U.S. banks with close ties to crypto firms were shut down by regulators after suffering a run on deposits.

10976500,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589428-gbtc-million-dollar-bitcoin-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1679525749,GBTC: The Million Dollar Bitcoin Bet,"Summary GBTC still trades at a sizeable 37% discount to net asset value. The tide might be turning though as Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC is foreshadowing. There are serious problems in the banking sector and all signs point to the return of the liquidity hose. It's been about eight months since I last covered Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ) and I have a bit of a 'love-hate relationship' with this ticker. I first wrote about GBTC for Seeking Alpha in December 2019 . My thinking at that time was the premium made GBTC much less interesting than holding BTC directly: The question an investor should ask oneself is ""if the trust lags the asset, requires a premium to purchase, and decays 2% annually, why buy the trust over the asset?"" This logic still certainly applies if we're comparing GBTC only to self-custodied Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) but it isn't necessarily applicable if we're comparing GBTC to other Bitcoin-proxy wagers in a traditional investment account. GBTC does have the benefit of providing tax-advantaged exposure to BTC if the investor is okay with not actually having the keys to the coins. Last July, I ended my most recent GBTC article with this: After the liquidation of a top shareholder, I think GBTC shares at a 30% discount are a solid way to long Bitcoin for a potential rally in the spot price. Eight months later, GBTC is roughly where it was at the time of my July 2022 article publication but the discount to NAV is actually larger at just under 38%: Data by YCharts Since that article, concerns about Grayscale's parent company and general market panic actually pushed the GBTC NAV discount down to 49% as recently as December. Despite the abysmal market sentiment surrounding Grayscale, Digital Currency Group, and the underlying asset, I think GBTC is a long at this point and I suspect the worst has already been priced in through the NAV discount. SEC Lawsuit Earlier this month, Grayscale's case against the SEC was laid out in front of District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judges. The most interesting take away from that hearing may not have been how Grayscale's argument was received by judges, but rather how the SEC's argument was received. From CoinDesk's writeup at that time: The judges questioned the SEC's logic in distinguishing between Bitcoin spot market prices and futures market prices. Grayscale’s argument is the SEC acted arbitrarily in rejecting the ETF application and previously approving Bitcoin futures ETFs. The attorney for the SEC was hit with a barrage of difficult questions from the judges and the market viewed this very positively for Grayscale. If we assume Grayscale wins this lawsuit, it stands to reason the SEC will take one of two approaches following the decision: The agency will approve Grayscale's next conversion application The agency will go the other way and un-approve the BTC futures ETFs I personally believe option 1 is more likely. As an ETF with the possibility of redemption, GBTC's NAV discount should close considerably. If the SEC doesn't allow US-based investors a ""safe, regulated"" way to get Bitcoin exposure through an ETF, it could risk damaging the agency's integrity to a significant degree in my opinion. After all, it should not be lost on investors that Gary Gensler's SEC has allowed ETFs that track the calls of a cable television personality but not a spot Bitcoin ETF. Taking the position that a Bitcoin spot ETF can't exist because of theoretical manipulation risk while also allowing two ETFs that one man can push around with a television show seems counter-intuitive; and that's me choosing to be generous. The Balaji Bet Balaji Srinivasan is a venture capitalist and entrepreneur. He was previously the CTO at Coinbase ( COIN ) and can certainly be seen as a pro-crypto advocate. He's been making headlines over the last few days because of a wager he publicized on Twitter calling for a $1 million Bitcoin price within 90 days. His argument for this call stems from the proliferation of bank failures and what he calls a ""stealth financial crisis"" leading to hyperinflation in the US dollar. While even some of the most bullish Bitcoin advocates view this $1 million BTC bet more as a publicity stunt than as an honest wager, Srinivasan himself insinuated on a recent podcast appearance that the wager is more about the banks than about Bitcoin: I hope I don't win. Okay. Because what this is is a way to call attention to this stealth financial crisis. Srinivasan's thesis for hyperinflation is that banks are underwater on collateral and can't cover withdrawals if enough people want their deposits back. There is certainly some truth to this fear as the unrealized losses on investment securities last year were nothing short of catastrophic: Unrealized Losses (FDIC) The reality is information travels much faster in 2023 than it did during the last financial crisis and the ""bank run"" no longer requires a physical bank branch. In Srinivasan's view, the only option the central bank and federal government will have to backstop all deposits is through monetized debt. The FDIC simply doesn't have the reserves necessary to payout all deposit holders in the event of a larger systemic financial collapse: FDIC This is likely why the FDIC, US Treasury, and Federal Reserve just announced the Bank Term Funding Program: The additional funding will be made available through the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution's need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress. Bold my emphasis. This program is staggering because it allows banks to borrow against treasuries at par, even if the positions are underwater. This is a roundabout way to turn the liquidity hose back on. As I see it, borrowing against underwater collateral makes more sense if the parties involved have an understanding that the underwater collateral won't be underwater for much longer. Bitcoin was quite literally made for this moment. Summary In my view, there is now too much at stake for the SEC not to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF. If it doesn't, the risk shifts to keeping BTC-proxy capital with the established institutions. We're already living in what is probably another financial crisis judging by the bank closures and rescues that we've witnessed over the last few weeks. I have a very hard time believing there aren't other banks suffering from the same borrow/lend duration problem that took out SVB a couple weeks ago and the we can already see a sneaky admission of it through the Bank Term Funding Program. Bitcoin has started accounting for a money printer that has only recently been turned back on. Even if the SEC loses the Grayscale lawsuit and does ultimately decide to un-approve the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) and other Bitcoin futures ETFs in an attempt to keep BTC out of the legacy financial system, it could just push the $930 million in AUM from those funds to GBTC anyway. Which is another possible catalyst that could result in the GBTC NAV gap constriction. If that were to happen, even if Bitcoin's performance is flat, GBTC will outperform. To be clear, I think BTC is best held in self-custody, off exchanges. But for dollars stuck in TradFi retirement accounts, GBTC isn't a bad idea given the setup.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589428-gbtc-million-dollar-bitcoin-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10976500.jpeg

42411004,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvTwj,1679524528,"Short-Term BTC Holders, Stablecoin Supplies Could Indicate Cryptos' Future Price Direction","To wide expectations, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised interest rates by 25 basis points.  Yet, two crypto indicators – stablecoin supply and the profitability of bitcoin (BTC) held by investors with short-term horizons – will likely have greater impact for investors than the decision.  A full 97.5% of bitcoin circulating supply held by short-term investors is now in profit, as the current price exceeds the average cost basis.  “Short term” means bitcoin that was acquired less than 155 days ago, and often includes participants who are newer to the market or more apt to trade in and out of positions quickly.  A full 98% of short-term holders sitting in profit on the day of the FOMC rate decision means that if enough people view Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments as bearish could result in additional selling pressure.  But a more bullish interpretation of his remarks could lead to short-term holders holding their positions and ultimately moving into the long-term holder (155 days or more) cohort. Investors holding bitcoin signals that they believe the price will increase.  The total supply held by long-term bitcoin holders has increased 5% over the past year.  As long-term holders are less likely to spend bitcoin, increases in this group can serve as a supportive base of relatively illiquid supply, undergirding bitcoin’s price.  Still, for that to take hold a stablecoin supply shift would be helpful as well.  The aggregate supply net position change of the four top stablecoins has steadily contracted since April 2022. Stablecoins serve as the mechanism by which a large portion of digital assets like bitcoin and ether are purchased.  An expansion of stablecoin supply indicates an increase in capital available for deployment. A contraction indicates the opposite. For investors with a bullish view on BTC, the former occurring would be the more attractive development.  As capital markets continue to digest the rate decision and subsequent FOMC commentary, monitoring short-term holders to see whether BTC prices sell off will be important. Additionally, tracking the supply of stablecoins will give clues to the extent that BTC may move higher.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/22/short-term-btc-holders-stablecoin-supplies-could-indicate-cryptos-future-price-direction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f55513811c2b34c53833edac7bc6196808f32c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393739,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0aT,1679523301,"Rapid Bank Runs Reveal Deposits Are Now Magic Internet Money, Too","One thing that has distinguished traditional banking from crypto, in the eyes of many financial experts, is stability. There's a strong belief that most people who put money into an account at a prominent bank will generally leave it there, indefinitely – whether due to comfort, satisfaction, relationships, laziness, lots of things.  That level of constancy or loyalty hardly prevails in crypto – evidenced by the lightning-fast withdrawals of deposits in 2022 from the digital-asset firms Celsius Network, FTX and Voyager Digital, as soon as a whiff of troubles arose, or even a whiff that other depositors might be jumping ship.  But the recent failures at Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank have shown the potential for stunningly swift deposit runs at traditional banks, too. It's been a nasty surprise for industry executives and regulators alike, a sign of just how predominant (and easy) online banking has become, with by-the-second updates on social media fueling the rumor mill and adding to the fragility.  So if customers sitting anywhere in the world with an Internet connection can instantly move their money from one bank to another, the question arises of how different that traditional setup looks compared to notoriously fickle crypto, aside from the ostensible government backstop.  None other than Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted Wednesday during a press conference that the deposit run at SVB was “faster than the historical record would suggest.”  “The speed of the run – it’s very different from what we’ve seen in the past,” Powell said.  Similarly, Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said in an interview with Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder David Rubenstein at an Economic Club of Washington event on Wednesday that ""it’s a complete game changer from what we’ve seen before.""  ""There were a couple of tweets and then this thing went down much faster than has happened in history,"" she said.  Sticky deposits  Banks are built on the idea that most customer deposits are “sticky” – thought of as a form of long-term funding even when technically they can be redeemed on demand. Because of the expectation the funds won’t be pulled out at a moment’s notice, banks then lend the money out to home borrowers, car buyers, credit card users, companies and real-estate developers, or sometimes invest the money in long-term bonds that might not pay off for years.  The dynamic has monstrous long-term implications for the traditional economy and financial system: If banks can’t depend on deposit funding, they might think twice about providing long-term credit. Customers reportedly withdrew $42 billion from SVB on a single day, March 9, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Crypto’s reputation might benefit, however – or at least not look so bad by comparison – if fast-moving Internet money is increasingly seen as the norm rather than an undesirable feature of newfangled, blockchain-based finance.  “It’s a new world with very fast digital runs on the bank,” said Lex Sokolin, chief cryptoeconomics officer at ConsenSys.  Read More: Bitcoin Sinks Below $27K as Fed, Powell Keep Focus on Inflation  Banking experts say the arrival of ultra-fast-moving deposits could represent one of the most fundamental shifts in the industry’s history. Sure, online banking's been around for a while, but online banking has never before been this prevalent during a banking panic.  The images of customers waiting outside Silicon Valley Bank branches to speak to a teller might look quaint, if not ridiculous, were they not so tragic. As it turned out, the degens and tech-company treasurers, working from their computers, were first in line.  In the Internet era, it only takes a few clicks and a couple of seconds to transfer deposits from one bank account to another. When doubts arise that your money isn’t safe, just park it at a different online banking account.  Rumors – or even worrisome, confirmed facts – spread quickly on Twitter, politicians’ press releases or online news reports. When people decide to play it safe instead of sorry, bank runs can start within days or hours.  Yellen not considering broader deposit guarantees  The Federal Reserve, the Department of Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said in a joint statement on March 13 that all deposit accounts at both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank will be guaranteed.  “Despite the central bank’s aggressive actions, confidence in the banking system – especially regarding small- and medium-sized regional banks – remains fragile, as lots of uncertainty and concerns remain,” Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note previewing Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  To crypto traders, phrases like “lack of confidence” and “uncertainty” sound very familiar, and government officials have long used the risk of “runs” as the main reason why crypto, specifically stablecoins, aren’t a safe option for parking savings.  If the perception of stability is gone – think about all those Ionic columns holding up bank-branch facades – or if all money is now seen as hot online money – then the main advantage of the traditional banking system over crypto really amounts to the fact that it’s supported by the government with deposit insurance of lender-of-last resort borrowing facilities. The Federal Reserve’s founding in 1913, of course, was a direct response to the frequent bank runs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she is supportive of protecting depositors in smaller U.S. banks suffering deposit runs.  But on Wednesday, during testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee in Washington, D.C., Yellen stressed that she is not considering a broad increase in deposit insurance. U.S. stocks slid on the news, because many traders had assumed that such a move was a fait accompli, maybe even a necessary one to prevent more deposits from fleeing smaller banks, or those perceived as weak.  Cryptocurrencies have been rallying since the start of what some people call a “banking crisis.” Bitcoin (BTC) hit $28,000 for the first time in nine months on Monday.  Already, crypto-friendly commentators are starting to revive the narrative that bitcoin might be a safe haven – say if the Fed needs to print more money to back the banking system. Asked about the Fed’s new emergency lending programs for banks created in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures, Powell said at the press conference that “it’s having the intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system.”  With 2022's wounds still fresh, it's probably a stretch at this point to argue crypto is a safe haven, but it's not crazy to expect that perceptions of the banking system’s stability might now be due for a rethink similar to what the crypto industry experienced in 2022.  The 513-page ""Economic Report of the President,"" published Monday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, dedicated nearly a full page to describing how the government’s financial safety net had helped to address the banking panic of 1907, which culminated in a rescue from the financier J.P. Morgan.  “Fast forward 100 years, and digital-asset proponents are now aspiring to create a decentralized financial system without relying on governments and their regulatory frameworks,” according to the report. Crypto’s “proponents have been relearning the lessons from the previous financial crises the hard way.”  The messy and swift unwinding of several heavily supervised banks over the past month suggests that executives and regulators in traditional finance also have some relearning to do.  “A fragile banking system is likely to encourage investors, especially of the younger generation, to hold at least some of their wealth in an ’insurance asset’ such as bitcoin,” said Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading.

Coinbase disclosed the SEC alleged the U.S.-based company may be operating in violation of securities laws in the running of its exchange and staking services. The regulator targeted Coinbase with a so-called Wells notice that informs the business that the agency is planning a future action that could include an injunction or cease-and-desist without specifying exactly what activity it found in violation.  “If needed, we welcome a legal process to provide the clarity we have been advocating for and to demonstrate that the SEC simply has not been fair or reasonable when it comes to its engagement on digital assets,"" said Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, in a statement. ""Until then, it’s business as usual.""  ""The company believes these potential enforcement actions would relate to aspects of the company’s spot market, staking service Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet,"" Coinbase said in a filing with the SEC, citing its conversations with the agency's staff.  The notice is preliminary, and such warnings don't always lead to enforcement actions. The company has until March 29 to let the agency know whether it intends to rebut the SEC enforcement division's findings that securities law have likely been violated.  In a blog post Wednesday, Coinbase further indicated that its digital asset listing process was not the subject of the notice.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also tweeted about the Wells notice on Wednesday.  An individual familiar with the situation told CoinDesk that the exchange had engaged in over 60 different discussions with the federal regulator over questions about registering and listing digital assets, and the agency had declined to offer any advice or answers to questions. The issues discussed included defining the right market structure and determining which assets could be listed.  Coinbase has publicly criticized the SEC for what it describes as a vague regulatory structure, petitioning the regulator in July to explain how digital assets could fit within securities laws.  For his part, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said on multiple occasions that he believes crypto exchanges – including Coinbase specifically – are operating as unregistered securities exchanges in the U.S., citing the number of tokens they list and arguing the vast majority of these resemble securities.  Shares of Coinbase were down more than 11% after-hours on Wednesday following the release of the news.  The Wells notice on Wednesday came the same day the SEC sued Tron founder Justin Sun on allegations the TRX and BTT tokens are unregistered securities (among other charges).

Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin by market cap, also fell 3.2% to $1.74K. The broader stock market saw downward pressure , too, as Powell stressed that the Fed will keep lifting rates higher than expected if need be. “Rate cuts are not in our base case,” he said in the press conference following the Fed's latest 25-basis-point rate increase.

Just last month, the Bank of England and Bank of Japan announced next stages of their CBDC development, and in doing so joined the European Central Bank in working towards a proof-of-concept to be used in pilot programs. This leaves the Federal Reserve, the world's largest central bank and the issuer of the world’s reserve currency, several steps behind its peers when it comes to the planning and deployment of its own CBDC – the digital dollar.  Ananya Kumar is the associate director at the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. She manages the center’s work on future-of-money issues.  In fact, while some in the U.S. Congress are worried the Fed is moving too fast, most other countries are concerned the issuer of the world's reserve currency is moving too slow. Exactly a year ago, the Biden administration issued an executive order on responsible development of digital assets, and there have been some positive steps since then. Up to 15 agencies were directed to release reports on the state of play of the market, research priorities and risk mitigation. These were largely positive when it came to furthering research into the design of a CBDC. The New York Fed also decided to experiment with a wholesale, bank-to-bank CBDC prototype – “Project Cedar.” The volatility of crypto markets beginning last year, and its conflation with CBDC, along with the silence from the Fed and other agencies since has led to a loss in momentum on the issue.  Both Democrats and Republicans are having their say: DeSantis, Emmer, Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) and others detractors make a series of arguments against CBDCs: The first argument is on the role of the private sector. They argue CBDCs could disintermediate the private sector, especially commercial banks, and unfavorably compete against private-sector offerings such as bank deposits or stablecoins.  Second, they argue CBDCs offer no added benefit to existing technology such as Instant Payments Systems, including the yet-to-be-launched FedNow. Finally, critics rightfully bring up the issue of financial privacy and surveillance concerns. The risk of a poorly designed CBDC is that it might give a central bank unauthorized access to our bank accounts and transaction details.  Read more: JP Schnapper-Casteras - Gov. Ron DeSantis, Privacy and the Politicization of the Digital Dollar  Some of these issues can be easily answered, on the basis of our research on global CBDCs across the last two years. In the over 100 models we've examined, commercial banks – not central banks – distribute CBDCs to the general public. Interestingly, such a system encourages new commercial activity as fintech companies and commercial banks build new wallets and tools to keep users' money safe. Cryptocurrency and stablecoin providers should welcome healthy competition from CBDCs, especially since the mantra for the industry has been “optionality” – that is, creating more alternatives to traditional holdings that speak to users. Creating trusted public money that citizens can hold along with their regular bank deposits and crypto-assets should be the ultimate goal for both the private and public sector.  On the issue of instant payments networks, the U.S. is already behind many of its G-20 counterparts, and is hoping to catch up with FedNow this year. FedNow, however, does not connect individuals with CBDCs. Its audience is financial institutions, which will be able to finalize transactions faster with each other, if the program is ever fully rolled out. It will also not offer other benefits such as interoperability with other assets and technological benefits of transaction speed, cost and, most of all, transparency in money flows. Experimentation on the digital dollar should be done in tandem with the FedNow rollout and all options to improve payments should be on the table.  Finally, the issue of how to build privacy in a centralized digital currency ecosystem is a real one. Authoritarian governments can enhance surveillance capabilities and get access to protected information if the necessary guardrails are not built. This is an important design concern, and one that gets a lot of attention in policy circles and Congress. The good news is that new technological options can not only meet minimum privacy benchmarks, they can also enhance the privacy protections provided by existing infrastructure.  Read more: John Kiff, Jonas Gross – Are There Tech Solutions to the Privacy and Compliance Trade-Offs for CBDCs?  Our research at the Atlantic Council has shown that privacy-preserving designs can have another advantage. They can address critical cybersecurity needs for CBDC systems as well. Privacy concerns rank high on the list for the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Sveriges Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan, all of which are working on proofs of concept that address the right balance between privacy and know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) requirements. The whole purpose of a pilot would be to see if these ideas work in practice. Oddly, opponents of CBDCs don't even want to find out.  There are good arguments about the risks of such centralization in digital payments, and privacy is the right concern to have. So is financial stability, monetary sovereignty and the lack of regulatory alignment on a host of consumer protection and KYC/AML standards. But these challenges can be addressed, and the best way of doing so is more experimentation and less hesitation. There is a noticeable absence in American experimentation with CBDC design, which has created a vacuum when it comes to international technical and regulatory standards. We are looking at a serious risk of greater fragmentation in international payments due to proliferation of CBDC models that cannot talk to each other. And, this vacuum in a global model for CBDC has the potential for the replication of China’s model around the world, which has been in pilot stage since 2020.  There is a political battle brewing on the issue of the digital dollar – and given the importance of financial infrastructure, it could seriously threaten the role of the dollar as the world’s currency of choice. We must not deny the reality that most of the world, including U.S. allies and competitors, is already in the game – creating their CBDC products, experimenting with each other and, consequently, creating technical and regulatory standards the U.S. will have little voice on.  Eventually, the U.S. will have to cross the hurdle of public opinion – and for that, it might behoove the executive and legislative branch to remember that trust is built with transparency. The Fed might want to take the route of the ECB, which has opened up a dialogue among itself, the private sector and civil society as it works toward piloting the digital euro later this year. Research, experimentation and regulatory clarity building towards a proof of concept that can answer our questions on the real risks and opportunities of the digital dollar is the key to U.S leadership in the future of money. Congress must ensure that any way forward allows for real experimentation and refinement while balancing the very real security and privacy concerns.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Ananya Kumar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/22/desantis-cbdc-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1bde2babb61e31c95463491cfa3eb19d26429e4-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator charged Sun, Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry (formerly BitTorrent) for the unregistered offer and sale of cryptos Tronix ( TRX-USD ) and BitTorrent ( BTT-USD ). The news sent Tronix ( TRX-USD ) sliding 13% , while BitTorrent ( BTT-USD ) was down 2% . The SEC charged eight celebrities for illegal touting of Sun's cryptos - actress Lindsay Lohan, YouTube star Jake Paul, rappers Soulja Boy and Lil Yachty, singers Ne-Yo, Akon and Austin Mahone, as well as adult film star Kendra Lust.

42414128,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwMK8,1679515950,"Bitcoin Sinks Below $27K as Federal Reserve, Powell Keep Focus on Inflation","Bitcoin (BTC) sank below $27,000 as the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did as was widely expected Wednesday, raising interest rates again, this time by a quarter point.  The decision reinforces the Federal Reserve's concerns that inflation remains problematic. The FOMC is ""strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said following the rate increase announcement.  Yet, in a statement accompanying the announcement Wednesday afternoon, the FOMC also acknowledged this month's banking near-meltdown, saying that ""recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.""  BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently trading at about $27,030, down 4.1% over the past 24 hours, with the BTC/U.S. dollar trading pair plunging as low as $26,815 at one point on the Coinbase exchange. Earlier Wednesday, BTC's price rose as high as $28,815, reaching its highest level since June 10 because some investors hoped the Fed would end its year-long diet of hawkish interest rate increases because of the recent bank failures. But the Fed dashed those hopes.  Powell’s speaking Wednesday afternoon also coincided with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking to senators that blanket deposit insurance “is not something that we have looked at ... in any way.”  The crypto market had ""relatively high hopes of either no rate hike or very dovish comments from Powell"" based on the last few days of price action, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  ""We did get some dovish guidance through the dot plot, but likely not as much as was priced in,"" Outumuro told CoinDesk. ""Then Yellen's comment triggered stocks and correlation dots driving crypto lower as well."" He added that Yellen's comment could be positive for crypto in the medium term.  Other market observers were also optimistic about bitcoin's price in the near future, given banking's calamities, which has undermined confidence in the sector. ""Bitcoin, straddling between being the leading risk-on asset and a financial lifeboat in the event of an all-out banking crisis, has benefited from the recent turmoil and now the prospect that the Fed’s tightening could be over,"" James Lavish, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, told CoinDesk in an email.  However, Lavish said he would still expect volatility ahead as the recent banking crisis continues. ""We march toward a recession, or worse, a much larger credit event occurs,"" he predicted.  Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Hashdex, told CoinDesk via email that “while this rate hike is anegative for risk assets in general, it is positive for bitcoin and gold as this puts more stress on the banking sector.""  Vineeth Bhuvanagiri, the managing director of Emurgo Fintech, the founding entity of the Cardano blockchain, said in an email to CoinDesk in an email that “banks are really struggling,"" adding, ""Authorities are having to return to massive liquidity injections to shore up the financial sector. And bank runs are forcing investors to rethink what it is to actually own assets – that is, they’re realizing that deposits in banks can feature major counterparty risk.""  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently hovering around the $1,740 level, down 3.1% from Tuesday, same time. Among other major digital currencies, crypto payment platform Ripple’s XRP token was recently down 11%, a reversal from earlier in the day when XRP jumped 20% on reports Ripple was well-placed to win a landmark case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was recently up 4%.  Traditional markets fell, albeit not by much following the Fed announcement. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq all closed down 1.6%.  The two-year Treasury bond rate, a gauge that usually reflects near-term interest rate expectations, fell to 3.93%.  The U.S. central bank’s decision comes after February consumer price index data showed month-over-month inflation dropping to 6% from the previous month's 6.4% reading. Core data, which strips away volatile energy and food costs, ticked down slightly. The declining CPI suggested that Fed measures were at least slowly taming inflation and offered support for monetary policy observers who have insisted in recent months that the Fed had overstepped.  Meanwhile, the labor market has remained strong, with a drop in the most recent weekly U.S. jobless aid claims.  “I think Powell's gonna be very sensitive about surprising the market,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager IDX Digital Assets, told CoinDesk prior to the decision.  But McMillan maintained that he had seen a more bullish attitude toward risk assets.  ""We've noticed that people are starting to think of bitcoin as the same bucket now as commodities or hard assets as stores of value,” he said.  In an email to CoinDesk, Brent Xu, chief executive officer and co-founder of Umee, a Web3 bond-market platform, wrote that bitcoin had ""shown remarkable strength during this global crisis involving the banks.""  ""Something resembling a mini bull run could be in play, but I think there’s a need to be cautious here,"" he wrote. ""The Federal Reserve might continue hiking rates higher than expected – that is, beyond this most recent 25 basis point hike – given that inflation has yet to be tamed. A pullback could be in store because of this, meaning that it’s just too uncertain a time right now for more definitive calls to be made.""  James Rubin contributed to this report.

42421283,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno3J,1679515331,"Gov. Ron DeSantis, Privacy and the Politicization of the Digital Dollar","This week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis proposed legislation to try to prevent the federal government from deploying a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in his state. That move reflects an unfortunate uptick in politicization and is ultimately unlikely to succeed.  Alongside a banner blaring “Big Brother’s digital dollar,” Gov. DeSantis – expected to challenge former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination for president in 2024 – claims CBDCs can enable surveillance by the federal government, threatening individual privacy and economic freedom. His draft would prohibit acceptance of an American CBDC under Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code and enact other limits against foreign countries’ CBDCs. Moreover, he called upon “likeminded states to join Florida in adopting similar prohibitions ... to fight back against this [CBDC] concept nationwide.”  JP Schnapper-Casteras is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a practicing attorney.  At one level, his concerns are partly understandable. Depending on how it is technically designed and legally regulated, a consumer-facing CBDC could potentially amass and store large volumes of personal information about individuals’ daily purchases and movements. Domestically, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining cash-like privacy, should the executive branch and Congress move forward with a digital dollar.  Internationally, there are well-grounded fears that CBDCs can be used, particularly by undemocratic countries, as a means of pervasive surveillance and control of their citizenry.  A 2022 Biden administration executive order on digital assets already mentioned privacy nine times. Still, the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies could do more to take privacy seriously, for instance by openly consulting with nonprofit groups and reassuring the public they have little interest in a vast national repository of consumer data.  On another level, DeSantis’ announcement is emblematic of the broader politics around, and antagonism toward, the Federal Reserve. For example, this week, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who also opposes CBDCs, tweeted out, “End the Fed.” Other members of the Republican Party have recently lambasted the Fed’s decisions on hiking interest rates and have even proposed eliminating the Fed’s role in overseeing banks across the country. On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) proposed federal legislation that would block the Fed from issuing a CBDC, mirroring a bill that has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the Majority Whip and longtime crypto advocate.  Read more: John Kiff, Jonas Gross - Are There Tech Solutions to the Privacy and Compliance Trade-Offs for CBDCs?  DeSantis’ bill politicizes an issue that need not be so political. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was Undersecretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush and named Fed chair by President Trump, has greenlighted certain research around CBDCs but stressed he would ultimately need congressional authorization and public support before any CBDC plan could move forward. Even Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly floated the idea of a digital dollar during the Trump administration.  Around the world, CBDCs are being explored by 114 countries, representing over 95% of global GDP, including 18 Group of 20 (G-20) countries, according to the Atlantic Council. The Biden administration’s latest CBDC efforts are in a sense catching up with what other nations are already doing. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. government – under either political party – will actually adopt a consumer-facing CBDC as opposed to focusing on improving technology for bank-to-bank transfers, known as a wholesale CBDC.  It will be sad and somewhat surprising if CBDCs become the latest battleground for a culture war. But it would not be entirely unprecedented, in light of how payment providers and banks have periodically turned into cultural flashpoints in the last decade. But it would be curious to see CBDCs – a technology the Fed has not even solidly developed, let alone clearly decided to promote – turn into a hot-button issue for a national presidential campaign. It’s a relatively niche issue that until now has mostly been taken up by policy wonks like myself.  Read more: Lipsa Das - What Will 2023 Bring for CBDCs?  In the end, DeSantis’ legislation is unlikely to succeed for other reasons. The U.S. Constitution definitively gives Congress the power to “coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin.” Other federal laws make clear that federal law generally preempts state laws on banking. Each of the 50 states would not be able to ban local stores from accepting pennies as legal tender. Here too, if and when Congress decides to act on a digital dollar, that would trump DeSantis’ legislation under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.  Whatever becomes of DeSantis’ proposal, Democrats and Republicans alike should take this opportunity to delve deeper into the substantive privacy issues implicated by a digital dollar.

The SEC said in a press release it was suing Sun, the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent (now known as Rainberry) over the sale of tronix (TRX) and bitTorrent (BTT) tokens, which the regulator described as unregistered crypto asset securities. The regulator further alleged the defendants ""fraudulently manipulat[ed]"" TRX's secondary market through an ""extensive wash trading"" scheme.  Sun, who was named Grenada's ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) last year, tried to artificially inflate TRX's trading volume through the wash trading scheme, the SEC alleged, by having his own employees ""engage in more than 600,000 wash trades of TRX between two crypto asset trading platform accounts he controlled."" According to the court filing, Sun's Tron Foundation employees conducted the trades, the BitTorrent and Tron foundations controlled the accounts and Rainberry employees transferred funds for the trading.  Tron's native token TRX fell 13% on the SEC charge. Other tokens related to Justin Sun, including Huobi (HT), Just (JST) and Sun Token (SUN) also fell more than 5% on Wednesday.  The agency is also suing Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, Ne-Yo, Akon and Michele Mason on illegal touting charges for their roles allegedly promoting TRX and BTT without disclosing they were paid to do so. The majority of these celebrities settled the charges.  According to the filing, while Sun said on social media that paid celebrities were required to disclose that they were being paid, ""Sun himself arranged the payments to celebrities and knew those payments were not disclosed.""  Somewhere between 4.5 million and 7.4 million TRX was traded daily through these wash trades, the agency said.  ""This scheme required a significant supply of TRX, which Sun allegedly provided. As alleged, Sun also sold TRX into the secondary market, generating proceeds of $31 million from illegal, unregistered offers and sales of the token,"" the SEC said.  In a statement, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the case was an example of the potential risks crypto investors may face with unregistered securities.  ""As alleged, Sun and his companies not only targeted U.S. investors in their unregistered offers and sales, generating millions in illegal proceeds at the expense of investors, but they also coordinated wash trading on an unregistered trading platform to create the misleading appearance of active trading in TRX,"" he said. ""Sun further induced investors to purchase TRX and BTT by orchestrating a promotional campaign in which he and his celebrity promoters hid the fact that the celebrities were paid for their tweets.""

42414121,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwLiz,1679511587,"SVB Financial’s First Bankruptcy Hearing ‘Wasn’t Really So Routine,’ Says Legal Expert","A $2.1 billion fight is brewing between SVB Financial Group, once the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  SVB Financial, in its first bankruptcy hearing in a federal court in New York, claims the FDIC improperly froze $2.1 billion in funds when it became SVB's receiver after California regulators closed the bank on March 10 for what it called “inadequate liquidity and insolvency.” SVB Financial filed for bankruptcy protection on March 17.  So what should've been a routine bankruptcy court hearing Tuesday “wasn’t really so routine,” said Dov Kleiner, partner at law firm Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen, P.C.  “They want it because they’ve got creditors [and] they’ve got about $3.4 billion of debt against them,” Kleiner told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday, referring to the holding company. “If that money belongs to the holding company … then it all belongs to the creditors of the holding company.”  The FDIC disagrees, however, and also has said the former holding company might have to shoulder costs related to the bank failure.  Kleiner said SVB Financial needs access to that cash not only to pay its creditors but to continue running two other operations – an investment bank and an asset management firm. He said those operations have “about $9.5 billion worth of assets” managed in various funds.  California-based SVB was taken over by the state’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) on March 10. Two days later, the FDIC took the bank into receivership. All SVB deposits and assets were moved to a new entity, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank NA.  Klein said the FDIC-controlled bridge bank claims SVB Financial owes it “money for various things” and that SVB is “not going to turn over any of those [$2.1 billion in] funds until we know how much is owed [and] who has a priority [for] them,” he said.  Deciding which entity controls that $2.1 billion in frozen funds will likely to take some time to play out, Klein said.  “It'll be a fight over which law applies, and then it'll probably be a fight over what the actual claims are,” he said.

42421079,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRht,1679509261,Straith Schreder: The Future of Content Is Collaborative,"Ignore it or embrace it. The world of Web3 is here to change the way we do content. Shifting the power from a selected few to the consumers, brands on Web3 are no longer at the mercy of the algorithm.  Unlike Web2 media, Web3 doesn’t come with a marketing playbook and requires consistent experimentation. This is when creatives such as Straith Schreder come into play. As executive creative director at Palm NFT Studio, Schreder has been the go-to person of many brands. One can say that she knows your audience and she will deliver exactly what they want.  Straith Schreder is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  Schreder is also one of the creatives behind ""IRL"", a podcast that dives deep into digital media literacy. ""IRL"" has opened debates about important subjects including net neutrality, free speech, disinformation and data privacy. Most importantly, it consistently questions the difference between our online and offline identities.  “We could debate the performative aspect of being online and sort of see it through this moral or amoral lens like it's bad to perform online,” she says. “Or we could see it as something that is liberating and powerful in terms of crafting your identity and figuring out who you are.”  At Palm NFT Studio, Schreder has worked with names including DC Comics (Superman!, Batman!) and Damien Hirst, the controversial British artist. Her experience with the Web3 audience has allowed Schreder to understand the changing dynamic between brands and their community members.  “I think being able to work on projects that allow us to engage with technology in a different way – in a critical way – feels creatively very exciting,” she says. “And it also feels historically important because we're trying to look at ways where we can change the dynamic relationship that we have between creator and fan to build a paradigm that is more collaborative and participatory.”  As the world of Web3 brand building continues to evolve, we reached out to Straith Schreder to understand her experience in this industry.  This interview has been lightly edited.  If you had to compare the media and crypto industries, would you say they are more alike than they are different?  I worked pretty extensively at Vice with their commercial and editorial teams. And I worked on Mozilla, an internet health platform, looking at the way that technology and digital culture intersects with and relates to the way that we show up online and in real life, too. For me, decentralization is kind of one of the key issues and the imperatives of our time. Looking at how we can use this format and use this industry to shape, to sustain and nurture resilient, creative culture is really important to me.  Read more: How Web3 Animation Project 'The Gimmicks' Survives a Crypto Winter  For marketers, too, working in Web2 media has so many challenges. You have to publish on countless social platforms and you have to publish constantly. You have to choose your audience in many ways. That's not an audience that you own. And it's also not necessarily the best experience for fans. So looking at what's happening in the media landscape and what we can do to begin to build a more resilient, promising and more representative media culture, I think that will happen in Web3. This kind of what led me to Palm.  You produced a podcast called ""IRL"" about the difference between our online and offline identities. What did you learn about yourself by doing that?  I think in many ways spending time with this issue, talking to experts about this issue through our work like with ""IRL"" has changed my understanding of how we show up online. There's another artist whose work interrogates this really powerfully. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maya Man, but looking at kind of generative art as a way of explaining and exploring the way that we show up online can be really powerful, too. Which is what her work does really well.  In truth, there's no way to be yourself online because every online space is so mediated. That doesn't need to be a bad thing, though, because you can express yourself in new ways and try on different identities. You have more avenues now to figure out who you are. And I think that's a really powerful thing. So we could debate the performative aspect of being online and sort of see it through this moral or amoral lens like it's bad to perform online. Or we could see it as something that is liberating and powerful in terms of crafting your identity and figuring out who you are. So there's that piece of it, too.  How has your experience working with DC been? Is it tough reinventing a brand in Web3?  One of the things that I've taken away from that project is that there's a lot of diversity in the audiences that we work in and giving them as many ways as possible to participate in a project is really powerful. In the case of DC, we're looking at an audience that is on the surface largely a Web2 audience. At the same time those users, like 60% of them, came to our platform already owning crypto. So there's kind of a mainstreaming of the technology that is real, and that overlaps with some of these core collector audiences. I think what's powerful is that we've been able to reach these existing DC collector fans and we've also been able to create new fans.  One of the projects that we're working on with DC is called the Backhaul Collection and a key feature of that project is that holders collectors of this project can vote on and shape the first [non-fungible token] comic. So they're contributing to the canon in a really impactful way. They're creating comics with DC for the first time. They're meeting with the artists on Discord and they're casting the votes that determine what happens next.  Could you explain Palm's role in Damien Hirst’s “Currency” art project – and what does it feel like being a part of art history?  One of the things that is really cool about that project, similar to what we've been working on with DC, is this notion of participatory artwork. Again, to collect the currency is to make a choice about what happens next in the trajectory of that project. To be a part of that project is to participate in its making, because what Hirst asked of collectors was to make this fundamental choice about digital value – do you hold on to the NFT or do you decide to burn a painting?  And the fact that about half of people have decided to keep the digital piece tells us a lot about the power of digital ownership. So I think being able to work on projects that allow us to engage with technology in a different way – in a critical way – feels creatively very exciting. And it also feels historically important because we're trying to look at ways where we can change the dynamic relationship that we have between creator and fan to build a paradigm that is more collaborative and participatory.  Have NFTs actually helped anyone in the creator economy?  For me that's the power and the potential of NFTs. What I think that NFTs can begin to do is give us the tools and the language for what's possible with creativity. And that to me is really exciting. On a format level, looking at generative works that can create the conditions for more people to have unique experiences with art. And to be able to collect something that truly is one of one, something that speaks to them, is really important.  The idea that you could compress the space between worlds feels really cool. You can have an approach to royalties and remuneration that is truly artists first feels incredibly significant. So I think my hope is that, especially for what we work on as a studio, is to continue to push for what's possible when it comes to proving this out as a medium that will support artists and will kind of create a canvas for the worlds that we could build next.  How will Web3 build trust and support with Web2 customers? Will Web2 customers be able to make the shift easily?  That is the challenge that we're navigating right now, too. I think that for as much opportunity as Web2 media offers creators, brand and [intellectual property], there are still very real challenges around the cost of viewership, awareness and strat in these spaces. And I think that there are onboarding challenges to Web3, too, but I also think that there are clear and increasingly proven strategies around how this technology can work to engage audiences and build audiences and begin to build really durable and valuable relationships between artists and fans. As focus continues to be placed on technology and the infrastructure itself, I think that we'll begin to see even more brand adoption of Web3 platforms.  If you could show someone a piece of NFT to sell them the idea of Web3, what would it be?  I think one of the pieces that to me means a lot is one that I own from the collection, “Fake It Till You Make It” by Maya Man. It is something that comments on a viral belief system so eloquently and means a lot to me. But might it not be everybody's cup of tea.  It definitely looks like my cup of tea.

42414135,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwMfM,1679509102,Crypto Exchange Coinbase Suspends Algorand Staking Rewards,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) told its customers on Wednesday that it will no longer offer Algorand token (ALGO) rewards as of March 29. The token will still be available to trade.  A Coinbase spokesperson didn't give a reason for terminating Algorand rewards but said in an email to CoinDesk that “all rewards from the Algorand governance period ending March 31st will be paid in early April.”  “Coinbase works alongside asset issuers to provide rewards and continuously reevaluates our offerings to ensure the best customer experience. We have decided to discontinue Algorand (ALGO) rewards at this time,” the Coinbase spokesperson said.  However, Algorand Foundation's CEO Staci Warden tweeted on Thursday that the move was in light of regulatory scrutiny. ""They've [Coinbase] now informed us that they are evaluating their services in light of recent regulatory scrutiny, and, for that reason, they will no longer support Algo rewards for retail customers,"" she said.  Coinbase disclosed late Thursday, that the SEC alleged the U.S.-based company may be operating in violation of securities laws in the running of its exchange and staking services. The regulator has targeted Coinbase with a so-called ""Wells Notice"" that informs the business that the agency is planning a future action.

According to the exchange’s website, users can still earn staking rewards from the Ethereum, Cosmos, Tezos, Cardano and Solana blockchains.  The move involving Algorand comes as Coinbase’s staking service faces questions after crypto exchange Kraken in February agreed to pay $30 million in penalties and shut down its U.S. staking-as-a-service operation to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it was selling unregistered securities. At the time, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler warned other platforms to “take note,” hinting at possible further investigations into other U.S.-based crypto exchanges.

With the collapse of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and most recently Credit Suisse, cryptocurrencies appear to have become a safe haven among the mismanaged TradFi establishment.  On March 8, rumors of trouble at SVB caused digital assets to become entangled in the situation. The announcement that $3.3 billion of Circle's dollar-backed USDC stablecoin was held at SVB caused the stablecoin to depeg from the U.S. dollar.This led to digital asset investors selling positions on major exchanges. Bitcoin dropped from 22,410 to 19,500, and ether slipped almost 200 points from 1,560 to 1,368, breaking below its 200-day moving average momentarily before recovering.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  By Friday, March 10, news of the largest bank failures since 2008 had consumed financial media outlets, and banking indexes plummeted on fears of widespread contagion. The S&P Regional Banking Index (KRE) lost over 28% in roughly five trading days, and has yet to recover.  On March 12, the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced they would insure the deposits of the failing banking institutions to prevent a deeper run on banks and quell fears of contagion. The actions were clear enough to stop a major failure but not enough to keep depositors from withdrawing billions of dollars. Ironically, the major winners in this recent debacle have been risk assets, most notably digital assets like bitcoin and ether.  While correlations between the stock market and digital assets have always remained in flux, one of the most consistent predictors of crypto prices has been the global money supply. This recent bout of bank insolvency has created a new mandate for central banks to stop the bleeding by printing more cash.  The chart of M2 and total crypto market cap says enough about how liquidity affects the net demand for digital assets. If the current rally since March 11 can be trusted, crypto is predicting that central banks are going to have to keep printing to avoid (another) financial crisis.  Not surprisingly, this deterministic view of M2 = “bitcoin go up” isn’t as simple as it seems, as the Federal Reserve still has to compete with rising inflation, and hot unemployment levels. On March 10 payroll numbers came in above expectations, and just four days later the consumer price index showed a 0.5% increase in inflation. Neither of these figures has helped Chair Jerome Powell fulfill his mandate, but they have put pressure on the Fed to continue raising rates.  The conflicting data creates the question of how the Fed will react to both rising inflation and failing banks. Printing has already begun, but rate hikes would only exacerbate the problem, causing more banks to fail.  A look at the rate hike prediction since March 6 paints a good picture of how rapidly the situation is evolving.  What was widely predicted to be a year of higher for longer rate policy has shifted drastically to pause, and ultimately pivot, in the coming quarters. Policy anywhere in between is possible at this point. The Fed’s “dot-plot” forecast released on March 22 will provide a critical window into the confidence of Federal Open Market Committee members as they try to anticipate how effectively central banks can navigate hot macro data while safeguarding financial institutions.  In the middle of all this confusion sits crypto, which has steadily rallied and is now seen by many investors as a bulwark against another financial crisis. But can digital assets fully escape the trajectory of economies in decline? Should a banking crisis, inflation or further rate hikes deliver the hard landing that many assume is inevitable, will bitcoin be the escape pod?",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nathan Cox ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/22/bitcoin-emerges-as-safe-haven-as-traditional-finance-faces-turmoil,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c314b21dc77ff646d4a49ced2279ce9f6188237-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421311,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpaH,1679505835,The Reality Behind the Crypto Banking Crackdown: ‘Operation Choke Point 2.0’ Is Here,"The Biden administration and federal regulators appear to be using whatever means necessary to cut the cryptocurrency industry off from banking services. Critical observers have dubbed this alleged effort “Choke Point 2.0” after a similar push by the Obama administration to cut undesirable but legal industries off from the financial system.  U.S. officials have so far uniformly denied the existence of any such coordinated agenda. But whether it’s an active extralegal conspiracy or merely an alignment of motivations, the evidence is increasingly clear that crypto is in the crosshairs.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Figures including Brian Brooks, former head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), allege this has led to banks being targeted for shutdown, in part, because they served cryptocurrency customers. That would have no grounding in existing law, may violate recent FDIC reforms, and may have caused collateral damage by fomenting instability in the banking sector.  A new report, authored by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, devotes a lot of space to crypto, and certainly confirms the negative sentiment in the U.S. executive branch. One former financial regulator described this report to CoinDesk as “a damning indictment of the space that makes [the Biden administration's] policy position crystal clear.""  Choke Point 2.0  The report follows a wave of bank shutdowns that some have alleged were triggered not just by financial stability concerns, but by the broader push to strangle cryptocurrency businesses - despite the lack of any authorizing legislation. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank has explicitly claimed the shutdown of Signature Bank was intended “to send a message to get people away from [banking] crypto.” Frank is a member of Signature’s board, so he is motivated to claim crypto, rather than mismanagement, was to blame for the bank’s failure.  There is other support for the idea of an undisclosed crypto-strangling agenda. Reuters reported late last week the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) required Signature’s acquirers to give up Signature’s crypto customers in the sale. The FDIC initially denied that report but, as with other recent events, its actions would seem to confirm it. Signature assets will now become part of Flagstar Bank, but the deal, announced on March 20, did not include roughly $4 billion in deposits belonging to digital asset firms, according to the FDIC.  As no less than the Wall Street Journal editorial board argued earlier this week, this seems to confirm the FDIC is not just actively pursuing an anti-crypto agenda, but is lying to the public about it.  Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures seems to have been first to term this alleged initiative “Choke Point 2.0.” That refers to Operation Choke Point, an Obama Justice Department effort to lean on banks that served gun manufacturers, payday lenders and other legal but undesirable industries.  Though executed under the cover of anti-money laundering efforts, multiple critics, including former regulators and the House Financial Services Committee, ultimately condemned the original Operation Choke Point as an abuse of power, and further concluded that it had harmed lawful financial service providers. The Department of Justice launched an investigation of the effort.  Ultimately, new restrictions were placed on the power of the FDIC in the wake of Choke Point, in part to settle lawsuits brought by victims of the crackdown. Imposed in 2018, those restrictions included limitations on the FDIC’s ability to interfere with banks’ customer relationships, and a requirement that all efforts to terminate such relationships be expressed in writing. Informal or unwritten suggestions were also restricted, likely one major reason regulators and others continue to deny what is fairly obviously a targeted crackdown on a legal industry.  See also: Should I Keep My Money in Bitcoin or a Bank? | Opinion  In a statement announcing a 2019 settlement of its suit against FDIC, the payday lender Advance America said its lawsuit ""uncovered how some FDIC leaders and officials executed a campaign motivated by personal scorn for our industry, contempt for our millions of customers and blatant disregard for due process. This settlement will help to prevent this disenfranchisement from happening again – to our business or any other legal, regulated business.""  It seems highly plausible that similar targeted bias is at play in the FDIC’s recent actions. That may mean the agency faces another wave of official and legal backlash for its unauthorized initiative. But the damage – both intended and accidental – has already been done.  The Federal Department of Unintended Consequences  The apparent interagency push to debank crypto firms is coming at a moment that is politically expedient but economically fraught. The wave of crypto frauds and collapses in 2022, particularly the allegedly manifold crimes of Sam Bankman-Fried and his FTX associates, have made crypto an easy target.  But at the same time, rapid interest rate rises in response to inflation have fueled broad anxiety about the banking sector – anxiety that may have been compounded by the very moves intended to target crypto. In particular, the collapse of Silvergate Bank under regulatory pressure and attacks from figures including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may have primed fears that then led to a run on Silicon Valley Bank, which in turn fueled even broader fears.  There are other clear ironies here. Efforts to debank legal, regulated crypto companies in the U.S. would not have prevented FTX or other offshore frauds that have made the crackdown politically appealing. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies had more power to protect victims of U.S.-based alleged frauds such as Celsius Network, but failed to do so.  See also: When Will Crypto Learn From the Mistakes of Banks? | Opinion  As Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao observed, the crackdown is already having unintended consequences that don’t particularly make Americans safer. One immediate effect has been pushing users away from the U.S.-regulated and broadly trusted stablecoin USDC, and towards tether (USDT), an unregulated offshore service whose stability is an eternally open question.  The same offshoring effect seems poised to continue: Banks in Europe and the Caribbean have reported increased interest from crypto firms looking for options. That could lead to crypto firms pushed entirely out of U.S. jurisdictions.  That would have many effects – but it’s not at all clear that protecting Americans would be one of them.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,David Z.

42421323,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpld,1679503025,‘Smart Money’ Tools Reveal Where Crypto Capital Is Moving,"Who are the smartest people in the crypto room, and what are they doing with their capital?  “Smart money” is the moniker assigned to a loosely defined group of investors and traders who have an edge in their trading activities, often simply because they have more capital at their disposal.  The argument is that those with more capital have more resources and more to lose. Because of this, other, smaller investors want to know how they are spending their money.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  To be sure, “smart money” has seemed anything but.  In 1998, Long Term Capital and its team of PhDs required a $3.6 billion bailout, spurred by excessive leverage and poor trading results.  Ten years later, the 2008 financial crisis served as another example when the smartest people in the room required federal assistance to offset trading losses.  Most recently in crypto, the failures of FTX, Alameda Research, Three Arrows Capital and others showed the smartest people in the room making catastrophic mistakes.  So does watching what others are doing make sense at all?  I say, definitely yes. While you should determine your overall thesis, seeing how capital is flowing can provide helpful insights. With the exception of outright fraud, checking the smart money – or so-called large capital flows – always makes sense.  Even if poor results can happen with a sound thesis (maybe an unexpected event changes conditions), what matters is the extent to which those individuals or institutions can sway markets by their mere presence. Like a large ocean vessel, large capital flows often take other things with it, even if they are moving toward an iceberg. Gauging the vessel’s direction ahead of time can offer clues into how closely you want to court disaster and how many life jackets you bring along.  In crypto, a number of online tools can provide real-time insight into how capital is moving. These tools are a uniquely admirable characteristic of blockchain based assets.  Some of the tools vary, depending on the asset. For bitcoin (BTC), one option is “whale activity.” Whales are unique wallet addresses with 1,000 or more coins.  The 1,000 number feels arbitrary, but the implied minimum BTC portfolio value of $28 million today, and nearly $70 million at its peak, feels adequately large to offer some larger investing guideposts.  One metric of note is simply the decline in the number of whales over the last two years.  Since peaking at 2,157 in February 2021, the number of whales has fallen by 22%. BTC’s price, by comparison, has fallen by 41% over the same time period.  Looking at where whales are sending coins is also worth considering. Are whales sending coins to or from exchanges? The former has historically implied bearishness, while the latter usually indicates bullish sentiment.  Recently, coins have been flowing to exchanges. The net exchange volume for whales has been positive since October 2022.  These two factors suggest that larger investors have been cautious. Fewer whales exist, and the ones still around have their coins poised to sell. They could be incorrect, but knowing what they’re doing is worth knowing.  Tools specific to ether (ETH) and altcoins can provide additional layers of information. Platforms such as Nansen and Arkham Intelligence assign “smart money” labels to wallets based on both capital and investing behavior, and can provide real-time looks into their activity.  For example, I’ve recently found that three coins with significant movement into “smart money” wallets over the last 30 days are liquid staked ether, Aave interest-bearing USDT and Binance USD (BUSD).  Looking at individual funds, I found one whose largest identified holding was UNI, an outlier from other larger funds.  Filtering further shows the fund’s acquisition of UNI occurred more than a year ago, with little on-chain activity since that time.  Two years ago, UNI’s price was $32 compared to $6 today.  A fund holding an asset throughout a downturn of that extent could indicate significant long-term belief in the coin itself, a desire to participate in Uniswap governance, or that the fund may cut losses if and when UNI moves higher.  A clear answer may not be readily available, but investors can at least see the possibilities, helping them make informed decisions.  Other recent “smart money” moves that stood out include:  A larger fund removing wrapped ether (wETH) from exchanges, while depositing USDT, chainlink (LINK), and wrapped bitcoin (WBTC)  Over the last seven days, there have been 4% and 27% declines, respectively, in stablecoins USDC and USDT held in smart money wallets; WETH held in such wallets increased 12% over the same time period  While the net flow of BTC from whales to exchanges has been positive, it has also been trending downward since February  Identifying and analyzing smart money moves can consume hours, and can’t be completely covered in one column. But investors who take the time will enhance their digital research.  A traditional finance (TradFi) analogy would be a real-time live stream of 13F filings disclosing hedge fund positions in equities – hard to sustain, but also hard to look away from.  And whether an investment decision results in profit or not, considering it from its inception is helpful.  Takeaways  Making crypto history: On March 21, Coinbase made history, appearing in the very first crypto case to go before the U.S. Supreme court. However, the case wasn’t about digital assets per se, but instead how courts should handle disputes about arbitration, private trials where a neutral person (called an arbitrator) listens to both sides and makes a decision. In short, Coinbase argued that if the court says customers can go to court instead of arbitration (in spite of what was outlined in the user agreement), then companies like Coinbase should be able to put the brakes on the court case until they have a chance to appeal that decision. Although this case may not have a direct effect on digital asset businesses, it could have significant implications for Coinbase and other crypto companies in future conflicts with their clients.  A scathing critique: The Biden administration’s “Economic Report of the President,” published on March 20, took a swing at crypto, stating that various aspects of the digital asset ecosystem are causing issues for consumers, the financial system and the environment. The report analyzed cryptocurrencies' role as investment vehicles and payment tools, as well as their potential use in payment infrastructure, and claimed that ""many of them do not have a fundamental value"" while noting other issues with the sector. The report, more substantive in its treatment of digital assets than other areas of financial services that wreaked havoc in recent weeks, was a scathing critique that made their policy position clear, leaving many in the crypto industry feeling uneasy about the future regulatory landscape.  Bitcoin bargain? Bitcoin's Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio has decreased by 60% this year, despite BTC's price increasing by 68%. This is because transaction activity has outpaced price growth, indicating bullish sentiment and suggesting that bitcoin is currently undervalued. The NVT ratio measures an asset's market capitalization against its network transfer volume and is used to examine the cost of a digital asset. Similarly, ether's NVT ratio has decreased by 68% since January, while its price increased by 51%.  QE expectations: Bitcoin’s rally to $28,000 nine days caused Crypto Twitter to celebrate in anticipation of an end of monetary tightening, an onset of a new quantitative easing (QE) and the dawn of a new bull run. But the cause of this bullishness is far more complex than the simplistic reasons that the “QE is back!” chorus would have you believe, as Noelle Acheson, former head of research at CoinDesk, writes. What’s clear, however, is that concerns around banking and the debasement of the dollar have led to growing interest in bitcoin as a potential insurance asset. This could cause many investment managers, who were watching from the sidelines, to recalibrate portfolios.

In June 2022, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that a CBDC could preserve the U.S. dollar's standing and the Fed is assessing whether a U.S. CBDC ""would improve on an already safe and efficient domestic payments system."" ""The federal government has no authority to unilaterally establish a central bank currency,"" Cruz emphasized . Cruz's remarks come one day after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called for a state-level ban on a CBDC.

With the goal of helping Web3 projects curate and build their communities, Unstoppable Messaging aims to help users carry their digital identity across their Web3 experiences. Holders can use their domain endings, such as .polygon, .nft or .x, to send peer-to-peer messages to one another.  Sandy Carter, chief operating officer and head of business development at Unstoppable Domains, told CoinDesk that its latest messaging service is another step in the company’s mission of fostering Web3 identity and bringing builders together through a Web3 native communication tool that also ensures privacy, a vital feature for sensitive discussions as projects develop.  “Messaging for me is so powerful, because I came from Amazon Web Services where we always work backwards from the customer,” said Carter. “This product offering was completely driven from our partners, Polygon being one of them, and this enables them to do the messaging they wanted.”  Sanket Shah, vice president head of growth at Polygon Labs, is also enthusiastic about bringing messaging to Polygon-based projects and communities.  “Identity is at the center of every community. In the Polygon community, .polygon domains provide that digital identity,” said Shah in a press release. “We’re thrilled that the Polygon community will gain a Web3 solution for connecting with others using only their .polygon domains with Unstoppable Messaging.”  Unstoppable has been rolling out a host of new features and forging partnerships to help Web3 users build out their identities. In February, Unstoppable teamed up with crypto browser Opera to offer support for its Polygon-based domains. Last week, Unstoppable tapped Polygon to roll out .polygon domain endings.

42394490,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8LUN,1679498527,What Are Dynamic NFTs? Understanding the Evolving NFT,"As non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have grown in popularity, so have their use cases and functions. Discussions about a new class of NFTs known as dynamic NFTs are gaining momentum as digital assets evolve. While many NFTs are static, dynamic NFTs can change over time.  What is an NFT?  An NFT is a unique digital token that is stored on the blockchain and represents ownership of an item, real or digital. This unique crypto asset is differentiated from others through various data points, including a unique contract address and token ID. This means that no two NFTs are identical and they aren't interchangeable with one another.  A contract address refers to where the smart contract for the NFT is stored, in most cases for NFTs that's on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract can automatically execute actions when certain conditions are met without the need for an intermediary. A token ID is a unique numerical identifier for each NFT.  Static vs. dynamic NFTs  Some NFTs are static, meaning that once a token is minted to a blockchain, the data associated with that token cannot be changed. For example, if you mint a rare, one-of-a-kind artwork as an NFT, that digital image and the data associated with it will remain the same, no matter how much time passes or how many times it changes hands.  On the other hand, a dynamic NFT is a type of NFT that changes based on external conditions. Also known as a “living NFT,” the token has characteristics that can be triggered to change due to an event or achievement. For example, if you are a gamer, your NFT avatar can be programmed to change its appearance depending on your advancement in the game.  For clarity, GIFs and videos can also be considered static NFTs, as long as the specific JPEG image or MP4 video linked to the NFT doesn't change once it's minted. Dynamic NFTs only refer an NFT if it is able to be altered after mint. The alteration occurs in the NFT’s metadata and can also reflect in the appearance of the token.  An NFT’s metadata provides information about the content of the NFT, like its name, description, traits and transaction history. Typically, an NFT's metadata is stored off-chain and is specified as a JSON file.  Once an NFT is minted, its token ID and contract address cannot be changed. And although the metadata of an NFT can be modified after it has been minted, doing so can be a difficult and time-consuming procedure that requires knowledge of code. As a result, many existing NFTs are static and possess permanently immutable traits.  Although this static NFT model has found wide usage in NFT art projects, play-to-earn games and digital collectibles, its utility can be limiting for projects that need to regularly update aspects of their metadata, such as real-world assets, blockchain-based fantasy sports leagues and progression-based video games. This is where the concept of dynamic NFTs comes in.  How does a dynamic NFT work?  Dynamic NFTs function by storing data in a format that can be edited. While static NFTs are usually created using the ERC-721 token standard, dynamic NFTs use the ERC-1155 standard. That type of token standard is sometimes referred to as “semi-fungible” because it can be changed if required.  Changes to a dynamic NFT can be triggered by a smart contract. Typically, an oracle will send external data to the smart contract, which triggers a change in the NFT's metadata. The characteristics of that NFT, like its appearance, will then be updated.  Examples of dynamic NFTs  One of the early examples of a dynamic NFT is a one-of-one artwork by Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, titled ""Crossroad."" It was created before the 2020 U.S. presidential election and was meant to change its appearance depending on the result. After Joe Biden became president, the image changed to depict former President Donald Trump laying in a heap after losing the election.  The popular NFT-based game Cryptokitties is another example of a dynamic NFT. In it, players can buy, sell or breed digital cats. Each cat is represented by a dynamic NFT, giving owners the ability to update some of the data associated with the token, such as the cat’s genes, personality and appearance.  The digital collectibles of rising National Basketball Association star LaMelo Ball are dynamic NFTs. The NFTs incorporate on-chain sports data and change depending on the outcome of a game. For instance, if a player scores more than 1,000 points in a season, some NFT avatars in the collection could transform to reflect that. Notably, the Gold Evolve NFT came with a promise that if Ball won Rookie of the Year for the 2021 NBA season, the dNFT would evolve into a new image. The NBA star won the award and the NFT evolved.  In December 2021, Regenerative Resources, a company trying to transform degraded land into productive seawater landscapes, announced that it was launching five short films as dynamic NFTs. Although each short film will initially have a single frame, more frames will be released every time the token is bought or resold, until the holder can view the entire film.

Integrating crypto payments into messaging apps like Telegram – in theory rendering sending cryptocurrency as easy as sending a text or a photograph – should be an extremely positive development for mainstream adoption.

The addition of USDT could therefore prove an important development for Telegram's crypto service.  The messaging app's cryptocurrency journey goes back some years to its development of the Open Network (TON) blockchain project. However, this development was abandoned in 2020 owing to legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  However, TON was kept alive by members of its community, calling themselves The TON Foundation, who have continued to advance the project.  Despite not being directly involved in TON, Telegram maintains an interest in the network, exemplified by building its blockchain-based auction platform Fragment atop it late last year.

42414127,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwM9W,1679497143,French Lawmakers Agree to Effectively Ban Crypto Influencer Promotions,"French social-media influencers wouldn’t be allowed to hawk unlicensed crypto products under a plan voted on by lawmakers on a key legislative committee Wednesday.  The National Assembly’s Economics Committee voted in favor of a law designed to stop unsafe products or outright scams from being promoted by well-known personalities on sites such as Instagram and YouTube.  The committee agreed to an amendment to forbid online influencers from directly or indirectly promoting crypto-asset services from unlicensed providers. Proposed by Stéphane Vojetta of President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling Renaissance party and opposition socialist Arthur Delaporte, the proposed law would put digital assets in the same category as risky financial products, gambling and pharmaceuticals.  Since in practice no crypto companies are licensed by the French Financial Markets Authority, the measure amounts to an effective ban on influencer promotions, with violators facing two years in jail and a fine of 30,000 euros ($32,300).  Delaporte told the committee it is time to “act, in this period marked by political problems, to regulate a place where politicians have for too long been uninterested” – referring to a turbulent week in French politics with widespread unrest over a pension reform and with Macron’s government narrowly surviving a vote of confidence.  “It’s not about killing liberty, it’s about valuing the work” of influencers, Delaporte said.  If the law is agreed to by the Assembly and Senate, France would join countries such as the U.K. and Belgium in seeking to tighten promotion of crypto products. Last year, reality TV star Kim Kardashian settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for hyping EthereumMax without disclosing that she had been paid to promote the token.

However, a new report from blockchain-focused venture-capital firm RockawayX and startup data provider DealRoom shows that one region still managed to achieve record-setting investment levels in 2022.  European crypto startups raised a record $5.7 billion in VC funding last year, up from $5 billion in 2021, according to the latest State of European Crypto VC Funding report. The investment cycle followed the global trend of peaking in the second quarter and declining sharply in the first quarter of this year. Web3 remained a key sector of interest, while the fastest growth category was infrastructure, including developer tooling, blockchain scalability products and layer 1 blockchains.  “With an increasingly hostile U.S. regulatory environment, crypto industry onlookers speculate that the space’s center of gravity may shift, taking funding and innovation to other regions. This data suggests that the foundation exists for Europe to be a key beneficiary,” RockawayX CEO Viktor Fischer said in a press release. ""Europe already has a plurality of crypto startups, and a top early-stage ecosystem; if U.S. growth capital concentrates there, European crypto companies could attract the late-stage funding that catapulted U.S. leaders in the last cycle.”  Crypto investments worldwide had a rocky start to 2023 with venture capital and other investments down 91% year-over-year in January. Investors moved away from centralized-finance projects such as collapsed crypto exchange FTX to instead back earlier-stage infrastructure, Web3 and decentralized-finance projects.

Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), hovering around breakeven at $28.27K as of shortly before 9:30 a.m. ET, has surged nearly 70% since the start of 2023. Some say the tumult in the banking sector has served as a boon for crypto prices, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) up some 30% since Silicon Valley Bank was taken over by the FDIC on March 10. Chhugani drew a parallel between bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) recent price action and ""the pre-2020 days of Crypto, where it traded as a 'safe haven' and 'risk-off' asset."" So, if the U.S. central bank meets market expectations and hikes by 25 bps, crypto prices will sell off, ""but not by much because, such a move further hurts the banking system,"" he contended. A more fragile banking system ""is bullish for crypto because it reinforces the case for 1. a decentralized 'store of value' money that cannot be devalued by a central bank (Both BTC and ETH) and 2. a case for decentralized financial systems that can be transparent, swift and robust in this fast, social digital age of bank runs and allows users to maintain control of their funds through self-custody,"" the note said. On the other hand, should the Fed pause its rate increases, investors might come to the conclusion that something is breaking in connection with financial stability. For crypto, that decision could be an ""immediate positive impulse... but definitely, markets would wait to see what more is to come out of the banking situation."" Another scenario that could play out, although unlikely, is cutting rates by 25 or 50 bps. ""This acknowledges that the Fed went 'too fast and too far' in their rate hikes"" to bring inflation down, Chhugani wrote. Crypto markets in turn could rally on the immediate risk-on impulse, he added. Here's a deep dive on how the Fed is facing a dilemma -- to hike or not -- in the wake of the banking turmoil .

If Grayscale wins the lawsuit against the SEC, it could lead to a spot ETF being approved. If GBTC is turned into an ETF, that would close the deep discount to net asset value. But a spot Bitcoin ETF could also be an important landmark for Bitcoin itself. The recent banking turmoil helps to win back some sympathy for the digital currencies. I've been in a measured Bitcoin (BTC-USD) accumulation mode since October 2022 . I've been especially interested in the Grayscale line of products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). I intend to hold this until Grayscale converts it into an ETF (and thus closes the discount to NAV on this closed-end fund). GBTC is currently trading at a 36.87% discount. I think that's still a very wide discount (very few closed-end funds trade at such a discount) that's not warranted to begin with but especially not because Grayscale sued the SEC because it doesn't allow it to convert GBTC into an ETF. GBTC discount to NAV (Grayscale) This lawsuit signals that the company wants to convert the closed-end fund into an ETF/ETN. There are also clear business incentives because converting GBTC into an open-ended product would create the largest such U.S.-based product. The largest ETF/ETN within a category tends to attract quite a lot of the flows. It is also a much easier vehicle to hold or trade for many investors. Unfortunately, the FTX blowup set the crypto world back a bit. It certainly doesn't help Grayscale with its case against the SEC. A month ago, I didn’t think there was a real rush to scoop this up but thought it could look like a great buy in a few years' time. Two important things have changed: 1) Grayscale’s oral arguments in the Grayscale vs SEC case went down very well. 2) The tensions around deposit safety are again casting Bitcoin in a favorable light. The recent banking turmoil with today’s acquisition of Credit Suisse ( CS ) by rival UBS ( UBS ) won’t have escaped anyone’s attention. Bitcoin’s popularism was likely a product of the Great Financial Crisis and the widespread unhappiness about banking. That sentiment is becoming more salient as banks are blowing up once more. I think this is reflected in the recent Bitcoin price action. It took off around March 10 when Silicon Valley Bank failed: GBTC price (YCharts) In part, it is also a duration trade. Bitcoin also seems somewhat correlated to the 30-year treasury and the Nasdaq. With rates dropping hard through the banking turmoil, this is a tailwind as well. But in my opinion, that only explains part of the outsized move. Bitcoin price (YCharts) Bitcoin is surging above its 200-day moving average, and the longer it stays ahead, the more and more quantitative traders (momentum/trend following) start buying into that trade. The move in GBTC has been even more pronounced and that’s because of the oral arguments hearing on March 7 that went really favorably for GBTC. GBTC also broke through the 200-day moving average and is likely getting picked up by quantitative strategies (these were previously likely short). The way I understand the Grayscale vs SEC lawsuit is like this: Grayscale alleges it doesn’t add up if the SEC 1) allows a Bitcoin futures ETF but not a 2) Bitcoin spot ETF. I understand Grayscale’s argument as follows(remember, I'm not a lawyer, you can read the unofficial transcript here ): Futures derive their prices from spot and are approved by the SEC Because the SEC has accepted the situation of the futures ETF where; futures and off-exchange manipulation will be spotted by CME (Futures exchange) a Bitcoin spot ETF (while fraud monitoring futures) should be allowed as well The SEC's position is contradictory in arguing that the manipulation of the off-exchange Bitcoin spot would be spotted in Futures because the price action would show up there as well. The SEC is also arguing that the manipulation of off-exchange Bitcoin spot to defraud investors in a potential spot ETF wouldn’t necessarily show up in the futures and wouldn’t necessarily be spotted. Greyscale then argues the spot ETF could rely on the same fraud monitoring system the futures ETF uses. The SEC’s defense to this appears to be that Grayscale first needs to establish whether futures or spot Bitcoin can be considered as leading the other. This in turn seems to be a peculiar argument because 1) the futures market didn’t exist before they were allowed to trade. 2) I’d argue this isn’t how liquid markets operate. Futures and spot markets are much more likely to be part of a dialogue of price. A dialogue that’s kept in check by moderators (i.e. arbitrageurs). At times one will lead, and at other times another market will lead. It can’t be true one market consistently leads, or arbs would start front-running other markets until the lead disappeared. It comes very much across to me as if the SEC is invoking questionable grounds to stall the inception of a spot ETF. Another sign that its case may be quite weak was its attempt to invoke the Chevron deference doctrine . The doctrine makes it harder to second-guess the agency: The scope of the Chevron deference doctrine is that when a legislative delegation to an administrative agency on a particular issue or question is not explicit but rather implicit, a court may not substitute its own interpretation of the statute for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrative agency. Rather, as Justice Stevens wrote in Chevron, when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency’s action was based on a permissible construction of the statute. The judges also appeared interested in the $4 billion of value that would be unlocked if GBTC were allowed to be converted into an ETF (because of the disappearing discount). A practical effect that would greatly benefit investors. The timeline of the case looks like this: Grayscale vs SEC timeline (Grayscale) A decision could follow as soon as Q2 of 2023. That doesn’t necessarily mean the discount will close. It would likely narrow given the recent response. However, the SEC doesn’t have to approve the conversion. If the SEC is found to be in the wrong here, it could choose to get rid of futures ETFs to equalize the treatment of the two classes. That seems an unlikely response but it is theoretically possible. Finally, one last thing I believe is essential to understand is that a true U.S. Bitcoin ETF would likely have an impact on Bitcoin itself. It makes the asset even more widely accessible and embeds it into the existing investment universe. When a gold ETF was launched it seems to have permanently impacted the valuation of the metal. On November 18, 2004, State Street launched the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), it surpassed $1 billion in assets within its first three trading days. My impression has always been it had a marked impact on the price of gold because it became much easier to include as part of an asset allocation plan: I'm not sure if the recent banking panic-induced Bitcoin spike has legs but several other potentially more enduring tailwinds could start driving Bitcoin back toward previous highs. I still think it is quite likely the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) will look like a solid buy in a few years from now.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589276-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-etf-conversion-could-happen-sooner-than-expected?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10968360.jpeg

The unveiling of the new marketplace comes just weeks before Ethereum’s much-anticipated Shanghai hard fork, an upgrade that’s alternatively referred to by project officials as “Shapella.” The milestone will mark the first time that Ethereum users can withdraw ether from the proof-of-stake network, spurring growth in staking services as well as an emerging breed of staking derivatives – because investors should have more confidence in how and when they would be able to redeem or “unstake” their ether.  Read More: What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?  The Ethereum blockchain, started in 2015 , transitioned last year into a proof-of-stake network as its main mechanism for assuring data security – abandoning its original proof-of-work system that was seen as more energy intensive.  Staking as a service has drawn extra scrutiny this year, after crypto exchange Kraken in February agreed to pay a $30 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission and shutter its staking service in the U.S. to settle charges the service amounted to an offering of unregistered securities.  A nagging concern is that the rewards paid to Ethereum stakers might be deemed by regulators as being akin to interest paid on investment securities.  ConsenSys executives argued in a March 10 blog post that staking rewards “aren’t a mythical construct dependent on the acts of a specialized manager who enjoys discretion over how the funds are invested to generate a reward,” but merely a way to “incentivize volunteers to secure the network.”  The preferred characterization of staking is as “data validation not investment,” according to the blog post.  Consensys’ new staking marketplace will “hopefully start laying a foundation where you’ll see more and more institutions offer data validation into the network,” Bornman said.

42412546,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5KhO,1679489400,Bitcoin Mining Firm Navier Starts Tokenized Hashrate Marketplace for 'Qualified' Customers,"Bitcoin mining hosting and services firm Navier has debuted a marketplace for buying and selling tokenized hashrate, which is open for ""qualified investors.""  “What Reactor.xyz [the name of the platform] delivers is ownership of an asset, ownership of a certain amount of hashrate that will mine for a certain amount of time,” CEO Josh Metnick said.  So far, there are two options available to investors looking to mine without setting up their own facilities. They can use companies like Compass Mining, where they buy a physical machine and hosting services for it to operate, or work with a cloud mining firm like Bitdeer or BitFuFu, which owns and operates machines and then rents out hashrate for a specific period of time.  Navier’s solution “has similarities” to cloud mining, according to founder Metnick, but gives the user more control over their hash power, such as choosing what mining pools to use.  ERC-721 tokens will be used to represent the ownership of the hash power, such that they can be easily traded among users. Also, the hashrate sold comes from industrial-scale bitcoin miners, as opposed to Navier’s own sites like cloud mining firms.  Read more: After Countless Bungles, Compass Mining Tries to Change Course  According to Navier, the existing two models available come with a lot of uncertainty. In the Compass Mining model, you have to trust another firm of delivering the right machines at the right time, without any damage, and then sign an agreement for hosting, and hope there are no “gotchas” in the contract, Metnick said. Cloud mining firms essentially offer synthetic hashrate, which users have little control over.  ""After years of helping manage colocation clients and facilities, the top customer service support requests are various forms of 'why is my machine down?' or 'why is my (x)Th/s machine operating at (<x)Th/s?' Mining rigs and colocation facilities are just not very stable. Then add curtailment to the mix, and it gets even worse,"" Metnick said.  Navier tries to mitigate these issues using tokenization, as well as technology to ensure redundancy across sites for any given amount of hash power. Through these methods, they target 100% uptime.  ""At the end of the day, this is the most important feature — customers want to get what they paid for,"" the CEO said.  BitFuFu and Bitdeer offer compensation for such hashrate fluctuations.

Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter-point. according to the CME FedWatch tool. Edward Moya, senior analyst at foreign-exchange trading firm Oanda, said momentum flows could support a 5% move in either direction. “If the Fed doesn’t spark a rally, bitcoin could settle closer to the $25,000 region.” Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg, said that there could be a “super-cycle” happening in crypto. “Bitcoin beating gold, the top-performing old-guard commodity in 2023 to March 20, by almost 10x may be indicative of a super cycle happening,” he tweeted.

The March issue included an entire chapter on digital assets and ""economic principles.""

42412563,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5KvQ,1679482800,Latest Ethereum Blocks Suggest Validators Are Reversing Censorship,"Ethereum’s “censorship” problem seems to have changed course over the past six months. After the government's Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctioned Tornado Cash transactions to U.S. citizens in August, the vast majority of blocks added to the blockchain were OFAC compliant.  Now, the share of “censored” blocks has shrunk to less than a third – in what might be seen as a comeback for Ethereum’s anti-censorship ethos.  According to the site MEV Watch, during the past weekend and into the beginning of this week, roughly one in three blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain was OFAC compliant. This means that about 30% of blocks excluded transactions sanctioned by the OFAC, including Tornado Cash.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Flipping that around, more than two-thirds of blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain over the last 24 hours are not OFAC compliant.  Just a month ago, Ethereum validators were still censoring about 50% of blocks that made it onto the blockchain. The last time that Ethereum had such low levels of censorship was Sept. 24, 2022.  What contributed to the reversal?  Since Ethereum went through the Merge in September, about 85% of the blocks that made it onto the blockchain participated in a middleware known as MEV-Boost, where validators can request pre-made blocks from builders.  MEV-Boost is a software that helps validators earn MEV, or maximal extractible value, which are profits that come from rearranging or including certain transactions within a block. The MEV-Boost software was innovated by Ethereum research and development team Flashbots in order to distribute MEV among validators more equally.  While MEV-Boost hasn’t been integrated into Ethereum at the protocol level, it’s widely used by the Ethereum ecosystem, as 85% of validators have relayed blocks via the middleware component. Flashbots also has its own relayer for validators to connect with, used by roughly 25% of validators.  After OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash, there was debate over whether validators should include those transactions or not. Ever since then, the Ethereum community has continued to push for a censorship reversal, and the results of those efforts now appear to be paying off thanks, in large part, to the introduction of new, non-censoring relays.  At the time the sanctions went into effect, most validators were connected to Flashbots’ MEV-Boost relay, which Flashbots immediately programmed to censor transactions by default.  In response to community backlash, however, Flashbots raced to complete the process of open sourcing its code for MEV-Boost, so others could develop their own non-censoring relays.  Read more: As Censorship on Ethereum Begins, Could This Open-Sourced Code Help Counter It?  In November, Agnostic and ultra sound relays with a non-censoring version of MEV-Boost were introduced. Since then, they have risen up in the ranks of relays delivering blocks on Ethereum. Flashbots accounts for delivering about 26% of the blocks over the past 14 days, while Agnostic and ultra sound each have delivered roughly 20% of the blocks over the past 14 days.  Over the weekend, Agnostic and ultra sound each delivered more blocks on Ethereum than Flashbots did.  Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis Chain, which runs the Agnostic relay, told CoinDesk that “it took some time to get the word out and demonstrate that we offer a reliable relay.”  Now that validators have had the opportunity to experiment with MEV-Boost, many have started to turn to alternative relays like Agnostic and ultra sound.  “The number of validators that are connected to us is constantly growing,” Köppelmann said. “We were already able to deliver the most blocks of all relays for some period of time.”  Read more: Fewer Than Half of New Ethereum Blocks Over the Past 24 Hours Are OFAC Compliant",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/22/latest-ethereum-blocks-suggest-validators-are-reversing-censorship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f09ce791ca6f7817b25c485816c206d40bb07601-527x297.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412554,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Kos,1679481050,"Copper to Lay Off Up to 15% of Staff, Focus on Crypto Custody, Settlement","Cryptocurrency custody provider Copper said up to 15% of its staff face layoffs as the firm streamlines its business amid tough market conditions affecting the crypto industry.  Copper currently employs a little over 300 in staff. The redundancy process is just starting and the company could not put an exact number on job losses, a spokesman said.  The crypto bear market is forcing firms like Copper to scale back operations, leading to thousands of job losses. Last week Copper said it was shelving its enterprise software business, which included cutting ties with global custody bank State Street. Instead it is focusing on its “off-exchange” ClearLoop settlement network, which removes the need to deposit and leave digital assets on an exchange ahead of trading. The network is used by over 400 clients including the likes of Paradigm, Nickel Digital Asset Management and Gate.io.  A conversation about moving away from enterprise software integration with firms such as State Street has been taking place since the fourth quarter of last year, CEO Dmitry Tokarev said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “At the same time, we’ve had a meteoric rise in the demand for collateral management solutions after what happened with FTX,” Tokarev said. “There came a point where we had to prioritize the scalability of the business and really focus on the revenue lines that make the most sense for us.”  Tokarev predicts ClearLoop will offer Copper’s institutional clients access to about 30% of total crypto market liquidity by the end of this quarter as more exchanges integrate the network. The figure should rise to 50% by year end.  “The pipeline of integrations, which is currently jammed, will result in 50% of market coverage, with the full protection of segregated trust over those assets,” Tokarev said.  Copper, which counts former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond as its chairman, has been in the process of trying to find additional funding. Tokarev said there will be a funding announcement in due course.  “The company is in a good spot with multiple years of runway,” he said. “Personally, I think the most important thing is to focus on the business itself, not on raises and valuations.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Ian Allison, Will Canny",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/22/copper-to-make-up-to-15-of-staff-redundant-focus-on-custody-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2eff619b3db62030b761864da97c491166b50c8-2710x1524.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Space ID, the latest launchpad, whose subscription ended in the European morning hours on Wednesday, received over 8.4 million bnb (BNB) tokens in commitments from 99,000 holders over a 48-hour period that started early Tuesday.  That’s over $2.85 billion in commitments at current market prices for BNB.  All of that money won’t flow into Space ID’s ID tokens, however, as the project’s hard cap for funding is a relatively paltry $2.5 million. These tokens were offered at a rate of 0.00007412 BNB for each 1 ID, with 100 million ID offered in total.  The final allocation will be calculated based on the number of BNB commitments to total number of holders who participated.  Space ID is a Web3 domain management, allowing users to exchange, register and manage crypto-based domain names. ID can be used on the platform as a governance token.  Binance Launchpad uses a lottery system for its token distribution. Once a new initial exchange offer (IEO) is announced, a snapshot is taken of potential investors’ bnb holdings over a set period that varies according to the sale.  After the BNB holding period, a claim ticket button will appear for 24 hours to users which need to confirm their lottery tickets, after which the lottery will start and the winners will automatically allow users to become participants of the token offering in exchange for BNB tokens.  Previous Binance launchpads have increased by several multiples for investors – which likely generates massive hype and interest.  A December launchpad for Hooked Protocol’s HOOK tokens raised 9 million in BNB commitments from traders, offering its tokens at just 10 cents at the time.

42393738,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0QD,1679472939,"Tether Stability Made It the Safest Stablecoin Bet Amid U.S. Banking Crisis, Analysts Say","The often-controversial tether (USDT) stablecoin emerged as the best bet for traders looking for a stable haven earlier this month following a series of banking troubles in the U.S.  Stablecoin USD coin (USDC) fell under 90 cents on March 11 after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) revealed some of the industry’s major players had exposure to the bank.  These players included U.S.-based stablecoin issuer Circle, which held a part of its USDC stablecoin’s cash reserves at Silicon Valley Bank as of Jan. 17, according to the firm's latest attestation.  Decentralized stablecoins took a hit too, with frax and dai – both backed by a basket of tokens – falling by cents on their intended dollar pegs.  Who is the boss?  USDT held its fort, however, even trading at a premium in the following days. This came despite a long-held notion among some market participants about the token’s opaque asset backing and concerns about parent company Tether Global.  Data further shows at least $5 billion of inflows into USDT in the past weeks, bringing its market capitalization to over $77 billion as of Wednesday.  Part of that could likely be due to its supposedly low exposure to the U.S. banking system, some say.  “Tether has no exposure to SVB as its popularity lies more in the Asian region, meaning USDT doesn't rely on dollars being held in American banks, making it one of the safest stablecoins to pivot to currently,” said François Cluzeau, head of trading at Flowdesk, in a message to CoinDesk.  “We have seen a lot of USDC and DAI being traded for USDT, which has kept USDT liquid,” Cluzeau wrote.  The systematic risks of USDC affected dai stablecoins, which further strengthens Tether’s thesis of holding a variety of assets to back its stablecoins, said Mitya Argunov, chief product officer at P2P.org.  ""Tether’s performance during the crisis is largely due to its lack of direct exposure to SVB – it just didn’t have deposits there. Other major stablecoins like DAI were also indirectly exposed and depegged because they are actually largely collateralized by USDC,” Argunov said.  “However, the flight to [USDT] as a safe haven should also be seen as confidence in Tether’s portfolio risk management strategy – which minimizes duration risk, i.e., how SVB should have operated,” Argunov added.  Still a need for caution  Meanwhile, some developers continue to remain cautious for the long term.  “Looking at Tether's history, it has experienced FUD and redemption issues in the past and has been stable amidst current market turmoil,” said Danny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, in a note to CoinDesk.  “[USDT's] ability to maintain stability amid recent challenges suggests that it may have a chance at long-term success,” Chong said, adding that further stress tests would show if it remained “resilient in the long run.”  USDC also demonstrated the effectiveness and resilience of its hedging strategy through collaboration with its banking partners as it recovered its peg swiftly the following week, Chong said.  Demand for stablecoins is undented, however.  “The swiftness of Circle’s USDC recovering its peg after their announcement of a recovery plan is further confirmation of how the market values the potential for stablecoin businesses,” Chong noted.",POSITIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,FIAT | MARKET | USDT | DAI | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/22/tether-stability-made-it-the-safest-stablecoin-bet-amid-us-banking-crisis-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22d0dabd9cba6e5b351512b7e99243d2e4d0118c-4608x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412551,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Knw,1679468400,Blockchain-Based Debt Protocol Obligate Records First Bond Issuance on Polygon Network,"Obligate, a blockchain-based debt securities protocol, has executed the first bond issuance without any banks involved using the Polygon blockchain, the protocol said Wednesday.  The issuer was Muff Trading AG, a Swiss physical commodities trading boutique specializing in sourcing precious metals and raw materials from South America. Muff sold tokenized corporate bonds using Obligate’s marketplace. The firms did not disclose the debt issuance’s size and terms.  The development precedes Obligate opening its platform to the broader public on March 27.  Obligate, which is regulated as a financial intermediary in Switzerland, allows companies to issue bonds and commercial papers using blockchain technology without relying on banks. It combines the efficiency of smart contracts and traditional finance regulations. Issuers must go through know-your-customer (KYC) checks before onboarding to comply with regulations. Investors receive ERC-20 tokens in their crypto wallets representing the bond, carrying the right to receive payment at maturity or collateral in the case of a default.  The development highlights the proliferation of on-chain debt markets in decentralized finance (DeFi) and is the latest example of crypto markets offering real-world financial service for businesses and sophisticated investors. Last month, German industrial giant Siemens issued $64 million of bonds with a one-year maturity on Polygon.  See also: Hong Kong Successfully Offered Inaugural $100M Tokenized Green Bond  “The bond market is the largest financial market, but it only works well for large companies,” Benedikt Schuppli, Obligate’s CEO, told CoinDesk.  The most prominent advantage of issuing debt via blockchain-based protocols is that it connects bond issuers with investors without intermediaries, slashing costs and administrative fees, Shuppli explained. This allows smaller firms to access financing through bond markets.  Luca Muff, founder and CEO of Muff Trading, told CoinDesk that this was the first time his company issued bonds and chose Obligate to access markets. “As a mid-size commodity trader, it’s a very tough environment these days with traditional banks,” he said.  Obligate deducts a 0.5% issuance fee based on the size of the debt paid by the issuer.  Unlike Siemens’ on-chain bonds, Muff’s issuance sidestepped banks’ traditional fiat money payment rails and was funded using Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The debt was secured with receivables held at Apex Group, a financial services firm with some $200 billion of assets under depositary and a partner of Obligate.  “With traditional sources of lending restricted by current market conditions, this issuance enables investors to access on-chain bonds and commercial paper at a fraction of the cost and time, within the same secure and regulated framework they are familiar with from the traditional financial markets,” Bruce Jackson, Apex’s chief of digital asset funds and business, said.  Obligate’s choice to use Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, showcases the blockchain’s growing lure for institutional capital. Investment-management firm Hamilton Lane opened tokenized funds on Polygon earlier this year, while Clearpool, a DeFi debt protocol, is set to open its institutional platform Prime exclusively on Polygon in the coming months.  Obligate raised $4 million from Circle Ventures and Blockchange Ventures earlier this year, after securing a $4.5 million investment from Earlybird Venture Capital and SIX Fintech Ventures.

42412560,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Kqk,1679452565,"First Mover Asia: Traders Focused on Liquidity, FOMC as Asia Opens Its Business Day","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto prices continue to remain flat as traders a traders await the FOMC's decision on interest rates.  Insights: Monetary liquidity expectations are one driver moving crypto markets these days, though not in the way many think – even if easing is around the corner, liquidity is tight, argues CoinDesk columnist Noelle Acheson.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,209 +19.0 ▲ 1.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,111 +228.3 ▲ 0.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,793 +42.7 ▲ 2.4% S&P 500  4,002.87 +51.3 ▲ 1.3% Gold  $1,949 −30.6 ▼ 1.5% Nikkei 225  26,945.67 −388.1 ▼ 1.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Good morning Asia.  Crypto markets are once again fairly flat as traders await the next release from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Bitcoin is up 0.1% in the last 24 hours to $28,163 while ether is up 1.5% to $1,794.  Meanwhile, dogecoin is one of the market’s fastest-moving tokens, up 4% in the last 24 hours.  The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is coming close to a five-week low at 103.19.  One observation that’s been made is how the biggest stackers of sats appear to be the mini-whales, with wallets that hold greater than 10 bitcoins. This cohort is growing faster than the mega-whales, or those with a bitcoin balance greater than 10,000 bitcoins.  This suggests that there’s a new level of conviction forming for crypto, in light of macroeconomic events.  Overall trading volume continues to be flat across the market as traders await the FOMC’s next announcement on interest rates. Stocks are also flat ahead of the Fed’s policy decision.  Prediction markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 bps increase after the March meeting, while survey results from CME’s FedWatch put that number at 89%, up from 69% a week ago.  A CNBC survey shows that traders now have mixed opinions about Federal Reserve rate hikes with only 52% saying that the Fed should hike rates.  It remains to be seen how this new group of sats stackers will react if the Fed slows interest rates as the year progresses.

The S&P 500 had lost almost 17% of its value, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had suffered its worst one-day drop on record, and bitcoin (BTC) had plummeted over 50% to just below $4,000 before recovering slightly. The number of COVID-19 cases was rocketing up around the world; New York City was closing all bars, restaurants and schools; in Spain, we were several days into lockdown. Things were looking bad.  The financial machine was springing into action. On March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to almost zero and committed to boosting its bond holdings by at least $700 billion. The message was one of “we’ll do whatever it takes,” and it worked. The global economy staggered and then limped, but markets soared.  That week made history on so many levels. It also unleashed a wave of armchair virologists on Twitter to keep us up to date with every minutia of the COVID threat. We didn’t know it then but that wave set us up for what we’re living through today.  If you’ve spent any time on Twitter over the past week, you’ll have noticed a new breed of liquidity experts telling us that the Fed’s actions over the past few days mark a reversion to quantitative easing (QE) and/or a pivot. In 2020, more of us got into the habit of getting our news from Twitter, regardless of the quality. Fast forward three years and we have a similar mindset: New liquidity pontificators are trying to teach bona fide experts, and disinformation blends with nuance to create an uncomfortable mix of hope, distrust and confusion.  Superficial social media analysis aside, the events of three years ago also set us up for what we’re going through today on a more serious level. The liquidity that the Fed would inject into the economy in 2020-2021 created an easy money environment that pushed up asset values, flooded startups with eager venture capital funding and loaded bank balance sheets with low-yielding government bonds as well as some riskier securities. It also ended up fuelling the steepest increase in consumer prices in over four decades.  This, in turn, triggered the fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s, which decimated asset prices and destabilized the equilibrium between bank assets and liabilities. The crisis that began in 2020 as the pandemic introduced unprecedented stimulus entered a new phase three years later almost to the day, with the closure of three U.S. financial institutions in the space of a week and the disappearance of a 166-year-old global systemically important bank (Credit Suisse) as a separate organization.  As it tends to do when faced with banking system strain, the Fed has again jumped into action. To make more funds available to meet withdrawals, two Sundays ago it announced the opening of a new financing facility called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). This enables banks to deposit government debt as collateral in exchange for a loan of 100% of its face value, even if the collateral market value is much lower.  Here is where the crypto market started to get excited. From a local low of $19,700 on Friday, March 10, BTC went on to soar 42% to over $28,000 nine days later. (Stock and bond markets also rallied, but by insignificant amounts in comparison.) Crypto Twitter celebrated the end of monetary tightening, the onset of a new QE and the dawn of a new bull run.
