42400430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYcM,1505652690,Canada Confirms Tokens May Be Securities and Pacific Coin Is the Test,"Joshua Ashley Klayman is a counsel in the Finance + Projects group at global law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP and co-head of the firm's Blockchain + Smart Contracts group. Martin Kovnats, Donald Johnston, Matthew Liberatore and Shannon Corregan work at Canadian law firm Aird & Berlis LLP, where they specialize in M&A, private equity and data security.  In this opinion piece, the authors present a detailed overview of Canada's recent ruling on initial coin offerings and what they mean for the market.      The list of jurisdictions that are silent on the question of whether blockchain tokens may be securities has grown smaller.  Less than a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) each issued guidance regarding the application of their respective securities laws to token sales, Canada has weighed-in with a warning that largely is consistent with those nations' messages: issuers beware, tokens may be securities.  On August 24, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), an organization composed of Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators, released Staff Notice 46-307 Cryptocurrency Offerings, which addresses how Canadian securities laws may apply to cryptocurrency offerings – a category that includes initial token sales and initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency investment funds and the cryptocurrency exchanges that trade such products.  In addition, the notice helps to clarify which tokens may be considered securities for the purposes of Canadian securities legislation.  A welcoming tone  Unlike the recent SEC report, the notice does not focus on a particular enforcement action or on a potential bad actor or fraudster.  Instead, the notice provides generalized advice to those contemplating raising capital via a token sale or creating a cryptocurrency investment fund, and invites such businesses to reach out to local securities regulatory authorities to discuss ways in which to comply with Canadian securities law.  Indeed, the release accompanying the notice struck a welcoming tone, quoting Louis Morisset, CSA chair and president and CEO of the Autorité des marchés financiers, who said:  ""The technology behind cryptocurrency offerings has the potential to generate new capital raising opportunities for businesses and we welcome this type of innovation. … Given the growing activity in this novel area, we are publishing guidance to help fintech businesses understand what obligations may apply under securities laws.""  In the notice itself, the CSA refers to its regulatory ""sandbox"" and expresses encouragement for financial innovation, including with respect to cryptocurrency offerings, stating: ""We want to encourage financial market innovation and facilitate capital raising by fintech businesses, while at the same time ensuring fair and efficient capital markets and investor protection.""  It continues:  ""As cryptocurrencies become more popular and mainstream, balancing the demand for new investment opportunities and the need to protect investors from high-risk or fraudulent activities is extremely important. In order to avoid costly regulatory surprises, we encourage businesses with proposed cryptocurrency offerings to contact their local securities regulatory authority to discuss possible approaches to complying with securities laws. We welcome digital innovation and we recognize that new fintech businesses may not fit neatly into the existing securities law framework.""  'Facts and circumstances' test  Consistent with the recent U.S. and Singapore guidance regarding token sales, the notice does not state that all cryptocurrency offerings automatically will constitute trades in securities and, instead, explains that a facts-and-circumstances-type inquiry will apply.  The CSA notes that, in certain cases, a coin or token may be considered a security for the purposes of Canadian securities law, and that cryptocurrency offerings must be assessed individually to determine if they fall within the ambit of the legislation.  Crucially, the CSA notes that ""in assessing whether or not securities laws apply, [the CSA] will consider substance over form.""  The Canadian tests for what may be considered a security are, in many ways, similar to the U.S. securities analysis. Section 1 of Ontario's Securities Act (OSA) provides a lengthy but non-exhaustive definition of ""security,"" which includes ""any investment contract."" This definition may capture a purchase of coins or tokens where the value of such coins or tokens are dependent upon the future profits or success of a particular business.  In Canada, the leading case for determining whether an investment contract exists is the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario (Securities Commission) (""Pacific Coin"").  The four-pronged test announced by Pacific Coin is arguably based on the Howey test that exists under U.S. law.  Under Pacific Coin, an investment contract exists when there is:  An investment of money  in a common enterprise  with the expectation of profit  that comes significantly from the efforts of others.  Prior to the CSA's release of the notice, there had been some speculation in Canada that Canadian authorities might rely on the ""family resemblance test"" set out in ""Ontario Securities Commission v. Tiffin"" or adopt an entirely new approach for classifying and regulating tokens, coins and cryptocurrency offerings.  The notice, however, seems to indicate that Pacific Coin remains the key case for determining what may constitute a security.  If an instrument satisfies the Pacific Coin test, it is an investment contract under Canadian securities law, and therefore a security for the purposes of section 1 of the OSA.  If a given token or coin is deemed to be a security under the Pacific Coin test, the applicable cryptocurrency offering for such token or coin may be classified as a trade in securities, in which case, Canadian securities laws would apply to the transaction.  Selected securities law considerations  As discussed in the notice, Canadian securities law, among other things:  Requires a seller of securities to provide a prospectus (or rely on an exemption).  Imposes civil liability to investors if transactions fail to comply with securities laws.  And requires registration if the business conducting the ICOs/ITOs is trading in securities for a business purpose (the ""business trigger"").  Below are some of the considerations highlighted in the notice:  Prospectus and trading requirements: To be in compliance with Ontario securities legislation, sellers of securities must either file a prospectus with the regulatory authorities or rely on a prospectus exemption.  In the notice, while the CSA mentions that, as of the date of the notice, no business had used a prospectus exemption to complete a cryptocurrency offering in Canada, it also states that it anticipates that cryptocurrency businesses may rely on the accredited- investor exemption (which requires investors to pass an asset test), or the offering memorandum exemption (which implements various specific disclosure obligations on the part of the issuer), depending on the provincial securities legislation in consideration.  The notice also mentions that consideration should also be given to the trading of coin/token securities, post-cryptocurrency offering, on exchanges and to the applicable restrictions on secondary trading.  Registration requirements: If a token or coin seller meets the business trigger-test by trading in securities for a business purpose, the seller will be required to either register as a dealer or rely on an exemption from the dealer registration requirement.  In the notice, the CSA lists, among others, the following important considerations for determining whether a natural person or entity is trading in securities: solicitation of a broad investor base (including retail investors); use of the Internet, including public websites and discussion boards, to reach a large number of potential investors; and raising a significant amount of capital from a large number of investors.  Marketplace requirements: If a cryptocurrency exchange offers instruments that are securities, the exchange may be required to comply with the Canadian securities laws governing ""exchanges,"" either by applying for recognition as a marketplace, or by applying for an exemption from recognition.  In the notice, the CSA notes that, as of the date of the notice, no cryptocurrency exchange had been recognized in any Canadian jurisdiction, nor had any cryptocurrency exchange been exempted from recognition.  Additional considerations  The notice also advises that fintech businesses establishing investment funds that will or may have cryptocurrency exposure should be prepared to consider or discuss with Canadian regulators a range of issues, including but not limited to:  The potential for full prospectus disclosure requirements, in the case of funds for which fund investors are expected to or will include retail investors.  Due diligence efforts of the fund with respect to any cryptocurrency exchange that the fund will use to buy or sell coins or tokens (e.g. bitcoin).  Appropriate registration categories, which may include registration as (among others) a dealer, an adviser and/or an investment fund manager.  Valuation (and auditing of the fund's valuation) of cryptocurrencies and securities in the fund, as well as selection of one or more cryptocurrency exchanges.  ""Custody"" in the cryptocurrency context, including requiring the relevant custodian to have expertise relevant to holding cryptocurrencies (including ""experience with hot and cold storage, security measures to keep cryptocurrencies protected from theft and the ability to segregate the cryptocurrencies from other holdings as needed"").  Takeaways  Overall, the notice clarifies that cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency offerings, exchanges and investment funds, remain subject to the existing Canadian securities law framework.  The CSA appears to be signaling that it wishes to collaborate and interact with businesses in the coin and token space, to avoid regulatory surprises while encouraging financial innovation and development.  We will see whether the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan will take a similar approach after the provincial by-election in the province on September 7.

42400434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJYfJ,1505649624,"Estonia Wants to ICO, But Is Currency Law a Deal-Breaker?","There's a new party interested in initial coin offerings (ICOs): global governments.  This time, though, they aren’t just out to warn citizens or regulate the new mechanism. Instead, at least one progressive government is considering whether it can take advantage of the technology.  The Baltic nation of Estonia made a splash last month when one of its government agencies proposed launching a token – the ""estcoin"" – as an extension of its e-Residency program. As detailed in a blog post that quickly vent viral, the proceeds would be used to create a type of public-private sovereign wealth fund that would invest in Estonian digital infrastructure projects and technology startups.  The idea, which is still very much in the ideation phase, won equal praise and derision, getting lambasted by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.  During his regular press conference, Draghi commented on Estonia's bid:  ""No member state can introduce its own currency; the currency of the euro zone is the euro.""  It's a notable comment in that it underscores a strange disconnect: are these new cryptocurrency tokens actually currencies?  The token tiff  While governments around the world are still in the process of deciding whether or not cryptocurrencies meet the definition of a currency – and many times that depends on just when and how they're used – Draghi's comments indicate some are lumping ICO tokens into the currency bucket already.  But tokens have key differences from cryptocurrencies that might make them look even less like a currency.  In Estonia, for example, the wealth fund seems more about giving Estonia's 22,000 ""e-residents"" – foreigners who are allowed access to certain services and benefits normally enjoyed by Estonian citizens – a new way to engage with the country, than giving them a new method for transacting that could rival the the euro.  According to the August 22 blog post, authored by e-Residency scheme managing director Kaspar Korjus:  “A government-supported ICO would give more people a bigger stake in the future of our country and provide not just investment, but also more expertise and ideas to help us grow exponentially.”  In this way, the token – which earned the endorsement of ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin – would function as a vehicle for raising proceeds that's more nuanced and targeted than traditional means: namely, governments issuing bonds in international capital markets.  But there were a couple paragraphs in the blog post that likely raised red flags with Draghi, and will raise flags with other Eurozone regulators. Those paragraphs have Estonia envisioning a future where the estcoins could potentially be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services both in and outside the country.  The one currency  Either way, it seems Estonia might be putting the cart before the horse.  Because not only did Estonia forfeit its right to issue its own currency and control its monetary policy in 2011 when it joined the Eurozone, but with that it also relinquished its ability to raise money in anything other than the euro.  ""If you sign up to the Eurozone, you sign up to the euro. Your financing is in euros,"" said Daniel Heller, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former executive at the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of International Settlements.  In an email exchange with CoinDesk, sentiments from the ECB spokesman Peter Ehrlich align:  ""Within the legal framework of the European Union, in all member states that, like Estonia, have introduced the single currency, only the euro is the legal tender and the monetary policy lies exclusively with the European Central Bank.""  These statements are what make Estonia's public ideation that much more confounding, especially since the project sounds similar to Italy and Greece's efforts to create so-called ""parallel"" fiat currencies that could be used domestically alongside the euro. Both proposals have been met with red lights from European authorities.  ""There are no exceptions to this rule,"" a European Commission spokesperson, referencing the euro-only mandate, told Reuters in August after it slammed the door on Italy's parallel currency proposal.  The crypto utopia  While many government regulators have made recommendations, if not formal decrees, for how cryptocurrency should be regulated in certain situations, there isn't a more homogenous way of categorizing them as you typically see in more traditional markets.  While many have argued this diversity of opinion inserts roadblocks to the global tool's use, that hasn't stopped cryptocurrency's upward trend in price (arguably one of the main mechanisms used to determine cryptocurrency's success).  Similarly governments have begun forming mixed opinions on ICOs – everything from all out bans in China to accommodation in Quebec. But one thing seems certain: some of these tokens will be labeled as securities.  While some worry about the impact of these regulatory declarations, the industry, for the most part, has continued with business as usual.  Business as usual, that is, except with companies and developers trying to position their tokens so as not to be classified as a security by saying instead that they're utility or app tokens – though those definitions remain a structural and legal gray area, as well.  It's unclear, at this point in its ideation phase, how the estcoins project plans on defining its token, but it's currently soliciting feedback from stakeholders and potential participants.  Arnaud Castaignet, head of the e-Residency scheme’s public relations, told CoinDesk that initial responses from Estonia's startup and blockchain community have been supportive, and that the current goal is to lay out all of the pros and cons before mapping out any formal next steps:  ""We are ready to move forward, nevertheless a national conversation is necessary first. If there is support for this proposal, then the next stage before the ICO would be to provide a white paper that outlines the value of estcoins and how the investment will be used to develop our digital nation.""  In his blog post proposing the estcoins idea, Korjus did not discuss how the token might co-exist vis-a-vis Estonia's obligations to the euro, an omission that caught the attention of several observers. And Castaignet did not respond to follow-up questions about the topic.  A possible out?  While Draghi's remarks left no room for ambiguity about estcoin's viability as a state-backed digital currency, the ECB's Ehrlich didn't rule out the proposal entirely. Instead, he suggested that, because the project would be undertaken via a public-private partnership, it would be outside of the ECB's jurisdiction.  ""[M]y understanding is that it's a private idea and no official position. The ECB will not comment on ideas brought forward by the private sector,"" he told CoinDesk.  Therefore, with the right combination of messaging and legal sleight of hand, the project might just pass muster with European technocrats.  Heller reckoned that for the project to have a chance, it would need to as a bond-like financial instrument that is neither an official currency nor a traditional bond.  Further, the tokens would need to be tied to a quasi-official entity:  ""What would be possible is if it's issued by some state-owned entity. We have this distinction that, say, debt of the gas company is not public debt because it's a gas company, even if it's owned by the government.""  If Estonia is indeed able to thread the needle and launch the token without breaching its Eurozone obligations, the project will possess an aura of legitimacy that means it should have no problem attracting hungry ICO investors, reckoned David Gerard, a U.K.-based commentator and author of ""Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.""  ""Something offered by a government is going to attract attention,"" he said. ""The value proposition for their ICO would just be, 'We're a sovereign country with a decent credit rating for our size,' which is pretty attractive – especially in a bubble.""
