42426178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfHh,1416765486,How Dangerous is Satoshi Nakamoto?,"Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, has a lot of coins that remain unspent. What is he or she likely to do with them, and how might it affect the bitcoin universe?  This article was inspired by a CoinDesk commenter, who worried that we don't know much about Satoshi's intentions. ""That hoard gives him way, way, way too much potential influence and wealth,"" they said.  Satoshi certainly has a lot of funds. Bitcoin security consultant Sergio Lerner's oft-cited analysis puts the figure at around 1m BTC, based on the early mining that he or she did.  Most of those coins were unspent, the exceptions being some test transactions during the first ten days after Satoshi mined the genesis block (the first block on the blockchain).  Satoshi's fortune  That puts Satoshi's personal fortune at around $383m at the time of writing, based on CoinDesk's index of bitcoin prices, the BPI.  But how many yachts Satoshi could buy is less important than how much of bitcoin's inventory he or she owns. Today, there are around 13.5m bitcoins in existence.  Satoshi owns 7.5% of the entire bitcoin inventory: one thirteenth of a digital currency with a $4.9b market capitalisation at press time. And that's not counting the rapidly growing digital economy that sits atop it.  All of this makes people like Jeremy Glaros nervous. Glaros runs CoinArch, a bitcoin hedging system designed to pay interest on bitcoin investments.  The worst-case scenario  ""Concentrating control of a market in a few hands is not generally good for integrity, fairness or transparency,"" said Glaros, citing Silver Thursday as an example.  In that 1980 event, two billionaire brothers tried to corner the market in silver, sending prices soaring and subsequently plummeting after the US government stepped in to regulate.  With such a huge holding, could Satoshi exact similar pressure on the bitcoin market? It could be catastrophic, said Glaros. He points to the bear whale incident, when 26,000 bitcoins were unloaded on BitStamp on 6th October, slashing market prices by 10%.  What would happen if a much larger stash of coins like Satoshi's was unleashed on the market at once?  ""If Satoshi were to dump one million bitcoins, it is not only the price effect we have to worry about but what I'll call the 'faith' effect: after all, if the creator appears to lose confidence in bitcoin then what are the rest of us to believe?"" Glaros said. Bitcoin companies would become insolvent, he suggested, and the market would take a long time to recover – if it were to recover at all.  A gentler scenario  That's the nuclear option, but there are others. One other option, Lerner said, is that Satoshi sells off his or her coins responsibly.  ""Suppose that Satoshi spends one satoshi on block N, two satoshis on block N+1, and three satoshis on block N+2, from different addresses known under his control,"" Lerner said. That proves that he or she has the control of those addresses, and the ability to move the coins.  Then, Satoshi waits a week, and lets the community know in a message that he or she plans to spend the coins. But Satoshi also tells people that he or she won't do it all at once.  The first market reaction could be a drop in the price, because people might be spooked that addresses known to be Satoshi's are moving coins.  The subsequent reaction could be positive, because of Satoshi's explanation and already-measured approach, Lerner suggested. Who knows – maybe having this Jesus-like figure come back might increase confidence in the market and drive the price up over time?  Burn, baby burn  There's another option that could drive up the price: burning the coins. Bitcoins can be effectively destroyed by sending them to an address that is unspendable. Satoshi could simply eliminate the coins by spending them to an unspendable address.  ""If he did burn them, the market reaction would be terribly bullish,"" Lerner said. Fewer bitcoins would mean that the ones left would be considered more valuable.  Gavin Andresen, who was Satoshi's closest disciple, thinks that Satoshi could combine elements of both approaches, which he believes could let the shadowy figure cash out some of his coins without revealing his or her identity.  Andresen suggested that Satoshi could buy bitcoins at current market rates on an exchange, and then burn bitcoins from his or her early stash, which would push up the price. Assuming the price does rise, Satoshi could then sell the coins purchased from the exchange at a profit, Andresen said.  To get full market value via this method, Satoshi would first have to recoup the amount that he or she paid for bitcoin on the exchange, and then make the same amount in profit. That means that he or she would have to force the price of bitcoin up 100%.  Satoshi would have to burn a lot of bitcoin and potentially destabilise the market to pull that off. It isn't a sustainable method when you're trying to offload a large number of coins.  In any case, it's difficult to know what Satoshi is going to do with those coins, because we know very little about him or her.  ""As far as I know he never talked about if or when or on what he might spend those early coins,"" said Andresen, who was as close to Satoshi as anyone was in the time that the anonymous figure contributed to bitcoin.  Guessing at Satoshi's intentions  We know that Satoshi's achievement with bitcoin used developments made by many others, and we also know that he or she announced bitcoin via the MetzDowd cryptography mailing list. This email list was a hangout for a loosely coupled group known as the cypherpunks, which focused on using cryptography to preserve privacy. Eric Hughes' 'Cypherpunk Manifesto' lays it out here.  There are some references in Satoshi's few posts on emailing lists and forums suggesting an ideology of equality.  ""We can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years,"" Satoshi said in one posting, replying to a point about cryptography solving political problems.  ""Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.""  The Nakamoto Institute, which collates information about cryptography and freedom of information, keeps copies of Satoshi's mails and forum postings, and of some cypherpunk literature.  Bitcoin activist Cody Wilson, who helped create Dark Wallet and also founded the 3D gun design site Defense Distributed, is also a spokesperson for the Nakamoto Institute.  ""Having these coins is almost necessary. The whole system was predicated on this kind of original distribution,"" Wilson said. After all, someone had to kickstart the bitcoin network, seeding it with coins when few other people were paying attention.  ""There is something less than anonymous about Satoshi,"" continued Wilson. ""You could even argue that the system he built and his own behaviour with the coin gives you enough data points about his personality to trust this figure.""  Satoshi revealed  Lerner quantifies that behaviour, and reaches similar conclusions. He believes that Satoshi wasn't mining for profit, because of the way he or she gradually pulled out of the mining process as other miners took on a greater percentage of the hashrate.  He explains that this was done in multiple stages, each with two phases. Satoshi would first reduce the hashing rate on his or her machines. Then, Satoshi would turn off a single machine and then increase the hash rate on the rest of the machines to compensate.  ""This could be done to test how the network would react to the disconnection of the machine. This method suggests that Satoshi did not turn each machine off because it was broken, but because he wanted to,"" Lerner said. ""This two-phase disposal method contradicts the hypothesis that Satoshi was mining for profit, and reinforces the idea that Satoshi wanted to let others get the mining rewards.""  There's certainly a chance, we must suppose, that the conspiracy theorists may be right, and that Satoshi was indeed a malicious force: one of the three letter agencies, an international cartel of banking bigwigs, or a nation state playing some shady geopolitical game. Occam's razor wouldn't cut that way, but that won't stop people suggesting it.  Let's assume Satoshi was malicious for a minute. Most of his or her code has been rewritten at this point, so back doors seem unlikely. The coins that he or she is hoarding could be dumped immediately, with catastrophoic effect, it's true. But then, there are more ways to mitigate the risk.  ""Diversify!"" advocated Andresen. ""Bitcoin is a high-risk investment and should be a small part of a well-diversified portfolio."" Or, in other words, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  In the meantime, Satoshi's position is being diluted to the tune of 25 bitcoins every ten minutes. When the last one is mined, assuming that he or she doesn't spend or burn his or her coins, Satoshi would have just under 5% of the bitcoin inventory.  ""He could act like he’s playing a long con, but at this point it becomes an increasingly untenable position,"" Wilson suggested.  Satoshi could burn the market badly if he or she truly wanted to, but there's nothing in the evidence we have to suggest that he or she will. As one person said when I asked this question on ZapChain, maybe it's best not to worry too much about things that you can't control.  After all, if a handful of decidedly non-anoymous banks can bring the financial system to its knees overnight, perhaps we have other, more pressing things to fret about.

42426187,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjfbh,1416760576,The Blockchain Lottery: How Miners Are Rewarded,"In their new book Bitcoin for the Befuddled, Drs. Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer use non-technical language and clear, step-by-step approaches to explain the ins and outs of bitcoin. Here, they provide an overview of the ""blockchain lottery"" and the process of how miners are rewarded.  As an incentive for users to update the blockchain as frequently as possible, Bitcoin uses a lottery-based reward system. Many people become miners and try to be the first to add a block to the blockchain. Then, based on some probability, a winner is chosen and gets to add a block.  What is the purpose of using a lottery like this to run Bitcoin? Well, let’s imagine Crowley wants to buy a $10,000 car from Clarice. Using traditional currency, two people engaging in this transaction would probably go to a bank and have the money transferred between their bank accounts (or use a cashier’s check, which is analogous to this; see Figure 2-10).  They would do this at a bank because they need a trusted third party (a “banker”) that manages a “money ledger” and moves the money on the ledger from one person’s account to another. The banker’s job is to make an announcement that Crowley and Clarice can trust; that is, to affirm that the ledger has been updated correctly. (The banker may or may not be sporting a monocle, wearing a top hat, and smoking a cigar.)  With Bitcoin, we also need a person to adjust a ledger, which in this case means adjusting the blockchain by adding a block to it. It turns out anyone can fill this role, as long as he is not connected with either party in the transaction, because that could lead to a conflict of interest. Picking a person randomly through a lottery helps accomplish this. So with Bitcoin, a lottery picks a random miner, who then announces to the network that certain Bitcoin transactions are valid (see Figure 2-11).  Of course, there’s always a small chance this miner does know one of the persons involved in a recent transaction. This is why blocks are arranged in a chain: In roughly 10 minutes, when the next lottery winner is announced, this winner also confirms, as part of her announcement, that she agrees with all the transactions of the previous lottery winner (see Figure 2-12).  In the process, each winner in the Bitcoin-mining lottery receives a reward, which is a certain amount of bitcoins. The reward includes all of the transaction fees for the transactions in that block, which motivates miners to collect as many transactions into a block as possible, increasing their reward. To be eligible for the reward from the next block, which is added 10 minutes later, a miner needs to have the latest copy of the blockchain to participate in the next round. This process is done automatically by open source Bitcoin-mining software that runs on computers controlled by the people involved in mining. Because of this incentive structure, thousands of miners constantly help process the transactions of Bitcoin users, making sure that the blockchain is always up-to-date.  The reward lottery is run by the community; no central authority exists to choose a winner. We’ll skip the technical details for now and just say that miners generate random numbers continuously, until they find a winning one. This takes about ten minutes. The community then verifies (also through cryptography) that the number found by the individual miner is the winner, and the miner adds a new block to the blockchain and collects the reward. When this happens, the phrase commonly used is that a miner has found a block.  Bitcoin for the Befuddled by Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer is available now through No Starch Press.

42377832,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73iwh,1416753694,Stakes Are High for Star-Backed Bitcoin Gambling Site As Crowdsale Stumbles,"Online gambling has long been a driving force behind the bitcoin economy, though one that remains both shrouded in secrecy and hampered by a lack of regulatory clarity.  However, an attempt to launch one of the first major regulated bitcoin-powered gaming platforms is struggling to alter this narrative, despite backing from a slew of international gambling stars.  Breakout Gaming, announced on 16th September, boasts former World Series of Poker champions Johnny Chan and Huck Seed as marketing partners and will be powered by its own decentralized cryptocurrency, breakout coin (BRO). Gaming pros Jennifer Harman, Ted Forrest, Todd Brunson and Vladimir Shchemelev have also signed on to support the platform.  The project completed its first initial coin offering (ICO) period this week, raising just 387 BTC (roughly $136,000 at press time) toward its 1,000 BTC ($350,000) goal. The ICO began on 21st October and formally ended at midnight on 19th November.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Breakout Gaming's head of marketing Gian Perroni and CEO Billy Chung framed the struggles as being more indicative of poor market timing than a disinterest in the project itself.  Perroni and Chung said:  ""When we first launched our crowdsale, bitcoin was in a free fall, which cast a chill with potential purchasers – not only for our project but for the crypto community in general.""  Breakout Gaming said it views its ICO and its gaming platform as complementary services and that, should the ICO fail to reach its goal in another planned fundraising round, private sources could be tapped to bring the project to fruition.  Both Perroni and Chung remain convinced of the project's ultimate success. Unlike past cryptocurrencies aimed at specific verticals, like potcoin for the marijuana industry or titcoin for adult entertainment, Perroni suggested that the Breakout Gaming ecosystem will add value to its preferred currency by providing a built-in marketplace.  He said:  “The difference is that we're building a gaming property whose sole purpose is to support the value of the coin. What will make the coin successful is if the gaming is successful, and what makes the gaming successful is the fact that we have a blend of excellent products and very, very good experienced personnel.”  The platform will accept breakout coin, bitcoin and fiat currencies for breakout chips – the individual tokens that enable gaming on its platform.  Emphasis on gaming  Breakout Gaming intends to use 7m BRO to incentivize new players to its games, which will include real-money and free poker and casino gaming, fantasy sports leagues for major US sports and fantasy games for electronic sports (eSports) like League of Legends and Defense of the Ancientshttp://www.playdota.com/ (DotA).  These games, Perroni argues, would give the platform an edge, even if it wasn't focused on promoting the platform through an online currency.  ""There's no one who's running the traditional poker and casino and also blending that in with fantasy e-sports,"" he said.  The platform will also feature a unique 'fantasy crypto' property that will allow players to pit whole lineups of cryptocurrencies against one another.  The firm's 7m BRO will be distributed to customers over two years, Perroni explained, through a series of giveaways and guaranteed prize pools that he hopes will entice new players into Breakout Gaming and, by extension, the digital currency space.  ""Breakout coin will give a lot of people the opportunity to being able to use a cryptocurrency, people who may not have had the opportunity or the trust to find out what this is all about,"" he added.  Messaging issues  Though many forum members have expressed interest in the platform's planned gaming options, other aspects of the project have been greeted with less fanfare or with skepticism.  Breakout coin uses a unique mining functionality called 'Proof of Bergstake', a form of proof-of-stake mining that ensures only individuals who participate in the initial coin offering will be able to mine the currency in the future.  Investors who participate in the ICO earn bergstakes, which allow them to earn more coins, even if they sell the original coins they purchase.  The community has been less enthusiastic about the Breakout Gaming pre-sale, with some criticizing the many changes to its ICO terms and conditions. Breakout Gaming argues it has been transparent about the alterations, and even asked the community for advice on how to make the offer more appealing.  The platform is offering its ICO investors the option to refund breakout coins purchased during the ICO, but said that only one participant has so far elected to take advantage of this offer.  Poker stars back bitcoin  In statements provided to CoinDesk, Breakout Gaming illustrated that the poker stars it has recruited for the project all have a familiarity with bitcoin and digital currency, as well as an interest in their first project in the space.  The gaming pros reported that they all are sponsored gamers for the platform, though a few are considering direct investment.  Some like Huck Seed were more deeply familiar with the technology. Seed cited his background in computer programming as the key to his early interest, but reported that he has become more engaged as the ecosystem has evolved.  He described his 'a-ha' moment with the technology, one that speaks to the wide appeal Breakout Gaming is seeking to achieve:  “One day, I was playing an Internet tournament with thousands of people, from all around the world and it was such a great feeling to compete with people from all over the world at the same time!”  Others such as professional poker player Ted Forrest hinted at some of the complications that may have so far prevented the project from reaching its ICO goal.  “Unless people are familiar and comfortable with how to buy cryptocurrency, they are finding the process of first buying bitcoin and then buying BRO coin somewhat cumbersome to the point that too many just give up in frustration,” he said. “As we all know, the attention span of most gamblers is not the longest.”  In defense of altcoins  Forrest hints at yet another complicating factor for the platform, its native currency. When asked why Breakout Gaming elected to introduce its own coin, Perroni said the decision was made in the interest of enabling the platform to best entice new users.  Describing the altcoin as his firm’s “competitive edge”, Perroni said breakout coin and its pre-sale were ways to ensure the gaming platform had a loyal and incentivized user base.  Perroni also indicated that he saw an inherent way to add value to breakout coin: since it is a decentralized currency, Breakout Gaming must purchase the coins it needs from the open market.  “We’re required to make sure that we have enough coins to cover any chips that are in play. If someone buys $100-worth of breakout chips, we then have to buy $100-worth of breakout coin ourselves from the decentralized market in order to cover that,” he explained.  The limit on the number of coins mined per year, along with this built-in market for the altcoin, are supporting factors, Perroni suggested.  Project future uncertain  Issues with the ICO aside, Breakout Gaming's team is still refining its global market strategy.  Perroni voiced Breakout Gaming’s intent to pursue licensing in Kahnawake, Canada, which he said would allow it to position its gaming properties differently in its target markets, though he said this process hasn't been completed.  In the US, he said he expects residents will likely be able to play its gambling properties for free, while competing in its fantasy sports offerings. By comparison, Perroni indicated that licensing in Canada would allow the company to offer a full suite of services both there and the UK.  “We’ll be able to provide some form of gaming experience in every country, whether it’s free only or a blend of free and real-money gaming,” Perroni said.  Breakout Gaming reported that it intends to launch a second phase of the ICO, though specific dates have yet to be announced.
