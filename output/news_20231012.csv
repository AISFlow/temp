18728950,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555177,1697151605,"Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here’s When","Ethereum has struggled alongside Bitcoin through the current bear market climate but this has not stopped bullish predictions for the digital asset. The most recent bullish prediction comes from British multinational bank Standard Chartered which believes that the Ethereum price could climb higher than $8,000. Factors That Could Trigger The Rise Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank has revealed his forecast for the Ethereum price in a research note. According to the researcher, he sees big things in the future of the digital asset which could climb higher than $8,000 in the coming years. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Drop Back To $900? Here’s What This Analyst Thinks Talking about the asset’s valuation, Kendrick points toward the many use cases for Ethereum that have emerged over the years but also sees more use cases emerging as time goes on. One of those is the much-coveted gaming and asset tokenization sector. Also, the Standard Chartered researcher said that they expect that Ethereum will see more growth than the pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While he expects Bitcoin to rise 3.5x, they believe Ethereum will rise 5 from current levels. “We think the path higher for ETH prices may take longer than for BTC, but we see ETH eventually reaching a higher price multiple than BTC relative to current levels (5.0x versus 3.5x),” the researcher said. He also believes that Ethereum would go on to further register its dominance in the space, especially with the Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum that have popped up to enhance the network. This, he believes, would lead to an increase in the Ethereum profit-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). ETH price succumbs to bear pressure | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum Could Climb Above $8,000 In terms of actual dollar values, $8,000 is not the only figure that the researcher dropped for the Ethereum price. The expectations for the digital asset exceed this four-digit figure right into the five-digit territory as Kendrick believes ETH could rise to anywhere between $26,000 and $35,000. As for when this might happen, the researcher seems to be targeting the next bull market as he expects the factors that will drive this value growth to happen between 2025-2026. “We see the $8,000 level as a stepping stone to our long-term ‘structural’ valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000,” he said in the note. Then beyond this, the researcher expects the price to continue to rise. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunge Drives Liquidation Above $30 Million, More Pain To Come? This is not the first time that Kendrick has released a bullish prediction for cryptocurrencies. He previously said he expects the price of Bitcoin to reach $120,000 and the entire crypto market to rise as well. However, it seems the researcher is much more bullish on ETH. Not everyone has provided bullish forecasts for ETH though. One crypto analyst actually believes that the digital asset is set for more decline. In the analyst, FieryTrading suggests that Ethereum’s price could fall as low as $900.

18725665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555201,1697146203,"Arbitrum Sale On Binance: How This Investment Firm Lost $465,000 In An ARB Trade","Recent transactions by Arca, a prominent investment firm, involving Arbitrum native token ARB, have again put them under the spotlight. According to on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain, the firm has suffered a substantial loss nearing half a million recently. Arca’s Arbitrum Shipment to Binance Lookonchain reported earlier today that Arca transferred roughly 1.49 million ARB tokens to Binance. With a value of around $1.21 million, this transaction indicates a possible liquidation of Arca’s holdings in Arbitrum (ARB). Related Reading: Arbitrum: What’s In Store For ARB Token After Unlock? If this were the case, according to Lookonchain, it would translate into a significant loss of $465,000 for the investment firm. Notably, as significant as it seems, the ARB token transaction isn’t an isolated case of Arca’s investments not panning out as anticipated. Loononchain noted: “Arca’s investment this year appears to be terrible.” An analytical dive into the firm’s past decisions has shown similar patterns. For instance, Arca’s foray into GMX and DYDX left them with losses of $231,000 and $304,000, respectively. Their stakes in DPX and SYN further compounded their negative streak, resulting in losses of $142,000 and $107,000. Arca (@arca) deposited 1.49M $ARB ($1.21M) to #Binance at a price of $0.815 5 hours ago and is expected to lose $465K. Arca’s investment this year appears to be terrible. Lost $213K on $GMX, $304K on $DYDX, $142K on $DPX, $107K on $SYN; Only made a profit of $294K on $RDNT. pic.twitter.com/qPSuZc4MSA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 12, 2023 Silver Linings Amid Investment Storms However, it’s crucial to note that not all is gloomy for Arca. Investment is as much about strategy as it is about timing, and while the firm has faced setbacks, they’ve also had its share of victories. An example is their investment in RDNT, which proved profitable, netting them a profit of $294,000, according to the on-chain tracking platform. Furthermore, Arca is not alone in its recent losses with Arbitrum. The ARB token has seen a decline of nearly 10% over the past week and 1.2% in just the last day, ensnaring numerous traders in its bearish trajectory. Data from Coinglass indicates that Arbitrum has witnessed total liquidations amounting to approximately $376,160 in the past 24 hours alone. A significant portion of these liquidations were long positions, valued at $282,120, compared to short positions at a mere $93,840. This data suggests that many traders were optimistic about ARB’s potential to follow a bullish trend. However, starkly contrasting their expectations, they faced significant losses.

ETH sank to as low as $1,523, its weakest price since March, CoinDesk data shows. It’s since bounced back to $1,531 but remains down 1.9% over the past 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index’s (CMI) 0.5% decline.  Bitcoin [BTC], meanwhile, was off only modestly to $26,600 outperforming most of the rest of the digital asset market.  Solana [SOL], toncoin [TON] and Avalanche’s native token [AVAX] declined 2%-3% Thursday.  Tokens tied to the decentralized finance (DeFi) suffered the most among digital asset sectors amid continued tepid DeFi activity, with the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF) down nearly 2%.  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks broke their four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each slipped 0.6% alongside sharply higher bond yields as the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) – a closely-watched measure for inflation – rose 0.4% in September versus the 0.3% analysts expected.  The U.S. Dollar index (DXY) also climbed 0.8%, adding to the pressure on riskier assets such as equities and crypto.  BTC shows strength as altcoins struggle  Investment advisory firm ByteTree recommended investors to cut ether's weight in portfolios as the crypto continues to struggle.  ""ETH is a fabulous long-term project but, at the same time, is losing its spark as an investment,"" ByteTree analysts wrote in a market report earlier this week. They cited reasons such as lower network revenues from fees, diminishing amount of tokens burned – which flipped ETH to inflationary – and gradual decline of staking yield.  Read more: Ethereum Has Nearly Cleared Out Validator Queue, a Sign of Weak Staking Demand  ""All these combined factors impose bearish pressure on ETH, and given the continued underperformance, we believe it is prudent to reduce exposure,"" ByteTree analysts said.  One reason for BTC's outperformance while other cryptocurrencies struggle could be that investors flock to its relative safety during uncertain periods, according to Dan O’Prey, chief product officer of Bakkt.  “Bitcoin, being the most decentralized and secure asset, has also benefited from flows from the riskier, long-tail coins,” O'Prey said in an email.

42392300,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4vpT,1697144400,Coinbase Sounds Alarm on IRS Crypto Tax Proposal,"Coinbase (COIN), the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, is arguing that a recent proposal from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will endanger the industry and Americans’ privacy.  The IRS had proposed a rule recently to formally define crypto brokers and instruct them on how they and their customers can properly pay taxes. But Coinbase said in a comment letter to the agency on Thursday that the proposed rule represents “an unprecedented, unchecked, and unlimited tracking on the daily lives of Americans.”  “These rules would establish an incomprehensible and unduly burdensome set of new reporting requirements that will degrade and displace the same taxpayer services the IRS is seeking to improve,” according to the letter from Lawrence Zlatkin, the vice president of tax for Coinbase Global Inc.  The Blockchain Association, a U.S. crypto advocacy group, had previously argued that adopting these provisions could kill the industry in the U.S.  Hours before the Coinbase letter, the IRS had something of its own to say about crypto dragging down tax revenues with its latest “tax gap” estimate that flags how much tax money the agency should be receiving but isn’t. That estimate highlighted crypto as part of a growing problem, saying the projections can’t account for noncompliance in some areas including “issues involving digital assets and cryptocurrency.”  In August, the Treasury Department published its nearly 300-page proposed rule, meant to finally comply with the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It sets out reporting obligations for centralized crypto exchanges, payment processors, some hosted wallet providers, some decentralized exchanges and people or entities that redeem crypto tokens.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other Democratic senators, wrote their own letter to the IRS this week that advised the agency to rebuff industry complaints. The lawmakers’ chief concern was that the rules as proposed will take too long to go into force, which would “disadvantage law-abiding Americans and cause the federal government to lose out on billions of dollars in tax revenue.” Impose the rule “as swiftly as possible,” the senators suggested.  But Coinbase asked the IRS to re-write the proposal “to limit compliance requirements to those parties that directly effectuate transactions in digital assets similar to those in traditional finance.”  The agency must review the public comments received up to its October 30 deadline before it can consider a final rule.

18722157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555137,1697140858,US Mega Bank JPMorgan Predicts Harsh Drop In This Bitcoin Metric,"In a recent research report from JPMorgan, the financial firm has predicted a harsh drop for one Bitcoin metric, forecasting a potential decline of the Bitcoin Network Hash Rate by 20% leading up to the Bitcoin halving in April 2024. JPMorgan Expects Bitcoin Hash Rate To Drop In the report, JPMorgan stated that the Bitcoin mining industry is at a crucible stage leading all the way to the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 and beyond. This is because the approval of a Spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) could spark a rally against the backdrop of record hash rates and the impending block reward halving that threatens the industry’s revenues and profitability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Metric Touches New All-Time High, Time For Reversal? The report highlighted that the total four-year block reward opportunity is estimated at $20 billion, due to the current price of Bitcoin (BTC), which is 72% lower than its all-time high in 2021. This figure represents a significant drop from its peak of $73 billion in April 2021 and has fluctuated around $14 billion and $25 billion since the past year. As such, the financial firm expects the Bitcoin mining sector to see the predicted 20% hash rate drop at the next Bitcoin halving in April 2024. “We estimate as much as 80 EH/s (or 20% of the network hash rate) could be removed at the next halving (April ‘24) as less-efficient hardware is decommissioned,” the report reads. Bitcoin halving is an event that aims to control inflation and it involves the reduction of Bitcoin miners’ rewards by half, and it takes place roughly every four years after miners solve 210,000 blocks. BTC price still holding $26,800 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce noted in the report that the bank favors mining operators that can offer the best relative value in light of the existing hash rate, operational efficiency, power contracts, and more. JPMorgan chose Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark (CLSK) as its top pick among several companies listed by the firm, highlighting that the mining company offers the best balance of scale, growth potential, power costs, and relative value. In addition, the firm highlighted the significance of other mining firms it listed. These include Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot platforms (RIOT), and Cipher mining (CIFR). According to the firm, Marathon Digital is the largest mining operator, with the highest energy costs and lowest margins. Meanwhile, Riot has lower energy costs and liquidity, but Cipher has the lowest power costs with limited growth. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto CEO Delivers Bad News For The Altcoin The firm also included an outweight rating table and price targets of the mining operators in the report. The high cost of mining and the removal of inefficient hardware have been seen as some of the factors that tend to affect the Bitcoin mining industry. Large amounts of electricity are needed for mining, and at first, this makes it too expensive for miners to continue their operation. Nevertheless, many also tend to come back whenever the next bullish cycle drives Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels.

18720889,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555217,1697138799,"Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond","Cardano is one of the most actively developed blockchains with an ambitious roadmap. Its native ADA token has seen immense growth since launching in 2017. This article explores what’s next for Cardano prices. What is Cardano (ADA)? Cardano is an open-source proof-of-stake blockchain network founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2015. It aims to provide fast, secure, and scalable blockchain transactions through leading research and development. The Cardano blockchain is divided into layers handling different functions: Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) handles peer-to-peer transactions using the native ADA cryptocurrency. Cardano Control Layer (CCL) runs smart contracts allowing decentralized apps and protocols. Some key aspects of Cardano include: Proof-of-stake consensus Cardano uses an Ouroboros PoS algorithm that is less energy intensive than PoW blockchains. Research-driven approach Cardano takes a science and philosophy-based approach for robust protocols. Multi-phase roadmap Cardano is being developed systematically in stages as part of a long-term strategy. Governance model ADA holders can vote on Cardano Improvement Proposals to determine future upgrades. Significant capabilities Cardano aims to rival Ethereum as the leading smart contract platform once development completes. Due to its organized development path, Cardano proponents believe it can achieve the vision of becoming the most advanced blockchain. Factors Influencing Cardano’s Price Several core factors impact Cardano prices and market outlook: Cryptocurrency Market Trends Like most altcoins, Cardano’s price depends significantly on the performance of top cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum. Rising crypto markets lift ADA. Bullish Cardano news also can have an impact. Project Roadmap Progress Cardano hitting major roadmap milestones like launching smart contracts demonstrates real-world viability and boosts ADA price. Adoption By Developers As developers build dApps, DeFi protocols and NFT projects on Cardano, utility grows along with demand for ADA tokens. Staking Participation Higher staking uptake increases locked ADA supply reducing selling pressure and potentially raising prices. Competition Interoperability blockchains like Polkadot and Cosmos or faster networks like Solana threaten to erode Cardano’s market share which impacts growth potential. Upgrades and Governance Smooth upgrades through community governance signals stability and reliability, instilling confidence in the network and ADA price. Major Cardano Price History Developments Cardano is still early in its developmental journey. Here are key highlights so far: 2017 – Shelley Era Begins ADA tokens were first made available in early 2017, trading around $0.02 during the initial months. As the crypto market surged, ADA hit an all-time high of $1.33 in January 2018 before declining with the broader market. The Shelley phase of decentralization development began, with staking and community governance capabilities being built. This marked a major step towards realizing Cardano’s vision. 2018-2020 – Bear Market Consolidation ADA faded from the spotlight during the 2018-2020 crypto bear market, with prices falling as low as $0.027 in March 2020. However, staking adoption grew steadily, reaching over 21 billion ADA staked by August 2020 and reducing supply pressure. Despite price weakness, Cardano made major headway on technical improvements during this period away from the hype. 2021 – Explosive Growth Phase As crypto markets returned to health in 2021, ADA went on a monumental run starting from $0.18 at beginning of the year and reaching an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021 – a surge of over 15x within 8 months! Several developments triggered this growth phase: Launch of native tokens and smart contracts functionality, allowing DeFi and dApp development. Listing on prominent exchanges like Coinbase increased investment access. Investor confidence grew in Cardano’s methodology after meeting roadmap targets. Founder Charles Hoskinson’s media interviews drove interest among retail investors. This proved a breakout year for ADA establishing itself as a leading altcoin. Cardano ended 2021 at around $1.50. 2022 – Crypto Winter Survival The 2022 crypto bear market was harsh on most altcoins including ADA, which fell to around $0.24 losing over 85% of its value from the peak. However, Cardano maintained active development throughout 2022. Over 100 projects were building on Cardano by year end despite market conditions. This demonstrated strong ecosystem fundamentals. Recent Cardano Price Analysis In 2023, ADA hasn’t fared much better, making a lower low at around $0.22. It is currently trading at around $0.24 per token but is at risk of losing support of a descending triangle pattern. Short-Term Cardano Price Prediction For 2023 With less than 90 days left in 2023, Cardano has little hope for much higher prices, and investors should focus more on what happens if support is lost. Immediate short-term price predictions could even point to more downside, possibly falling as low $0.15 before the year is over. Medium-Term Cardano Price Forecast For 2024-2025 Once ADA finds a bottom, which could go as deep as $0.15 in the new year, the cryptocurrency market could finally be poised for a rebound. If these two years are positive for the cryptocurrency market, Cardano could find itself – shockingly – as much as $20 per ADA according to the Golden Ratio 1.618 Fibonacci. Long-Term Cardano Price Prediction For 2030 And Beyond By 2030, Cardano intends to fulfill its goal of becoming the most developed blockchain platform. Assuming it achieves the vision, ADA has vast growth potential. If it maintains the long-term linear trajectory it is on, there are changes that Cardano can trade between $10 and $45 in the longer term. The next decade promises to be transformational for blockchain technology. If Cardano can cement itself as a leader, its long-term growth could be exponential. Patience and persistence are key. Conclusion: Cardano Price Prediction Cardano has established itself as a leading development-focused blockchain with the goal of becoming the backbone infrastructure for decentralized finance one day. While market conditions remain challenging currently, long-term growth prospects appear bright for Cardano by 2025 and beyond. Hitting development milestones will be crucial for justifying significant price appreciation in the future. Cardano Price Prediction FAQs Let’s look at some common questions investors have about ADA price analysis: What was Cardano’s lowest price? ADA sank to as low as $0.017 in the early stages after launch in 2017. During the 2022 and 2023 bear market, it dropped to around $0.22 which is the recent low. What was the highest price for Cardano? Cardano’s all-time high price was $3.10 reached in September 2021 at the peak of the crypto bull run. Is $10 possible for Cardano? ADA reaching $10 is achievable if crypto adoption returns to rapid growth by 2025 and Cardano executes its ambitious roadmap. But $10+ seems unlikely in the near-term given current depressed market conditions. Can Cardano crash to zero? A complete crash to zero looks highly unlikely barring an existential catastrophe given Cardano’s strong fundamentals. But an extended crypto winter could potentially push it below $0.10 until markets recover. Why is ADA so volatile? As with most cryptocurrencies, speculation and changing market sentiments contribute to ADA’s volatility. As a top-10 token, it also experiences high trading activity and price swings. When will Cardano’s price stabilize? ADA volatility should stabilize significantly if/when Cardano sees massive adoption as a blockchain solution used by enterprises, institutions and governments. But markets will likely remain turbulent for foreseeable future.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-prediction-ada-for-2023-2024-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/18720889.jpeg

It would be the first time that has happened since Ethereum’s major “Shapella” upgrade in April, which marked the completion of the blockchain’s transition to a fully-functioning proof-of-stake network.  Blockchain data shows that there are now just 598 validators waiting to go onto the network, down from a peak of over 96,000 in early June.  The shrinking queue means that the expected waiting time to add a new validator to the network shrunk to less than five hours as of Thursday. This is a remarkable decrease from when new validators were looking at a 45-day wait due to massive pent-up demand to stake ether [ETH], the network’s native token.  Ethereum’s rules limit how many new validators can come on every blockchain “epoch,” or roughly 12 seconds.  Validators participate in maintaining Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain and verifying transactions by locking up (staking) ETH. In exchange for their efforts, they receive staking rewards.  Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade allowed withdrawal of staked ETH for the first time, eliminating a significant source of risk for investors – that they might not be able to get their funds back out.  The upgrade unleashed a wave of inflows into the blockchain’s staking mechanism.  ETH staking growth was “exceptionally strong” since the Merge – when Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022 – and Shapella upgrades, but the initial fervor has started to cool, David Lawant, head of research at institutional crypto exchange FalconX, noted in a market report.  “An empty activation queue implies a slowdown in the growth of staked ETH,” Lawant said.  Staking rewards have dropped significantly to near 3.5% from 5%-6% earlier this year, according to CoinDesk’s Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), due to tepid network activity to generate revenue from fees and the increasing number of stakers. Meanwhile, short-term U.S. Treasury yields have surpassed 5% as the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates to combat inflation.  Ethereum’s staking ratio – the share of tokens staked in the network versus total supply – has grown over 22% from 15% in this April and 6.5% last September, but still lags behind other popular proof-of-stake networks. The same ratio for Solana [SOL] is 69%, while it’s 63% for Cardano [ADA] and 53% for Avalanche [AVAX].  This is largely due to ETH being used as a “network resource,” and because Ethereum possesses “a more distributed shareholder base,” Lawant said.",NEUTRAL,ADA | ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/12/ethereum-has-nearly-cleared-out-validator-queue-a-sign-of-weak-staking-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec531d202def3d45729700fe3b33b57353ab8a45-1526x902.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392310,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4wZd,1697137875,The SAFER Banking Act Can End Discriminatory Banking Practices,"In the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, the need for a fair and supportive banking environment has never been more pressing. After a string of market failures, the digital asset industry has been impacted by regulatory overreach reminiscent of the “Operation Chokepoint,” where the Obama-era Department of Justice targeted banks suspected of working with industries (e.g., gun manufacturers, payday lenders) they deemed unsavory.  The result? A forced exodus of these businesses overseas. This not only deprived the U.S. of potential economic growth but also sent a message that innovation was not welcome on its shores.  Cody Carbone is the Vice President of Policy at The Chamber of Digital Commerce.  Emerging as a beacon of hope to resolve these issues is The SAFER Banking Act (sponsored by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Steve Daines (R-MT)), particularly Section 10. While crafted to dismantle barriers to financial services for marijuana businesses, the bill offers a beneficial opportunity for the digital asset industry.  It not only promises to end the stifling practices that have hampered the growth of legitimate digital asset businesses but also paves the way for a more inclusive and innovative financial ecosystem in the U.S. By emphasizing that personal beliefs or political motivations have no place in determining access to financial services, it ensures that lawful businesses are not unjustly targeted. This is a significant step towards ending discriminatory banking practices that impede U.S. innovation in the digital asset industry and other emerging technologies.  Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  Prudential regulation, not prejudice  The essence of a robust financial system lies in its ability to foster innovation while ensuring safety and soundness. Section 10 underscores this by stating that while federal banking agencies must ensure that banks and credit unions operate safely, they cannot let personal or political biases dictate their actions. It's a clear message: regulators should not be in the business of picking winners and losers based on prejudice.  Subsections (b) and (c) of Section 10 further strengthen the case for fairness. Subsection (b) establishes an extremely high bar for the use of reputation risk in requiring account closures. “Reputation risk” is the subjective term used by bank regulators to de-risk certain industries. Additionally, stipulating that federal banking regulators cannot arbitrarily request or require the termination of a deposit account without a valid reason, it ensures that businesses are not left in the lurch without justification. Moreover, the requirement for written notice with a valid reason for any account closure request brings in the much-needed transparency to the process.  Section 10 of the SAFER Banking Act is more than just a stronger legal requirement; it's a statement of intent. It signals the end of an era where discriminatory banking practices stifled innovation and forced legitimate businesses to look elsewhere, usually overseas, for support. By ensuring that personal beliefs and political motivations have no place in banking decisions, it lays the foundation for a more inclusive, fair, and innovative financial landscape in the U.S. It's not just a win for the digital asset industry; it's a win for the very ideals of fairness and justice that our nation holds dear.  The SAFER Banking Act, and Section 10 in particular, is critical to preserving access to banking for the digital assets community.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Cody Carbone,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/12/the-safer-banking-act-can-end-discriminatory-banking-practices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec0c3bcaa9e4bfdb98a47c7594dbaa3472b4c784-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392304,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4w4r,1697137169,Is Sam Bankman-Fried a Sociopath?,"This week, as the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried continues to unfold, there has been an emerging chorus of people willing to state, quite bluntly, that the founder of crypto exchange FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research is psychopathic. The former “golden boy” of crypto, aka SBF, is accused of multiple counts of fraud related to siphoning billions of dollars worth of his exchange customers’ money to fund a litany of investments.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Convicted fraudster Martin Shkreli, for instance, wrote that “SBF practiced smiling so people wouldn't think he was a sociopath,” an insight apparently gleaned from Michael Lewis’ recently published biography of the FTX founder, “Going Infinite.” Shkreli has become a semi-notable commentator on SBF’s trial and jail conditions, given his own experience with the federal criminal justice system.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  He also appeared on SBF confidant Tiffany Fong’s vlog series about the trial, in an episode titled “IS SBF A SOCIOPATH? Caroline Ellison, Love & Remorse.” Fong, who gained notoriety as a critical former user of failed lending company Celsius, has had multiple private conversations with SBF, including when visiting him while still under house arrest, and has leaked portions of SBF’s personal writings that SBF provided her.  If I were a psychiatrist (I’m not), I’d try not to violate the Goldwater Rule, but it is notable how often this armchair diagnosis of SBF's deeply immoral behavior comes up. It’s a reasonable reaction, to some extent. There’s a lot of evidence already in the public record about SBF’s conduct and demeanor over the years that suggest ill-intent or indifference to possible results over his increasingly risk-prone behavior.  Just yesterday, his former girlfriend and employee Caroline Ellison — whose diary SBF released, detailing their rocky relationship — testified that Bankman-Fried was willing to make strange bedfellows when it suited him. While searching for capital to cover the money he allegedly misappropriated, SBF reached out to Saudi Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and directed FTX staff to pay a bribe to state party members in China.  There have been reports alleging SBF was a bad actor stretching back to at least 2019, when he was still a rising star (with just over 6,000 followers on Twitter). Dave Mastrianni, a retired graphic designer and crypto trader, was part of a little-noticed lawsuit against Alameda, alleging the supposedly “market neutral” hedge fund ran pump-and-dumps and traded against FTX clients.  A lot of people were seemingly willing to paper over inconsistencies and rumors in SBF’s record, while others assumed blissful ignorance. Hasseb Qureshi, a founder of Dragonfly Capital, who kept a wide berth away from all things SBF after reviewing documents when presented with the opportunity to invest in FTX, thought the founder was just “flying too close to the sun.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has also stated FTX’s growth and pace of investments didn’t add up, and like others assumed Alameda must have been printing money.  Little did people know. To some extent, SBF did print money — in the form of exchange token FTT, the now-worthless asset that SBF used to cover up the fact that Alameda was functionally insolvent after taking funds “loans” it could never pay back from unknowing FTX users. FTT was collateralized to take out even more loans from companies like Genesis Capital, which Department of Justice prosecutors are arguing was securities fraud.  Tarun Chitra, who knew SBF socially, said FTT was the beginning of the end for FTX, and the turning point at which the self-proclaimed effective altruist Sam Bankman-Fried went bad. After selling FTT at a steep discount to market makers in 2018, SBF was put in a position of having to increase the “inflation” of the token that made what could have been a profitable exchange a “Ponzi.”  Lying, manipulating and indifference to the harm of others are common characteristics of sociopaths. But it’s an open question whether Sam Bankman-Fried became the alleged criminal now facing over 100 years in prison, or was born that way. Lewis’ book details the life of a man with anhedonia, the inability to feel happiness. In a lover’s note to Ellison, SBF writes “there’s a pretty decent argument that my empathy is fake, my feelings are fake, my facial reactions are fake.”  In an infamous VOX interview, which SBF claimed was off-the-record, SBF said his persona as a charitable billionaire was a front that made it easier to attract financing and gain users’ trust. Indeed, FTX’s flows to effective altruism causes pale in comparison to investments SBF allegedly directed, or signed off on, into luxury real estate startups and buy political favor.  The best defense here is that he was poisoned by an ideology that says capitalistic growth now does the most good later. But even the most calculating utilitarians would be hard pressed to say lying and theft pay for the harm caused along the way. SBF’s mom, a philosopher of consequence, also has atypical views on “blame,” preconceived notions of “right and wrong” and the extent people can choose to choose badly.  SBF’s formative years were also spent in a milieu influenced by the era of “cheap money” and “blitzscaling,” which incentivized ambitious people to cut corners for the sake of market dominance. Eight years his senior, SBF once argued Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’ major flaw was that “she lied.” Ironic now that Ellison, speaking on the stand, said baseline edicts like “don’t lie, don’t steal” weren’t part of SBF’s operating system.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Altruism Wasn't Very Effective | Opinion  Ellison also said on the stand this week that she grew more and more comfortable with lying while working for SBF, who allegedly “directed” her to commit crimes. But where did that impulse from SBF come from?  Personally, I think it is often misleading to try to reframe a person’s entire life story to fit the context of crimes committed later. One of the imponderables of this trial is whether SBF is truly a sick man, or whether he was molded by circumstance.  His defense attorney’s argue a failed business is not necessarily fraudulent, and the mistakes are explained by “building a plane while flying on it.” SBF further claims his former lawyers constructed a narrative that he was a villain, in part to excuse the fact they often signed off on decisions — like using Signal, and excessive exec compensation — that failed the exchange.  Much of SBF’s most contemptible behavior isn’t even part of his trial. And whether his deceit has cause doesn’t mean it’s not sociopathic. But there’s a risk in saying SBF is uniquely unfeeling, uniquely evil in that it erases all of the reasons people like SBF keep popping up.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | FTT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/12/is-sam-bankman-fried-a-sociopath,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/921884d07e01b20308f6af113806459e085f029e-1726x971.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Led by co-founder Sandy Peng, Scroll has been building a so-called ZK rollup – a layer-2 network built using zero-knowledge cryptography – that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine computing environment, or EVM. The compatibility makes it easy for developers to redeploy applications built for Ethereum onto the new ""zkEVM"" network.  Scroll’s debut adds to the competition among rival providers of zkEVMs, including Polygon and Matter Labs.  Etherscan, a blockchain explorer tool, showed the main Ethereum blockchain interacting with the “Scroll: L1 Gateway Router Proxy” over the past couple days, following a “Contract creation.”  On Dune Analytics, a blockchain analysis platform, a dashboard was launched to track the new Scroll zkEVM. As of Thursday some 370 ETH ($565,000 worth) had been bridged to the network, the dashboard shows.  Scroll’s launch comes after two years of research and about seven months after Polygon and Matter Labs released their own zkEVMs. Scroll’s zkEVM previously went live on a test network in February.

Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022. In September 2022, FTX won an auction for Voyager, but then FTX itself collapsed in November. The FTC's complaint against the company and Stephen Ehrlich alleged that Voyager ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) promised that consumers' deposits would be ""safe"" in order to get them to deposit funds. When the company failed, consumers lost access to assets they had saved, including ongoing salary deposits, college tuition funds, and down payments for homes, according to the complaint. Consumers were locked out of their cash accounts for more than a month and lost more than $1B in crypto assets, the complaint alleged. In one marketing campaign, the company said that USD held with Voyager ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) was FDIC-insured. Voyager, however, is not a bank or financial institution, and its clients' deposits are not eligible to be insured by the FDIC. Stephen Ehrlich did not agree to the settlement, and the FTC's case against him will proceed in federal court, the FTC said. Ehrlich's wife, Francine Ehrlich, was named as a relief defendant. Voyager ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) and its affiliates agreed to a $1.65B judgment, which will be suspended to permit the company to return its remaining assets to consumers in bankruptcy proceedings. In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission separately charged Ehrlich with fraud and registration failures. The CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of CFTC regulations.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At “Fear” Right Now The “fear and greed index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market. Alternative created the metric, and according to the website, it’s based on these factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends data. The indicator uses a numeric scale from zero to hundred to represent the sentiment. When the index has a value greater than 54, it means that the average investor is greedy right now, while it being under 46 implies a fearful mentality is dominant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Rejection At This Historical Line, Bear Market Back On? The region between these two thresholds naturally signifies a neutral sentiment among the holders. Until today, the sector had been stuck inside this region since the last couple of days of September, as the investors had been split about the trajectory of Bitcoin. The chart below shows that the market sentiment has worsened with the latest drop in the cryptocurrency’s price below the $27,000 level. It looks like the value of the metric has registered some decline in recent days | Source: Alternative After this latest drop in sentiment, the fear and greed index has hit a value of 45, meaning that investor sentiment has just entered the fear region. The value of the metric seems to be 45 right now | Source: Alternative Historically, the market has tended to move in a way that’s opposite to what the majority of the investors believe. The likelihood of such a contrary move happening increases as this imbalance in the sentiment rises. While the holders are leaning towards one side (fear), the imbalance is small, as the fear and greed index is barely inside the territory. As such, the probability of a rebound would be pretty high right now (at least based on the sentiment). Besides the core sentiments discussed before, there are also two special zones, called “extreme fear” (at or below values of 25) and “extreme greed” (at or above values of 75). These regions are where the cryptocurrency has often turned around in the past. Naturally, bottoms have occurred in the former zone, while tops have formed in the latter area. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See A 50% Rise Based On This, Analyst Explains If the Bitcoin fear and greed index continues declining in the coming days and reaches values near the extreme fear region, a bounce could become a real possibility.

42392307,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg4wPN,1697135336,Westerners See El Salvador as a Template for a New Monetary System,"Since I arrived in El Salvador In August, I have spent most of my time talking to Salvadorans about their experiences with Bitcoin, and how they see adoption progressing over time. But it is Western expats who see the most potential for Bitcoin to transform this Central American economy over the next decade. They see the nation as similar to Singapore 40 years ago, with Bitcoin serving as the catalyst for future domestic economic growth.  I spoke with Fran Stajnar, an early Bitcoin adopter from New Zealand, about his ambitions to create new ways for retail investors to get exposure to the Salvadoran economy. Fran previously started a digital asset investment fund called “Techemy.Capital” and moved to the Salvadoran beach during the pandemic. He currently is working on a Salvadoran ETF to democratize access to investing in the country and aims to channel Western capital into Salvadoran companies. He views Bitcoin as the first instance of the separation of money and state, and posits this could lead to a change in mindsets very similar to the separation of church and state that led to the Renaissance.  Jonathan Martin is a graduate of Stanford University, Georgetown University, and a student at The Wharton School, currently on leave immersing himself in the world of Bitcoin in El Salvador. See his other diaries entries here.  El Salvador has become one of the primary destinations worldwide for passionate Bitcoiners, Stajnar says. Many view their home countries in the West as being overly restrictive and authoritarian, especially in response to COVID-19. El Salvador, to him, represents freedom, and the opportunity to live untethered from the politics of Western governments.  In this era of fiat debasement, Stajnar believes that El Salvador is a beacon of hope for other countries. Investors across the world are starting to consider the counter party risk involved with holding assets in Western countries that are potentially at risk of a future sovereign default. Meanwhile, the BRICS nations are building an alternative system, pushing a global trend toward de-dollarization (though they insist that they are not junking the dollar just yet). Drip, drip, drip, flood.  Read more: Jonathan Martin - The Bitcoin Circular Economy Battles Entrenched Mindsets in El Salvador  Currently, the Salvadoran stock market, the Bolsa de Valores El Salvador, only has 83 listed companies. Unless you have the political access of a large sovereign wealth fund, it is currently difficult to find ways to deploy smaller amounts of capital. Stajnar aims to create a way to allow for more people to invest in the domestic Salvadoran economy – which will increasingly become Bitcoin-backed — as a hedge against fiat-backed Western markets. He believes that GDP could increase precipitously by 2030, if President Bukele’s policies are maintained through his re-election in 2024.  With the advent of bitcoin, money is now digital and programmable. With time, there will be a Cambrian Explosion of projects that build upon the base layer Bitcoin network, Stajnar believes. It is the TCP/IP of the new internet of value, and we have only scratched the surface of its potential.  The Great Reset could happen a lot sooner than most people realize, as the fiat system has been experiencing inflation since 1971. Wages have not kept up with the costs of goods and services, and the result is a large wealth gap in the West. El Salvador is in a unique position to serve as a proving ground for what the world on the “Bitcoin Standard” could look like – with a fairer monetary system for all.  Changing world order  The implications of a nation state adopting the “Bitcoin Standard” stretch far beyond the border of El Salvador. Since the end of World War Two, the backbone of the global fiat monetary system has been U.S. Treasuries. To function in the global economy, nations have been essentially required to maintain a reserve of Treasuries to purchase energy and participate in the U.S.-led global order. If more countries adopt the “Bitcoin Standard” and begin settling trade between each other in Bitcoin rather than with fiat, we will create a global monetary system.  The United States has the “exorbitant privilege” of being able to print fiat currency that is the glue of the entire system, allowing her to solve domestic problems or to finance wars by creating new money. This has allowed the U.S. to grow into perhaps the most powerful country in history – militarily and economically – at the cost of an ever-accelerating national debt burden. In my conversations, Bitcoin expats in El Salvador are well-versed in the historical pattern of the end of the long-term debt cycle resulting in a currency reset at a global scale.  Throughout history, there is a pattern of fiat currencies failing, usually by first hyper-inflating. The Zimbabwean Dollar and Weimar-era German Mark are prominent examples, but instances of debasement stretch as far back as the gradual reduction in silver content in the Roman Denarii. History rhymes, and as global sovereign debt increases, a default in the West or a significant dollar devaluation become increasingly possible outcomes.  Bitcoin serves as a “Plan B,” where people can choose to opt out of the perpetually inflating fiat system. Forward-looking Western expats in El Salvador think they know what is coming in the world financial system and have taken action to protect their future purchasing power and freedoms.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced related actions against Ehrlich on Thursday, with the CFTC also including in its court filing that Circle's USDC stablecoin and bitcoin as commodities.  The CFTC accused Ehrlich of defrauding customers by misleading them about the strength of the company and doing business without proper registrations. The FTC said he lied about customers’ funds being protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  “Ehrlich and Voyager lied to Voyager customers,” said Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s enforcement director, in a statement about the suit, which calls for restitution, penalties and industry bans for the former executive. “While representing they would treat customers’ digital asset commodities safely and responsibly, behind the scenes, they took shockingly reckless risks with their customers’ assets, leading to Voyager’s bankruptcy and huge customer losses.”  However, one of the agency's commissioners, Caroline Pham, argued the CFTC's position that the company should have registered as a commodity pool operator is a bad interpretation of the law.  The enforcement action's definition of commodity pools “would seem to include commonplace lending activity—like taking deposits and providing loans,” she said in a statement on Thursday. “Such an interpretation is an overreach beyond our statutory authority and would disrupt well-established legal and regulatory frameworks for lending to institutions and consumer finance.”  The CFTC also took the opportunity to put on the record assets it considers commodities – as the agency has done in other recent cases, saying “certain digital assets are ‘commodities,’ including BTC, USDC, and others.”  The FTC also settled with the company in an agreement that permanently bans Voyager from handling customers’ assets, hitting it with a $1.65 billion judgment that is suspended to allow the firm to continue its liquidation to pay back its customers.  “This action reminds companies and individuals: Don’t play fast and loose with claims about FDIC insurance,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.  After Voyager collapsed in July 2022, the crypto lender first negotiated a doomed deal to sell to FTX, and then another arrangement for sale to Binance fell apart. Former Voyager customers may not recover more than 36% of their assets, according to estimates.

18715409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555108,1697130020,What To Expect This Month For XRP Price According To Historical Data,"The XRP price has had a rollercoaster growth trajectory which was mostly hindered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a lawsuit against Ripple. But a lot of the altcoin’s performances over the months have been rather predictable, and with its history, we can get an idea of what to expect for the XRP price this month. October Not Looking Good For XRP Price In a heat map of historical XRP price data generated by NewsBTC, we can see how the month of October has usually gone in the past. The heat map shows XRP’s performance over the last eight years and the figures for October are some of the worst historically. As shown in the image below, the month of October has historically seen more losses than gains when it comes to the XRP price. In fact, out of the last eight years, only two years have seen October record a positive return for the XRP price. In the first four years of the altcoin’s life, we can see that the month of October was characterized by losses. Then in the fifth year in 2019, XRP saw its first profitable October with a 14.84% increase. Then from there, there is an alternating trend recorded with one year being profitable and the next being filled with losses. October has been historically bearish for XRP | Source: NewsBTC The year 2022 was no different, seeing 3.24% losses after the previous year saw October end with 16.71% gains. So if this holds, it could be that October 2023 would end on a good note. However, as the charts show, this month is already seeing XRP prices fall, so for it to finish strong, there would have to be a massive price reversal. Otherwise, October 2023 could stick to historical performance and end in the red. October Is Not A Good Month As shown in this report from Bitcoinist, taking an average of the XRP price performance in October over the years shows that it is not a good month for the altcoin. The chart shared in the report reveals that historically, October is the third-worst month for the cryptocurrency. The only months that have seen worse performance than October are the months of February with slightly higher loss numbers. Meanwhile, June takes the crown for the month with the worst returns as the last 7 seven years have seen the month end with losses. On the other hand, December presents as the best month for the XRP price. This is followed by April being the second, with May and March snagging fourth and fifth place, respectively. January, November, and September are also profitable months but to a much lesser degree.

The new Safe 3 wallet comes with a ""tamper-resistant hardware component providing extra protection,"" according to an announcement on Wednesday.  The new Keep Metal product is used for backing up recovery seed phrases - a random string of words that the user needs to remember should they need to restore access to their wallet.  Trezor's new models come as the Prague-based firm pushes to entice more crypto users to take full control of their digital asset holdings. The company says that fewer than 2% of the estimated 420 million global crypto users use self custody at present.  The goal of the new releases is to ""enable crypto novices and newcomers to enjoy the security and peace of mind that comes with owning and safeguarding their own crypto,"" CEO Matěj Žák said in the announcement.  Trezor's New Products  The new Trezor Safe 3 wallet can be used to secure bitcoin, ether and 7,000 other coins, according to the company.  Roughly the size of a keyring with a stripped-back design and two buttons, the wallet more resembles something you'd use to open your garage door than a sophisticated piece of hardware you'd entrust with the security of your wealth of digital assets.  ""The form factor and design is basically the simplicity,"" Žák told CoinDesk in an interview. ""It doesn't pretend to be anything fancy.""  The Keep Metal is a steel tube with 24 alphabet tables emblazoned onto it, on which users should punch through the relevant letters that make up their recovery seed words as an aid to memory.  Backing up seed phrases became a contentious issue in May of this year when another hardware wallet provider Ledger introduced a recovery service which would store it in encrypted fragments with third parties. The ""Recover"" service was not greeted warmly by the crypto community, with users claiming it undermined Ledger's brief of privacy and security.  ""I understand why they did that from a business perspective, but we would never go there because it's against the principal of a hardware wallet,"" Žák told CoinDesk.  And in a nod to bitcoin's dominance among cryptocurrencies – and perhaps the marketing reality that some users want to store nothing on their hardware wallets beside bitcoin – Trezor has also brought out a BTC-only version of the Safe 3 wallet to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of its first bitcoin hardware wallet.

42392329,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg599F,1697125500,Crypto for Advisors: Advisors Pivot to On-Chain Support,"In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, there's a constant influx of new investment opportunities. Whether it’s direct ownership, current or upcoming ETFs, various funds, or investments offering exposure to this dynamic asset class, there’s lots to learn.  In this edition, we're excited to have Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors guide us through the examples of investment models available.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  What Are Advisors Doing to Support Clients’ Digital Asset Investment Requirements?  The discourse on digital assets has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. Previously, financial advisors debated the merits of these assets, questioning their investable value and the wisdom of including them in diversified portfolios. A growing segment of cautious digital-asset pioneers have allocated low single-digit percentages of their client portfolios to different vehicles that offer exposure to digital assets. However, these investment vehicles have failed to address the needs of investors who begin to realize the value of owning these tokens directly – a key feature of digital assets.  Over the last decade, the industry rolled out products that offered different levels of exposure to digital assets in compliant, often publicly-traded vehicles, sidestepping the complexities tied to the type of instrument, custodial responsibilities or even fee structures. These vehicles have traditionally included publicly-listed ETFs linked to futures markets, index funds, trusts and options. However, for U.S. advisors, directly tracking the actual performance of the underlying assets remained elusive until the introduction of Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs), which opened the door to a broader range of investable digital assets safeguarded by custodians, granting investors a more genuine experience with digital assets ownership.  While each new product that went to market brought investors closer to these tokens, a prevailing theme continued to be high fees and the missing benefit of direct ownership of these tokens, such as the ability to stake and generate yield, borrow against or lend them. For this reason, a substantial segment of more informed investors has chosen the self-directed route, independently managing and investing in digital assets outside of their advisory relationship. This shift has grabbed the attention of advisors, signaling a potential overhaul in their roles and a new chapter in advisor-client dynamics.  According to a recent Coinbase & Morning Consult survey, 20% of Americans have a Coinbase account. If this is any indicator, a significant portion of advisor clientele have also proactively embraced crypto. Historically, advisors played the role of introducing clients to new investments and assets. Today, the trend reveals a client-led revolution, with digital assets at the forefront.  While investment decisions are paramount, custody remains a pivotal concern. The susceptibility of centralized platforms like FTX, Celsius, and BlockFi to fraud, risk-management failures and systemic breakdowns has amplified the appeal of self-custody. Here is a significant opportunity for advisors to focus on: to meet their clients where they already are and to incorporate these assets into their clients' financial plans. And to even be able to charge fees on the assets under management.  Through my work at L1 Advisors, I see how advisors are starting to cater to a whole new segment of individual and institutional clients who hold or want to hold digital assets themselves.  One example is Nick Rygiel, the owner and financial advisor at Ironclad Financial, who works with self-custodied clients and provides recommendations for transactions that clients can execute on-chain. The main benefit to Ironclad’s clients is that they can generate additional yield on the assets they already hold by deploying them to yield-generating protocols like Uniswap V3.  Another firm, Lumida Wealth Management, is going after an entirely new segment of clients: crypto-native individuals and institutions who have either generated most of their wealth, or who hold all of their treasuries and capital, on-chain. These clients generally don’t have the option of moving off-chain, but they still have the same financial planning, risk management, income generation, and investment management needs of traditional clients.  We are long past the debate of whether digital assets are an investable asset class. At this point, advisors would do well to understand how tokenization – what effectively makes a digital or on-chain asset – will change their business, as other asset classes become digital assets themselves. Current data from DeFi Llama indicates that so-called “real world assets (RWAs)” – think tokenized bonds, loans, real estate – worth over $2 billion are now locked in DeFi protocols, signaling the start of a move of assets on-chain .  This monumental shift isn't merely technological. A new generation of clients that has experienced the efficacy of transparent digital assets now expects this efficiency across their entire investment portfolio. The lines separating conventional from digital are fading. Hence, in the coming year, you can anticipate a surge in wealth and asset management firms launching on-chain investment solutions to meet their clients where they already are. This will kickstart the global migration of tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets onchain. And with that we’ll see a new world of possibilities for our industry.  –Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors  Ask an Advisor: Crypto Questions Answered  If BTC and ETH go up 2x in a bull run, which crypto assets will go up 10x?  I can’t even pretend I know. However, you can certainly perform some analysis and due diligence and help your clients find some crypto assets that may outperform. Many protocols are creating positive cash flow, which may flow to the token. Just know they are riskier, so should be an even smaller portion of their crypto allocation. As we keep saying…have an investment thesis and plan.  – Adam Blumberg, Interaxis  Keep Reading  Former Blackrock executive says, “The SEC will probably approve [all applications for ETFs] at the same time; I don’t think they want to give anybody first-mover advantage.”  Temporary Speaker of the House is known to be crypto friendly.

Bitcoin Has Been Rejected From The Short-Term Holder Cost Basis As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, BTC is currently facing resistance at the short-term holder’s realized price. The “realized price” here refers to the cost basis or acquisition price of the average investor in the Bitcoin market. When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is below this level, it means that the investors as a whole are currently in a state of net loss. On the other hand, the asset being above this metric suggests that the overall market is holding some profits right now. Related Reading: Ethereum Could See A Steep Decline If It Closes Below This Level In the context of the current discussion, the realized price of the entire BTC sector isn’t of relevance, but of only a particular segment: the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs are the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The members of this group are generally weak in their conviction, and thus, they can be quite reactive to changes in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price specifically for these STHs over the past couple of years: Looks like the asset retested this line just recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin short-term holder’s realized price is valued at about $27,800 right now. During its most recent attempt at recovery, BTC retested this line but ended up finding some major resistance at it. The indicator actually has a lot of history of acting as both resistance and support for the spot price of the cryptocurrency. Generally, this line has helped the asset during bull rallies, while it has impeded it in bear markets. From the chart, it’s visible that the asset’s price had found resistance at this mark and had remained under it throughout the bear market in 2022. With the rally that started in January of this year, though, the coin had finally managed to find a break. The realized price of the STHs had then flipped towards being a support level, as it had propelled the asset during the retests in March and June. With the crash in August, however, Bitcoin once again slipped below the line and has been unable to climb back above it since. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See A 50% Rise Based On This, Analyst Explains Given the significance of the line, the latest retest of the indicator was quite important, so the fact that it ended in failure could be a worrying sign for the asset, as it may mean that a shift back towards a bearish trend might have occurred. BTC Price Retests like the one of the STH realized price can sometimes take a while to properly finish, but since Bitcoin has seen a steep decline towards the $26,700 level since the rejection, it may be confirmation that the asset was indeed rejected this time.

While major cryptocurrencies will likely bleed into critical support, one analyst believes there is hope for the XRP Ledger native token. Related Reading: ADA Price Hints At Potential Correction, Buy The Dip? As of this writing, the XRP price trades below the critical psychological level of around $0.5 and stands at $0.47 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, XRP was one of the worst performers, recording a 9% loss. Bitcoin Dominance Declines, XRP Price Will Come Out On Top? A pseudonym analyst on social media platform X recently shared a chart showing a decline in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). This metric measures the amount of the total crypto market capitalization represented by BTC. When the Bitcoin Dominance declines, the altcoin sector benefits as the metric suggests investors could move away from the number one crypto into other assets. The analyst indicated that the BTC.D stands at a critical level, facing substantial resistance. In that sense, the metric could return below 50% of the total crypto market cap. The last time the BTC.D stood at current levels, the XRP price rallied above two major obstacles at $0.60 and then at $0.70. The analyst stated: $BTC.D Got to the level where the $XRP Lawsuit win news came out. This caused a big altcoin rally at the time and also marked the 2023 top so far for $BTC and many other coins. Altcoin Season Looming? But Something Needs To Get Out Of The Way According to this analysis, an altcoin season might be on the horizon for the XRP price and other similar cryptocurrencies. However, the analyst believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to decide on the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The narrative around this financial product has been gaining influence on the nascent sector, and if the SEC approves it, there will be much less uncertainty around the nascent sector. In the last 24 hours, some movement has been around the spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ETHGate Rumors: Did Ethereum Bribe The SEC To Go After XRP? This movement coincides with a spike in volatility across the board and could set the stage for fresh news that will trigger the altcoin season or push the XRP price back to critical levels. On the possibility of the SEC approving the ETF, the best scenario for XRP and other token, expert Eric Balchunas said: (…) very poss there will be a few back and forths with SEC on these small but imp details. So I would not say approval imminent but I would say the fact that issuers are in a “back and forth” w SEC on this is hugely positive IMO.

42392330,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg5947,1697117834,SBF Trial: Defense Counsel's Cross-Examination of Star Prosecution Witness Meandered,"NEW YORK — Early on, Sam Bankman-Fried's defense attorney hinted that his questioning of star prosecution witness Caroline Ellison would deflect blame from his client toward her, but he never seemed to quite hit that actual note before finishing his cross-examination Thursday afternoon.  Attorney Mark Cohen walked Ellison through a number of topics pertaining to last year's collapse of FTX and her role in running sister company Alameda. She seemed to become quite comfortable on the stand, correcting Cohen and answering far more than what he actually asked on multiple occasions. The defense attorney wrapped up with her without actually trying to assign her blame for her culpability in the FTX catastrophe.  In the first hour of testimony Thursday morning, he had asked several questions about the extent to which Ellison helmed Alameda independently of Bankman-Fried.  Cohen asked Ellison if it was true that his client was absent for ""long periods of time"" while she was CEO at Alameda. She said it was.  He also asked if, during those times, Ellison and Sam Trabucco, who at one point was her co-CEO, made decisions without Bankman-Fried's input. She acknowledged they did.  Ellison, 28, wrapped up her testimony Thursday, her third day of questioning. Sporting the same gray blazer as the last two days, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend was asked about her company's accounting.  Read more: Who Is Alameda Research's Caroline Ellison?  Alameda engaged with a few accountants in 2021 to 2022, but after those firms reviewed Alameda's books, ""they found they couldn't or wouldn't do it,"" Ellison said, as she faced questions from Cohen. Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame initially prepared Alameda's balance sheets, but at some point, Ellison took over this task, she testified.  The company's financials are at the center of Bankman-Fried's demise. An award-winning CoinDesk story in November 2022 that cited Alameda's confidential balance sheet caused many to doubt the viability of Alameda and FTX.  Cohen also asked about Ellison's early days at Alameda and disputes among multiple employees at the company that happened before she joined in 2018. Neither Cohen nor Ellison said more about the disputes besides her acknowledging she had heard about them. It was unclear what Cohen was referring to.  The defense counsel also asked Ellison if she was an ambitious person. While she said she didn’t consider herself to be an ambitious person early in her career, she recalled being more driven during her time at Alameda.  ""I became more ambitious as Sam encouraged me in that,"" she said.  Awkward moments  Cohen bumbled at times, asking Ellison to repeat much of the same information she told federal prosecutors during her testimony the day before.  He asked a number of questions about disparate topics, including the terms of Ellison's agreement with prosecutors, some of the documents she put together and the decision-making process at Alameda. There was no immediate common thread beyond Ellison herself and her role at Alameda.  At one point, Cohen rattled off the names of nearly every single month of the year as he asked a confused-looking Ellison if she had met with prosecutors during each of those months. The meandering line of questioning invited several objections from the prosecution and a couple of warnings from the judge.  Minutes into the cross-examination, Cohen called for a sidebar – a request he has made frequently throughout the trial. The ask appeared to exasperate Judge Lewis Kaplan, although he ultimately granted it.  ""We're not gonna do this [all day],"" Kaplan warned Cohen.  Despite that warning, Cohen continued to call for sidebars and ask Ellison a series of repetitive questions, prompting Kaplan, and the prosecution, to snap at the defense.  ""We've had several minutes of the same line of questioning,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said after raising one particular objection.  In response, Cohen offered an explanation for his method of questioning, but Kaplan quickly shot down the rebuttal.  ""I'd like you to go onto something else,"" Kaplan told Cohen.  Ellison appeared equally vexed with Cohen's legal strategy, making her frustration known during one particularly confusing part of the cross-examination in which he asked the former Alameda executive a question about the trading firm’s borrowing practices.  ""Do you have anything more specific?"" Ellison asked Cohen.  Terms of service  A letter sent by Cohen to the judge in parallel with Thursday's hearing suggests the line of questioning he might want to take with witnesses once Ellison is out of the way.  FTX customers' rights are ""not established by their expectations and understandings,"" Cohen argued in a Thursday filing, suggesting that what an earlier witness for the prosecution, commodities trader Marc-Antoine Julliard, hoped for from the exchange was less important than the actual contractual terms of service, drafted under English law.  Cohen, who has previously been told by the judge he can't probe whether FTX clients were simply negligent or gullible, has now said he wants to ask Julliard and Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang about the ""factors they considered material"" when signing up for the crypto exchange.  Defense strategy  Previously, Cohen has argued Ellison is the one responsible for the FTX exchange's dramatic collapse last year.  ""[Bankman-Fried] relied on [Ellison] and he trusted her to act as the CEO and manage the day-to-day,"" Cohen said in his opening statement last week. ""As the majority owner of Alameda, he spoke to Ms. Ellison, the CEO, and he urged her to put on a hedge, something that would protect against such a downturn. She didn't do so at the time, and this also becomes an issue later on, when the storm hit.""  Sassoon pushed back against that narrative in her direct questions to Ellison, walking the former trader through her conversations with Bankman-Fried about Alameda's financial position over the years before FTX's collapse. The two spent quite a bit of time discussing an analysis Ellison put together of Alameda's financials in response to Bankman-Fried saying he wanted to invest in more venture projects. Ellison said she recommended against doing so, but Bankman-Fried announced new venture investments in January 2022 anyway.  Months later, Bankman-Fried blamed her for not hedging Alameda's risks, Ellison said.  While Ellison ""absolutely could and should"" have hedged Alameda's risks earlier in the year, the problem was that Bankman-Fried had decided to make a number of investments that put Alameda into an unsound financial situation, she said.  ""I thought that hedging could have helped our situation, but I felt that the fundamental reason we were in the situation was that we had borrowed these billions of dollars in open-term loans and used them for illiquid investments,"" she said, and Bankman-Fried had made the decision to make those investments.  Another prosecution witness  Alameda software engineer Christian Drappi took the stand after Ellison's testimony came to a close.  The centerpoint of his testimony was a fateful Alameda all-hands meeting hosted by Ellison just days after FTX's liquidity crisis came to light in November 2022.  Drappi revealed that the meeting, which has been reported on previously, was secretly recorded by an Alameda employee who'd joined the firm just three days before it imploded.  Alameda ""borrowed a bunch of funds on FTX, which led to FTX having a shortfall in user funds,"" Ellison could be heard saying in an excerpt from the recording shared with the jury.  In the recording, Drappi asked Ellison if there was a plan to eventually pay back FTX creditors. She responded that ""FTX was trying to raise [money] in order to do this,"" but added the fundraising efforts ultimately fell apart. The revelation that FTX attempted to raise money to pay back its lenders caused Drappi to grow even more concerned.  Companies typically raise funds when they have something ""exciting"" going on, Drappi said he recalled thinking when he initially heard Ellison’s remark, ""not to fill a hole in a balance sheet.""  Prosecutors shared the audio tapes in an attempt to bolster Ellison's credibility with the jury. In theory, the all-hands meeting shows the Alameda CEO admitting to crimes before she had a personal interest in doing so. The tapes were recorded before Ellison was aware of FTX criminal investigations and prior to her making a plea deal with prosecutors.  Ellison said in the recording that she, Bankman-Fried and FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh were aware that Alameda used FTX customers' money.  ""FTX basically always allowed Alameda to borrow user funds as far as I know,"" she said at the meeting in response to a question from an employee.  The Alameda CEO appeared ""sunken"" as she spoke, said Drappi, who ascribed a spurt of laughter from Ellison as ""nervousness.""  In a recording played later during Drappi's cross-examination, though, Ellison's laugh was louder. When Judge Kaplan admitted the audio as evidence, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, Christian Everdell, negotiated with the judge to append an additional portion that prosecutors had initially excluded.  In the defense’s piece of the recording, an Alameda employee could be heard thanking Ellison for her openness and honesty about the situation, acknowledging that ""I'm sure it wasn’t fun.""

18705909,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555109,1697113847,Bitcoin Price Plunge: Long-Term Holders Buy $1.35 Billion Worth Of BTC,"A new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytical firm, has buttressed recent data indicating Bitcoin holders are adding to their holdings. These long-term Bitcoin investors, often known as “HODLers,” don’t appear to be phased by the recent volatility in Bitcoin’s price. According to on-chain data, long-term holders have been rapidly amassing Bitcoin, adding more than 50,000 BTC each month to their holdings. Monthly Accumulation Of BTC Worth $1.35 Billion Bitcoin is currently showing signs of slowing down, as its price just dipped below $27,000. It would appear that short-term speculators are mostly to blame for the persistent selling pressure, as data shows whale investors are seeing this opportunity to buy more BTC at a discount rather than secure profits. According to Glassnode’s HODLer Net Position Change metric, long-term holders are purchasing an average of 50,000 BTC worth $1.35 billion at the current price of Bitcoin every month. Another metric, the Long-Term Holder Supply, which measures the amount of BTC’s market cap with holders, also reached an all-time high of 14.859 million BTC. This means 76.1% of the total circulating supply has not moved in the past five months. Consequently, 94.8% of the total Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past month. Source: Glassnode To back up this data of increased accumulation, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared chart data from Santiment showing Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million. At this rate, the number of BTC vaulted by holders is poised to pass 50,000 in October. This increased accumulation suggests that long-term holders remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and see this price correction as temporary. #Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 $BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million! pic.twitter.com/47ZePiaIII — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023 BTC price falls below $27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Supply Tightens According to Glassnode, only 11.5% of BTC’s circulating supply changed hands in the last 3 months, indicating a prolonged inactive period of on-chain activity. That there are fewer transactions suggests that investors are unwilling to sell at the current price as the industry awaits approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Source: Glassnode If this current trend holds, then the current downtrend could be short-lived, especially if sentiment among smaller traders also turns toward buying. A predominantly hold mentality would give the asset time to recover and establish significant support that serves as a bounce-off point for another rally. Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,766 and is down by 1.31% in a 24-hour timeframe as it approaches the next major support near the $26,500 level. If enough large players accumulate at these lower prices, it may establish a price floor as bulls push the price back up. As crypto analyst James Straten points out, Bitcoin could jump 50% as part of the correlation between the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the price of BTC.

The cryptocurrency fell 2% on Thursday to around $26,600 after starting to drop on Sunday. Equities also dipped after gaining earlier in the week and gold edged higher. September’s consumer price index (CPI) is due at 8:30AM ET, and is expected to have slowed slightly.

Caroline Ellison wept on the witness stand near the end of her second day testifying against her former boss and ex-boyfriend, the fallen cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. The diminutive, soft-spoken former CEO of Alameda Research described the unraveling last November of her hedge fund and its sister company, the FTX exchange, and the “relief” she felt as revelations about their fraud became public. “I felt a sense of relief that I didn’t have to lie anymore,” Ellison testified. Her voice trembled and cracked as she recalled one particular text message exchange between her and Bankman-Fried during what she described as the “overall worst week of my life."" ""I felt indescribably bad about all the ... people that lost their jobs ... and the people that trusted us that we had betrayed,"" Ellison told the packed courtroom as she reached for a tissue.  Membrane Labs, a cryptocurrency-focused trading and lending platform, raised $20 million in a Series A funding round, with participation from big names like Brevan Howard Digital and Point72 Ventures. The capital will be used to help build the type of grown-up trading infrastructure the crypto space needs in order to avoid further disasters. Other notable names included in the round were Jane Street, Flow Traders, QCP Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, Electric Capital, Jump Crypto, QCP Capital, GSR Markets, Belvedere Trading and Framework Ventures.

42392325,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg58ZL,1697112722,"USDR Issuer to Salvage Failed Property-Backed Stablecoin’s Assets, ‘Make Users Whole’","Crypto’s latest depegging disaster may take a turn for the better for affected investors. The issuer of failed real estate-backed stablecoin USDR plans to liquidate the token’s assets and hold a redemption.  “Our focus now is to make users whole,” Michael Slatkin, who leads marketing for USDR issuer Tangible, said in the group’s Discord server late Wednesday.  Holders of USDR will be able to redeem their severely devalued stablecoins for a mix of cryptocurrency assets, some of which represent real estate in the U.K., according to an announcement on the server. It's unclear how much value the redemption process – which could take months – will ultimately return for investors.  USDR fell from its $1 peg to nearly 50 cents this week after much of the asset’s DAI reserves got drained by investors fleeing the token, which is backed primarily by real estate holdings.  It’s among the first high-profile failures in a niche sector of the crypto markets called real-world assets (RWA) whose proponents find various ways to tokenize more traditional investments like real estate and treasuries. The $45.5 million USDR in circulation was trading at a 44% discount at press time.  The real estate investments that represented 78% of USDR’s backing also generated yields as high as 16% for its investors, according to the project. This supposedly made the stablecoin more appealing than more common dollar-pegged assets, like Circle’s USDC.  But it also made it riskier. Circle keeps much of its stablecoin’s reserves in highly liquid (and incredibly safe) short-term Treasury bonds. In contrast, USDR’s more speculative, illiquid real estate assets can’t be sold quickly to meet the bank run-like conditions that played out this week, one investor said.  Tangible, which specializes in creating such RWAs, will abandon USDR once the redemption is complete according to Slatkin’s statement.  “We tried something new, we learned from the experience, and we’ll keep building,” Slatkin said in the announcement. “New products, both announced and unannounced, will improve on what was developed for Real USD and Tangible will continue to be a leader in the category.”",NEUTRAL,DAI,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | DAI,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/12/usdr-issuer-to-salvage-failed-property-backed-stablecoins-assets-make-users-whole,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/372ddccfc0bd155890bde7d80dac7ddbc13d3bde-1475x695.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Is it Unlucky for Crypto Traders?,"Friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest of days due to various superstitions and indeed that date has historically been bearish for the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index.  Bitcoin [BTC], however, has historically performed positively on this dreaded date.  Data tracked by crypto services provider Matrixport show since 2010, bitcoin has risen 1% on average on Friday the 13ths, with prices then surging an average of 14% and 66% in one and three months, respectively, following these peculiar Fridays.  ""While these [Friday the 13th] stats might superficially imply that Bitcoin experiences significant gains on Friday the 13th, a more nuanced evaluation hints at the potential for a corrective phase within the crypto market,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a note to clients Thursday.  ""Specifically, Ethereum's ability to generate revenue faces challenges due to limited activity in DeFi applications and a notable decline in NFT minting. Concurrently, crypto markets are exhibiting signs of weakness, suggesting the possibility of lower cryptocurrency prices in the near future,"" Thielen added.  Ether's price is trading near September lows of $1,550 at press time. The key support, if breached, could trigger substantial liquidation of leveraged positions. That would open doors for a deeper slide toward $1,430 and eventually $1,300 and have market-wide ramifications, per Thielen.  ""Chart-technical levels for Ether (ETH) are breaking, which could set off cascading liquidations, with the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin, susceptible to negative sentiment shifts,"" Thielen noted.

The funds, mostly in ether (ETH), lay dormant for five days before a tranche of 65,000 ETH ($100 million) was transferred to the Bitcoin blockchain using the RenBridge service. The attackers then used a mixer, a blockchain-based tool that masks addresses.  “Of the 4,536 Bitcoins converted from ether at RenBridge, 2,849 BTC was sent through mixers, predominantly a service called ChipMixer,” Ellipic said. “Tracing these assets becomes more challenging, however at least $4 million was transferred to exchanges, where it may have been cashed out.”  ChipMixer was subsequently shut down and seized in an international law-enforcement operation, after which the attackers switched to Sinbad for the mixing service.  The identity of the attackers remains unknown, but wallet data and analysis of fund movements may help shed light on who could have been behind the attack.  Who hacked FTX?  Elliptic said suspects range from rogue employees at FTX to North Korean hacker group Lazarus, which is alleged to have exploited several crypto protocols. On-chain signs, however, point to Russian groups, it said.  “A Russia-linked actor seems a stronger possibility,” according to the firm. “Of the stolen assets that can be traced through ChipMixer, significant amounts are combined with funds from Russia-linked criminal groups, including ransomware gangs and darknet markets, before being sent to exchanges.”  “This points to the involvement of a broker or other intermediary with a nexus in Russia,” it said.  Accounts tied to FTX and FTX US were drained on Nov. 11, 2022, mere hours after the company filed for bankruptcy and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned from the crypto empire he ran.  Bankman-Fried was later charged with two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy to commit various forms of fraud by federal prosecutors last year, weeks after stepping down from his role at FTX.  John J. Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of the FTX Debtors, which handles the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, later said that $323 million in various tokens were hacked from its international exchange and $90 million from its U.S. platform.  Stolen assets that were previously untouched started moving a few days before the start of Bankman-Fried's trial, and have since been on the move. Earlier this month, over 15,000 ether, worth nearly $25 million, was swapped for other tokens using the privacy wallet Railgun and THORChain exchange.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/12/russian-attackers-may-have-been-behind-hack-of-sam-bankman-frieds-ftx-elliptic-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8520007ceb641d159110a66cea5291da021a4b2-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18702701,http://blokt.com/?p=1418,1697108457,UK Residents – How to Buy Bitcoin in the UK,"As Bitcoins popularity continues to increase so does the number of people asking – ‘ How do I buy Bitcoin? ’ As it stands the process of purchasing Bitcoin can alter slightly depending on which country you live in. In this article, we will cover specifically how to buy Bitcoin as a UK resident. Bitcoin offers its users some real benefits over fiat currencies such as global payments with minimal fees and peer-to-peer transactions with no 3 rd party interference. It has also enjoyed massive growth in its value over the last decade and as this digital currency continues to go mainstream so increases the potential uses and convenience of it. In the UK it’s even possible now to purchase an 18 million pound London mansion using Bitcoin. While there are many advantages to Bitcoin it must also be noted that its price can be very volatile. This means that its value can drop or increase significantly in short periods of time. You should consider this when buying Bitcoin and be aware of your risk tolerance. What’s different for UK citizens? This all comes down to being able to pay for your Bitcoin. The most common method of paying for Bitcoin is by using a credit/debit cards or by bank transfer. There will be specific exchanges or marketplaces that allow purchases using UK credit/debit cards but also many that will not accept UK cards or bank transfers at all. Speed can also be a factor, and if you are looking for instant purchases again, there will be specific marketplaces that cater to UK residents. SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) seems to be a commonly excepted payment method. If your bank account allows this, then you will have a few more options from where you can purchase Bitcoin. It may be necessary to open multiple accounts to get the best deal and use Bitcoin the way you require. For example, let’s say you wanted to get into Bitcoin trading and there’s a specific exchange that has the best tools and charts for this. However, this exchange does not allow you to purchase Bitcoin using a UK bank account, you would, therefore, need to buy them elsewhere and transfer them over to this exchange. This will likely become less of an issue with time, as cooperation increases and British banks becoming more willing to service the Bitcoin marketplace. Cryptocurrency Exchanges Cryptocurrency exchanges allow their customers to buy, sell and trade digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin. The number of digital currencies available will depend on the exchange. When you open an account and buy from a cryptocurrency exchange, there will be an initial verification process. This will involve sending in scanned images of your passport or other forms of ID as well as personal documents like recent bank statements. This process can take just a few minutes or multiple days depending on the cryptocurrency exchange. This is because you will have to wait while they confirm that all of your documents meet their requirements. Fees will vary between different exchanges, so it’s worth looking around. Here are some cryptocurrency exchanges that do serve UK customers: Coinbase – A highly popular exchange. Deposits possible via SEPA payments or instant purchases using any Visa/Mastercard credit/debit card. Kraken – Another popular exchange. Deposits possible via SEPA payments or by credit/debit card purchases. Bitstamp – Deposits possible via SEPA payments or purchases using a credit/debit card. Coinfloor – UK based Bitcoin exchange. Deposits in GBP possible via SWIFT or SEPA payments. CEX.IO – Deposits possible via SEPA payments or using a Visa/Mastercard credit/debit card. Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces These online marketplaces match those who are looking to buy Bitcoin with those who are looking to sell. For those looking to make their first Bitcoin purchases, these online markets can be quite competitive on price and have lower initial fees. You will need to have a Bitcoin wallet ready beforehand when purchasing from a P2P marketplace which we will cover in the next section. Here are some peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces that support purchases for UK residents: Bittylicious – Reliable service and an easy way to buy Bitcoins via UK bank transfer. LocalBitcoins – Buy Bitcoins directly from people in exchange for your local currency. Quick note – An excellent site for comparing the costs of buying Bitcoin in the UK to help you get the best deal is BittyBot . Bitcoin Wallets Whenever you purchase Bitcoin, you will need to have a wallet to store them in. The most common and easiest method of storage is via an online Bitcoin wallet; however, other forms include desktop, hardware and paper Bitcoin wallets, and these options are usually much more secure . Bitcoin ATMs There are more than 90 Bitcoin ATMs that currently exist in the UK with the vast majority being in London. These machines allow you to insert cash in exchange for Bitcoins (although, their rates are little poor). You will need to have a Bitcoin wallet already when purchasing through a Bitcoin ATM. Final thoughts on buying Bitcoin in the UK It’s worth looking around when purchasing Bitcoin to make sure you are getting the best deal. The marketplace is developing quickly with new players set to enter the scene. This should lead to lower and more competitive fees for UK citizens. Where is your favourite place to buy Bitcoin?

18702631,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555089,1697108442,Buy LINK Now? Chainlink Touted As ‘Safest Bet’ For This Mega Trend,"Real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as one of the next mega trends in the crypto space, and according to a recent study by K33 Research, Chainlink could profit in a big way from this trend. In a recent study, the research firm projected that LINK would be the “safest bet” to capitalize on this impending boom. This sentiment reflects the broader industry outlook, especially given BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s earlier comments in May where he noted the potential of tokenization in securities. “The next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities,” remarked Larry Fink during a New York Times DealBook event. He further elucidated that tokenization, which is the creation of a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain, would facilitate “instantaneous settlement” and notably reduce transactional fees. What Makes Chainlink The Go-To Choice? The growing interest in the tokenization of RWAs, which includes traditional financial instruments like private equity, credit, and bonds, has paved the way for the increasing valuation of LINK. Tokenization is no longer a buzzword but a mechanism to optimize financial transactions by reducing costs, streamlining operations, and enhancing transparency and accessibility. Related Reading: Chainlink To Go “Parabolic” After Breaking 28-Month Downtrend? David Zimmerman, an analyst at K33 Research, mentioned, “If we wish to have exposure to the RWA narrative and avoid being sidelined when it takes off, LINK is the safest bet.” Global financial institutions and emerging cryptocurrency platforms are gearing up to leverage this trend. A testament to this is JPMorgan’s recent announcement about its first live blockchain-based collateral settlement transaction, which involved industry giants BlackRock and Barclays. Chainlink, as a project, has strategically positioned itself in this domain, acting as a bridge between blockchains and the external world. The project’s unique system of oracles and an expansive list of partnerships emphasize its pivotal role. “Chainlink, with its system of oracles and wide partnerships, is well-positioned to connect blockchains with real-world data, making it a strong player in the RWA narrative,” stated renowned crypto analyst Scott Melker, echoing Zimmerman’s insights. Zimmerman further opined that while Chainlink might not record the highest gains in this RWA movement, its robust infrastructure and pivotal role in the ecosystem make it one of the most well-placed projects to harness the potential benefits. Related Reading: Chainlink Creator Expects Mass Crypto Adoption To Send Market Cap To $10 Trillion Despite the undeniable potential and traction that RWAs have gained, Zimmerman highlighted potential challenges in realizing their full potential. Yet, the prevailing narrative’s allure is so compelling that we might witness “an isolated RWA crypto bubble” even before its tangible real-world impacts become ubiquitous. Zimmerman’s advice to potential investors is to be patient. The recommendation is to wait for the token to hit the long-term support level of around $5.70 before diving into long positions. LINK Price Remains Trapped In Trend Channel The Chainlink price has been trading within a descending trend channel since June last year. Even the recent hype around the partnership with Swift and the SmartCon was not enough to push LINK out of the trend channel. In total, LINK has been rejected at the upper trendline six times, last on October 1. A bullish sign at the moment is that Chainlink is holding above the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $7.19 despite the sharp correction in the broader crypto market. If this holds over the next few days, LINK could attempt a retest towards the upper resistance line.

The ruling could lead to a flurry of ETF approvals and potentially a de-approval of futures ETFs. GBTC currently trades at a 16% discount, but the discount is expected to narrow to around 5-10% as the conversion to an ETF becomes more certain. Grayscale Investments won a court ruling ( see here ) saying the SEC must vacate its rejection of Grayscale's attempt to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF or exchange-traded fund. I've been anticipating this would ultimately happen since the end of 22'. I've written a short commentary for subscribers when the suit was just won: This doesn't leave the SEC any basis to continue to reject spot Bitcoin ETF's. Because many have been filed in the past few years, the most likely path forward will be a flurry of approvals. There is also a possibility (although I'm not sure how likely) that the SEC will attempt to de-approve the futures ETF's. This seems a risky path (it could easily spark more litigation) and it makes the agency look awful, and it will make very few people happy. I'm guessing there is a 90%+ probability we'll see spot Bitcoin ETF's within one year and possibly quite soon. As I finish this article up GBTC trades at $20.37. My rough estimate is the fund owns $24.6 in Bitcoin per unit. That's a discount of around 16%. Not as much as when I first started writing about this event, but with this court ruling out, it is much derisked. Grayscale wants to convert this fund into an ETF ASAP (see its letter to the SEC dated September 5). When it does convert, the discount should disappear. resulting in roughly ~19% upside. This assumes Bitcoin doesn't move. However, Bitcoin did move when the lawsuit result was announced (around 5%). It could be considered a strong positive for the broader crypto market to see a spot ETF being introduced. The 16% discount is not terribly attractive for a closed-end fund with a volatile asset like Bitcoin subject to steep fees. It is not uncommon for closed-end funds to trade at a 16% discount. Outside the U.S., it is even more common. However, Grayscale intends to convert the fund to an ETF, which changes things. In addition, the assets within the fund can easily be hedged. Data by YCharts Given 1) the assets in the fund can be hedged and 2) the upcoming catalyst, a 17% discount is still a steal. A position like this doesn't have the volatility associated with Bitcoin, but it has 19% upside. Upside, I expect to arrive within a year and possibly even before the end of the year. I believe the discount should have narrowed to 5-10% already. As the timeline to conversion becomes less uncertain, the discount could quickly narrow to 5% and less. I've not hedged out the underlying Bitcoin risk because I think this is a favorable position. The next Bitcoin halving will likely take place within the next six months. The Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event that reduces the amount of Bitcoin rewarded to miners for validating transactions. Approximately every four years, the rewards that miners receive are cut in half. Miners tend to sell all their rewards or at least a portion of their rewards. If these rewards are decreased, it limits supply coming into the market. Historically, this supply decrease correlated with periods of exceptional strength in the Bitcoin price. Here's a chart from an article explaining the halving in more depth that illustrates this dynamic: bitcoin halving chart (Cointelegraph.com) The halving isn't guaranteed to drive up prices. Other forces (like higher interest rates for example) could be strong enough to offset its pressure. I also think there has historically been a feedback loop going on. Prices edge up as the halving nears, and this is increasingly confidently explained (on blogs and financial media) as being caused by the halving. It's a story that makes a lot of sense and historically worked, which means people believe it and buy Bitcoin reinforcing the story further. I can't say for sure whether it will happen again, but IF it happens again, the story will only be stronger as the historical pattern proves to hold again. Data by YCharts It is worth mentioning that both GBTC and Bitcoin are trading above their 200-day moving averages which is a bit more relevant to stuff that can't be priced off a future cash flow stream. These technicals tend to influence CTA's and quant funds to buy. Conclusion To summarize my arguments, this ruling is bullish for Grayscale but the broader cryptocurrency sector as well. It should pave the way for approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs within a year but potentially before year-end. GBTC currently trades at a roughly 16% discount per unit which translates into ~19% upside on conversion to an ETF. That's if Bitcoin itself is stable. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, historically correlating with robust performance in Bitcoin price due to the decreased supply from miner rewards, is rapidly approaching. GBTC and Bitcoin are trading above 200-day moving averages which is a positive for investors driven by price history. This leads me to the conclusion GBTC is still an attractive position on timeframes from short term to long term.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4640364-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-bitcoin-16-percent-discount?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18701209.jpeg

42392319,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg584Z,1697104800,Did Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman-Fried Cook Alameda’s Books to Save the World?,"Before she worked at Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison did not think she’d break the rules of morality and also accounting. Of course, this was also before her ex-boyfriend and boss Sam Bankman-Fried convinced her that such mores were worth bending for the greater good.  The FTX chief’s creative ethics entered his criminal fraud trial during Wednesday’s plodding but emotionally charged direct questioning of Caroline. According to the government’s star witness, Sam was so engrossed in his conception of right and wrong that other people’s base principles (namely, upholding the truth and not stealing) were at best guidelines – if even that.  “The only moral rule that mattered to Sam was whatever maximized utility,” Caroline said. She testified Sam’s goal was to “create the greatest good for the most number of people.”  Therein lies the altruist. Sam styled himself a champion of the “effective altruist” movement, an offshoot of utilitarianism whose proponents seek to make as much money as possible and then give it to causes that might save the world. That was how Sam did it, at least. For a time, his crypto empire appeared to be rocketing the quirky quant toward maximum philanthropic velocity. He’d already started giving massive sums to politicians, charities and pet causes he thought could save humanity from itself.  (It came at the cost of his customers, according to prosecutors as well as “Enron John” Ray III. The crisis-era CEO of now-bankrupt FTX Group has spent the past 11 months on a highly lucrative global treasure hunt to claw back millions of donated dollars to make FTX customers whole.)  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Regardless … Sam’s maximal utility prompted Caroline to shelve whatever rulebook she’d followed before. “It made me more willing to do things like lie and steal” at Alameda, she testified. Her steady words (they later wavered) captured the jury’s unbroken attention – a rarity on a day mostly spent discussing balance sheets that almost put Judge Kaplan to sleep.  Caroline’s seven-hour long direct questioning delved into how things broke bad for the Empire of Sam. Months before Alameda collapsed, Caroline said she worried the crypto hedge fund’s borrowing of billions of dollars from FTX customers would be both companies’ undoing (she was right). That said, she said she did nothing at the time to stop the lies enabling it. Instead she perpetuated them – she bamboozled Alameda’s lenders with them.  Through a tremendous feat of Grotesquely Atrocious Accounting Principles (G.A.A.P.), Caroline said she cooked up seven flavors of balance sheet to serve lenders like Genesis (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group), who by June 2022 had grown money-hungry in the face of its own possible collapse. Sam chose the seventh. There, Caroline had hidden Alameda’s massive FTX borrows as perhaps more palatable long term loans.  “I didn’t want Genesis or others to know Alameda owed money to FTX,” she said. Throughout Wednesday, she repeated what that really meant: Alameda owed money to FTX’s customers. It had taken their money to help it make money to help make Sam the money he needed to help save the world.  Caroline Ellison pled guilty last December to seven counts stemming from her time running Alameda Research. On Wednesday, she told the jury that she was taking responsibility for her actions. She didn’t really say whether her past failure to do so was a result of her steadfast belief in Sam’s vision – or something else. No matter: She stuck by risk-taking Sam until the castle imploded. This was the man who’d flip a coin that could either destroy the world or make it twice as good, she said Tuesday.  Ultimately the truth did come out, killing FTX, Alameda, their lenders, investors and customers, and sparking criminal investigations into Caroline and the other members of Sam’s inner circle. She said her house was raided by the FBI before she began cooperating with prosecutors – a contrast to the quiet coder Gary Wang, who volunteered himself to the government barely a week after the companies’ demise. Deputy court clerk Andy Mohan slid Caroline a baby blue tissue box as she tearfully called out to “the people that trusted us,” people she said she “betrayed.”  Caroline did not betray Sam’s own state of mind during all this (she isn’t allowed to because of the bothersome rules governing witness questioning. They’re far more rigid than ethical mores). That said, she returned to a favorite topic of this newsletter: The artifice of this alleged fraud.  Remember the Toyota Corolla we were looking for in last week’s newsletter? Caroline told the jury she saw Sam driving one at their home in the Bahamas. He’d switched from an unnamed luxury car to the most normal automobile imaginable because she said he said “it would be better for his image.”  Sitting in the courtroom hearing this, Sam – who was tapping away at his computer when Caroline later broke out in tears – shook at his highest frequency yet.  — Danny Nelson  Courtroom scenes  Judge Lewis Kaplan continues to express his respect for the attorneys trying the case – but still wound up almost mocking lead defense counsel Mark Cohen on Wednesday after he objected to Ellison saying she “believes” former FTX executive Nishad Singh told her that offsetting ledger entries in FTX and Alameda’s books were meant for auditors.  “I believe this is Wednesday. I believe this is Wednesday. That’s not speculation. Overruled!” the judge said, getting the ruling in as Cohen said “withdrawn.”  He appeared to be losing his patience with the prosecution as well, chiding Department of Justice attorneys across Tuesday and Wednesday for mislabeled exhibits and seeming exasperated with their extensive focus on spreadsheets.  The overflow room, where most reporters and members of the public are stashed during trial days, burst into laughter after Ellison said “Alameda paid what I believe was a large bribe to Chinese government officials to get some of our exchange accounts unlocked,” and Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said deadpan, “Well, let’s break that down.”  During a back-and-forth after the jury left the room, Judge Kaplan again took aim at arguments advanced by the defense. Cohen and his team asked for permission to bring up artificial intelligence firm Anthropic’s recent fundraising news (a report said it’s in talks for a juicy valuation), saying it speaks to questions of portfolio investing. Prosecutors objected, saying the current value of Anthropic’s stock is immaterial to whether or not Bankman-Fried misappropriated customer funds, a view Judge Kaplan agreed with.  “This is like saying if I broke into the Federal Reserve bank, made off with a million dollars, bought Powerball tickets and won big, it’s OK,” he said.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  Caroline Ellison has one more day on the stand, facing defense attorney Mark Cohen as he continues his cross-examination.  He only had a few moments with Ellison on Wednesday, trying to ask a question about FTX’s fiat account and how it tracked its funds – however, after some initial back-and-forth, it was clear he and Ellison were on slightly different pages about how different accounts were referenced, culminating in the best objection I’ve heard so far this trial.  “Objection Your Honor, this is confusing!” Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said. Judge Lewis Kaplan seemed to agree, cutting the jury loose (it was just around 4 p.m. – 30 minutes early) but keeping attorneys in the room a bit longer to sort out certain issues (see above).  It’s unclear how long Cohen’s planned cross-examination will take. One thought that's striking: While the defense team argued for the right to question prosecution witnesses about recreational drug use, Judge Kaplan said he and the DOJ need prior notice outside the presence of the jury. I haven't seen any filings as of Wednesday early evening, and the topic did not come up at the close of Wednesday's court session.  At any rate, once Cohen is done, prosecutors will have a chance to conduct a redirect. Once that’s done, we’ll likely hear from BlockFi’s Zac Prince.  BlockFi both lent funds to Alameda and was briefly set to be acquired by FTX before it all came crashing down.  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | WALLET | RESEARCH,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/12/did-caroline-ellison-and-sbf-cook-alamedas-books-to-save-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano Founder Alleges Favoritism Toward Ethereum In an AMA session shared on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson mentioned that the Himman emails and other revelations expose the thought process of the SEC and show that there was unequal application, which he doesn’t see anything wrong with. Furthermore, he believes that none of the Commission’s actions presupposes corruption but only favoritism. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto CEO Delivers Bad News For The Altcoin It is worth mentioning that Hoskinson happens to be a co-founder of Ethereum. However, he was forced to exit the team after he suggested that Ethereum be run as a commercial entity rather than a nonprofit, but this idea didn’t seem to resonate with others on the team. As such, one can easily assume that there could be some form of bias in his statement, as he could feel endeared to Ethereum despite the circumstances surrounding his exit. Reacting to the clip, One X user stated that Hoskinson’s “old ETHGATE buddies” may have convinced him to make such statements. Meanwhile, others in the crypto community criticized his statement, emphasizing that there was really no difference between favoritism and corruption, especially when a government agency is involved. Some went as far as alleging that Hoskinson could well have been involved in the scandal and that he was talking “like a defendant.” ETH price continues to struggle | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Himman Emails And Other Revelations A Big Deal While Hoskinson may have tried to downplay the Himman emails and other revelations, they undoubtedly lay a foundation as to possible wrongdoings of the Commission. For one, the email showed that Bill Hinman had interacted with Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin before he gave his speech, where he mentioned that ETH wasn’t a security. With this in mind, Buterin could have possibly influenced Hinman’s speech. There have also been revelations of how the SEC had close ties with Ethereum, which instantly presupposes a conflict of interest as it becomes harder to regulate or deal fairly with such a body without being influenced by external factors. Related Reading: No Love For FTX: Ex-Girlfriend Delivers Scathing Testimony Against Sam Bankman-Fried Meanwhile, Steven Nerayoff, who was an active participant during Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO), continues to allege that the SEC was corrupt in its dealings with Ethereum and that he has evidence to back up his claims.

42392332,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg59EN,1697098082,Bitcoin’s 300% Surge From Early 2019 in Focus as Fed Officials Favor Rate Pause,"The Fed officials lean in favor of a pause in the rate hike cycle, strengthening hopes that the tightening cycle has ended.  A similar Fed backdrop in early 2019 saw bitcoin quadruple to $13,880.  They say history doesn't always repeat itself, but in financial markets it often rhymes.  The recent dovish rumblings by U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) officials have revived memories from early 2019 when bitcoin (BTC) surged over 300% against a similar Fed backdrop.  Since early 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points to tame inflation. The so-called liquidity tightening cycle has been one of the major sources of pain for risk assets, including bitcoin.  This week, the Fed policymakers have offered a dovish respite. On Tuesday, Atlanta Fed Bank President Raphael Bostic and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the central bank may not need to raise rates further. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Fed Governor Christopher Waller argued that rising Treasury yields have done the Fed's job, preventing any urgent need for another rate hike, according to Reuters.  These comments have strengthened the belief in the market that the central bank's dreaded tightening cycle ended with July's 25 basis point rate and that the bank will now wait to see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds in the coming months.  The Fed's previous rate cycle, which ran for three years, saw rates peak at 2.5% in December 2018, following which the central bank adopted a wait-and-watch mode for seven months. Bitcoin bottomed out in December 2018 and rose to $13,880 by the end of June 2019.  Another interesting parallel is that the latest pause in the Fed tightening cycle comes several months ahead of the supposedly-bullish Bitcoin blockchain's mining reward halving, just as it did four years ago.  ""Reflecting back on 2019, the Fed concluded its rate-hiking cycle and entered a seven-month pause. During this period, Bitcoin experienced a dramatic price rally, surging by an impressive 325%,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy, said in a note to clients last week. ""In line with our outlook, it’s highly likely that the Fed concluded its rate-hiking cycle in July 2023.""  ""At present, the most critical macroeconomic factor appears to be a reflection of the situation in 2019 when the Fed paused its rake hikes, leading to a significant surge in bitcoin prices,"" Thielen added.  In other words, assuming all else is equal, past data favors an upside in bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $26,800 at press time, representing a 62% year-to-date gain, according to CoinDesk data.  While the 2019 playbook favours upside in bitcoin, an eventual Fed pivot to rate cuts might initially lead to price weakness.  Per Thielen, traders should closely follow the rationale behind potential Fed rate cuts. Rate cuts implemented to counter economic weakness and low inflation might have bearish implications, Thielen noted.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/12/bitcoins-300-surge-from-early-2019-in-focus-as-fed-officials-favor-rate-pause,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fe72f76ab7de95666e2906d69434c274415fab1-3024x4032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18695862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555067,1697097594,How Low Can XRP Price Go Before It Skyrockets To $5? Analyst Forecasts,"A meticulous analysis of the XRP/USD trading pair by renowned crypto analyst, Jaydee, has shed light on some compelling technical patterns and indicators. With the crypto community eagerly anticipating XRP’s next major move, Jaydee offers insights that hint at two critical price thresholds before a potential rally toward $5. What’s Next For The XRP Price? The analyst today shared the following 1-week chart of XRP and explained: “XRP – PATIENCE & ignoring the news is key! Let’s take a step back and look at a more macro view! Though short term may look scary (even w/all these irrelevant news), the weekly chart still creating ‘hidden bullish divergence’ on RSI/SRSI.” Central to Jaydee’s analysis of the logarithmic scale chart of XRP/USD is the identification of a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern on a chart signifies a phase of consolidation, after which the price will either break out or break down. A breach of the lower trendline signals the onset of a fresh bearish trend, whereas a surge past the upper trendline suggests the commencement of a new bullish trend. Related Reading: Bulls Vs Bears: XRP Price Gears Up For Big Squeeze, Which Side Will Prevail? Jaydee highlights the significance of the $0.4797 support level within this pattern for the XRP price. The chart suggests robust support at this price level which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The analyst also brings attention to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level which he sees as the lower end of the dip area. The chart implies that XRP could further drop significantly towards this area below $0.35. In the event of such a short-term pullback, this lower Fibonacci level could very well delineate a critical support area. As remarked by Jaydee in the tweet, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stoch RSI have both formed hidden bullish divergences. The RSI of XRP/USD in the 1-week chart currently stands around 45.53, and is in neutral territory, not signaling any immediate overbought or oversold conditions. Yet, the divergence in the RSI presents a captivating narrative. Jaydee highlights the hidden bullish divergence, where the price charts higher lows while the RSI is trending with lower lows, typically an indication of diminishing bearish momentum. This is usually seen as a bullish sign as it suggests that the downward momentum is weakening and could well be a precursor to a bullish phase. The Stochastic RSI stands at 7.66 and shows the same pattern. Overall, Jaydee’s forecast for XRP is bullish in the medium to long term. Related Reading: XRP Price Retest: A Prelude To A Stunning Surge To $2, Predicts Expert In conclusion, the convergence of these technical indicators and the unwavering support at $0.4797 shows strong bullish undercurrents for the XRP price. Still, it is conceivable that XRP might face a further short-lived drawdown before launching into a significant bullish ascent. Assuming these patterns persist, a leap to a $5 pricing (green arrow) seems plausible as per Jaydee. Feedback From The XRP Community Delving into the commentary, Jaydee added nuances, stating, “Scary on the daily chart (glad we knew that 12% correction was coming). The weekly chart is way different compared to daily.” When queried by a user named Steven about the potential implications of Bitcoin ETF approvals and increased adoption and utility, Jaydee responded, “Charts will still play out. May even have a ‘wick’ at higher levels on higher time frames. But the body candle close on the macro view is the true value, rather than any wicks. Wicks would just be “noise” caused by news. Didn’t all these bullish news REKT many already?” On the timing of the $5 forecast, Jaydee candidly remarked, “Nobody can predict timeframe or knows when we would start getting the next impulse move up. I just placed an arrow wherever. Wait a minute… You really think we are God?” Responding to a user’s inquiry about XRP potentially dipping to $0.35 creating a lower low, Jaydee clarified, “It would if a body candle closes there. But possible wicks can head down there.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.4821.

42392316,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg57uJ,1697092788,"Alameda Lost Nearly $200M to Phishing Attacks, Ex-Engineer Says","You’d expect big-name traders to ensure high levels of security and steps in place to protect against phishing attacks and hacks, both of which plague the crypto ecosystem.  But not Alameda Research. The beleaguered Sam Bankman-Fried run trading company lost at least $200 million to a variety of common attack vectors that run amok in the industry, as per new claims made by ex-employee Aditya Baradwaj.  “SBF believed that the single most important thing for a startup like Alameda or FTX was being able to move very, very fast,” Baradwaj posted on social app X earlier today. “This meant virtually no code testing and incomplete balance accounting.”  “Blockchain private keys and exchange API keys were stored in plaintext in a file that several employees could access,” Baradwaj added. CoinDesk has verified that Baradwaj was an employee of Alameda by reviewing payslips he provided.  Alameda lost $40 million by yield farming on a “new blockchain of questionable legitimacy,” wherein the network’s creator held the company’s funds hostage. Months of negotiations followed, but it is unclear if these funds were finally recovered.  Yield farming is a popular way to earn rewards by supplying tokens to a financial application on a blockchain. However, applications build by malicious actors may block withdrawals after attracting a sizable amount of capital – leading to losses.  Another security goof-up occurred when private keys, or a password to a secure crypto storage, was leaked “likely by a former employee.” The attack cost Alameda over $50 million in various tokens.  However, the biggest hit was a $100 million loss after Alameda got tricked into clicking on a fake phishing link on Google Ads. The fake link was likely mimicking a DeFi protocol and had been promoted to the top of Google searches.  Baradwaj stated that these incidents were just a few from a wide range of security lapses at Alameda.  In Michaels Lewis’s recently released biography of Bankman-Fried, it is claimed the founder lost at least $500,000 everyday during Alameda’s early days and once misplaced over $4 million worth of XRP tokens.  Together, these losses showcase the lax security practices at Alameda and the apparent carelessness of employees. Each of these attacks could have been avoided had private keys been stored more securely and if DeFi transactions were carefully vetted before moving millions of dollars in capital.  Such losses were not limited to Alameda. Bankman-Fried’s other company, crypto exchange FTX, lost over $400 million shortly after declaring bankruptcy in November 2022. The cause of the attack has been revealed to be poor private key management – which could have even cost the firm upward of $1 billion.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | XRP | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/12/alameda-lost-nearly-200m-to-phishing-attacks-ex-engineer-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6a2741138911a274c69886a74773c7caed9df5b-874x492.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a TechCrunch report, Ellison testified that the crypto trading firm paid Chinese officials to unlock their Alameda trading accounts on OKX and Huobi in China. Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that Bankman-Fried was not charged with bribery in this case. Still, the evidence was presented to demonstrate trust, confidence, and motive between Bankman-Fried and Ellison. Alameda Research Former CEO Exposes Hidden Payments To Chinese Officials According to Ellison’s testimony, while Bankman-Fried was CEO in 2020, the accounts valued at approximately $1 billion were frozen. Related Reading: Bulls Vs Bears: XRP Price Gears Up For Big Squeeze, Which Side Will Prevail? In November 2021, Bankman-Fried claimed that a colleague, David Ma, who had connections in China, found a way to unfreeze the accounts. Ellison, who had become co-CEO of Alameda by then, made crypto transfers totaling around $100 million to $150 million to reopen the accounts, unaware that the payments were made to Chinese officials. Ellison stated that Bankman-Fried and Sam Trabucco instructed her through a Signal chat to make the payments. Before the accounts were reopened, Ellison revealed that Alameda employees explored various strategies to unlock the accounts, including involving lawyers and government officials. Ellison testified that they even considered using Thai prostitutes to open accounts on the exchanges to facilitate fund transfers, but these efforts were unsuccessful. One Alameda trader, “Handi,” resigned in early January 2022 due to her objection to paying bribes to Chinese officials, as her father held a government position. Courtroom Clash Ellison testified that Handi had a heated argument with Bankman-Fried about the matter, during which he allegedly told her to “shut the fuck up.” A month after Handi’s resignation, Trabucco asked in a Signal chat if Handi’s father had immediately reported them, to which Bankman-Fried responded with “lol.” Ellison shared a list with prosecutors containing notes, one of which referred to a payment of “150m from the thing?” about the money transferred to regain the accounts. Per the report, Ellison explained that she did not want to explicitly state in writing that the payment was made to China to unlock the accounts, fearing that it could be leaked and used against Alameda Research in court. Bankman-Fried’s defense lawyer, Mark Cohen, attempted to strike Ellison’s statement about avoiding written evidence of the payments, but Judge Kaplan overruled the request.

At this pace, SSV is moving closer to its all-time low of around $13.40, registered in September 2023. SSV Founder Getting Drafted In response to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, Muroch stated that the situation on the ground is “much worse than described.” The founder said that being drafted into the army might help “tip the scale” and improve the situation on the ground.

As of writing on October 11, it is unclear whether Muroch has been mobilized and actively serving in the military. Although this news didn’t immediately impact sentiment, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain picked out two notable transfers. Two addresses, “ikuvc.eth” and “0xF447,” deposited 18,055 SSV worth over $250,000 to Binance, a leading exchange. Transfers to centralized exchanges usually indicate a potential intention to sell. Even so, it still needs to be determined whether these addresses have liquidated their tokens for other currencies, usually USDT or more liquid and stable tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). SSV remains under pressure at spot rates. The token is down 5% on the last trading day, extending losses, collapsing from its all-time highs of nearly $100 when it first listed on Binance. Currently, SSV is down by over 95% from its peak, highlighting the dicey state of the token and how unfavorable the markets have been in the past eight months. SSV Network Still Under Development The SSV Network aims to strengthen Ethereum by allowing anyone to become a validator without necessarily operating a node. Ethereum is a proof-of-stake network reliant on a web of validators for security.

This system distributes the validator key among a network of non-trusting nodes. The platform allows anyone to stake ETH without running a full validator node, earning rewards. In doing so, SSV Network aims to make staking more decentralized and accessible while enhancing security and reliability. Currently, SSV Network is still in development and permissioned. However, they plan to update via a Permissionless Launch, broadening their base of operators and validators.
