42388269,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVAF,1672098756,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Ho Ho Holds Near $16.9K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin held steady throughout the Christmas holiday weekend at about $16,900, while most other major cryptos were flat, although tinted more green than red.  Insights: In this last week of 2022, First Mover Asia is revisiting a few of CoinDesk's best and most impactful stories from the past year. In a column last week, columnist David Z. Morris considered one of the upsides to the series of debacles that have deeply wounded the industry. Morris argues that investors' growing uncertainties about crypto's future will root out careless speculation and refocus attention on ""good deals and ideas.""

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  A Quiet Holiday Weekend for Bitcoin, Other Cryptos  By James Rubin  Bitcoin held steady over the long Christmas weekend as investors largely ignored crypto and the macroeconomic uncertainties that have plagued the world in 2022.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,900, just about where it stood 24 hours earlier and where it finished Friday as markets wound down for the holiday. BTC is likely to continue in the same vein during the year's final days given business' historical, end-of-year slowdown.  ""Bitcoin looks like it might be finding a home between the $16,000 and $17,000 zone,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Ether was recently changing hands at slightly over $1,200, mirroring bitcoin's flat trading of the past three days. The second-largest crypto by market cap was up 0.5% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies were recently flat, although tinted more green than red. XRP, the token of open-source, public blockchain Ledger XRP, was among the biggest gainers, rising 5.4% to over 36 cents. ADA, the token of decentralized blockchain platform Cardano, and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, were both recently up more than 2%.  U.S. equity markets were closed Monday in observance of the holiday weekend. They rose gently on Friday after the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment survey showed an uptick in optimism about the economy. Still, the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, has dropped for three consecutive weeks.  In crypto news, U.S. miners powered down over the weekend as a powerful winter storm swept across much of North America, sending temperatures to historic lows. The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.  Oanda's Moya was encouraged last week by the court approval of a $37.5 million bankruptcy loan for bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ). In the agreement, Core Scientific, one of the world's largest miners by computing power, reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday.  ""The crypto miner shares are poised to rally which shows you that investors believe in the restructuring support agreement and are still willing to invest in some of the distressed parts of the crypto-verse,"" Moya wrote.

Morris  If there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:  The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.  Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.  As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.  The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.  See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | Opinion  But 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly toward clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.  This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.  Betting on the future (but not building it)  This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.  Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st-century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.  This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath special-purpose acquisition company on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).  The task now is finding out how to sell [crypto] as a tool, rather than a speculative investment.  The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.

Macro and microeconomics have taken a hit on the industry, leading venture capitalists and investors to take a more cautious path when investing.

6465119,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513734,1672095639,Bearish Indicator: Bitcoin Volatility Hits All-Time Low,"Bitcoin volatility has been on a decline since the start of December. This has been a culmination of both low interest from investors, as well as the declining prices of digital assets in the market. It has not led bitcoin to record its lowest volatility level on record yet. Bitcoin At All-Time Low Volatility Will Clemente shared a chart on Sunday that showed that bitcoin volatility had fallen to an all-time low. The chart itself is interesting in the fact that it shows just how the bitcoin volatility had been moving over the last few months. Related Reading: FTX Token Jumps 65% As SBF Returns Home, Can FTT Hold The Gains? There were multiple spikes in volatility from the start to the middle of the year 2022. However, toward the end, volatility dives off a cliff and continues this downtrend at this time. Keep in mind that the volatility of an asset is basically how much the price in dollars moved up and down in a given period. The larger the movement in price, the higher the volatility of a coin. Given that the price of bitcoin has been more or less steady over the last few months, it tracks that the volatility would be lower. Then in December, the price of bitcoin had mainly revolved around the $16,000 level, causing volatility to decline. Bitcoin has barely moved price-wise in the last 7 days, up only 0.56% in this one-week period. It is the lowest that volatility has ever been, and while it would normally paint a bullish picture for the digital asset, it has invigorated the bears. BTC stalls at $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Not A Good Time For BTC Now, more often than not, when volatility falls to such low levels, it has been right before a bull market where prices had recovered sharply. However, the timing of these have also mattered greatly because it is what determines whether low volatility is bearish or bullish. One of the times when low volatility had been very bearish was back in 2018. Like now, the market had just come out of an explosive bull rally that saw bitcoin hit new all-time highs. But with such low momentum, it had caused the price to crash a further 50%. Related Reading: Ethereum Stalls At $1,200, Why Bears Still Have The Upper Hand Given the similarities of both situations, it is likely that this will go as it did in 2018 compared to when volatility hit a low in 2020. The bitcoin bottom is likely not in too, which lends credence to this bearish case, although the decline may not be as high as 50%. This chart posted by Twitter user @DrahoslavP puts in perspective just how volatility has affected the price of the digital asset. Every time volatility fell below value ""1"" it was followed by bullish rally with one exception – october 2018. pic.twitter.com/pzW1GCAr40 — Data Patron (@DrahoslavP) December 25, 2022 Nevertheless, it is not all bad news for bitcoin. In fact, looking over the long term, it is important for this to happen. Right after the low volatility and eventual decline in 2018, bitcoin marked the bottom of the bear market. This had given way to the recovery that would set the pace for the next bull market. In other words, if a decline follows the current volatility trend, then it may present the best opportunity for investors to get into the digital asset. For BTC bottom chasers, this could be the holy grail of bottom indicators.

DeGods will be moving to the Ethereum blockchain, and Y00ts will be moving to Polygon early next year, the team said.  “There’s an argument to be made that [DeGods] has capped out on Solana,” the project’s leader, Rohun Vora, known as Frank, said in a Monday Twitter Spaces. “It’s hard to accept, but it’s been tough to grow at the rate we want to grow. If Ethereum is where we have to go to keep growing, it’s what we have to do.”  The collections are two of the buzziest in the Solana NFT market, with DeGods commanding a 515 SOL (around $5,750) floor price at the time of writing, the largest in the ecosystem. Y00ts, DeGod’s sister PFP collection that was released this fall, has a 148 SOL (around $1,660) floor price.  Sales of DeGods rose following the news, with the collection’s floor price increasing 12% as of Monday. Sales for Y00ts have stayed relatively calm, with the floor price increasing just 5 SOL (around $55). In the week leading up to the announcement, sales of DeGods and Y00ts accounted for nearly 70% of all Solana NFT sale volume, according to data from Magic Eden.  The move was preceded by months of tension on NFT Twitter, with some builders in the Solana NFT sector condemning the exit while the collection’s holders largely cheered on the move.  In early December at the Art Basel festival in Miami, rumors circulated that the DeGods team asked the Solana Foundation for $5 million to stay on the Solana platform. The DeGods team denies the claim.  Another win for Polygon  Y00ts’ move to Polygon came at a price. A DeGods representative told CoinDesk that Polygon paid for the move with a grant from its partnership fund, saying the details of the deal will be made public eventually.  Vora said the grant will last “one year, maybe two,” and wasn't paid upfront. It’s unclear what will happen once the grant runs out.  “There are a lot of milestones we have to hit,” Vora said. “And the grant isn’t as much as people think.”  The migration is the latest in Polygon’s partnership winning streak – the layer 2 blockchain has attracted partners as large as Starbucks (SBUX), Nike (NKE), Reddit, Instagram and DraftKings in the past year.  On the back end, DeGod’s move to Ethereum and Polygon could get complicated. It’s rare to see high-profile NFT ""bridges"" at this scale – when projects go multi-chain, it’s typically instead in the style of Doodles, which is considering launching Doodles 2 on a layer 2 blockchain while keeping its original collection on Ethereum.  The details of the migration’s technical elements haven't been announced yet, but the team has said that Y00tpoints, a token given to Y00ts holders who stake their NFTs, will transfer chains as well.  “What is the worst-case scenario here? An exploit on the bridge contract,” Vora said of the move's technical challenges. “We want to do [the migration] as soon as possible, shooting for Q1, but we have to make sure it’s airtight. Bridges are notorious for issues around stuff like this.”  CORRECTION (Dec. 27, 16:30 UTC): An earlier version of this article said the Solana Foundation confirmed the DeGods team asked for $5 million to stay on the chain, which was incorrect.

Binance sees their largest ever Bitcoin outflows in a 24-hour period with nearly 30,000 bitcoin leaving the exchange. Across ETH and ERC20 tokens, Binance saw $3 billion leaving the exchange in its largest single-day outflow since June. The legitimacy of the price for Binance's BNB exchange token is called into question. Binance: Fear, Uncertainty And Doubt Or Legitimate Questions? By far, one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse has seemed — on the surface — to be Binance ( BNB-USD ). After only having 7.82% market share of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) supply on exchanges in 2018, their share is now 27.50% despite a much broader trend of Bitcoin supply leaving exchanges. The Bitcoin balance on Binance now totals 595,864 BTC, which is 3.1% of outstanding supply, worth $10.58 billion. This Bitcoin belongs to their customers and reflects a growing trend in market share over the last few years that has made Binance the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance now controls approximately 60% of the spot and derivatives volume in the entire market as well. It’s hard to see how any exchange in the space can be a “winner” in the current market conditions, but one could make the case for Binance, with the exchange’s growing strength in a decimated industry. On top of that, Binance’s BNB token, the native currency of Binance’s own Ethereum-competing Layer 1 blockchain, is still one of the better performing tokens when valued in Bitcoin terms this year. Yet, is this recent “strength” everything that it seems or is it a facade? We’ve learned over the last month that no company is safe in this industry right now (especially exchanges) and questions are growing around Binance’s practices, solvency, BNB token value and the overall state of their business over the last few weeks. Is it FUD or legit? Let’s try to break some of it down, addressing the concerns through an objective and skeptical lens. Binance Flows We’ve seen significant outflows from Binance across different various tokens and Bitcoin when looking at both Nansen and Glassnode tracking. Across ETH and ERC20 tokens, Binance saw $3 billion leaving the exchange in its largest single-day outflow since June. Across Nansen total wallet tracking, all Binance balances are estimated at $62.5 billion with around 50% of those balances in stablecoins across Binance USD (BUSD-USD) and Tether (USDT-USD). Nansen Source: Nansen Nansen Source: Nansen According to Glassnode, the total Bitcoin exchange balance on Binance is down around 6-7%, after reaching a peak on December 1. Although balances remain above 500,000 Bitcoin and Binance has shown a rising trend of Bitcoin balances on the platform this year, this is a significant move for outflows in just 24 hours. The largest one-day change in Bitcoin outflows was just shy of 4% back in July. As a general comparison, the trend of Bitcoin exchange balances was a much different story for FTX, whose balance had been falling heavily since June. Note that in some of the charts below, exchange balances are using daily data from Glassnode instead of 10-minute or 1-hour intervals where we can see more of the latest Bitcoin exchange outflows. The numbers above reference the latest 1-hour interval data. Exchange balance data, especially intraday, can change and data is typically more reliable on a longer time horizon, especially given that we have little insight into Glassnode’s classification and data science techniques that are used to label different wallets and addresses. Yet, however you cut the data, Binance outflows on December 13, are a bit alarming and raise questions: Is this a one-off event and just business as usual or is this the start of something more? Glassnode Bitcoin Magazine PRO Bitcoin Magazine PRO Bitcoin Magazine PRO Glassnode In absolute terms, December 13, brought about the largest ever flight away from Binance for both Bitcoin and stablecoins — an extremely notable move. Glassnode Glassnode Bitcoin Magazine PRO In particular, in the case of BUSD, Binance’s native stablecoin that has its reserves custodied by U.S. financial firm Paxos, there has been a notable amount of redemptions as of late. Large holders of BUSD have been withdrawing from Binance and sending it to Paxos, redeeming the stablecoins for dollars. This shows up as BUSD being “ burned ” at the Paxos Treasury. The main cause for concern is not whether Binance has any Bitcoin/crypto or not. We can transparently see that the firm controls tens of billions worth of crypto assets. What isn’t exactly clear, similar to FTX, is whether the firm has commingled users' funds or whether the firm has any outstanding liabilities against user assets. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao ((CZ)) has said that the firm has no liabilities with any other firms, but as recent months have shown, words don’t mean all that much. While we are not claiming that CZ is lying to the public about the state of Binance finances, we have no way to prove otherwise. When answering a tweet on whether the company was going to audit liabilities against user assets, CZ’s response was, “ Yes, but liabilities are harder. We don't owe any loans to anyone. You can ask around. ” Unfortunately, “ask around” isn’t a satisfactory enough answer for an ecosystem supposedly built around the ethos of don’t trust, verify. While there is no doubt that Binance is an industry giant in the crypto derivatives industry, some investors may wonder if the firm isn’t doing similar things as past actors in regards to trading against clients using user funds and/or proprietary data. Things like the former Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase departing Binance U.S. last summer after just three months as the CEO leaves one with many questions. To add to our skepticism, the price of the Binance exchange token BNB is near all-time highs in Bitcoin terms, appreciating an astounding 828% against Bitcoin in the last 785 calendar days. Is BNB, a more centralized cousin to Ethereum (ETH-USD), really worth approximately 14% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist? BNB is not equity in the Binance company. BNB is a crypto token spun up from nothing in 2017. btcization Btcization BNB is one of the few cryptocurrencies that is up year-to-date in Bitcoin terms, with the others being illiquid alts well below their BTC-denominated all-time highs. Bitcoin Magazine PRO The only other two cryptocurrencies that outperformed Bitcoin during 2022 have been the “meme” Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), which is 55% below its all-time high in Bitcoin terms, and quasi-security Ripple (XRP-USD), which has been delisted by major exchanges and is 87% below its all-time highs in Bitcoin terms. btcization Why is the outperformance so notable? Why are we hammering this point so hard? Because financial markets aren’t magical machines tied to a fantasy-land reality. Financial markets — while appearing to be disconnected from reality at times — always come crashing down to reality, exposing those that were possibly perceived as giants once before. For the most part, the crypto industry is an attempt at modern alchemy, and exchange tokens minted from nothing with centrally engineered “tokenomics” are no different. In fact, they are part of the problem. btcization Some investors may be considering the possibility that BNB was pushed up with the internal help of Binance or its unofficial affiliates during the bull run, although there's no evidence that this occurred. Just look at the volume profile of where coins changed hands on its native exchange. While it would be a leap of faith to say this took place directly using customer funds à la FTX, the revenue of the company has been used to buy back the token, similar to a stock buyback. btcization btcization btcization While it remains to be seen whether the firm is levered against its own token in any sort of way, it would certainly be no surprise to us if the company supported the ascent of the token/chain, similarly to many other exchanges with token that outperformed Bitcoin during the bull run. BNB is a “blockchain” that can be arbitrarily halted by the Binance team . It is not even attempting to be a decentralized application set. That’s fine, but we remain extremely skeptical that its relative valuation against Bitcoin — what we believe to be humanity’s best bet as decentralized digital cash — is tethered to reality. How does something that traded with double the realized volatility of Bitcoin during the bull market now have the same implied volatility in the bear market after it has appreciated by over an order of magnitude with a strong relative outperformance throughout 2022? The entire “industry” is cross-collateralized, and all of the altcoins are merely riding on the beta of Bitcoin with far less liquidity, thus having greater volatility and potential (fleeting) upside. We think this attempt at modern alchemy is destined to fail, at worst. At best, the asset likely drastically underperforms global neutral money through its adoption phase. Said differently, the worst-case, paranoid-style take would be that the exchange rate of BNB is tied to the solvency status of Binance the exchange. We don’t think that there is an overly strong probability of this outcome per say, but it is certainly non-zero. The coming weeks will be full of headlines around the state of global crypto regulation in a post-FTX world. In a 48-hour period, Reuters published news stating that the U.S. Justice Dept is split over charging Binance , Binance withdrawals for Bitcoin and aggregate stablecoin pairs have hit all-time highs and the BNB exchange token has fallen 10% relative to Bitcoin. Out of an abundance of caution, we will continue to urge readers operating on any centralized exchange — of which Binance is most definitely included — to look into self-custody solutions. There have been far too many instances of incompetence and/or misconduct from exchanges. It’s not that we don’t trust CZ or Binance, it's the fact that we don’t trust anyone. The whole point of Bitcoin is we now have an asset that is truly the liability of no one. Verify the ownership of an open distributed network with cryptography; don’t trust permissioned IOUs. With the mix of regulatory concerns about the global crypto derivatives industry, a questionable exchange token with unbelievable relative performance over the last two years and a shaky proof-of-reserves attestation — that was incorrectly claimed to be an audit and had industry CEOs raising eyebrows — we find the need to urge our readers to evaluate their counterparty risk.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566446-binance-black-box-assessing-reserves-and-liabilities?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6454378.jpeg

This Metric May Hint So,"The on-chain data for the stablecoin redemptions during the recent price plunge could suggest there aren’t many Bitcoin holders selling anymore. Stablecoin Redeem Count Has Remained Low Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, large stablecoin redemptions have usually accompanied major declines in the Bitcoin price during this bear market. A stablecoin is said to be “redeemed” when an investor exchanges the token for fiat through the issuer of said coin. Investors usually use stablecoins when they want to escape the volatility associated with tokens like Bitcoin. Thus, redemptions of them can be a sign that investors are exiting the market currently. The “stablecoins redeemed supply” is an indicator that measures the total amount of such redemptions happening across the market of all types of stables. Another metric that keeps track of these withdrawals is the “stablecoins redeem event count,” which, as its name already implies, measures the total number of redemptions taking place in the market rather than the total sum of their value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal? Small Investors Show Rapid Accumulation Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both these stablecoin redemptions indicators over the past year: Looks like only one of these metrics had its value elevated in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, during the large declines in the price of Bitcoin in this bear market so far, the stablecoins redeemed supply has usually registered high values. This trend makes sense as investors would be converting to stables to sell off during the crash, and then redeeming them for fiat. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptocurrencies To Keep An Eye On This Week – Post-Christmas Gainers The stablecoin redeem count also observed spikes during such dumping events, except for the most recent one. This implies that in the price plunges before the latest one, many investors always took part in stablecoin redemptions, showing that the market had a uniform and more natural selling appetite. In the most recent decline where Bitcoin went from above $18k to below $17k, however, the redeemed count has stayed low while the redeemed supply has still observed very high values. This means that only a few whales were involved in this dumping event, a possible sign that largescale selling pressure may be getting depleted in the market. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,800, up 1% in the last seven days. Over the past month, the crypto has gained 2% in value.

This put it ahead of market leaders such as bitcoin and ethereum in terms of performance, solidifying its position as the market leader through the first half of the holidays. Litecoin Tops List Of Gainers Over the last 24 hours, Litecoin has been on an upward rally that put its price firmly above $65, turning resistance into support for it. The digital asset saw upwards of a 6% increase in price over the last day. The rally stopped just below $70 before a slight downward correction took place. Related Reading: Ethereum Stalls At $1,200, Why Bears Still Have The Upper Hand Given that most of the crypto market remained muted through Christmas, this put Litecoin right at the top of the gainers’ list. It also saw a significant jump in trading volume, rising more than 180% over the 24-hour period to be sitting at $437.7 million at the time of this writing. Its market cap crossed $4.9 and this saw it surpass Shiba Inu to reclaim its spot as the 14th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Other cryptocurrencies that made the gainers list was GRT with more than a 4.20% increase in price over the one-day period. ICP was third on the list with 3.56% gains, while CSPR followed closely behind at 3.21%. Terra Classic (LUNC) featured as 5th on the list, rising about 3% on Christmas to be sitting at $0.0001486. Can LTC Reach $100? Litecoin’s recent bullish movement can be attributed to CNBC’s Jim Cramer saying during an interview that holders of the cryptocurrency are “idiots.” Following this, the digital asset had begun to trend on social media, resulting in an upward rally on Christmas Day. Bulls try to push LTC above $70 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com However, LTC hit a roadblock just before reaching $70. Even though this put it above its 50 and 100-day moving averages, there was still enough resistance from the bears to keep it from reclaiming this position in the short term. This means that successfully beating $70 will likely see a rapid rise to $80 for LTC. But $100 remains a long way off for LTC. Related Reading: FTX Token Jumps 65% As SBF Returns Home, Can FTT Hold The Gains? The recent rally does not carry enough momentum to see it through to $100. Add in the fact that the crypto winter is still in full swing and it becomes improbable that the digital asset would be able to reach this price level in the short term. If bitcoin were to fall further and hit $10,000, then LTC could reach a low of $30 before the next bull market begins. One important event to look towards that could mark a bullish trend for Litecoin, though, would be the next halving event happening in August 2023. When this happens, the block reward could drop another 50% to 6.25 LTC. This decrease in supply could end up pushing the price upwards, as long as demand remains high.

""We will soon start scanning the data on-chain to find out who owned what prior to the hack in order to return them to the rightful owners. As different users had variable proportions of assets and debt, this process might take a little [time],"" the decentralized-finance protocol said in a post linked on its website.  In a tweet thread posted on Sunday, the team said a first attack used a flash loan to drain funds out of its V2 product. A second larger attack used the owner key to exploit V1. The protocol, which offers leveraged trading on the Avalanche blockchain, didn’t say how much had been taken.  Blockchain security firm PeckShield, citing “community intel,” said at the time that the exploit may have been a rug pull that made off with $12 million. Earlier Monday Certik, also a security company, said it had been unable to contact members of the team and posted a graphic indicating it was treating Defrost as an exit scam.

Small Investors Show Rapid Accumulation,"On-chain data shows small Bitcoin holders have accumulated recently while whale holdings have decreased, a sign that may be bullish in the long term. Bitcoin Investors With 0-1,000 Coins Have Increased Their Holdings Recently As a Twitter user has pointed out using data from Santiment, holders with wallet amounts in the 0-1,000 coins range have aggressively accumulated at recent lows. The relevant indicator here is the “Bitcoin Supply Distribution,” which tells us which wallet groups are holding what percentage of the total supply right now. Wallets (or more simply, holders) are divided into wallet bands based on the number of coins they are holding at the moment. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all addresses that are currently carrying at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. The Supply Distribution metric for this group measures the collective balance of all the wallets falling inside this range. Related Reading: What Makes Big Eyes Coin, Bitcoin Cash, And Solana Better Than Most Preceding Projects? Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution data for the 0-1,000 coins and 1,000-1,000,000 coins bands: Looks like the values of the metric for the two groups have moved oppositely to each other in recent days | Source: ₿igMak on Twitter As you can see above, the Bitcoin Supply Distribution curve for the 1,000-1,000,000 coins band has observed a sharp decline recently. The holders belonging to this group are the whales, which means that the percentage of the supply held by these humongous holders has been going down, suggesting that they have been capitulating during this deep bear market. The supply share held by the 0-1,000 coins group, on the other hand, has rapidly increased recently, implying that retail investors have been accumulating large amounts during the recent lows in the price of the asset. From the chart, it’s apparent that such a pattern was also seen during the 2018/2019 bear market, albeit the scale of movement from both these groups was much smaller. Interestingly, this trend only formed in that bear after the cyclical low was already in for BTC. Related Reading: Bottom Signal: This Bitcoin Ratio Declines To Four-Year Low Thus, if history is anything to go by, this recent accumulation from the 0-1,000 coins group could help Bitcoin form the bottom for the current cycle (if it’s not already in), and therefore reverse the coin towards a bullish trend in the long term.

While many crypto companies fell victim to the resulting contagion, banks that deal with digital assets have also been impacted. According to a recent S&P Global report, such banks have seen an increase in crypto-related deposit outflows . And this trend is expected to continue, given crypto volatility after the FTX collapse. Crypto lender Silvergate Capital's ( NYSE: SI ) crypto deposits fluctuated by over $5B in a given quarter twice this year. Metropolitan Bank ( NYSE: MCB ) reported a 7.2% sequential decrease in total deposits in Q3, primarily due to a $485.9M decline in crypto-related deposits. Of this, S&P noted, 70% resulted from the bankruptcy of its customer Voyager Digital in July . Signature Bank ( NASDAQ: SBNY ), which saw a $6.1B reduction in crypto deposits, plans to limit its crypto deposit exposure to less than 20% of total deposits . Customers Bancorp ( NYSE: CUBI ) saw a 9.5% sequential decline in Q3, according to S&P. Provident Bancorp ( NASDAQ: PVBC ) estimated a Q3 loss of $27.5M related to loans to crypto miners amid bitcoin volatility and rising power costs. It warned that the actual figure may exceed this estimate. As of Sept. 30, the bank had $76.5M in loans secured by crypto mining rigs (5.2% of its loan portfolio) and $71M in lines of credit secured by bitcoin and ether. In the past six months, shares of Silvergate ( SI ), Metropolitan ( MCB ), Signature ( SBNY ), Customers Bancorp ( CUBI ), and Provident ( PVBC ) all declined in double-digit percentages compared with the S&P 500's 1.9% increase. S&P recently noted that FTX was once viewed as a ""stabilizing force"" in the crypto space as it offered to back troubled lender BlockFi in July. But the deal never went through due to FTX's own liquidity crisis and BlockFi eventually filed for bankruptcy . Once FTX declared bankruptcy , 130 affiliated entities followed suit. Companies with significant exposure to FTX include Genesis Trading , Galaxy Digital and bankrupt Voyager . FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently facing multiple federal charges . The FTX contagion also hit venture capital funding in the crypto sector. According to data firm PitchBook , the final eight months of 2022 saw a steep drop in VC investments — from ~$4B per month to under $1B, a trend that's expected to continue into 2023. But all may not be lost. ""Market fear and doubt percolated in 2022 as participants suspended operations and/or filed for bankruptcy. However, investors will likely become more comfortable investing in crypto in late 2023 as we lap 2022's failures and see more regulations, better risk management, and real-world use cases,"" said PitchBook senior analyst Robert Le.

42417084,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOqD,1672064554,From Degen to Regen: How Web3 Started Playing Positive-Sum Games,"Back during the DeFi Summer of 2020 – ages ago in Web3 time – the meme “degens” came about as a way to describe Web3 enthusiasts who were yield farming on systems with high annual percentage yield (APY) and high likelihood of failure. It’s a playful term that’s also revealing of the industry’s mercenary and self-interested side.  In the first two years of the decade, driven by headlines, rising prices and FOMO, thousands of traders entered Web3 with the intention of making a quick buck. And despite a steep sell-off this year, crypto continued to go mainstream. There were Super Bowl ads. News of banks using decentralized finance (DeFi). And, yes, negative press about all the bankruptcies.  Sadly, with the implosion of custodial systems like BlockFi and FTX a lot of people lost money. That is really bad for the people who were hurt and destructive for the space.  Kevin Owocki is the chief executive and founder of SuperModular and co-founder of Gitcoin. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  Since Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem in the Bitcoin white paper, there have been boom and bust cycles in crypto that, from an evolutionary perspective, are similar to natural systems. In times of abundance, thousands of new projects blossom. In times of scarcity, projects fail. The survivors will be the dominant species of the next boom (as visualized in this poster I made).  Survival of the fittest is a simple yet powerful mechanism observable in the Web3 ecosystem – the fit best meet the preferences of markets. It might explain why degens, seemingly interested in short-term advancements rather than long-term success, hit a dead end. It turns out purely self-interested behaviors are maladaptive in Web3 (as they are many places in nature).  Indeed, the industry that’s now known as Web3 has always had a side of it that is about more than greed and profit. Crypto is a tool for building collaborative organizations and sharing resources – the long-term trends that have always motivated participants.  Recently, there’s been increasing awareness and focus on how blockchains, distributed systems with decentralized buy in, support public goods. Public goods are the stuff we all rely on (like open-source software or privacy research) but are hard to maintain and fund.  See also: The Next Step in the Evolution of Web3: Regenerative Finance | Crypto 2023  Another term for this is “regenerative economics,” the idea that money can be used to incentivise communities to solve systemic issues. Even when open-source projects fail, the exercise can benefit the rest – if everyone is moving along the same axis towards social betterment. Innovate, iterate, evolve, repeat.  That’s why, even in the pits of crypto winter, 2023 is ripe to be the year of the regen.  Degen to regen  Degens came to Web3 seeking financial upside. Regens are those who are working or building in regenerative cryptoeconomics. They have a long-term view on how Web3 can be good for the world, but not just in the financial sense.  Regens see how financial systems could be designed to act as channels for greater human flourishing in service of all of humanity’s needs. My friend Gregory Landua, co-founder of the Regen Network, argues people have eight essential needs that could be expressed as forms of capital. Beyond financial capital, there’s our social, material, living, intellectual, experiential, spiritual and cultural needs.  See also: How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open Source Needs | Opinion  With programmable money, we can program our values into our money. Crypto has it within itself to create systems equally as extractive and fragile as the existing financial system. When a degen trades, he’s playing a zero-sum game – the tokens leave his wallet and enter the counterparty’s wallet and visa-versa. But Web3 can also build more positive sum protocols that expand resource capacity over time.  The journey to regenerative cryptoeconomics  There is a common thread linking many people in the regen ecosystem. They used to be degens! Lured by the promise of better economic circumstances for themselves and their family, they entered the ecosystem to make a profit.  Over time, however, they grew enamored by the promises of collective action – often through the direct experience of contributing to or using a project. Their attitude and incentives shifted. That’s by design, built into the structure of crypto-economic systems. For instance, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) allow people with a shared mission to come together and pool resources – everyone involved is at least partially aligned in their values and commitments.  See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum's Goals | Opinion  When you join such a community, you start learning to manage risk and ride the volatility. You think differently about capital allocation. But sometimes it takes more than that to get the bigger picture.  Many regens are former degens who took this journey during the last cycle, in 2017. And that’s partially why I’m so optimistic about the future of regenerative systems. There are thousands and thousands of people who are newer to crypto, who came into Web3 in the last year or so, and they are likely on step two of the journey (i.e., down bad) now. They’ve made mistakes and learned from them, a base of knowledge that can serve for a more pragmatic approach to the next market cycle.  The window of opportunity is here for newcomers to Web3 to move to step three – find community and discover crypto’s regenerative use cases. From there they will build the next cycle of projects, many that will be positive and impactful for the world.  The impact(s) are already here  People sometimes say to me, “Hey Kevin, this talk of regenerative crypto-economics is great, but are there any examples of theory in action?”  Regen is not just talk. It is happening! In fact, Alejandra Borda and I wrote an entire book detailing 100 different examples of projects where people are using crypto to regenerate the world.  To namedrop a few: Proof of Humanity, Celo, Kolectivo and Gitcoin (the crypto-based crowdfunding protocol I built) are all doing worthy things.  2023: The year of the regen  In this down cycle we have an opportunity to filter the noise from the signal and rediscover our purpose. Through decentralization and peer-to-peer technology we can build a more fair, just and less extractive financial system. We can bring more democratic, more organic financial tools to the masses.  As individuals, we can find community, join a DAO and BUIDL on the projects that could serve as the foundation of the next era of Web3. It’s the year to build projects that are democratic, prosocial and net-positive for the world.  To regain legitimacy, the Web3 ecosystem must find ways to rotate capital, attention and talent away from the projects that have the best Ponzi-nomics and towards the projects that are going to have the most durable positive impact. We want this not because we want crypto to look good for the world, but because we want crypto to be good for the world.  Many of today's most mainstream crypto projects have positive externalities. For example, OpenSea, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) exchange, has allowed thousands of artists to monetize their work and generate new forms of income that are less extractive than their Web2 counterparts.  Lens Protocol, a Web3 social media platform that’s generating increasing buzz in crypto amid changes at Twitter, are enabling people to own their own data and to take their social media presence from site to site. Web3 social media has the potential to disrupt tech giants. (Disclosure: I am a Lens Protocol angel investor.)  Proof Of Humanity, a registry of 18,000 Sybil attack-resistant identities, is using UBI tokens to pay people a stipend. Gitcoin is a crowdfunding platform that has delivered $72 million worth of funding to public goods and recently released a suite of protocols that allows others to crowdfund for their communities. Kolektivo is a suite of protocols that allow local communities to launch, finance and govern their own regenerative economies.  See also: Who Is Building Ethereum's Public Goods? | Opinon  Web3 carbon credit systems such as KlimaDAO and Toucan Protocol allow for better, faster and cheaper carbon credit trading. While carbon credits are not perfect, Web3-enabled systems such as Hypercerts allow users to reward projects with observable outcomes. Moreover, hypercerts can be used beyond climate concerns in impact areas such as education, health care, AI safety and open-source software.  2023 will be the year of the Regen. We will rebuild and regenerate not just the Web3 space, but our communities and ourselves.

Talks, however, are still taking place, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. For the deal to be canceled, there needs to be mutual agreement, and that's not the case now, the person said.  “We were previously exploring a potential acquisition by Nexo as part of the proposed restructuring plan,” Vauld said in a private message on Twitter. “To provide a very brief summary, our discussions with Nexo have unfortunately not come to fruition.”  Nexo, however, said it's not calling off the deal quite yet.  “Nexo has not given up on its attempt to save Vauld and help its creditors recover the maximum possible platform funds,"" Nexo co-founder and managing partner Kalin Metodiev said in an email.  Vauld suspended all withdrawals, trading and deposits on its platform as it looked at restructuring options, CoinDesk reported in July. The company filed for creditor protection in Singapore earlier the same month and has until Jan. 20 to work on a restructuring plan. In June, the firm said it would lay off 30% of its staff.  According to an affidavit on July 8, the company owed $402 million to its creditors, with 90% of that debt originating from individual retail investor deposits. A month after it filed for creditor protection, Indian authorities froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million).  In explaining the end of the transaction, Vauld said Nexo hadn't responded to due diligence requests to assess Nexo's solvency that would provide its creditors with assurance. It also pointed to Nexo's Dec. 5 announcement it was phasing out service in the U.S., possibly leaving Vauld's customers in the country without a way of having their claims handled. A third point was the proposal failed to offer Vauld creditors an early exit option, which it said was vital to a successful restructuring.

6432856,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513724,1672055129,Top 5 Cryptocurrencies To Keep An Eye On This Week – Post-Christmas Gainers,"It has been a roller coaster ride for crypto investors this 2022. This month, total crypto market capitalization fell from around $2.2 trillion at the start of the year to approximately $850 billion. Several high-profile bankruptcies this year exacerbated the precipitous decline in valuation. The market for cryptocurrencies is still consolidating, with the majority of assets unable to make large gains. Despite the current crypto winter, cryptocurrencies remain by far the most profitable asset class for investment, with the ability to recover losses and hit record highs in the long run. Currently, investors anticipate that the cryptocurrency market will strive to end the large sell-offs in 2023. A lengthy crypto winter tends to test the patience of investors, but it is one of the finest opportunities to purchase good cryptocurrencies at a discount. Meanwhile, there is continued curiosity in how particular crypto assets will end 2022, as their price movement will provide insight into what to expect in the following year. Here are five cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on for the week of December 26. Bitcoin (BTC) The year has not been kind to the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. Since the start of 2022, bitcoin has lost more than 60 percent of its value. Because of this, over 50% of BTC investors are currently losing money, causing the market to crash. Nevertheless, a number of evidence imply that bitcoin will make a strong comeback in 2023. As of this writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,864, up 0.7% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Benjamin Cowen, a well-known cryptocurrency specialist, predicted that once bitcoin bulls seize control of the market, a “long accumulation period” will commence. Related Reading: VeChain Jumps By 4% As VET Investors Look To Profit Before Christmas Image: Pixabay Ethereum (ETH) The current price of Ethereum is $1,221, an almost 3% increase over the past week. The 24-hour low is $1,203 and the 24-hour high is $1,222. The cryptocurrency is up 0.1% on the one-hour and 24-hour time frames. The Ethereum Exchange Reserve for All Exchanges measure reveals the ETH reserves on CEXs have decreased by more than a quarter, according to on-chain data. Thus, investors are acquiring Ethereum and are becoming more bullish. At the time of writing, the bulls must demonstrate a strong push and consolidation above the $1,230 zone before a countertrend strategy can be considered. The next bullish objective would be $1,300 and possibly $1,350. Cardano (ADA) Despite the turmoil of 2022, Cardano’s (ADA) onchain activity has continued to reach new benchmarks. Cardano smart contracts surpassed 4,400 this year, a 395 percent increase, and 57 million transactions were conducted, an increase of approximately 140 percent. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.26, up 0.2% in the last 24 hours, after a nearly 3% weekly chart correction. Despite its poor performance, ADA remains among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with around $9 billion valuation. Crypto total market cap at nearly $772 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Polygon (MATIC) Several major cryptocurrencies are expected to drop below their most recent lows, but MATIC has outperformed as it attempts to establish a stable foundation well above its annual bottom. In its first few months of existence, the price of MATIC was very constant, fluctuating between $0.01 and $0.03. MATIC’s price, up 0.9% in the last 24 hours and trading at $8030, reached an all-time high of approximately $1.40 in late 2020, one year after its launch, as the entire cryptocurrency market began to recover. This signified a tremendous rise of more than 4,600% in comparison to its initial price.

42413331,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8R3s,1672052095,Bitcoin Miners Powered Off as Winter Storm Battered North America,"Crypto miners across the U.S. powered down over the weekend as a powerful storm swept across North America.  The bitcoin mining hashrate, a measure of computing power on the blockchain, dropped about 100 exahash per second (EH/s), or 40%, to 156 EH/s, between Dec. 21 and Dec. 24, data from BTC.com shows. It returned to about 250 EH/s as of Sunday.  The practice, known as curtailment, is touted as a way for miners to help electricity grids. The miners' steady demand ensures power producers are bringing in revenue to offset costs, but they can power off when demand from other sources is high, such as during winter storms.  The U.S. and Canada have been hit by an Arctic storm that sent temperatures as low as -50°F (-45°C) in the western U.S. state of Montana, according to the BBC, and covered western New York state with as much as 43 inches of snow. At least 37 people died as result of the storm, CNN reported.  Foundry USA, the biggest mining pool in the U.S., lost more than half of its hashrate on Dec. 23 – the biggest loss of any major pool – according to statistics from information platform Mining Pool Stats. Foundry is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Some of the U.S.’ biggest miners also curtailed operations. These included Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last Wednesday. In Texas, 99% of industrial-scale bitcoin mining load was turned off at 6 a.m. on Saturday, Lee Bratcher, founder and president of industry group Texas Blockchain Council, said in a LinkedIn post.  Dennis Porter, who advocates for the industry through the nonprofit Satoshi Action Fund, said the miners’ curtailment is proof that they are supporting the electric grid.  Denis Rusinovich, a Europe-based miner, tweeted that the big drop in computing power is “another confirmation that bitcoin's geographical diversification is vital.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/26/bitcoin-miners-powered-off-as-winter-storm-battered-north-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92926f3c506ab4b4964df5890d2946efce016784-1920x1165.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What seems to have caught people’s attention is the fact that the Optimism chain seems to be unrivaled and unmoved by the chaos happening in the crypto space. This is now tagged as an unusual trend because it goes against the current especially with the sudden spike in USDC and USDT. Here’s a quick glance at how the crypto and network are performing: OP price down by 1.83% Metamask provides support for L2 Solutions User retention rate grew to as much as 34% weekly Source: Santiment There seems to have been a convergence given the noticeable connection between the uptick in stablecoins with that of OP’s price performance. According to CoinMarketCap, OP price is currently up by 0.4% in the last 24 hours, or trading at $0.9348 as of press time. The USDC and USDT surge is observed to be following a market trend which would ultimately revert back to normal with the price of OP diminishing and with the USDC and USDT prices settling down. Related Reading: VeChain Jumps By 4% As VET Investors Look To Profit Before Christmas Potential Factors That Cause USDT, USDC Uptick With the increased activity, people are contemplating on what could have triggered the sudden uptick. One of the possible theories would be Optimism’s impressive Total Value Locked (TVL) as it grew immensely compared to other cryptocurrencies. Another is the announcement of Metamask wallet providing support for Optimism and other Layer 2 solutions. It has definitely helped increase the awareness and adoption of Layer 2 which can attract more people to shift to the network. More so, the solution’s recent update on mobile accessibility is also one of the reasons why it has grown in popularity and also because users can easily and conveniently use Optimism via their mobile phones. Nevertheless, even before the mobile usability update, many users have already started flocking towards OP. Its user base has increased from 24,000 to 80,000 in just three months and the figures are predicted to rise especially with the recent Metamask update.

It has been observed that the network isn’t just good with the attraction game but can also keep their users loyal and satisfied. In fact, the retention rate of OP has grown to as much as 34% per week. A number of dApps are now on Optimism which also caused its TVL to increase to more than $500 million.
