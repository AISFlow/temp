42374412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRrF,1655940650,First Mover Asia: DeFi’s Resilience During the Market Slowdown; Bitcoin Slumps Near $20K,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin loses its bounce to drop below $20,000 before regaining ground; other major cryptos decline.  Insights: DeFi keeps its head up in the current crypto whirlwind.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $20,079 -2.3%  Ether (ETH): $1,057 -5.6%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC +7.8% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +1.9% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Shiba Inu SHIB −7.9% Currency Ethereum ETH −6.9% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE −6.4% Currency  Bitcoin Loses Its Bounce  So much for good things.  Bitcoin ended a three-day run of price increases on Wednesday, sinking below the $20,000 threshold it surpassed two days earlier before regaining this perch later in the afternoon.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,100, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours. The decline came just two days after bitcoin cracked $21,000 as investors swooped in following a weekend dip, and amid a brief lull in the crypto calamities that have afflicted the industry in recent weeks.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands at approximately $1,050, down over 5% in the past 24 hours. Other major cryptos were well into the red with the token of troubled crypto lending platform Celsius (CEL) off by as much as over 20% and WAVES down 13%.  Investors once again shied away from riskier assets while digesting the latest inflation remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who testified to the Senate Banking Committee that the U.S. might not avert a recession as the Fed continues its current monetary hawkishness. In separate commentaries, the CEO of Deutsche Bank and analysts from Citigroup predicted a 50% likelihood of recession. Fed critics have maintained that the bank waited too long to boost interest rates, forcing it to adopt the harsh measures that seem likely to spur economic contraction.  “It would have been better if the Fed took ‘transient’ inflation seriously earlier this year instead of downplaying it,"" Mark Lurie, CEO of crypto software provider Shipyard Software, wrote to CoinDesk in a text. ""But at this point, the Fed is doing the right thing by raising interest rates – inflation is public enemy #1.""  ""The downside is that it’s too late now to do so painlessly, and Powell is likely again downplaying the risk of a recession. It’s probably already here. This bodes poorly for crypto short term. Investors who may have bought the BTC dip earlier in the week may be realizing there will not be a quick recovery, driving today’s slow drop back to $20K.""  Crypto news was more nuanced on Wednesday than during recent months, when the daily drumbeat of industry mishaps and mini crises weighed on prices. On the upside, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) granted in-principle digital token payment licenses to crypto exchange Crypto.com and two other companies. The licenses will enable the three firms to offer services in the country, which has upped its scrutiny of crypto assets in recent months.  Later in the day, Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, struck an upbeat note in a speech at the Point Zero conference in Zurich, saying that crypto technology's ability to eliminate middlemen in financial trading shouldn't lead to the kind of risk shortfalls that caused the 2008 financial meltdown. Cunliffe expressed faith in crypto, saying the technology will outlive current volatility, just as the internet economy ultimately overcame the dot-com crash of 2001. His comments came little over a week after BOE governor Andrew Bailey reiterated his stance that cryptocurrencies have ""no intrinsic value.""  Elsewhere, Australian bitcoin miner Iris Energy (IRIS) increased its hashrate estimate to 4.3 exahash/second (EH/s) for the year.  Voyager Digital (VOYG) shares fell more than 60% after the crypto broker disclosed its exposure to beleaguered hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and said it may issue a ""notice of default"" to the crypto fund if it fails to make a loan repayment. Voyager's exposure to 3AC consists of 15,250 bitcoins ($370 million) and $350 million USDC, the company said in a statement Wednesday.  Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase, which have received a monthslong battering during the crypto crash, fell nearly 10% to close just under $52, near their all-time low.  Yet Lurie of Shipyard Software said optimistically that the recent crypto downturn was a sign of crypto's maturation.  ""The more sensitive it is to macro conditions, the more proof there is that it’s taken seriously as an asset class part of a professionally balanced portfolio,"" he said. ""That’s a positive sign long term.”  Markets  S&P 500: 3,759 -0.1%  DJIA: 30,483 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 11,053 -0.1%  Gold: $1,838 +0.3%  Insights  DeFi Keeps Its Head Up in the Current Crypto Whirlwind  The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has held up well amid troubles at centralized crypto companies this month. There were hardly any massive on-chain liquidations, surprises or smart contract failures across popular DeFi apps, including Aave, Compound, Maker and others, even as crypto markets shed value.  “Established DeFi lending protocols like Aave, Compound and Maker have not had any downtime or withdrawal limitations due to excessive risk-taking of borrowers,” Alex Svanevik, founder of crypto data firm Nansen, shared in Twitter messages with CoinDesk.  “The transparency and real-time monitoring of on-chain transactions enable everyone to see liquidations and value at risk at those levels,” Svanevik added.  Aave, Compound see massive transactions  Svanevik highlighted that over $6 billion was repaid on Aave and Compound, both lending and borrowing platforms, which equated to a 64% reduction in their debt outstanding.  “That’s almost twice as much reduction in TVL (total value locked) compared to last year's May crash (-36%), and we have seen some very large investors repay massive positions, most notably a single wallet repaying 140K ETH on Aave after some initial on-chain liquidations last week,” he said.  Such moves didn't cause any unforeseen contagion damage in the crypto ecosystem, a showcase of the resilience of DeFi applications that rely on smart contracts to conduct financial transactions instead of centralized third parties.  Meanwhile, Svanevik said the centralized manner of operations in some crypto businesses caused the downturns of the past few weeks: “What we are seeing is that the shadow credit system across centralized lenders have enabled excessive leverage and risk into the system with little to no visibility to users until forced selling started and withdrawal stops hit last week, reminiscent of Archegos margin calls last year or Robinhood’s 2020 outage.”  Svanevik noted that the percent of holdings in stablecoins for wallets labeled as smart money by Nansen spiked to all-time highs last week – suggesting a sign of “aggressive de-risking” as well as repayment of on-chain loans.  “We are already seeing signs of this ratio coming down again, indicating smart money is deploying again,” Svanevik concluded.  The DeFi sector did, however, see some governance drama in the past week at Solana-based lending protocol Solend, as reported, with the potential issue subverted on Tuesday.  Market capitalization fell under $1 trillion earlier this month as recession and inflation fears led to a slowdown in broader markets. Bitcoin saw a nearly 12-week decline that pushed prices to as low as below $18,000 last week – marking the first time the asset fell below the highs of the previous cycle.  A decline in crypto prices in early May caused contagion risks within the crypto ecosystem, starting with the implosion of Terra’s UST stablecoin in mid-May. The dollar-pegged coin dropped to a few cents while the protocol’s flagship LUNA tokens plunged nearly 100%.  That caused the value locked on Terra applications to tumble by $28 billion and lead to Three Arrows Capital seeing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.  In June, crypto lender Celsius Network saw troubles as it disabled user withdrawals, citing “extreme market conditions.” That led to rumors of insolvency among crypto circles. Its peers were seemingly affected as well: Lender BlockFi said this week it had secured a $250 million credit facility from crypto exchange FTX to bolster its “balance sheet and platform strength.”  Important events  The 4th annual NFT Industry Event (NFT.NYC)  Point Zero Forum in Switzerland  4 p.m. HKT/SGT(8 a.m. UTC): European Central Bank Economic bulletin  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Bitcoin Slips Ahead of Powell Testimony, Pharrell Joins Doodles NFTs as it Announces First Fundraise  Julian Holguin, CEO of popular NFT project Doodles, revealed the company's partnership with musician Pharrell Williams, new project Doodles 2 and the project's first funding round led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.

After falling more than 70% from its all-time high, investors across the space had started to retreat from the digital asset due to this new price trend. However, trends like these are not new for bitcoin. Although the present market may seem worse than previous ones due to it still ongoing, there have been some brutal bear markets in the past. A Blast From The Past It can often be helpful to take a look at the previous market cycles for bitcoin to see that this is nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, the bull and bear trends of this market have deviated from what has been recorded in history but it still remains very similar to what has been recorded in the past. For bitcoin, the alternation between bear and bull markets has always been part of the experience. It has been through several of these boom-bust cycles in its 13 years in existence and it is not expected to change anytime soon.

26700,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238751,1655934160,Does Crypto Mining Pose Double Taxation Risks?,"Increased crypto adoption has directly resulted in more demand for digital assets. Cryptocurrency mining has, in turn, been on the up over the years. Crypto legislation has been trying to catch up in light of its increased popularity and therein lies the issue. While crypto mining has been associated with tax evasion, is double taxation on crypto mining a possibility? Read on to find out. Double Taxation and How It Occurs Double taxation refers to a taxing principle where taxes are paid twice on the same income source. Its occurrence may be legal, and it does occur for some actors. A taxing authority may impose taxes twice during the same taxing period, on the same income source, for the same purpose, and within the same jurisdiction. Such an occurrence raises illegality concerns. The Susceptibility of Crypto Mining to Double Taxation Crypto mining may incur several possibilities of double taxation. They include the following. 1. Income Tax on Mining and Capital Tax Crypto mining activities generate returns to the miner through mining rewards. In most jurisdictions, the rewards represent a taxable income and are subject to an income tax. Tax obligations don&apos;t end there on paying the income tax as per the rates stated by the jurisdiction a miner is based in. The miner is obligated to pay a capital or wealth tax.

42411775,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzAW,1655933378,7 Key Ways to Evaluate a Cryptocurrency Before Buying It,"The cryptocurrency market draws the attention of not only seasoned investors but also ordinary people with no previous experience in buying crypto. While bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency – and is still the largest by market cap – it wasn’t long before alternative coins (altcoins) emerged, including Ethereum (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE) and many more.  Today, 19,000 cryptocurrencies exist, and many of these altcoins frankly don’t have a promising future. So it’s important to learn how to tell which coin is worth your time and money. In this guide, you will learn seven effective ways to evaluate a cryptocurrency so you can invest with more confidence.  See Also: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know  1. Check out the project’s website  Any cryptocurrency worth your time and investment should have a website. These days, building a website is relatively easy, and any company serious about its business will have an updated, engaging and informative one.  Things to look for on a cryptocurrency’s website:  It’s up to date and easy to use  Clean and free of spelling and other errors  Discloses the team members and partnerships  Clearly defines the token’s objective  Offers a white paper  2. Read the white paper  A crypto white paper is one of the most important tools for evaluating a cryptocurrency as it serves as the backbone of the project’s proposal. It’s an authoritative document outlining the goals and strategies for the cryptocurrency’s usage. Moreover, white papers serve as a road map for the token, and they are usually one of the first things that potential prospects read before allocating money to the project.  In addition, a cryptocurrency white paper is where you will encounter the tokenomics of a coin. The tokenomics include details of how the token will be distributed among the investors as well as its supply limits. It also includes information regarding minting new tokens as well as token burning, if that is part of the ecosystem.  Granted, some white papers get so technical and detailed that you don’t necessarily need to understand every aspect of the tech specs, but knowing who the team behind the project is, what their goals are and how they will achieve them is important.  Not having a white paper is a major red flag, and any trustworthy white paper should be free of spelling and grammatical errors.  3. Scrutinize social media channels  To gain keen insight into a crypto community, first visit its social media accounts. Most cryptocurrency projects will have Twitter, Reddit or Discord channels – and usually all three – that they manage.  Take note of the number of followers they have and the interaction in the comment sections. Assess whether the community moderators are answering questions, promoting news events and actively participating in discussions. For example, if people are posing legitimate questions in their Discord channel and getting ignored or told they “just don’t get it,” that’s a bad sign.  Learn to spot social media crypto scams. Stay away from groups that are too spammy in their sales approach. A strong project won’t need to resort to such tactics.  Second, do a general search across social media for mentions and discussions of the cryptocurrency. If a lot of people are talking positively about the cryptocurrency on social media, that can indicate there will be buying pressure and investment interest. On the flip side, if the mentions are mostly negative, that can be a warning sign – though it’s important to understand the context of conversations, both positive and negative, on social media.  4. Analyze the project team and partnerships  The success of a cryptocurrency is dependent upon its team members. Many reputable coins have project members who were involved in other successful coin launches. This helps to induce more trust within the community. You should be able to find the founders and key members in the project’s white paper and website. Research the team to determine its reputation and thought leadership in the blockchain ecosystem. A team with a prior history of successful projects is a great sign, while a team entirely new to the crypto community might not have the experience to achieve its goals.  Apart from the project team, look at the list of partnerships, if any. You can usually find this on the landing page of the website. Sometimes you will find partnerships with well-known brands like Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), JPMorgan (JPM), Visa (V) and IBM (IBM). As with all things crypto, do your own research and verify that the partnerships are legitimate.  5. Evaluate the cryptocurrency’s market metrics  To check this information, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency aggregator such as CoinMarketCap. What sets a novice investor apart from a seasoned one is a working knowledge of these three basic market metrics.  Market capitalization  The market cap of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price of the cryptocurrency with the total number of coins or tokens in circulation. Generally, it’s safer to invest in cryptocurrencies with a high market cap (over $1 billion), but this isn’t a fail-safe as some cryptocurrencies with high market caps are still high-risk, so judging the value potential by market cap alone isn’t recommended. You can also find many newer projects with amazing potential and partnerships backing them up that just need more time or exposure to reach that threshold. Generally, coins ranking in the top 100 are safer investments than those lower on the list.  Trading volume  Another indicator to watch for is the coin’s trading volume. This metric shows how much the cryptocurrency has been traded within a specified time frame. A high volume means a lot of investors are buying and selling, which leads to more liquidity and price stability. An example of high volume is ETH which, as of this writing, has a daily trading volume of more than $14 billion. In contrast, a low volume signifies low investor faith in the price action and can lead to large price swings and poor liquidity.  Supply metrics  Most cryptocurrencies have a max supply, which essentially means the maximum number of coins that will ever exist. There are cryptocurrencies such as ETH that have an unlimited supply, but the majority have some limit even if it's in the hundreds of billions of coins.  The circulating supply indicates how many are currently either being traded or held in a wallet. This metric can be used to understand the potential scarcity of a coin, which can affect its price in both directions. Knowing the difference among maximum, circulating and total supply will help you make sound buying decisions.  6. Study the price history  In addition to understanding the market metrics, you should always take note of the price history of a cryptocurrency. The crypto market is volatile, so it’s normal to see fluctuations in price, but look for a gradual increase in price over time. It’s wise to observe the price over different time spans, including the “all time” history view to get as broad an understanding as possible of the long-term and shorter-term price trends.  Avoid coins that have exaggerated highs followed by sudden drops as this can indicate a pump-and-dump scenario – a scam whereby a coin’s price is inflated due to false hype and then immediately sold off for profit. This is also referred to as a “rug pull.”  7. Determine whether the cryptocurrency has a utility  Not all cryptocurrencies serve a practical purpose. Look for coins that offer utility in the blockchain ecosystem. Is the coin project seeking to solve an issue within the network or enhance its functionality? One prominent example is Ethereum. Many smart contracts, NFT projects and businesses depend on its technology to survive, so you know it should retain its value over time. Others, like bitcoin, are decentralized digital currencies used for payments and as a store of value.  Other types of coins worth noting include utility tokens. These tokens serve an objective purpose. One example is Basic Attention Token (BAT); this utility token is used by advertisers to pay for ads on the Brave browser, which blocks all ads by default. Users who choose to see ads can join a program that pays them for their attention in BAT.  Conversely, some coins merely exist as jokes. Or, like meme coins, are heavily pushed by social media influencers. That’s not to say you can’t make money with these coins; you should just understand the risks as many are prone to fail at some point. However, if you do decide to invest in meme coins, learn how to do so safely.

42374426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZS7b,1655930992,Market Wrap: BTC Falls Below $20K as Crypto Bounce Loses Steam,"After surging earlier this week, bitcoin resumed its more recent slump below $20,000 on Wednesday amid a sell-off by retail investors.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $19,900, down over 4% over the past 24 hours. The decline comes two days after bitcoin climbed past $21,000 as investors bought a weekend dip to two-year lows.  “The global crypto market remains vulnerable to further selling pressure,” Oanda senior analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email, but he also noted that “a consolidation could be around the corner as the challenging macro environment is close to being fully priced in.”  FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said that investors were premature in buying the latest dip because the wider economic conditions and the U.S. central bank's monetary policy are less favorable for assets than they were during previous downturns.  “Retail shoppers risk being caught swimming against the financial current, which is hardly a successful strategy,” Kuptsikevich wrote. “History suggests that enthusiasts risk running out of steam soon, being left with depreciating assets and losing confidence for years that equity or cryptocurrency markets are a worthwhile place for their money.”  Most altcoins dropped in tandem with BTC, indicating that investors' appetite for taking risks remains low. Ether (ETH), the token of Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, underperformed, dropping more than 6% in the last 24 hours.  The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index were roughly flat as investors digested congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who indicated that the Fed would maintain its hawkish monetary course to rein in inflation, possibly at the expense of a recession.  Rising prices, which have stemmed heavily from increased energy costs, continue to bedevil the U.S. economy, although West Texas Intermediate crude oil, a measure of wider energy markets, fell below $102 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys and the U.S. dollar, which investors consider safe haven assets, closed lower.  ""Wall Street remains hopeful that the Fed will monitor the impact of rate hikes on the economy,"" Oanda's Moya told CoinDesk, adding that ""risk appetite remains elusive as global recession fears intensify.""

Powell's testimony  Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that a soft landing “is going to be very challenging” and that a recession is “certainly a possibility.  “We are not trying to provoke and do not think we will need to provoke a recession, but we do think it’s absolutely essential that we restore price stability, really for the benefit of the labor market, as much as anything else,” he said.  Inflation is still running at a four-decade high of 8.6% in May, a level that surprised economists, traders and even Fed officials. Powell said the Fed will continue to raise interest rates until it sees a clear sign that inflation is cooling down.  “Financial conditions have already priced in additional rate increases, but we need to go ahead and have them,” he said.

42423079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28bPh,1655928302,Ontario Securities Commission Slaps Bybit and KuCoin With Penalties,"A top Canadian financial regulator has slapped two crypto exchanges, Bybit and KuCoin, with enforcement actions for failing to comply with securities laws in the Canadian province of Ontario.  The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) determined that both exchanges were operating noncompliant platforms that allowed Ontario residents to trade unregistered securities.  “Foreign crypto asset trading platforms that want to operate in Ontario must play by the rules or face enforcement action,” Jeff Kehoe, director of enforcement at the OSC, said in a press statement. “The outcomes announced today should serve as a clear indication that we refuse to tolerate non-compliance with Ontario securities law.”  Bybit, which recently confirmed it was laying off employees, cooperated with the investigation and reached a settlement agreement with the regulator. As part of the agreement, Bybit paid a nearly C$2.5 million ($1.9 million) fine to the OSC and agreed to work with the agency to properly register. In the meantime, Bybit won't accept new accounts for Ontario-based customers or market its services in the province.  Unlike Bybit, KuCoin is accused of being uncooperative with the OSC’s investigation. As a result, the Seychelles-based exchange has been permanently banned from participating in Ontario’s capital markets. The OSC also hit the exchange with a C$2 million ($1.5 million) fine, as well as nearly C$100,000 ($77,000) in investigation-related costs.  The penalties come over a year after the OSC told exchanges operating in Ontario that they “must contact the OSC or face enforcement action.”  According to the OSC, neither Bybit nor KuCoin contacted or registered with the agency by the April 19, 2021 deadline.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/22/ontario-securities-commission-slaps-bybit-and-kucoin-with-enforcement-actions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9704092b0757047758dc7ebc4e7b15f400f48fc-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The “sunsetting” will happen later this year, a blog post said. Advanced Trade, which is now live on desktop but not on mobile, is already prompting users to migrate their funds over from Pro, a reporter found Wednesday.  The move comes as exchanges jockey for users; Binance.US announced earlier Wednesday it was eliminating trading fees on bitcoin transactions.  Perhaps the biggest result of the move will be more accessibility for retail traders who were unaware that they could often find cheaper fees on Pro, which uses a different URL and has a standalone app.  Other than accessibility, however, the change appears to have little functional impact on trading on Coinbase. Advanced Trade mirrors Pro in fee structure and trade execution, as it interacts directly with the Coinbase exchange order book, the blog post said.  Coinbase pledged to launch more features for Advanced Trade in the coming months as it gets close to the end for Coinbase Pro, which was formerly known as GDAX.

In a revival, buyers are angling at June 2022 highs at $10.5, completing a double bottom formation. Past Performance of WAVES WAVES crypto is leading the charge as per the formation in the daily chart. After an extended lull, the explosion of prices on June 21 lifted the coin into the green. The token is now up 24 percent against the greenback, aligning with gains of late May 2022. WAVES Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is northwards as per the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. With the immediate trend defined, traders may find entries on dips above $5.3. The immediate target lies at June 2022 highs at $10.6. Following the expansion on June 21 with rising trading volumes, there is a W-formation, a double bottom, at $4.2. This level marks the lows of May and June 2022. Any break below $5.3 may force WAVES prices towards June 21 lows at $4.7 with sustained gains back to $4.2. What to Expect from WAVES? Buyers are currently in control per WAVES technical analysis in the daily chart. Accordingly, traders can load up with targets at $10.5 in the medium term with every dip. However, if prices recoil from spot rates and fail to confirm gains of June 21, the coin may slump to $4.7 and back to May 2022 lows.The post WAVES Technical Analysis: Price Surges by 24%, Buyers Target $10.5 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,USDT,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/waves-technical-analysis-price-surges-by-24-buyers-target-10-5/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=waves-technical-analysis-price-surges-by-24-buyers-target-10-5,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42423083,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy28bVh,1655926178,India Clarifies Rules for Controversial Tax Provision Ahead of Start Date,"India's Finance Ministry has issued guidelines to clarify the reporting mechanism for the contentious and soon-to-be-implemented 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) provision.  CoinDesk earlier reported how India would clarify that provision of its tax code.  The 1% TDS liability – which will take effect on July 1 – is the most controversial provision of India’s recently introduced crypto tax law, with the industry even exploring a legal challenge. Another provision, which enforces a 30% capital gains tax on all crypto transactions, took effect on April 1.  TDS is a liability imposed on the exchanges that deposit taxes on behalf of sellers on their platform. It will be calculated at 1% of a transaction's value. The seller would be able to offset the 1% TDS from his or her total tax liability of 30%.  The government notification also clarified the timeline that parties have to report a virtual digital asset transaction. The government said it must be notified of a transaction within 30 days from the end of the month in which the transaction is made and any sum deducted must be paid to the government within the same time frame.  The format to report the transaction was also specified by the government. A new form will be introduced entitled 26QE, which will play the dual role of a statement and a receipt.  The new rules also say that the person responsible for paying the tax deduction should give a TDS certificate to the payee within 15 days from the due date for reporting it to the government.  The tax would have to be paid beforehand in cases where the payment for the transfer of a digital asset is in kind.  The parties will also have to maintain details like date of transfer of virtual digital assets, value of consideration and mode of consideration.  The latest clarification is said to be a precursor to the Indian Finance Ministry issuing an FAQ on taxation of cryptocurrency in order to provide more clarity.  The government has exempted transactions of up to Rs 50,000 ($640) in a year from the rule of 1% TDS for certain categories of taxpayers.

During a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Powell said that a soft landing “is going to be very challenging,” and that a recession is “certainly a possibility.” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) called Powell the “most powerful man” in the world right now.  “We are not trying to provoke and do not think we will need to provoke a recession, but we do think it’s absolutely essential that we restore price stability, really for the benefit of the labor market, as much as anything else,” he said.  Inflation is still running at a four-decade high of 8.6% in May, a new high that surprised economists, traders and even Fed officials. Powell said the Fed will continue to raise interest rates until it sees a clear sign that inflation is cooling down.  “Financial conditions have already priced in additional rate increases, but we need to go ahead and have them,” he said.  The federal funds rate is currently in a range between 1.5%-1.75%, but revised projections by Fed officials last week show that the rate is expected to go up to 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year.  Three senators, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), challenged Powell with questions on crypto, specifically regulation, accounting treatment of digital assets and the current crash in the crypto market.  “We are tracking those events very carefully,” said Powell, but the central bank is “not really seeing significant macroeconomic implications, so far.""  He also repeatedly highlighted that there’s a need for a better regulatory framework for crypto.  “The same activity should have the same regulation no matter where it appears, and that isn't the case right now because a lot of the digital finance products, in some ways, are quite similar to products that have existed in the banking system or the capital markets, but they're just not regulated the same way,” he said. “So we need to do that.""",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/22/fed-chair-powell-says-soft-landing-will-be-challenging-calls-for-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d38343a07c365745b2fc7ae1b608970cb22e61d-2010x1368.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394038,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucizp,1655921735,How Web3 and Bitcoin Billionaires Will Revolutionize Philanthropy,"How many crypto billionaires will there be? Rhys Lindmark, CEO of Roote, a nonprofit startup studio, answered this question at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  ""By 2025, or 2030, 20% of all billionaires will be crypto billionaires,” he said, if bitcoin hits $200,000. Drilling down further, that would give the world 400 BTC billionaires and 200 ETH billionaires. That’s a huge jump from the current estimate of 19 crypto billionaires.  And just as technical innovation produces a new generation of wealthy elites, it also produces philanthropists. How the crypto generation spends its wealth may determine if humanity is able to adequately address its existential issues.  Web2 gave the world the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – massive organizations that funnel money towards worthy causes. Web3, also a huge “wealth creation event,” is seeing its own class of philanthropic institutions like the FTX Future Fund, which pledged to donate $100 million this year.  For Lindmark, what separates Web2 from 3 is the idea of ""SquadWealth,” or what happens when communities are able to align around emerging financial incentives. This matters for capital formation – like founding new projects – as well as philanthropy.  “Every round is a community round, with NFT degens and crypto VCs aping in together,” Lindmark said.  Not only that, but crypto seems to have an obsession with building “public goods,” he said. ""These are a bunch of Web3 projects that are creating positive externalities, and they're all about giving back.""  See also: How Web 3 Changes Philanthropy | Opinion  Crypto may also finally give us a “risk-adjusted investment ladder for public goods” similar to how venture capitalists value startups. ""We will have seed, Series A, Series B, etc., but for nonprofit public goods,” he said.  What’s more? “Donors will be repaid through retroactive public goods funding,"" Lindmark said. CoinDesk spoke with Lindmark after his presentation on the Big Ideas stage to hear more about philanthropy in Web3. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.  How did you get interested in Web3 and philanthropy?  I really dove deep into Web3 in 2017. I had left my old company after the 2016 election in the United States – I just felt like I needed to concentrate on the bigger world, follow my curiosity and learn about Ethereum. These people are thinking in a really cool way: If we change how money works and how coordination as a society works, that is going to have a big impact. A big part of that is knowing where these philanthropists, created by printing lots of “magic internet money,” are putting their money.  We know that Bitcoin plunged below $25K, the lowest level since December 2020. In your speech, you mention if bitcoin goes to $200,000 and the rest of crypto rises with it, this would give you 400 BTC billionaires, 200 ETH billionaires and 200 other billionaires. Do you think it still will happen? Will bitcoin recover from this bear market?  All things considered, I am not an analyst, so I don't know. The price of bitcoin historically has gone up about 10x after “bitcoin halvings.” We’ll see what happens in 2024, [but] I'd say the odds of bitcoin [rising] above $200,000 are like 10%-15% and the odds that it's above $100,000 is, maybe, 25%-50%. Those are completely random numbers. But yeah, I expect OrangeCoin to go up.  So you’re confident in bitcoin?  I am mostly projecting trends – it's less that I'm bullish on bitcoin itself. I am more of a smart contract guy myself.  If crypto enables anyone to mint a token, literally print money, do you think there is an ethical obligation to donate?  I 100% think there's an ethical obligation to give away your money whether or not you can print crypto tokens. I think you have an ethical obligation to donate about 10% [of your earnings] after you make about $100,000. You don't get happier the more money you make, and every $1,000 [can be] impactful for the 750 million people who make less than $2 a day. Everybody should self tax themselves.  How can we apply crypto?  There are DAOs where you put your tokens into these yield-generating assets, but instead of giving yourself the yield, you give it to other people. It's similar to what PoolTogether has been doing with its “lossless lottery” – but you can just point it just at a charity. Crypto enables you to self tax yourself and direct where the money goes, so I hope in our future taxation system you get to choose where the money goes.  Do you think “effective altruism” is being used as a shield by the rich and powerful?  That definitely happens within philanthropy. Effective altruists, specifically as a type of philanthropist, are better than most philanthropists in being more aggressive than the “Giving Pledge,” which is a thing that Bill and Melinda Gates and others have pushed forward to give at least 50% of your wealth by the time you die.  I think SBF [FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried] and CZ [Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao] said they're going to give 99% of their wealth by the time they die.  Do Effective Altruists have as much of an obligation to not lose their wealth as they have for acquiring it?  I won't speak for all of them, but many that I know see wealth accumulation as a means to an end.  Why should the state or the government have a role in allocating resources?  By 2100, the way that we allocate and support public goods is going to be totally different than it is today. Right now it mostly goes through the state, and philanthropy is playing this role where it is not very transparent. The donor may choose where they put their money, but it is not accountable to anybody except the donor – so you get a market that's optimized for short-term private goods. While the government is optimized for short-term public goods, like roads and bridges.  Philanthropy can actually be optimized for the long term because it can be riskier and experiment more. In 80 years, that money will look a lot more like Gitcoin Grants. We already do it for open source software within the crypto world. Over time, there will be these “impact DAOs” and impact certificates – a whole impact economy will exist for funding public goods not just on the internet, but for communities around the world. There'll be community currencies that are baked into it. I think a lot of public goods financing, instead of coming from the government, will be through these new bottom-up mechanisms.  Is it possible to eliminate poverty?  It is 100% possible. Through industrialization and modernization plus good charity efforts, the amount of people in poverty has decreased by 400 or 500 million in the last 40 years. As more and more people in developed countries start to give back and as countries enter later stages of development … no one will be in poverty.  Do you think Web3 will help in this process?  Definitely. Web3 is a really cool technological frontier, and when new technological frontiers get developed and exploited there's a lot of value generated. That money can be pushed back into the system. There’s also the economic freedom perspective: Web3 hopefully will be part of a trend of banking the unbanked and bringing people out of poverty by providing new economic opportunities.  In addition to Coinbase Giving and FTX Future Fund, you said there would be dozens of massive Web3 foundations that give in a bottom-up way. These foundations will take the form of what Nadia Asparouhova calls idea machines, funded organisms that turn ideologies into outcomes. Could you give me an example of it? And why do you think it will happen?  An idea machine is something that is kind of like a movement of people who are looking to do something, but it's self organizing, and naturally is able to get excited people into it, but also excited capital. So you need kind of the money and the people that are starting to prioritize things and push towards these outcomes. And then once those outcomes happen, value gets created, and then the money, more people and talent kind of go back into that system. So maybe Gitcoin is a fine example of this, where you've had this bonus money that exists, people are excited by it, and then people start to co-create these giving to each other, the kind of SquadWealth. Everybody gives to each other's Gitcoin Grants, and then that allows people to start operating and creating more value, which then kind of loops back to bringing more people in financial capital into that system.  Could you explain more about the VC ladder for nonprofits? How will it work?  There are no risk adjusted ladders and also no returns to getting in early to a new nonprofit. We need to change that. The impact economy will have retroactive public goods funding and advance market commitments and a whole new kind of impact market rewarding those who get into new nonprofits early.  So why will it happen and how will it work? Is it just the same as the company, like going through the seed funding, Series A?  There are two separate things that need to occur here. The first is that the impact that is created needs to be recognized in a way and needs to have some kind of market price – this is the idea of impact certificates. I think that the impact itself needs to be recognized further down the line, five or 10 years later.  The other side is learning to measure the actual risk of new risky nonprofits that could have huge returns later. We’ll have to have some kind of equity or way to evaluate companies at the beginning based on how risky they are, because they might not all create impact but some of them might.  See also: How Crypto Could Avoid the Risks of 'Down Rounds' | Opinion  So you think this new model will attract people to donate more?  It's a good question. I honestly need to do some of the thinking myself more about this, whether this is actually something that people deeply, deeply want. I do think that if philanthropists could either get a little bit of a rate of return on some of their donations or have a little more incentive for putting money towards something risky than I think they would want to. But I haven't done the “100 customer interviews” to make sure that that's true.  What do you make of Jeff Bezos and Sam Bankman-Fried?  Sam was an ambitious kid that happened to execute really well, and now he has a bunch of money, and he's actually giving money back in a very serious way. I mostly agree with the effective altruists mindset. He's already donated $100 million through the FTX Future fund, and next year is going to give at least another $100 million and probably more. He’s trying to give $1 billion by 2025.  Do you think crypto is ultimately worth it, despite the fact that many retail participants lose out during the process of “wealth creation?”  I think Web3 is totally still gonna reshape the world, and that it is worth it. But there are so many bad things – something like $5 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2018. You know, luna – $50 billion of value lost, and so that's 10x more. Crypto has messed up a lot of lives for sure and hasn't been as inclusive as it could be.  But I think in the long run these new protocols will help us move money over the internet and will also help us kind of create our own community money. I think that's going to be a really powerful thing for society going forward.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/22/how-web3-and-bitcoin-billionaires-will-revolutionize-philanthropy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c53742ecf906227f6c833213da6b16d5664b482-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421536,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYbV,1655919769,What if the Federal Reserve Has Inflation All Wrong?,"New data this morning showed inflation in the United Kingdom has hit 9.1%, beating out the rates in the U.S., Italy, France and all other G7 nations. That highlights a possible disconnect between the rationale behind tightening U.S. monetary policy and the actual causes of ongoing inflation rises.  You see, since the beginning of U.S. pandemic relief spending in 2020, prominent neoliberal economic voices have warned of the danger of America’s big-spending approach to cushioning the pandemic shock. The U.S. spent more as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) than any major economy on Earth, in a mix of direct payments to citizens, forgivable loans to small businesses and new pandemic-related federal spending.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here  From nearly the beginning of that fiscal response, figures like Harvard economist Larry Summers warned that it could trigger inflation. For a while, they seemed right – until roughly the end of 2021, U.S. inflation did outpace the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. But with inflation around the world now surpassing U.S. levels, that story is increasingly open to doubt. Median inflation globally hit 7.9% in June, with the U.S. ranking just 48th out of 111 countries.  So if the U.S. printed a bunch more money than other economies, why are we all getting the same dose of inflation? The most compelling theory is that the particularly generous U.S. stimulus juiced inflation stateside for a while, but that effect has been largely supplanted by non-monetary factors that are hitting everyone. Those factors are pretty obvious: COVID and war.  See also: Inflation Will Create a Political Vacuum. Can Bitcoin Fill It? | Opinion  Even without any pandemic relief at all, COVID would have created major price pressures. Wages have risen sharply even since the end of expanded U.S. unemployment benefits, in part because the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers cratered in the early stages of the pandemic, and still hasn’t recovered to 2019 levels. While supplemental income made it easier, some workers would still have chosen to avoid risks to their health by staying home. Others (largely women) were forced out of jobs by the loss of support systems like childcare.  At the same time, the grim reality is that the labor force has also been reduced by illness and death. Wages rose for similar reasons after the Black Plague decimated the European peasantry, centuries before there was any such thing as unemployment insurance.  It’s also vital to remember that pandemic relief, particularly Trump-era unemployment enhancements and stimulus checks, not only helped keep Americans safe by making it easier to stay home, but also helped the American economy experience a shorter recession and stronger recovery than any other advanced economy. For this, we can thank Steven Mnuchin, the Trump Treasury Secretary who clearly learned the lesson of the Obama administration’s anemic fiscal response to the 2008 financial crisis, which helped drag out the subsequent recovery.  Not ‘transitory’  Around the world, meanwhile, COVID also caused major supply chain disruptions that pushed up prices. The prime example is commodity silicon chips, with shortages continuing to constrain the supply of new automobiles. One reason leaders, including Janet Yellen, considered early signs of inflation merely “transitory” was that the bulk of it came from specific disrupted sectors such as autos. Most notoriously, the price of used cars in the U.S. spiked brutally in 2021 and has only recently begun to tick down.  And now, of course, there’s Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That has had immediate impacts on energy markets thanks to limits on the export of Russian oil. It is beginning to have what could be catastrophic effects on food prices as Putin’s forces steal Ukrainian farms, which are among the most productive in the world. Chip shortages affect particular sectors like cars, but oil and food prices feed into the cost of nearly everything.  So we may be living through a transition between two distinct drivers of inflation – from money supply-driven price growth to supply-constraint price growth. The two are hard to entirely disentangle, because pandemic stimulus money is still driving some amount of U.S. spending. But with countries that did nothing close to the U.S. levels of spending now seeing MORE inflation than the U.S., it simply makes little sense to continue accepting Larry Summers’ version of events. In a few years, hindsight might vindicate dovish figures like Yellen.  Yet attention in the U.S. remains focused on the actions of the Federal Reserve, which has begun a cycle of aggressive interest rate hikes designed to shrink the supply of U.S. dollars in circulation. It’s one of a bare handful of tools the Fed has, and the Fed has the most explicit responsibility among U.S. institutions to maintain price stability.  Demand destruction  But if the money supply isn’t really the problem, what impact will the Fed's tightening have?  On the one hand, it’s pretty simple: Instead of limiting demand for specific sectors where real-world supply constraints are driving up prices, Fed tightening will cool demand for pretty much everything, largely by destroying people’s jobs. Inflation hawk Summers thinks we need to nearly double unemployment to 6% for several years to control prices – a truly devastating scenario for many workers and businesses. As the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail.  That means not just a temporary slowdown, but perhaps even long-term damage to the U.S. economy. Productive employees will lose their jobs, and productive facilities will be mothballed – both changes that are hard to reverse when things pick back up. In some sense, we traded an immediately catastrophic pandemic crash for something slower, and hopefully less traumatic, but not much less challenging.  See also: Bitcoin and Today's Wicked Inflation Share a Common Ancestor | Opinion  And that demand destruction won’t actually increase the global supply of Russian oil or Ukrainian wheat. It just means fewer people will be competing for the same supply of food and energy, because they’ll be out of work.  This is the logic of inflation-fighting inherited largely from Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve chair from 1979 to 1987, who infamously triggered a major recession in the early 1980s to fight inflation. That inflation, too, was at least partly driven by supply-side rather than demand-side problems, particularly a lengthy oil crisis caused by war in the Middle East.  The good news is that while that recession was intense, Volcker’s tough love set the stage for a huge U.S. economic expansion that arguably ran from the mid-1980s into the late-1990s. So while we might wish the Fed had more nuanced tools than a mallet poised to squash the entire economy, or that political leaders had more wherewithal to enact targeted policies, pain now could still mean a more stable, healthier situation not too far in the future.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

Powell's remarks came in testimony on monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee.  In an accounting directive – the innocuous-sounding Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 – to public companies, the SEC had advised firms holding customers’ digital assets that they’d need to consider those assets as belonging to the companies’ own balance sheets. This move spurred Coinbase (COIN) to declare in a public filing that customers’ assets may be caught up with the company’s in a hypothetical bankruptcy. That admission caused some fear among customers, though the company argued it wasn’t a signal about the company’s health.  Read more: Coinbase Has No Risk of Bankruptcy, New 10-Q Disclosure Language Is SEC Requirement, CEO Armstrong Says  ""Custody assets are off balance sheet, have always been,” Powell told the Senate Banking Committee. “The SEC made a different decision as it relates to digital assets for reasons it explained, and now we have to consider those.”  As it relates to the banks the Fed oversees in the U.S., Powell said the SEC’s interpretation is “certainly something we're focusing on very closely right now,” adding that his agency is working with other banking regulators to figure out how it might change the way they assess lenders that keep cryptocurrencies.  After the filing from Coinbase, the Biden administration began pushing behind the scenes to insist that future legislation require legal walls to protect customers’ digital assets. And another incident – the drama at Celsius Network, the crypto lending platform that halted customer withdrawals last week – threw a spotlight on the problem of shielding customers’ money.

But even as this rages on, there is a bigger issue that could threaten the recovery that BTC has made so far, which is the fact that larger miners may be forced to liquidate their holdings. Bitcoin Miners Can&apos;t Meet Up Usually, bitcoin miners are known for holding the coins that they realize from their activities. Since miners are not buying the coins in the first place, it makes them the natural net sellers of bitcoin. However, their tendency to hold these coins has often seen them having to offload their bags onto suffering markets. So instead of actually selling in a bull, they tend to hold until the bull market is over and with profitability down in a bear market, are forced to sell coins to finance their operations.

42374555,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvvShB,1655917200,Coinbase Redesigns Mobile Wallet to Add Dapp Browser,"Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has redesigned its mobile wallet to add a browser that makes it easier for users to search for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and games and transact on the company's system.  The top decentralized apps (dapp) are suggested in the browser's homepage, allowing users to perform token swaps in a couple of clicks, according to a demo shared on Coinbase Wallet's Twitter account Tuesday. Many of the new features are already present in Coinbase's web browser extensions.  Coinbase may be hoping that by improving access to these areas, users who haven't explored those applications will be tempted to do so, boosting the company's transaction revenue in the process.  The news comes the same day that Binance.US said it is cutting fees on bitcoin (BTC) trading to zero with plans to extend this to other tokens in the future, a move Coinbase may be forced to match. Coinbase shares fells around 3% following the announcement. Encouraging more transactions in other areas of the crypto universe might help counter any lost fee revenue.  Among other changes, the search function adds auto-complete, bookmarking and tabs to help make the experience of exploring dapps on the wallet more user friendly. The functionality recreates the kind of experience customers are used to when using regular web browsers.  Coinbase also extended its support for the Solana network, adding the facility to send, receive and store SOL and Solana program library (SPL) tokens. Users will no longer need separate wallet apps for multichain activity across DeFi, NFTs and so on.  The exchange's peers are also aiming to address integration. Robinhood (HOOD), for example, announced last month that it planned to roll out a DeFi-focused crypto wallet by the end of the year.  The Coinbase wallet will begin roll out today with more users getting access in the coming weeks, the company said in a release.

42421539,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYgf,1655915658,Should You Copyright Your NFTs?,"NFTs: You have heard about them, your grandma has heard about them, but do you really know what you get when you buy one?  At this point, it is common knowledge that the immutability of blockchains has given creators and collectors credible proof of digital ownership, validity and scarcity for the first time ever. But what happens outside the blockchain?  Meanix is a 21-year-old self-described “all-out NFTs fanatic, halfway between blockchain and music.” He welcomes reader feedback on Twitter.  In the real physical world, ownership is often synonymous with copyright, and that is what gives companies like Yuga Labs absolute control over their brands.  Copyright has been a very hot subject in the PFP (profile picture) NFT communities because PFPs are supposed to become part of one’s digital identity. Knowing exactly to what extent you can use your digital identity is a big deal.  Thankfully, holders of Yuga’s Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens were given permission to develop derivative products from their apes. Imagine spending $200,000 on an NFT that you can’t even create merchandise with. But ape owners still face limitations.  Depending on the particular NFT collection, there may be restrictions on the usage of intellectual property (IP) on the holder’s side, and so many have started looking into NFTs that give buyers the ability to leverage and commercialize their NFTs’ artwork. And that has led to an explosion of projects that give extensive or complete freedom for holders.  This debate has shifted specifically toward “CC0,” known as “no copyright reserved,” and commercial rights, or as punk6529 considers them, the main contenders for the copyright standard license for PFP projects. The Pepsi and Coca-Cola of PFP NFT copyright models have involuntarily created two camps that have continuous fiery disputes on which is better. With all the misconceptions going on, I’m here to shine a light on the matter.  While I won’t be taking any side, I want to help you make the best decision for yourself. So let’s dig in.  J1mmy.eth vs DCinvestor.eth  There are two ways of thinking about copyright in NFTs. One is about retaining the rights over your art as a creator for more control and exclusivity to revenue generation outside the blockchain. This is known as copyright.  The other way is the permissionless approach where the art, the intellectual property, belongs to no one, but ownership still exists on the blockchain, thanks to Creative Commons licenses. I was aware of the emergent discussions on the copyright models for NFT collections, especially the PFP ones. But when I saw a rare heated public exchange between j1mmy.eth and DCinvestor.eth – two high-profile NFT influencers – I realized that the rivalry between the two sides went deeper than I thought.  DCinvestor.eth is on the CC0 team – CC0 stands for Creative Commons Zero. j1mmy.eth is bullish on commercial rights for NFTs. Their disagreement has led to a dispute filled with ego and sharp remarks (start here and scroll up).  In DCinvestor’s view, there is potential in CC0 projects, but j1mmy calls CC0 mighty foolish, though he didn't use precisely those words. DCinvestor.eth is arguing that open-source software runs much of the internet and that, much like with Bitcoin and Ethereum, environments where everyone can contribute could become the most valuable. While he is “advocating for community participation and building in CC0 communities and brands,” j1mmy.eth is confident that CC0 NFTs “will not be a popular concept with mainstream,” that they are a bad investment compared with NFTs with commercial rights and that people should “ignore the CC0 projects if they are trying to win.”  Both of them made bold statements, and with their track records and credibility, there are good reasons to take them both seriously. But who’s right?  Why copyright?  First, some context.  Copyright was created to encourage creators to create new works by enabling them to claim some of the economic value of those works. While distribution and consumption of works are getting cheaper and cheaper, creation remains costly. Copyright was the compromise that ordered or even destroyed free culture in order to save it. If there are no creators to create, there is no more culture to preserve. And without a guarantee that creators can make a living in this world by creating, this scenario would become inevitable.  That is how the “All rights reserved” implied license came to life, with all finalized creative works fitting into this category automatically, without requiring registration, unless stated otherwise by the creator.  Starting with the basics, the most important information on intellectual property rights is that these rights give the owners of copyright the power to set boundaries to their copyrighted material, discourage plagiarism and defend what for some is the only source of income by punishing anyone who threatens their livelihood by exploiting the IP without permission. Not only independent artists but projects and brands such as BAYC can benefit from the retention of some rights because protecting their brand is important for longevity.  However, in order to see the bigger picture of what copyright means for NFT collectors and creators specifically, before going any further into this article, you should check out this invaluable piece written by Amy Madison Luo for CoinDesk. According to Luo, “creators and collectors are going to inadvertently give up rights if they are not familiar with basic IP law.”  (Disclaimer: While most countries abide by the “Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,” copyright law can vary in each jurisdiction. The interpretation of intellectual property rights from this article is generally valid, but the reader should look into the lawfulness of their actions before applying anything stated in this article.)  What follows should supplement all Luo has written, helping you make more educated decisions. We’re going in deep.  What are commercial rights?  The term “commercial rights” has been used far and wide in PFP communities, but the truth is there is no accurate one-size-fits-all description of it. Some projects, like BAYC, state in their terms and conditions that the owners of NFTs have full unlimited commercial rights over their apes, which means that they can commercialize and sell items with their apes however they want. Others, like CryptoKitties, have taken a slightly different approach by giving the owners of NFTs only limited permission to commercialize their NFTs for the creation of merchandise with earnings capped at $100,000 per year and with restrictions on “using the art to market or sell third-party products” and “modifying the art.”  Both BAYC and CryptoKitties can brag about giving commercial rights to the holders, but it is evident that one of them is limiting that right to an extent.  Each project’s terms and conditions dictate what “commercial use” means for the holders, and that can vary. Depending on the project, there may be limitations on how a buyer may commercialize their NFT, including limits on revenue and on rights to create any derivative works and on exclusivity and royalties.  Generally, commercial rights give individuals access to exploit certain intellectual property for direct or indirect income generation through a transfer of copyright. But be aware that a written assignment is required for a transfer of copyright. So, unless clearly specified in the terms and conditions, you own only the token, not the actual artwork itself.  The ideal scenario for commercial rights for NFTs, and the one that I suppose J1mmy is supporting in his tweet, is the one where you, the NFT holder, get the ownership over the NFT and the underlying artwork and the exclusive unlimited commercial rights attached to it.  So, besides the ownership of the NFT and the money you can make from selling it, you are the only one with permission to use your PFP for merchandise, advertisements, movies or anything that involves the exploitation of the PFP and generates revenue. This opens the avenue to income opportunities outside of the blockchain from derivative works, and you have complete control over it for as long as the smart contract authenticates your ownership over the NFT,  Some projects, however, such as Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult, provide purchasers of their NFTs with a non-exclusive license to the underlying art, instead of a transfer of commercial rights, which means that the creators are also allowed to exploit the intellectual property rights governing the art.  Some of the most popular PFP projects that claim to give their buyers “commercial rights” are BAYC, World of Women and Invisible Friends.  What about Creative Commons and CC0?  Creative Commons (CC) was initiated for the purpose of shifting from the “All rights reserved” standard for copyright to a variety of options for creators on opening up their works for other people to use.  For a better understanding, in the picture below you can observe the various types of Creative Commons licenses:  As it can be clearly seen in the picture, the CC licenses lie between complete openness (CC0/public domain) and some restriction of commercial usage and modification/alteration (CC BY-NC-ND). It is worth noting that, no matter what CC license you choose from the list, once you attribute a piece of art to it, anyone can distribute it freely forever.  In the view of Creative Commons representatives, “there’s nothing contradictory about a creator offering their work to the public under a CC license as well as minting it as a limited edition NFT.” They argue that these NFTs that include CC-licensed work are still an entry on a catalogue raisonne, which gives them rareness and authenticity even though a CC license makes it legally possible to create infinite copies of a work. There are, however, some implications that come with the usage of Creative Commons licenses for NFT assets that most people seem to miss.  Most buyers believe that CC0 is the license that gives them the most power over their NFTs because the creators are renouncing their claim to exclusive rights over that artwork. But the fact that the creator no longer has any say over the usage of their work, excluding moral rights, doesn’t imply that the buyer has complete control over it.  First, if you buy an NFT from a PFP collection using any CC license, you don’t get the exclusive legal right of right-click saving it to use it as your social handles or display it wherever you want as your avatar. So, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but you have as many rights over your CC-licensed avatar as the other guy. But I promise I won’t “right click, save as” your PFP and use it as my profile picture on Twitter.  Furthermore, buying NFT artwork released under CC0 doesn’t mean that you own the rights to the CC0 artwork. It simply means you have paid for it on the blockchain. But that should be enough because it also means that if you own a CC0 NFT, you own everything. Sure, you don’t own the IP, but nobody does. It can’t be bought. It can’t be sold. All that remains is the original token on the blockchain. And that’s yours.  Let’s forget about copyright for a second. For the most part, what you are paying with the PFP projects is the community anyway. As long as you’re holding the NFT, you enjoy exclusive access to the community and its perks and utility granted by the ownership of the cryptographic token. These things aren’t available in the public domain.  Nonetheless, with public domain media, you can profit commercially from it, but so can the rest of the world. As a result, you won’t have the same opportunities for creating revenue with your NFT’s artwork. But that’s also the beauty of it. Anyone has the creative and commercial freedom to build out the brand.  There is also the risk that someone could mint these PFPs or make derivatives for resale and create their own community around them. We can see the marketplaces being flooded with lookalikes or complete copies of popular PFP projects, but under CC0, it is no longer considered plagiarism, so one of these communities that came after yours could eventually surpass yours and even have better benefits or utility. And there’s nothing you can do about it. But “pwnership” suggests that maybe you don’t really need to do anything about it.  A notorious CC0 project is “mfers”, created by Sartoshi, and there has a very interesting story about how that community was created and started building.  Other examples of CC0 NFT projects include CrypToadz, Loot and Nouns.  Pwnership says copyright stinks  Now, “pwnership” could be the ultimate argument for the supposed irrelevance of copyright for status goods such as art and NFTs. Because people collect them for the social status ownership conveys, “is a status good really so bad if everyone gets to consume everything, except the status?” That’s the question law professor and NFT creator Brian L. Frye addresses in his essay “After Copyright: Pwning NFTs in a Clout Economy.”  Frye coined the term “pwnership” in the essay and argued that the NFT market is living proof that art doesn’t require copyright and that clout trumps control. He wrote:  The NFT market recognizes the owner of a “legitimate” NFT of a work as the “owner” of the work, even though NFTs typically don’t convey copyright ownership of the work.  Pwnership consists of “clout,” rather than control.  Read more: How Bananas and Mortgages Explain the NFT Craze  NFT owners don’t need copyright, because pwnership depends on the endorsement of the author, rather than control of the use of the work.  In fact, NFT owners encourage others to use the work, because popularity increases the value of ownership.  For example, I could mint a new NFT with any CC0 Noun, but because everyone knows the “original” collection, the one endorsed by the creator(s), mine will have no relevance and probably little if any value. But the opposite could happen, too. A creator could launch a collection with incredible art tomorrow, but fail to get any attention and sales. Someone else can “steal” the art, copy the idea, rebrand it and profit from the original work without being required to compensate the “original” creator. Copyright gives you the power to legally sue someone using your IP without permission. CC0 doesn’t.  Coming back to “pwnership,” Frye claims that copyright created artificial scarcity because markets for anything other than public goods require scarcity. But he adds that the art market never needed copyright to define scarcity in the first place because the “original” piece was always considered authentic, and so only the original is valuable.  The art market values ownership and the clout that accompanies it, and so “scarce” or valuable art was always defined by the associated clout. “Art is not scarce [because] vast quantities are available for next to nothing,” Frye contended.  NFTs have created a market in ownership. In Frye’s words, “The art market was always essentially an NFT market,” because nothing else matters besides the scarcity of clout of ownership. NFTs don’t normally offer you the right to control the use of a work of authorship, but the right to be the owner of the token and the clout associated with ownership.  Subsequently, value is tied to ownership; once the work is sold, the clout is gone. Ironically, “right-click savers” generate more clout when they boost awareness of an NFT project in their attempt to troll. By talking about the work, they only prove its value and increase that value. People can use the work however they like, without affecting the ownership.  As mentioned earlier, for PFP collections, the main value stays in the benefits and utility of the cryptographic token, and those benefits are given by the creator’s endorsement. And this seems to be the foundation of “pwnership.”  What is the fan favorite?  I was curious to know what Web 3 enthusiasts think the best copyright model for NFTs is and the poll I created on Twitter on the matter shows overwhelming support for CC0. It does make a lot of sense that people in this market would be most attracted to the “no rights reserved” narrative because CC0 is in alignment with the spirit of Web 3.  Ultimately, Web 3 is about transparency and openness, and CC0 contributes to that by allowing anyone to use the artwork of any NFT under this license for commercial use or otherwise.  We are all dreaming of an open universe where characters from our favorite NFT projects can coexist and thrive. (Some may call it the “metaverse”; the terminology is not relevant for now.) But, frankly, non-CC0 collections make this dream improbable to achieve. Copyright stands for restriction and control and makes the goal expensive and inaccessible.  To build out a universe with characters from copyrighted collections, you either have to own the token or license the IP from the owner. With CC0 collections all you have to do is build it.  And that’s kind of what Web 3 is supposed to be, right? A free for all. A decentralized universe where everyone can contribute and you don’t have to ask giant centralized entities for permission anymore.  Final thoughts  I might have been a little harsh on both copyright and CC0, but the reality is that there’s no right or wrong when choosing a copyright license for your NFT project. It all comes down to what you are trying to build as a creator. Yet, BAYC proves that greater intellectual property freedom can inspire a community of holders to build on top of the brand. Although BAYC is not CC0-licensed, there’s no denying that the community’s contribution to the brand has significantly improved the collection’s value.  There’s no standard for commercial rights licenses, but they do have the advantage of giving you exclusive rights over the commercialization of the NFT’s artwork outside the blockchain.  Read the terms and conditions before buying any NFTs to understand exactly what you’re getting.  To end with something provocative, here's another quote from Frye’s essay:  “Ownership requires control. Pwnership says all you need is clout. The copyright market assumes that ownership without control is meaningless. The NFT market says pwnership of clout is plenty. Sure, you can make money off a work by selling copies. But it’s so much easier to just sell pwnership of a work when it becomes popular. And the NFT market is living proof that a market for pwnership is alive and well and living on the blockchain.”  This article is a piece of art too, I humbly submit. But don’t worry, you’re free to read it and share it.

Binance.US said Wednesday it will offer zero-fee bitcoin trading on its platform as it seeks to attract more users.  Coinbase will continue to face headwinds in the current crypto downturn, especially in light of Celsius and Babel Finance’s struggles, Mark Palmer, an equity research analyst at BTIG told clients in a note Wednesday. Palmer sees Coinbase being able to weather the storm given its larger size and being well capitalized.  “While we are not at all dismissive of the impact of the current crypto market downturn, we also believe any notion that COIN would be unable to survive this latest challenge is misguided in light of the facts on the ground,” Palmer wrote.

The firm mined 194.48 BTC and 189.26 ETH in the first quarter of 2022, bringing in $8.6 million in revenue, according to its unaudited quarterly earnings report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. In the first quarter of 2021, Bit Digital marked $43.95 million in revenues. BTBT also noted a $10.18 million net comprehensive loss for Q1 2022, compared with a $35.79 million profit for the same period last year. The numbers also mark a drop compared to the last two quarters of 2021.  The firm had to move its mining rigs out of China when the government banned crypto mining in May 2021. All of its rigs were in the U.S. as of November 2021, but under 40% was deployed as of March 2022.  BTBT's production in May 2022 suffered from an explosion and a subsequent fire at a facility in Niagara Falls, New York, hosted by Blockfusion. In the same month, a mine in North Tonawanda, also in upstate New York and hosted by Digihost (DGHI), had its power cut off because local authorities said it required additional permitting. Out of 1,580 rigs of Bit Digital's that were offline in North Tonawanda, 470 have been brought back online as per the Wednesday filing.  Bit Digital has moved to recover its hashrate in the second quarter of the year. On June 7, it signed a colocation agreement with Coinmint, leasing hashrate for at least one year. Under the deal, Bit Digital will pay for operating costs, including electricity and a fee of 27.5% of profit to Coinmint. On June 9, it signed a hashrate swap agreement with Riot Blockchain (RIOT), under which Bit Digital’s factory-new miners were swapped for Riot’s operational machines, hosted at a Coinmint facility in Massena, New York. BTBT will receive 0.625 exahash/second (EH/s) of hashrate from Riot, in exchange for 0.500 EH/s, according to the filing.  Recently, bitcoin miners have had to sell off their bitcoin holdings to pay for running costs and debt, giving up on HODLing strategies. To weather the storm, at the end of Q1, Bit Digital had $28.1 million in cash and digital assets holdings of 832.14 BTC and 266.71 ETH, worth about $17.4 million at today's prices. The miner also raised $21 million through a share sale to Ionic Ventures LLC between April and May of this year, the filing said, and has filed with the SEC to raise $500 million through an at-the-market equity offering.  Bit Digital is likely not affected by a moratorium bill on proof-of-work mining in New York State that is awaiting the governor's signature, since the company draws electricity from the grid and doesn't plan to file permit applications.

The layer 1 blockchain will become the home of the DYDX token, which is currently trading at around $1.50, according to CoinMarketCap.  The chain, which will introduce the fourth version of the dYdX platform, will be built in the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem – a community of interconnected blockchains that can easily communicate and trade assets back and forth.  In a blog post announcing the update, dYdX noted that having a standalone chain on Cosmos would provide the platform with extra flexibility around fees and features.  “A major benefit of Cosmos is that the chain can be developed to suit the exact needs of the dYdX network. One application of this is that traders would not pay gas fees to trade, but rather pay fees based on trades executed similar to dYdX V3 and centralized exchanges. These fees would accrue to validators and their stakers,” the post read.  Compared with most decentralized exchanges, which use automated market makers (AMMs) and liquidity pools to fill orders, dYdX will continue to use a traditional order book model with the new version of its platform. DYdX has long maintained that order books, which directly match buyers to sellers, are better suited to handle institution-sized transactions.",POSITIVE,DYDX,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | DYDX,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/22/crypto-exchange-dydx-to-start-a-standalone-blockchain,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

There have been many attempts to ensure the security of cryptocurrencies and its users and taking blockchain nodes to space might be a game-changer. Launching blockchain nodes in space provides an untouchable data center in space with a higher level of security because the data center cannot be accessed on Earth. Early this year, SpaceChain managed to successfully launch the mission of its blockchain-enabled payload into space onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The payload was incorporated with the space node created for Velas Network AG. It was installed onto a satellite that also managed the launch mission. It became a stepping stone for SpaceChain towards their goal of having a decentralized network of blockchain nodes. The nodes will operate from satellites in orbit while serving fintech and business applications. What are Blockchain Nodes? BlockchaiN, a distributed ledger technology (DLT), allows data to be stored globally on thousands of servers. It allows any network user to see all the entries that appear at any time, which makes it nearly impossible to gain control of the network. A blockchain node is the communication endpoint, which allows any user or application that wants to interact with the blockchain to do so through nodes.

42374562,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvvSnT,1655910269,"Digital Dollar Would Secure Greenback as Global Reserve Currency, Lawmaker Argues","A digital dollar would support the greenback's role as the global reserve currency, could support underbanked individuals and may be more trusted than another type of cryptocurrency, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) argued in a white paper published Wednesday.  The 15-page document, which argues the U.S. should create a central bank digital currency (CBDC), outlines what a digital dollar is (a liability of the Fed), how they compare to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or tether, some of the needs for a CBDC and the differences between wholesale and retail CBDCs. It also contrasted the potential safety of a digital dollar compared to cryptocurrencies.  The white paper comes as the broader crypto market settles into an extended downturn and conversations about a potential U.S. CBDC continue within the Fed.  ""A U.S. CBDC would have advantages over privately issued stablecoins and crypto‐assets, most notably the ability to be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, like traditional cash, and would provide holders with a degree of safety that may not be offered by privately issued stablecoins because of the risk associated with sponsors’ reserves,"" the document says.  Other countries are already considering issuing a CBDC, the paper notes.  The white paper also notes that a CBDC could pose risks to privacy or security, as well as broader monetary policy implications. Himes proposed the Fed ""experiment with a wide range"" of privacy and encryption tools to protect consumer data.  These experiments should include public participation, the paper says.  Whether a U.S. CBDC should be intermediated is another open question, as well as what its architecture should be.  Himes suggests a CBDC should use a semidistributed base, rather than a true blockchain or purely centralized back end. Intermediaries could access this network if they had a specific reason to.  ""A U.S. CBDC should be regarded as an alternative rather than a substitute for commercial money and payment systems. Therefore, the architecture and characteristics should not 'squeeze out' activity more efficiently or appropriately provided by commercial entities,"" the white paper says.  The white paper also argues in favor of a account-based wallet system, rather than a token-based one that has been advocated by groups like the Digital Dollar Project. An account-based system would require the Fed or the appropriate entities to conduct know-your-customer processes on the users of wallets, while a token-based system would prioritize token and transaction verification.  The Federal Reserve has conducted research into both the policy and technical aspects of a digital dollar for the past few years, but various officials have expressed reserves about it arbitrarily issuing one.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a report published by the U.S. central bank, said they want Congress and the Biden administration to authorize the Fed to issue a CBDC before the central bank actually feels comfortable doing so.  In a statement Wednesday, Himes said other countries have made ""real progress"" in developing their own CBDCs.  ""The longer the United States government waits to embrace this innovation, the further we fall behind both foreign governments and the private sector,"" he said. ""It is time for Congress to consider and move forward with legislation that would authorize a U.S. CBDC. I hope that this white paper will contribute meaningfully to that dialogue.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/22/digital-dollar-would-secure-greenback-as-global-reserve-currency-lawmaker-argues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38e883be53e92b7ec181dc13dd3edbd8ae2c23d7-2335x1751.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin holds $20,000 and altcoins retrace from yesterday's rally.  Market moves: Miners are selling their bitcoin holdings. Could this push the price down further?  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) is down 5% on the day after reaching a 24-hour high of $21,500 on Tuesday. BTC hit lows of $19,900 Wednesday but has since managed to hold just above the $20,000 mark.  Altcoins, which were up yesterday, have retraced. Solana (SOL) is down 10%, Avalanche’s AVAX is down 8% and Polygon's MATIC is down 8%.  Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is down by 5.5% over the past 24 hours, around $1,091.  Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, said that as the market remains turbulent, BTC will likely continue to oscillate within a range of $19,000-$22,000.  “This comes as liquidations are still prevailing and leveraged orders are dominating,” said Kssis.  Over the last four hours, BTC has remained above $20,000.  In traditional markets, stocks in Europe fell with U.S. futures and commodities amid warnings that the Federal Reserve's ongoing campaign to hike interest rates might lead to an economic downturn.  Futures for the S&P 500 declined 1.7% Wednesday and contracts for the Nasdaq 100 contracted 2%. This comes after U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday off their worst week since March 2020.  Market moves  Miners Are Dumping Their Bitcoin Holdings  Miners have a significant influence over the price of bitcoin. In the first four months of 2022, public mining companies sold 30% of their bitcoin production. Bitcoin’s recent downward price action and the deteriorating profitability of mining has forced miners to start liquidating their bitcoin holdings, according to a report by Arcane Research.  Bitfarms (BITF), a Canada-based bitcoin mining company, sold almost half its bitcoin to reduce debt. BITF sold just under half its bitcoin holdings for about $62 million. The sale of 3,000 BTC cuts the miner's holdings to 3,349.  Public miners only make up around 20% of bitcoin’s hashrate, but studying their behavior can hint at how private miners are behaving, according to Arcane Research.  The miners are some of the biggest whales, holding around 800,000 BTC, according to CoinMetrics, of which public miners own 46,000.  “If they are forced to liquidate a considerable share of these holdings, it could contribute to pushing the bitcoin price further down,” Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Arcane, wrote in the report.  “When looking at patterns from previous bull/bear markets, this type of behavior from miners is not surprising,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, Analyst at GlobalBlock, in an email.  In November 2019, miners capitulated on the leg down to $3,000.  “It's typical for miners to be accumulating during bull markets and selling in bear markets, as they need to cover interest payments due to being too highly levered, or they need to pay for power costs,” said Sotiriou.  Data from Glassnode shows that it is not just Bitfarms that has been selling recently. Miners’ balances have declined from the 2019-21 accumulation uptrend.

This search has been going on for not so long ago - from the trading week of 9 May. It was during this weekly candle that sellers managed to update the historical low. The FIL cryptocurrency began to form its downward trend in April 2021 at the earliest. However, the most aggressive fall wave occurred in April-June 2022. During this period, the FIL market had no weekly candles to close above the opening price. The trading volumes were as high as possible. The last local downward impulse was caused by a loss of control over the $17.5 range. Buyers kept this mark from January 2022. After losing control of $17.5, the FIL price fell by 71%. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UPnCDQqw/ Given the lack of a global bottom in this cryptocurrency, we do not recommend investing in FIL until buyers take control of at least $7.6. That is, until we see a rebound of the FIL price to about $10 and keep buyers at $7.6, we can not advise buying this cryptocurrency. Under the optimistic scenario and the retention of $7.6 by buyers, we will expect FIL to continue to grow with the next target of $13.7. This mark shows the global trend line of sellers.

42374557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvvSiR,1655906400,Ledger Launches NFT Marketplace and Services Platform for Enterprises,"Crypto hardware and security firm Ledger is launching a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace and Web3 services platform for enterprises, the company announced Wednesday at the Ledger Op3n conference at NFT.NYC. Ledger is also rolling out a suite of other products focused on Web3 education and security.  The company’s NFT marketplace, Ledger Market, prioritizes security and transparency. According to Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier, clear-signing, a process that helps NFT traders avoid scams, is something that has been lost “in the wave of Web3 innovation,” as proper security is “one of the industry's biggest problems.”  Ledger Market is partnering with brands, such as LVMH's Tag Heuer, NFT collection DeadFellaz and Brick/Babylon, to list their assets on the marketplace.  Ledger is also launching Ledger Enterprise Create, a platform where companies can scale their Web3 projects and securely move into the NFT space.  “Everyone's building NFTs like they were building websites in the 2000s,” Gauthier told CoinDesk, with webmasters and a lack of transparency between parties involved in the technology. He hopes Ledger Enterprise Create will allow “brands and creators [to be] completely in control.”  “What we want to do at Ledger is to accompany creators and brands throughout their NFT journey and to secure the whole stack from minting the NFT to distribution into production,” said Gauthier.  According to Gauthier, Ledger has 2 million daily active users and over 20% of digital assets worldwide are protected by its technology. The company launched in 2014 with a focus on bitcoin, and now has been entering the Web3 space with its recent product developments. In May, it launched Ledger Connect, a hardware wallet for users to connect to Web3 applications.  But before putting Web3 into action, Gauthier noted that it's Ledger’s job to help users understand the various technologies and how they can use them.  This is one of the reasons Ledger is launching Ledger Quest, a learn-to-earn Web3-focused game with NFT rewards, and Ledger Academy, an educational platform for users to broaden their understanding of blockchain technology and security.  Ledger is also announcing a Pro Team of celebrities, including Mike Shinoda, Deadfellaz, Dan Held and Bobby Hundreds, to be ambassadors of the company by educating their communities on Web3.

42411787,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzeH,1655905032,4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market,"The crypto market is experiencing double-digit percentage losses, with bitcoin (BTC) dipping below $20,000 in June 2022, its lowest price since November 2020. General market sentiment beyond crypto is also bleak, and has many investors understandably worried. But that doesn't mean you should throw up your hands and run from the markets.  See Also: Crypto Crash vs. Correction: What's the Difference?  So, what should you do instead?  1. Buy the crypto dip using dollar-cost averaging  It’s all too easy to be on the wrong side of a crypto trade when markets turn wildly volatile, but that doesn’t mean you have to sit there and watch your portfolio plummet by the hour.  Investors who have held back a reserve of fiat currency or stablecoins, or have expendable capital in their bank accounts, will have the ability to “buy the dip.” This common phrase used throughout the crypto industry refers to the practice of buying up an amount of cryptocurrency whenever there’s a significant bearish correction in the market.  Read More: What's the Point of Stablecoins, Anyway?  The idea is, if and when prices return back to their previous highs, the dip buyers will bank a nice profit. This echoes the infamous preachings of stock trading legend Warren Buffett, who once said “When there’s blood on the streets, you buy.”  While buying the dip can be done in a single trade, the most recommended strategy is to implement something called “dollar-cost averaging (DCA).” This involves breaking up your reserve funds into smaller tranches and making several trades over time.  For example, let’s say you have $1,000 in reserve funds. A good DCA strategy would be to break up the amount into five tranches of $200 or even 10 tranches of $100 and place trades using those smaller amounts.  The thought behind this is, it’s incredibly difficult to know exactly when an asset has bottomed out (reached the lowest price before reversing), so instead of spending all your money in one go, it usually works out better to buy a small amount and wait to see if the asset falls in price further. If it does, buy a little more, and so on.  Doing this will typically garner much better results than if you had invested all your capital in a single trade – unless, of course, you were lucky enough to go all-in at the perfect time.  Read More: Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget  2. Use indicators to find the best entry point  For investors that possess a basic or higher understanding of technical analysis – the practice of predicting an asset’s price movements based on chart trends, indicators and patterns – it’s possible to use certain indicators to gauge when an asset has reached a bottom.  Of course, no indicator is completely foolproof, but they can often give you a strong signal when to buy a dip.  A popular method is to use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator – a momentum oscillator characterized by a channel and a line that oscillates in and out of it. There are two key elements to this tool:  Overbought: When the indicator line breaks out above the channel the asset in question is considered “overbought” – in other words, overvalued – and usually signals that prices will fall back down soon.  Oversold: When the indicator line breaks out beneath the channel the asset in question is considered “oversold,” or undervalued, and usually signals that prices will rise soon.  While these two signals can be used alone to good effect they don’t always accurately predict bottoms or tops, particularly on lower time frames such as the four-hour, hourly or 30-minute options. A better method is to employ the RSI divergence strategy.  One thing to note about the RSI is it usually follows a similar pattern to an asset’s price, meaning when the price falls, the RSI indicator line also falls. However, there are times when the two lines move in opposite directions. This is known as an RSI divergence, and typically indicates the beginning of a trend reversal.  To spot a bottom, you will need to see if the RSI line makes a higher high while the corresponding price makes a lower low. Ideally, the RSI line will be near or into the oversold region on a larger time frame, such as the daily, to signal a strong reversal opportunity.  Below, we can see an RSI divergence on bitcoin’s daily chart (A) signaled a strong reversal in the trend followed by a rise in price. Three months later, another RSI divergence emerged (B), this time in the overbought region – signaling a bearish trend reversal that quickly followed.  Read More: 3 Simple Long-term Crypto Investing Strategies  3. Diversify your investments across different crypto assets  Just like it’s nearly impossible to accurately predict the bottom of a bear market, it’s also impossible to know exactly which of the 17,000+ cryptocurrencies will recover the fastest or go on to rally the highest.  One way to hedge your bets is to use DCA for a range of different crypto assets. This might involve reducing your trade sizes even smaller, but, in doing so, you’ll reduce your overall risk. Of course, it’s not enough to randomly select crypto assets and invest in them. You’ll want to perform rigorous due diligence first on each crypto asset you intend to buy and look for the following:  Previous all-time high: No crypto is guaranteed to return to its all-time high, but it can give you an idea of what sort of potential the asset has.  Past performance: Look at the asset’s price history using tools like TradingView and see how well it has recovered during previous crashes. Does it correlate strongly with the rest of the market, or does it regularly outperform other leading assets? Previous performance is no guarantee of future price activity, but, again, it gives you a rough idea of what might be possible.  Upcoming roadmap announcements: One thing that can assist in an asset’s recovery is the arrival of a major update or roadmap development. These can include things like a rebranding, a mainnet launch or a new partnership.  Read More: Kevin O'Leary's Crypto Diversification Strategy  4. Don’t freak out  This might seem like a no-brainer, but managing your emotions during bear markets is not as easy as it sounds. In fact, it’s often described as being the hardest thing to master when learning how to trade professionally.  Renowned American economist Benjamin Graham once said, “Individuals who cannot master their emotions are ill-suited to profit from the investment process.”  Read more: 15 Ways to Stay Sane While Trading Crypto  An important step is to recognize that fear and greed are powerful motivators and can often lead to making snap judgments that end in losing trades. Having a concrete plan in mind before placing a trade can make all the difference between making a profit or losing money. This can simply be a case of saying, “When I see a bullish RSI divergence on the daily chart, I will allocate X amount to the trade, and take profit at Y.”  Taking profit is another seemingly easy but incredibly difficult thing to master. Greed can often keep you in a trade beyond your take profit level in the hope the asset will rise even higher in price. This increases the risk of the trade moving against you, especially if you don’t set stop losses.  The crypto market is incredibly volatile and while you might be frustrated if you’ve missed out on the opportunity to buy the dip this time, another crypto crash is likely on the horizon. Make sure you take profits, ensure you keep some capital in reserve for crashes and remember to keep your cool when the bears move in.

26914,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=240669,1655904726,NEAR Technical Analysis: Price Moves Up To $2.5,"June 2022, for the NEAR cryptocurrency, will be remembered for an unpleasant fact - the loss of the global initiative of buyers in the market. Starting from 2 November 2020, the NEAR price has been moving upwards. Sellers have tried three times in almost 2 years to take control of the trend line of buyers. They succeeded for the third time. The weekly candle from 6 June broke the limit orders of buyers down and firmly secured below the mark of $5.2. This mark was kept for 4 weeks, starting from 9 May. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wea2EJnX/ During these 4 weeks, buyers could not do anything to realize even a small price rebound in the weekly timeframe. The result is the approximation of the NEAR price to $2.5. This mark is interesting because in May 2021 from $2.5 buyers aggressively began to slow down the downward trend. Although in the weekly timeframe, buyers failed to completely stop the fall of NEAR at this point, the momentum subsided and the price turned. Given the possibility of Bitcoin updating the local low even before the end of the trading week on 20 June, we believe that the scenario of the NEAR price fall to $2.5 is quite real. It is in the range of this mark that you can buy NEAR in the long run.

The Las Vegas-based company has already forged a handful of deals that bring crypto to retirement investors, most notably via Swan Bitcoin’s bitcoin individual retirement account (IRA). With more competitors including Fidelity making access to crypto retirement investing easier, Prime Trust’s effort is slated to accelerate with its bear market cash in hand.  Chief Financial Officer Rodrigo Vicuna declined to comment on the company’s valuation. He said the round has been in the works since late last year; some late-stage stragglers might even write checks in the next month or so. Prime Trust last raised $65 million in its July 2021 Series A.  The Series B comes as markets lurch into what may likely be a bona fide recession, crypto’s first. Sluggish user growth has forced other companies to pare back their spending or even slash headcount, making Prime Trust’s plan – grow, invest, hire – a little jarring.  Vicuna offered the adage of bear markets being high time to build. When asked if Prime Trust was stocking an acquisition war chest a la FTX, he demurred: “As a CFO, you can never say no to” the right opportunity.  “This is really a strategic investment to build out the critical infrastructure that helps us scale for our clients,” he said.

What constitutes a moveable, storable crypto asset is growing, according to Vicuna. He said the company is anticipating a surge in tokenized assets, like securities, real estate and NFTs, that can be represented and transferred across chains.  “The bulge-bracket banks really see this as the future, and so we’re building out” tokenized asset capabilities, Vicuna said. ”Really dynamic custodians can look at assets and say, ‘Yeah, we can safeguard that.’”  Prime Trust has been thinking about tokenized securities since at least its 2018 acquisition of the equity crowdfunding platform FundAmerca. Prime Trust has pitched it as an on-ramp and distribution vehicle for cash-hungry companies looking to access better liquidity for the trading of their private shares. It’s facilitated $3 billion in capital raises, according to the website.  “It's a smaller part of the business that we think will be more meaningful,” Vicuna said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/22/prime-trust-raises-107m-with-eyes-on-crypto-ira-tokenized-asset-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2fcb5419dcc572aaaddfbffb0b0627cdb6a1cf1-3405x2554.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The BOE deputy governor for financial stability appeared potentially open to making markets more efficient. However, Cunliffe urged caution over the kind of changes to U.S. trading rules proposed by crypto exchange FTX.US that would allow direct-to-consumer derivatives trades, rather than collateralizing positions through an intermediary.  Cunliffe told the Point Zero conference in Zurich that crypto innovations should not be used to cut corners on financial collateral – a feature he regards as a vital safeguard, even for near-instant trades, as it cushions the rest of the financial system from the impact of defaults.  “Margin is there to protect against counterparty credit risk,” said Cunliffe, who has led international work on stablecoin standards. “If the transaction happens in a nanosecond, then you have a nanosecond’s worth of counterparty credit risk.”  FTX.US' proposed solution would allow derivatives risk to be settled in real time.  “Margin is just ‘pay as you go’ for risk … rather than waiting until the risk crystallizes and see if you have enough,” he said. “What happens if you don’t pay as you go? … 2008 showed us what happens when prices move.  “I won’t go into FTX, but there's all sorts of interesting ideas there about collapsing margin, clearing and settlement all into one smart contract which could have tremendous efficiency,” he said.  Cunliffe expressed faith in crypto, saying the technology will outlive current volatility, just as the internet economy ultimately overcame the dot-com crash of 2001.  But he is more skeptical about trends in decentralized finance (DeFi), which cuts out financial intermediaries and poses a headache for policymakers used to dealing with centralized and regulated lenders.  “I don’t know if full disintermediation will ever be possible; my sense is it’s a bit illusory,” Cunliffe said. “What you would be saying to us is: Do you have the confidence to regulate the code, and that these basic risks that could disturb the financial system could be managed with the algorithm.  “At the moment I have the same confidence in that as in a fully automated pilotless plane,” he said. “I want to know where liability lies if the algorithm goes wrong and I crash.”  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began consulting on the FTX plan on May 10, with CEO Sam Bankman-Fried forced to justify the plans to an audience of largely skeptical traditional financiers.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/22/boes-cunliffe-cautions-against-2008-repeat-with-ftxs-derivatives-rule-change-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa65edf5f5369dafa55e8f9335c4fd17c8855731-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Crypto Incident Response hotline will function 24/7, and victims will be paired with a team of investigators from Chainalysis who will trace and label the funds in Chainalysis’ program. If funds have already been transferred or stolen, the Chainalysis team will “help liaise with law enforcement and asset recovery counsel.”  The hotline service is separate from Chainalysis’ analytical products. A spokeswoman for Chainalysis told CoinDesk that victims do not need to be existing customers of Chainalysis at the time of the attack.  Ransomware criminals had a record year in 2021, raking in $731 million in crypto payments.  According to Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research, ransomware gangs are only getting more sophisticated. The average ransomware payment jumped 34% in 2021 as criminals went after bigger targets, and it shows no sign of slowing down.  By initiating a rapid response and immediately tracing the funds, the program aims to make it harder for criminals to cash out – and easier for law enforcement to catch them.  According to a press release provided to CoinDesk, Chainalysis sees the continued increase in cyber attacks as a barrier to building trust in cryptocurrency.  “We’re investing in this service not just to assist organizations in their times of need, but also to help bring bad actors to justice and demonstrate that crypto is not the asset class of anonymity and crime,” the release stated.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/22/chainalysis-launches-247-hotline-for-crypto-crime-victims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8196ec80278d48572a52a0ad7e7f29e6aae9963b-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374558,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvvSkx,1655899090,"Voyager Digital Plunges on Three Arrows Exposure, Analyst Downgrade","Voyager Digital (VOYG) shares fell more than 60% after the crypto broker disclosed its exposure to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and said it may issue a ""notice of default"" to the crypto fund if it fails to make a loan repayment.  Voyager's exposure to 3AC consists of 15,250 bitcoins ($370 million) and $350 million USDC, the company said in a statement Wednesday.  Dubai-based Three Arrows Capital said June 17 it had suffered heavy losses in the recent market downturn and had hired legal and financial advisers to figure a way out, according to a Wall Street Journal report. 3AC invested over $200 million in LUNA tokens in February, an amount that is now essentially worthless since the Terra ecosystem imploded in mid-May, co-founder Kyle Davies told the WSJ. Last week, the company was reported to be facing possible insolvency after incurring at least $400 million in liquidations.  Analysts urge caution  Wall Street analysts have turned cautious on Voyager, and are opting to steer clear of purchasing shares until there's more clarity.  ""The 3AC exposure raises survivability questions for VOYG,"" Chris Allen, an analyst with boutique investment bank Compass Point said in a note to clients Wednesday. ""With 3AC contemplating asset sales or a rescue by another firm , it is unclear if the fund will be able to repay its outstanding loans and even if it somehow has the capacity to do so, we would expect it to take an extended amount of time."" Allen has a neutral rating on Voyager's shares along with a price target of $6 (C$8).  BTIG analyst Mark Palmer downgraded the firm's recommendation on Voyager shares to neutral from buy, while removing a price target (previously $11.60, or C$15). Palmer told clients in a note there isn't enough clarity on how the situation will unfold and it's difficult to value the stock right now.  The stock was priced at C$0.60 in Toronto as of 15:11 UTC.  Deadline for 3AC  Voyager, which has agreed to a loan from Alameda Ventures to secure its assets, initially asked for repayment of $25 million USDC by June 24, and then requested repayment of the entire amount by June 27, 2022. While several days remain before those deadlines, neither of these amounts has been repaid, Voyager said.  ""Failure by 3AC to repay either requested amount by these specified dates will constitute an event of default. Voyager intends to pursue recovery from 3AC and is in discussions with the Company's advisors regarding the legal remedies available,"" Voyager said.  ""The Company is unable to assess at this point the amount it will be able to recover from 3AC,"" it noted.  The two-part loan from Alameda comprises a cash/USDC-based credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million and revolving credit facility for 15,000 BTC. The loan will be used only if it's needed, Voyager said.  The company also has about $152 million in cash and crypto on hand, and a further $20 million that can be used only for buying USDC.

42393827,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbwR,1655897400,Ethereum's Gray Glacier (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Difficulty Bomb),"The crypto sector is rife with liquidations and layoffs, but Ethereum developers continue to chip away toward the Merge – the blockchain network’s upcoming shift to a new, more energy-efficient mechanism for issuing blocks and staying secure.  Ironically enough, the doom and gloom in the markets have coincided with an optimistic period in the development history of Ethereum. The network will soon shift away from its energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, whereby computers compete to issue blocks and earn rewards, and go to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which randomly selects “validators” to add blocks to the blockchain if they “stake” 32 ethers with the network.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  Ethereum had an encouraging Merge dress rehearsal a couple of weeks ago when its Ropsten testnet (test network) successfully switched to PoS. Testnets are networks that run in parallel to Ethereum and allow developers to experiment and test new apps without putting any real monetary value at risk.  Despite a few minor issues, the Ropsten Merge was generally considered a major success, and over the next few months, a bunch of similar trial runs will take place on other Ethereum testnets. If those test runs go off without too much of a hitch, Ethereum should, at long last, be ready to embark on its official Merge into a PoS network.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Wen Ice Age?  PoS has been on Ethereum’s road map since it launched in 2015, but the network’s plan to switch from PoW to PoS is an engineering endeavor without any real precedent. Ethereum maintains a market cap of $140 billion, and a screw-up could mean financial catastrophe.  With so much at stake, Ethereum’s developers have taken pains to dot every ‘I’ and cross every ’T’ in order to ensure the transition to PoS comes without any major hiccups. That caution, however warranted, has led to a series of setbacks for the project. The transition to PoS had been slated for as early as 2019, but every time the Merge (originally called “Ethereum 2.0”) appeared to be around the corner, the timeline seemed to shuffle back a few more months.  Read more: ‘Ethereum’ vs ‘Eth 2’: What’s in a Name?  Ethereum’s core developers will bristle at the suggestion that the Merge has ever been “delayed.” Technically, it has never had a concrete release date. But that is really just semantics. The Merge timeline has, time and time again, extended past most peoples’ expectations.  The Merge really does appear to finally be near this time around, but the road to PoS appears to be lengthening yet again this month with the announcement that the so-called “Difficulty Bomb” will be delayed by a few months.  As EthHub explains, “Ethereum's ‘Difficulty Bomb’ refers to a mechanism that, at a predefined block number, increases the difficulty level of puzzles in the proof-of-work mining algorithm, resulting in longer-than-normal block times (and thus less ETH rewards for miners). This mechanism increases the difficulty exponentially over time and eventually leads to what is referred to as the 'Ice Age' – that is, the chain becomes so difficult to mine that it grinds to a halt and stops producing blocks (freezes).”  The Difficulty Bomb has historically been used by Ethereum’s developers as an artificial incentive for implementing the Merge. Moving the Difficulty Bomb means issuing an update to the entire network – something that will need to happen anyway with the Merge, but is a bit of a headache for developers if not completely necessary.  As the Bomb gets closer, the network will slow down until it eventually becomes unusable.  On Ethereum’s biweekly “All Core Devs” call on June 10, a developer noticed that the Difficulty Bomb, which isn’t expected to completely freeze the network for another couple of months, had already begun to slow down block issuance enough that it has become noticeable.  As a result, developers agreed to push the Bomb back by 700,000 blocks, or roughly 100 days. This will give them a few more months to run tests and prepare for the Merge without the risk of slowing down the network for no real reason.  But if the Bomb can be pushed back at will, what’s the point?  Is the Bomb pointless?  Ben Edgington, product lead at Ethereum development firm ConsenSys, described the Difficulty Bomb as “one of Ethereum’s oddities.”  “In terms of acting as a forcing function for devs, I don't feel it really serves that purpose very well,” Edgington argued. “Having these Bomb-only forks is an illustration. We're about to do the third one in Ethereum history.”  According to Edgington, that the Bomb has repeatedly been pushed back (without any update to PoS) is evidence that it is not working as intended.  In Edgington’s view, Ethereum developers already have enough motivation to roll out the Merge. “We’re aware that there is a cost to not delivering: There's an environmental cost, there's an issuance cost, there's a not being on the most secure consensus protocol cost. You know, we believe proof-of-stake is better than proof-of-work in many ways. So there are real costs to not merging soon,“ Edgington said.  Not everyone agrees with Edgington that the Bomb is pointless. Tim Beiko, who leads the All Core Devs call on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation, explained to CoinDesk that the “Bomb is extremely useful for many reasons” beyond just being a forcing function for the Merge.  “The first reason that it’s useful is that it forces people to make an active decision about their participation on the network,” Beiko said. Each time the Difficulty Bomb gets pushed back, client teams – which build the software powering the Ethereum network – need to upgrade their code. The most recent Difficulty Bomb pushback will come with the so-called Gray Glacier network upgrade, which is slated for June 29 and will require all client teams to update their software before June 27.  Whenever the network is upgraded, client teams must coordinate to update their software in unison. If the teams don’t work together, they risk fragmenting – or forking – the network into two blockchains. In Beiko’s view, the “active decision” to update and push back the Difficulty Bomb is a good exercise for client teams, because they will eventually need to flex their update muscles again for more consequential changes, like the Merge itself.  “The second reason [for the Difficulty Bomb] – and this is one I think is probably way underrated – is the idea that it makes it a bit harder to create a scam fork of Ethereum,” Beiko said. “Two years or three years ago, there was, like, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Gold, all these forks of forks of forks. The reason in large part you don't see those on Ethereum is because they require not only a one-line change – like a lot of these Bitcoin forks do – but they also require people to run the updated software.”  Beiko thinks the Difficulty Bomb can help prevent scam forks because it makes spinning up a new version of Ethereum a bit more complicated. Unless the team behind an Ethereum fork has an engineer capable of altering Ethereum’s code to remove the Difficulty Bomb, the fork will eventually grind to a halt once the Bomb hits – rendering it useless.  Moreover, Beiko said, “beyond doing the technical change, you need to convince people to download it.” You can’t just re-skin Ethereum, remove the Difficulty Bomb and invite people over to your new network. Node operators – the people with computers that keep blockchains up and running – will also need to upgrade their software in order to support an Ethereum fork.  That means launching an Ethereum fork also requires building a community that believes in your project enough that they are willing to put in a bit of extra work in order to upgrade their software.  “I think that's really healthy, both because it limits the amount of low-effort forks, but if you do have a legitimate fork, which I think are very healthy for blockchains … it puts a minimal technical bar on what they need to do,” Beiko said.  What does this mean for the Merge?  Edgington and Beiko both agree that the Bomb’s pushback won’t have much of an impact on the actual Merge timeline.  Bomb or not, they say delays and coordination challenges just come with the business of building open-source software across several different teams and time zones.  “In this distributed development community, there is a tendency for timelines to get elongated – to get prolonged – because often you move at the pace of the slowest, and often decision making is kind of hard, so it's easy to kick stuff for another week or another week and it all adds up over time,” Edgington said.  “As long as we're mindful and we keep a sense of urgency that we need to get this done, then I think we are on a good track to deliver the Merge pretty soon,” he continued.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently predicted the Merge might be ready in August. Edgington predicts it will happen before Ethereum’s major developer conference, DevCon, which takes place in October.  Beiko, says something “catastrophic” would need to happen to prevent the Merge from taking place before the end of the year.  The Ropsten testnet Merge was a good indicator that a real Merge might finally be nearby, but the wait continues.

SHIB rose to the $0.000011 mark on Wednesday morning from the $0.0000074 level last weekend, posting a maximum gain of nearly 48% for investors, as per CoinGecko data. A large part of the jump came Tuesday amid a relief rally in bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.  The tokens fell to the $0.0000094 level at the time of writing as traders took profits amid a slowdown among majors.  Price charts suggest support at $0.0000082 and resistance at $0.000011 in case of a further bounce. However, SHIB is down 89% from its lifetime high, which was reached in October last year. The token had a market capitalization of over $5.5 billion at press time.  Analysts said speculative frenzy drove SHIB prices instead of it being a strong, fundamental-driven move.  “Recency bias suggests to investors that a bottom has been formed with Bitcoin and Ethereum this past weekend and that the market may be poised for a short-term recovery,” Edson Ayllon, product manager at dHEDGE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This kind of sentiment brings back confidence in speculators, which, because of the absence of utility, SHIB attracts speculation,” Ayllon added.  Kate Kurbanova, the co-founder of risk management platform Apostro, seconded the sentiment. “The reasons for Shiba Inu’s latest growth are somewhat hard to explain and come with no observable link,” she said.  “While retail investors might have been accumulating the token on optimism that Musk’s erratic tweet in the not-too-distant future will stir the growth of the digital asset, thus translating to gains in the long run,” Kurbanova stated.  Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is an infamous dogecoin (DOGE) proponent and reiterated his liking for the meme coin earlier this week. “I keep supporting [d]ogecoin,” he said, as reported, adding the was continuing to buy the token.  Some of this week’s gains on SHIB came as developers behind the prominent meme coin ecosystem released a proposal last Sunday that suggested changes to how ecosystem token BONE was used on the ShibaSwap platform.  BONE, a governance token and the main token emitted as yield rewards, would be used as fees to perform an action on the upcoming Shibarium protocol, a layer 2 protocol atop Shiba Inu that would support native app deployment and development.  Meanwhile, Ripple founder Brad Garlinghouse put the speculative nature of meme coins like DOGE and SHIB in focus during an appearance at the Point Zero Forum in Switzerland on Wednesday.  ""I have publicly said I think the vast majority of tokens will go away over a period of time because I can't figure out the utility,"" Garlinghouse said. ""There's some that were created a little bit as a circus rhetorical sarcastic. Dogecoin is a clear example of it was never designed with utility. The founders have left the project. It moves based on the tweets of Elon Musk.""  ""This is purely speculative.

42374574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvxEar,1655888064,Iris Energy Raises 2022 Hashrate Estimate to 4.3 EH/s,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Iris Energy (IRIS) has increased its hashrate expectation to 4.3 exahash/second (EH/s) for the year.  Previously, the Australia-based miner said its hashrate would increase to 3.7 EH/s of computing power by year end. The increase is because its site in Mackenzie, British Columbia, will be completed ahead of schedule, the firm said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.  Iris Energy was also planning to finish the construction of data centers in Childress County, Texas, that would house 3 EH/s of computing power by the end of 2023, and energize them in the first quarter of 2023, according to a May 11 investor presentation.  In the latest filing, Iris Energy hinted that its Texas site may be delayed. The firm removed its estimates for the completion of the Texas site, saying instead that it would ""continue preparatory construction activities"" so that it can ""scale up"" once market conditions improve. ""We expect to continue work at Childress to preserve optionality going into 2023 for our 600MW project in Texas,"" Lindsay Ward, the company's president, said in the filing.  A company spokesperson repeated the language of the filing when CoinDesk asked to clarify if the Childress facility is on hold. ""Iris Energy's contracting and procurement strategy in relation to construction activities at Childress allows us to take a prudent pause on major capital expenditure activities without incurring significant additional financial costs,"" the spokesperson said.  The bitcoin miner has already made a $130 million payment on mining rigs over the expected 4.3 EH/s, and has a contract to buy $400 million of machines from Bitmain.  Iris Energy also decided not to pursue any financing options to maintain ""balance sheet flexibility"" as market conditions deteriorate. Many miners have used at-the-market equity offerings and loans to fuel their expansion as they hold bitcoin. On Tuesday, Bitfarms said it sold 3,000 BTC for $62 million in part to reduce a rolling credit facility from Galaxy Digital.  Iris Energy will have $93 million in cash after it pays for the expansion to 4.3 EH/s and will continue to sell its bitcoin ""on a daily basis,"" according to the Tuesday filing.  The company said it has no ""corporate-level debt"" because all of its indebtedness comes from limited recourse financing that sits in the balance sheets of its wholly owned subsidiaries, meaning loan defaults won't force the entire company to liquidate.  The firm has $41 million in debt, according to data compiled in a June 14 investors' note by B. Riley.

The token will be issued in July and become the company's fifth stablecoin. It will join U.S. dollar-pegged USDT, euro-pegged EURT, offshore Chinese yuan-pegged CNHT and the Mexican peso-pegged MXNT that was released last month.  The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in May raised concerns about how stable stablecoins really are. While UST was designed to maintain its peg to the dollar programmatically, in contrast to Tether's stated approach of keeping near-cash investments that can be rapidly liquidated should the need arise, there have been calls for greater transparency about the quality and liquidity of those investments.  In April, the U.K. government said it hoped to become a global hub for crypto technology and investments.  “We believe that the United Kingdom is the next frontier for blockchain innovation,"" Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in the statement. “Tether is ready and willing to work with U.K. regulators to make this goal a reality and looks forward to the continued adoption of Tether stablecoins”.

Prices dropped to just over $19,900 at press time, a 4% drop in the past 24 hours and a 7% slide over the past week. The decline came as analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs warned on Tuesday that “recession risks were “not fully priced in.""  “The bear market will not be over until recession arrives or the risk of one is extinguished,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. Meanwhile, Goldman analysts said stock traders were pricing in a mild recession, “leaving them exposed to a further deterioration in expectations.”  Separately, Citibank pegged the probability of the global economy seeing a recession in the near future at nearly 50% as central banks “tighten monetary policy and demand for goods weakens.”  Supply shocks for basic necessities could push up prices and eventually cause an economic slowdown, Citi economists said. The team now sees the world economy growing 3% this year and 2.8% in 2023, according to Bloomberg.  Since Wednesday’s open, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has fallen 2.29%, Shanghai Composite has dropped 1.20%, and India’s Sensex has slid 1.29%. In Europe, Germany’s DAX plunged 2.9%, while the stock index Stoxx 600 dropped 1.56%.  Premarket futures on U.S. equities fell during European morning hours. Futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.70%, while S&P 500 futures lost 1.56%. Crude oil (West Texas Intermediate) futures fell 5%.  Bitcoin has tracked broader markets closely over the past few months, meaning a further slide in the broader markets could see bitcoin falling further over the coming weeks as traditional banks sound alarms on the state of the overall global economy.  Crypto market observers say a long-term recovery in bitcoin prices would take place only when global sentiment turns position and with signs of expansion.  “It’s foolish to forgo the wider macro context in which crypto and finance operate,” Andrey Diyakonov, chief commercial officer at Choise, said in a Telegram message earlier this week.  “Commodities market indicators and [European Union] bonds market meltdown spell out worrying predictions for the world economy,"" he said.
