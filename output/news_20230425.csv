42420730,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqdHZ,1682459721,"Bitcoin Regains $28K Amid Mildly Encouraging Tech Earnings, Liquidation of Short Positions","Bitcoin (BTC) climbed over $28,000 as investors seemed to respond to mildly encouraging first-quarter earnings from tech giants Google's parent Alphabet and Microsoft and the liquidation of a number of bitcoin short positions.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $28,250, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours. BTC had traded sideways most of Tuesday before its surge shortly about the time U.S. equities markets closed.  BTC’s late surge came as Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft both slightly surpassed analysts’ expectations and data from analytics firm Coinglass showed that some $11.3 million of BTC short positions had been liquidated since 4 p.m. ET. These types of short squeezes have historically tended to accelerate price jumps.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, followed a similar pattern and rose 1.8% to change hands at around $1,869. ETH slid as low as $1,804 on Tuesday morning, according to CoinDesk data.  Major equity indexes closed in the red Tuesday afternoon a day after embattled First Republic Bank (FRC) said in its quarterly results that it had lost $100 billion in deposits, renewing anxiety about regional banks. Last month, Silicon Valley and Signature banks both imploded. On Tuesday, First Republic’s shares plummeted almost 50%.  The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.5% and 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 1% for the day.  In bond markets, the yield on the two-year Treasury note sank 19 basis points to 3.94%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped roughly 11 basis points to 3.40%.  ""This deep into earnings season, it seems the outlook isn’t too bad and that should mean the [Federal Reserve] can stay on their tightening course with the risks of a June hike still remaining on the table,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note.  “After this round of earnings and the latest consumer confidence report, the one thing that everyone can agree upon is that personal consumption is going to be a lot weaker going forward,” Moya added.  In an email to CoinDesk, Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator Truflation, struck an upbeat note, writing that current macroeconomic uncertainties, including the ongoing debate about monetary policy, have again underlined crypto’s potential.  “This is the time for crypto to shine against all this adversity, regulations, compliance/obedience while the fiat world is struggling with debt, bank concentration and this shift to a multipolarized world with so much mistrust against institutions and lack of guidance and leadership from politicians,” Rust wrote.  He added: “If not now, crypto will just become another technology providing rails for the existing systems they want to subject to compliance so that incumbents can maintain and manage incremental transitions, versus leapfrog into a new modern age of financial innovation without middlemen.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/25/bitcoin-regains-28k-amid-mildly-encouraging-tech-earnings-liquidation-of-short-positions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9671b1d7488457d9192370d402ecbdd3c3ea9589-4452x2504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12098141,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528578,1682456412,"Cardano (ADA) Could Be Poised For A Bullish Breakout, Here’s Why","Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain-based platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum to address some of the scalability and interoperability issues faced by existing blockchain networks. Given the asset’s potential, ADA has gained a lot of attention in the crypto community over the years. However, lately, many investors and traders have wondered about the crypto’s next move amid the uncertainty in the crypto market. Cardano (ADA) Possible Bullish Breakout In the past week, Cardano (ADA) has seen some significant bearish price action. The asset crashed in the past 7 days with the price down by nearly 20%. This bearish trend can be attributed to several factors, including the ongoing downtrend in the market. However, despite the bearish trend, ADA may be poised for a bullish breakout, according to the asset’s price chart. On the 1-day time frame, Cardano has just tapped into an order block indicating a likely reversal (upward movement). An order block is basically the last bullish or bearish candle before the formation of a significant move in the market. It refers to a price level where a large number of buy or sell orders are clustered, creating a significant level of support or resistance. Large institutional traders, hedge funds, or other market participants who place big buy or sell orders at a specific price level create order blocks. An identified order block at a certain price level may be that price will bounce off that level and move in the opposite direction. In this case, ADA could form a reversal to the upside given the asset tapping into the order block at the $0.37 region. Though it is uncertain when ADA will execute the reversal, it could happen soon given the precision in the chart. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, ADA bears seem exhausted as the asset has only been down only 0.2% in the last 24 hours. ADA currently trades at $0.38, slightly above the above-identified order block price level. Should ADA continue an opposite direction to the upside and not invalidate the marked out order block. ADA’s price could tap into major highs such as the one at the $0.46 zone. Fundamentals That Could Contribute To ADA’s Breakout Technicalities aside, Cardano also has some fundamentals that could be a part of its possible bullish breakout. An instance is the Snowmantastic NFT project transition from the Ethereum network to the Cardano network. Snowmantastic has collaborated with over 200 projects in the industry. Its transition to Cardano could drive a huge amount of investors into this ecosystem, therefore, increasing the native’s token price in the long run. On the Cardano network, we can already see a similar scenario where the accumulation of ADA is on the rise. According to a chart shown by the popular crypto analyst, Ali Chart, on April 1, the number of large transactions on Cardano reached 4,000. By April 13, the transactions climbed up nearing 5,000. The analyst noted, Large ADA transactions are on the rise, suggesting that Cardano network activity is heating up as institutional players and whales make their moves. This is a bullish sign supporting the ADA uptrend!

The total proceeds from the deal is expected to be about $50 million for the debtors.  FTX.US purchased Ledger Holdings, the parent company of LedgerX, for $298 million in 2021, according to audited financial statements viewed by CoinDesk. Ledger Holdings also includes the crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, which said it would return external capital to investors in September 2022.  LedgerX's sale comes after a tumultuous auction process that included multiple postponements. A sale hearing was expected to occur on April 12, according to bankruptcy filings, but an April 10 filing said that ""the sale hearing regarding the sale of the LedgerX Business is postponed until further notice.""  According to financial documents viewed by CoinDesk, LedgerX generated trading and clearing revenue of $1.2 million and posted negative EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $17 million in 2022.  ""We are pleased to reach this agreement with MIH, which is an example of our continuing efforts to monetize assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders,"" said John J. Rray III, CEO and restructuring head of the FTX Debtors, in the release.  Miami International Holdings is a U.S.-based exchange conglomerate that owns several equities, options and commodities exchanges. It already holds the licenses to operate a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-licensed commodities exchange, having acquired the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) in 2020. Currently, MGEX offers just one non-index commodity futures product: North American Hard Red Spring Wheat. Miami's acquisition of LedgerX would allow the company to enter into crypto trading.  LedgerX was purchased by the U.S. entity of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and rebranded as FTX.US Derivatives. LedgerX holds three CFTC-issued licenses, which allow LedgerX to list futures contracts for commodities, provide clearing services and broker futures trades for customers.  After FTX purchased the business, some competitors did similar deals.

This pullback has left Bitcoin at a crossroads, with traders waiting to see whether the key support level of $27,000 will hold or break. However, Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and bid liquidity movement can provide valuable insights into market activity. In Q1/2023, a block of bid liquidity was identified in what appeared to be controlled by a single entity, which was named Notorious B.I.D, according to the research and analysis firm Material Indicators. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Bitcoin Rally 2.0 On The Horizon? This entity was successful in attracting more bids to fuel a Bitcoin rally, and the movement of bid liquidity became predictable over time. However, the game ended with a rug pull in the first week of March. As of this writing, according to Materials, there are indications that a similar entity may be active in the market again, with bid liquidity movement that looks similar to what was seen in Q1. While there is no way of knowing for sure if Notorious B.I.D. is back, it appears that somebody is using a large stack to play a similar game. One of the key differences between what was seen in Q1 and what is being observed now is that the buy walls are changing size. This could be a distribution strategy, as the large buyer seeks to push the price up to a higher distribution range and ultimately use those bids as exit liquidity. According to the fire chart of the Material Indicator, there is a substantial bid wall situated just below the $26,000 mark. This bid wall may have the potential to prevent a further decline in Bitcoin’s price shortly, but only if the $27,000 support floor is broken. Despite this, Bitcoin’s current support level has remained stable, indicating that there is a possibility of a rebound to higher levels. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Bitcoin’s price may bounce back to higher levels. BTC’s MVRV Reaches 11-Month High According to Gaah, a researcher and analyst from the CryptoQuant Firm, the MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio is a key indicator of market sentiment and can provide valuable insights into investor behavior. The ratio is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of Bitcoin by its realized capitalization, which is the sum of the value of all Bitcoin transactions since they were last moved on-chain. When the MVRV ratio is in the green quadrant, below a value of 1.44, it is considered to be in the accumulation zone. This indicates that there is decreased selling pressure in the market, as the realized capitalization of Bitcoin exceeds its market capitalization. In other words, investors are less motivated to sell their Bitcoin, as they believe that its true value is higher than its current market price. Gaah notes that the MVRV ratio reached a high of 0.82 in December 2022, when Bitcoin was still trading at around $17,000. This is the same level that the ratio reached in 2018, just before Bitcoin experienced a significant drop in value. However, Gaah believes that the current market conditions are different and that the MVRV ratio is a reflection of the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin.

42420727,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqdFV,1682451781,Bitcoin Could Be Poised for a Rebound,"Bitcoin’s third consecutive day of negative trading has aligned with technical indicators that suggest bitcoin’s price could rise again, at least in the short term.  Bitcoin's (BTC) price has retraced 9% since breaching the psychologically important $30,000 mark on April 14. Ether (ETH) has declined 14% over the same timeframe after peaking above $2,100.  A few things stand out, technically:  The $30,000 price clearly indicates resistance. Support or resistance for bitcoin and ether tends to concentrate around large whole numbers because traders usually place buy and sell orders at points that end in 0 or 5.  Bitcoin reaching $30,000 aligned with what at the time was the upper range of its Bollinger Bands.  Bitcoin’s trading range contracted to .0005% between open and close as it reached the upper range, implying that buyers and sellers were content with its price.  Bollinger Bands plot an asset’s 20-day moving average, and calculate two standard deviations above and below the average. As an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of the average 98% of the time, a breach of either level is considered an event worth watching.  In this most recent case, the breach occurred in conjunction with what is likely a psychological resistance point. Investors are generally most concerned with what happens next.  The recent decline accompanied an expected drop in momentum, but it also occurred in conjunction with a move towards the lower end of the Bollinger Band. The momentum drop shows in the decline in BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) from 71.54 to the current 42.53.  Between January 2015 and today, bitcoin’s RSI sat between 42 and 45, 163 times, with an average 30-day performance of 6% following the occurrences.  The future seven-day performance has historically been flat, with a mere 0.63% gain.  Meanwhile, bitcoin approaching the lower range of its Bollinger Bands raises the question of whether prices will decline below the mark or stay within the confidence interval and move higher.  Given recent history, technical analysts could expect BTC prices to advance, albeit methodically, back to their 20-day average. In a moment of technical alignment, bitcoin’s 20- day moving average is approximately 6% above its current price.  Meanwhile, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator has declined from 0.5 (Uptrend) to 0 (Neutral), further highlighting the recent pause in price movement.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/25/bitcoin-could-be-poised-for-a-rebound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c102414b0f2f25eb6edd297dcf4df924ad988bca-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another leg up against big banks | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why First Republic Bank Stock Shares Are Plummeting First Republic Bank share price falling is the result of a negative first quarter earnings report. The bank revealed that across Q1, more than $100 million in deposits sought refuge elsewhere. First Republic CEO Mike Roffler said the bank would be”pursuing strategic options” and “taking steps to meaningfully reduce our expenses to align with our focus on reducing the size of the balance sheet.” The steps include laying off up to a quarter of the workforce, slashing executive level salaries, and more. Typically, companies will hold a Q&A session with analysts, but First Republic ended the call, bringing back painful memories of the 2008 financial crisis, Reuters reports.

I intend to add more people from Signature’s operations team and some salespeople in due course.”  Fortress Trust, a regulated trust company with 22 money transmitter licenses, was formed by Scott Purcell, who previously oversaw digital asset innovation at Nevada-based Prime Trust.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/25/former-signature-bank-crypto-payments-chief-four-of-his-team-join-fortress-trust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b06688df59df9f3da83cd5ce95550bae173a87fa-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420714,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqd49,1682449750,Alejandro Navia: Building the Future of Tokenized Media,"Harvard dropout. Startup founder. Web3 adviser. Non-fungible token (NFT) enthusiast. Alejandro Navia seems a lot like your typical modern-day entrepreneur, but one who has a strong spiritual life and is willing to challenge the Web3 industry to consider life beyond the gadgets and screens.  Presently, Navia is one of the creatives behind the leading Web3 news platform, nft now, where he covers trailblazing artists and technologists. For him, Web3 offers two simple selling points: digital ownership and sovereignty.  Prior to nft now, Navia gained professional experience with leading media, AI and aerospace firms, including Verizon. He has also helped many founders and creators scale their businesses, raising over $92 million in funding.  Navia’s ardent interest in spirituality, plant medicine and mental health advocacy shapes most of his work. In fact, he has been actively vocal about the mental health crises in the creator economy, reaffirming the importance of mental health care in the next generation of creators.  “Web3 is definitely going through its own challenges in mental health. It's an industry that is on 24/7 and is derived from access to information … The promise of life-changing money [in Web3] is really something that can create addiction or create gambling-type behaviors,” said Navia in a CoinDesk interview.  As nft now continues to produce informative content highlighting the best talents of the Web3 universe, CoinDesk caught up with Navia to understand the future of tokenized media and why mental health in Web3 needs more attention.  The interview has been edited for clarity and length.  Apart from running a firm full time, you also have interest in psilocybin education, plant medicine and ocean conservation. How do you manage all of this?  It's very simple. To the outsider it looks like there's a lot going on, but when you actually start looking into it it really just comes down to a single purpose that I have in my life – to be of service. I'm very much aligned in terms of mental health and really bringing it to nft now. It’s about empowering the creators of [Web3] culture and bringing the technology from niche to mainstream. And we’re exploring the ways to do that in an effective way that tells the stories of others and empowering those who are the visionaries of the [NFT] space.  And when you think about my day, it's very simple. It’s about having a well-crafted vision, knowing what the purpose is, and then having the discipline to say “no.” Once you have your why and then you have your what, everything just becomes crystal clear. It's truly about making sure that you have the right systems in place, making sure that you're surrounded by the right people, the right team. I can't stress enough how much help I get from my team, my wife and my friends.  Do you think there are challenges that are exclusive to the Web3 and NFT industry that makes running a startup in it hard?  That’s an interesting question. Being an entrepreneur in startups is incredibly challenging. And being a founder in media and Web3 is also challenging. So when you combine all three, it's almost a recipe for suicide. So it’s incredibly challenging but also rewarding.  And the challenge that I'm facing is [in understanding] what the future of tokenized media is going to look like. Particularly because at nft now, we are not cutting-edge. We are the one’s cutting the edge. We're tackling a big issue that has been really plaguing the industry for about 15 years now.  Also, Web2 is broken. We know that very clearly. Even in journalism, it's all about the headlines, the clicks, the CPMs (cost-per-thousand views). And that sometimes comes at the cost of the community. People are now diluted down to a single number, which is traffic, and our identities are not taken into account for the things that we like. And so as a consumer there is this element of being blanketed by those concepts. People are no longer loyal to the publishing or the publishing houses. They're loyal to the headlines.  So the invitation here for us to tokenize media is [in understanding] how to flip that model and actually serve opportunities versus serving ads. How do we make sure that we are sharing the value that we're creating with our community? How do we incentivize the community and the reward systems that we can create?  And so this is why we launched the Now Pass to be able to begin this first step towards division of tokenized media. And Now Pass is the key that will help you unlock the Now Network. And the Now Network is this membership portal that allows you to engage with tokenized media and earn points that will allow you to exchange those experience points for rewards, access, merch, NFTs, events and dinners, etc. And so you really start incentivizing the community to take an overall active role in what you do versus a passive role.  Interesting. What is the biggest misconception about Web3 that you come across?  The biggest misconception is that we have been conditioned to have instant gratification when most people don't realize that it took us about 40 years to get to Apple Pay on your phones. And so the greatest misconception is that we have been conditioning society to think that everything should be working right away really fast.  Even in Web3, outsiders think that everything should be working efficiently right away, as fast as possible. But great things take time and technological paradigm shifts really take time. Remember, the internet was born in 1991 and it wasn't until the mid 2000s that we started seeing digital media become a thing. All the social media platforms we use today are probably around 15 to 20 years old. If they were humans they wouldn’t be able to get in a club. Think about it in that conception. Technological paradigms and shifts require time.  How can we address the mental health well-being of Web3 creators?  Web3 is definitely going through its own challenges in mental health, more so than ever. It's an industry that is on 24/7. It's an industry that is based on access to information. And the promise of life-changing money is something that can create addiction or gambling-type behaviors.  So it's really about being more open and destigmatizing the conversation. And making sure that it becomes a natural order of saying, “I'm not doing OK today,” or “I’m going through a challenging time.” And we're starting to see this in younger generations being more open to it. But there’s still a fine balance between being open to it and doing it for social media.  Apart from your love for NFTs, what else do you have in common with the other founders of nft now, Matt Medved and Sam Hysell?  Oh, we have a passion for storytelling. When we founded nft now we asked ourselves the question – what is not going to change in the next 10 years? That's a question from Jeff Bezos and I borrowed that question for us. And what we came down to is storytelling. Storytelling is not going to change in the next 10 years. It seems like the mediums will change, though.  We also have a lot of commitment to serving people, sharing and empowering creators. We want to bring technology forward and challenge the status quo, and do it in a fun, effective and camaraderie way. Honestly, we just do it with love. That's what we have in common, the love of the game.  If you had to sell Web3 in 30 seconds, what would your pitch look like?  The idea of Web3 is digital ownership and sovereignty.  Fair enough. What are you most excited about in the NFT space right now?  I'm excited that the NFT space is continuing to thrive in the bear market. I'm also very excited about the Now Network. I'm also excited about the future of tokenized media. And I'm excited for the nft now team to bring that future into reality very, very soon.  This makes me excited for you, too.

12096214,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528566,1682449221,Ethereum Staking Takes A Leap Forward: Here’s What’s On The Horizon,"Ethereum’s (ETH) staking ecosystem has made headlines in the blockchain space since the recent Shanghai upgrade. As the crypto market continues to grow, Ethereum has emerged as a market leader in staking, offering some of the best yields and attracting more investors. But what exactly makes Ethereum’s staking so attractive? Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Ethereum Staking Goes Big According to DeFi Ignas, a leading expert in decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum’s ETH has the best token economics in crypto. One of the main reasons for this is Ethereum’s decision to move away from the Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. He suggests that If Ethereum had remained on PoW, $4.7 billion worth of ETH would have been issued, more than the entire market cap of UNI, Uniswap’s native token, at $4 billion. This move has made Ethereum supply deflationary, creating a more valuable asset for investors. However, as DeFi Ignas points out, Ethereum’s staking ratio currently stands at just 14.8%, the lowest among major blockchains. This is despite offering a competitive ~4.5% APR. One reason for this low staking ratio is that other blockchains have a more concentrated token distribution, with insiders, team members, and early investors actively staking for rewards. According to DeFi Ignas, recent data suggests that the staking landscape is shifting, with some major players losing market share and a significant amount of ETH being withdrawn from staking platforms. In particular, Kraken, Coinbase, and Huobi have all seen a decline in their market share in the past month. Furthermore, 36% of all ETH staking withdrawals originate from Kraken. It’s worth noting that when there are more withdrawals than deposits, it typically indicates a bearish sentiment among investors, as they sell their holdings in larger quantities than they are buying. This is further supported by the fact that around 40% of all ETH stakers have a negative ETH PnL, meaning they are holding ETH at a loss. However, there is a silver lining to this data. According to DeFi Ignas, 29% of all ETH stakers have staked their ETH at the current price, which suggests that there are still many investors who believe in the long-term potential of ETH and are willing to hold onto their investments despite short-term market fluctuations, which for him, this is a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum staking. ETH Staking, The Best Risk/Reward Option For Financial Freedom? According to DeFi Ignas, Ethereum staking is poised to overtake decentralized exchanges (DEXes) by total value locked (TVL), with just 15% of all ETH currently staked across 83 protocols. Also, despite being a relatively new industry, the Liquidity Staking Derivative (LSD) ecosystem has already surpassed lending, bridging, and CDP stablecoins in terms of TVL, and it’s expected to continue growing in the future. Additionally, Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which enables “squad staking” by allowing groups to stake different amounts of ETH collectively, is another trend gaining traction in the Ethereum staking ecosystem. On the same note, the prominent crypto analyst McKenna has stated in a recent Twitter post that Ethereum’s staking rate has increased from 14.15% to 14.93% post-Shanghai, and this trend is expected to continue. McKenna predicts that ETH staking will become a major sink, with a staking rate close to 20% by the end of the year. The increase in staking is also a bullish sign for the future of Ethereum, as it demonstrates the community’s commitment to the network and its success. As more funds are locked in staking, the circulating supply of ETH decreases, creating a scarcity that could potentially drive up the asset’s price.

A substantive part of the $1 billion deal was allowed to proceed by the U.S. government in an April 20 filing, despite concerns the fine print of the contract would pardon breaches of tax or securities law.  The deal had been approved by the vast majority of Voyager creditors who voted, and by bankruptcy judge Michael Wiles. A committee representing those creditors in bankruptcy proceedings tweeted that it was ""incredibly disappointed"" with the news and was ""investigating potential claims"" against Binance.US.  Lawyers for the U.S. government, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, had sought to block the deal, arguing that some of the assets involved in the transaction, including potentially Voyager's VGX token, could constitute unregistered securities. VGX fell about 11%, trading around $0.3144 on Tuesday.  Binance.US' offer, originally made in December, allowed it to back out if the deal wasn't consummated within four months.

12094910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528507,1682445639,Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: aSOPR Retests Crucial Level,"The Bitcoin market may be close to a decision point as on-chain data shows the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is retesting the 1.0 level. Bitcoin aSOPR Has Declined Towards A Value Of 1.0 Recently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the BTC market had shifted towards a profit-dominated regime back in January. The “aSOPR” is an indicator that tells us whether the average investor is selling their Bitcoin at a profit or at a loss currently. The “adjusted” in aSOPR comes from the fact that this metric has been adjusted for filtering out transactions/sales of all coins that were done within only one hour of the previous transaction/purchase. The benefit of making this restriction is that it removes all noise from the data that wouldn’t have had any noticeable implications for the market. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1.0, it means the total amount of profits being harvested by the investors is more than the losses right now. On the other hand, values of the metric below the threshold suggest the market as a whole is realizing some losses at the moment. The 1.0 level itself naturally serves as the break-even mark, where the total amount of profits becomes equal to the losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been above the 1.0 mark in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 17, 2023 Historically, the aSOPR 1.0 level has been quite important for Bitcoin, as it has represented the mark where the transition between bullish and bearish trends has taken place. During bear markets, the indicator generally stays under this level, as investors naturally realize large losses. The mark acts as resistance in such market conditions, meaning that any attempts to break above it usually end up in failure. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘ESR’ Continues To Show Bullish Divergence, Will Price Follow? On the contrary, the 1.0 level acts as a support for the price during bullish periods, making sure that the indicator stays in the profits zone. Both these patterns can also be seen in action in the above graph, as the 2022 bear market saw the metric being stuck in the zone below 1.0, while the rally that started in January has observed it is in the green area. There was an exception last month, however, when the Bitcoin aSOPR sharply plunged below the 1.0 mark due to a sharp plunge in the price. It wasn’t long, though, before the metric (and also the price) returned back toward the bullish trend, implying that it was only a temporary anomaly. Recently, as the asset’s price has once again been going down, the indicator has also declined toward the 1.0 level. “With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point,” explains Glassnode. Related Reading: What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says It now remains to be seen whether the retest will be successful, and this level will act as support for the price, or if a break below will take place, possibly bringing with it more decline for the cryptocurrency.

The community is concerned that the quick activation of these big BTC wallets might be due to a security flaw affecting wallet private key generators and would adversely affect prices. Old Bitcoin Wallets Awakening The large BTC movements notably coincide with a sharp retracement of prices from recent peaks of $31,000. Over the last week, prices have dumped, moving down towards $27,000 and retesting critical support levels. Typically, how whales move coins between addresses and sometimes to centralized exchanges can impact sentiment, subsequently affecting prices. According to WhaleAlert, 6,071 BTC worth over $178.1 million was transferred on April 20. The sending address still holds 3,999.99999789 BTC and the last time it was active was on October 10, 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcycle Shows Small Drawdowns, Report A day later, on April 21, another wallet holding 1,128 BTC holding coins worth over $31.5 million moved 278 BTC. While big, the sending address was last activated on June 1, 2021. The latest movement, though recently moved as early as 15 months ago in mid-December 2021, saw 1,000 BTC valued at more than $27.5 million transferred. 💤 💤 💤 A dormant address containing 1,000 #BTC (27,456,958 USD) has just been activated after 12.0 years!https://t.co/lHrgCNWpbY — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 24, 2023 It has yet to be verified whether the 7, 349 BTC, worth over $201 million at spot rates, moved were transferred to centralized exchanges. Often, when coins are moved to centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, the community believes they will be liquidated; influencing sentiment. Old Wallet Private Key Generator Cracked? Will BTC Prices Fall? One analyst observed that the sudden transfer of huge chunks of BTC could be because of a flaw in an old wallet’s private key generator that has now been exploited. If an unauthorized third party gets a private key, they can recover the wallet and take charge of all coins held by the vault. If that happens, then old dormant wallets, including Satoshi Nakamoto’s, the founder of Bitcoin; can be compromised. Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to hold 1 million BTC, which he mined in the early days of Bitcoin before disappearing. There is a general belief that if the identity of Nakamoto is revealed and his coins moved, BTC prices may fall due to the fear of expected liquidation. However, that has not been verified, and none of his coins have been moved. Unless these wallets are somehow related to Mt Gox cold storage, then some old wallet generator has to have been cracked. We’re now at waay too many 10+ year wallets springing to life on multiple assets all of a sudden… — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) April 24, 2023 The situation making the rumor a possibility is that it is currently impossible to verify the true owner of the wallet. The pseudonymous nature of the Bitcoin network means it until the “victim” reveals their true identity and admits that their wallet had been compromised and their stash stolen, there is no way to verify if this was an exploit or if it was the actual owner moving the coins.

The Scale program was set up to accelerate the growth of blockchain and layer 2 ecosystems by giving them access to oracle services. Oracles enable Web3 systems to access off-blockchain data that can be used in smart contracts. The Celo ecosystem has more than 1000 projects, according to a Tuesday statement.  ""Our community’s goal in joining Chainlink Scale is long-term sustainability,” Xochitl Cazador, head of ecosystem growth at the Celo Foundation, said in the statement. “Developers building on Celo now have access to Chainlink's oracle services, enabling the next generation of highly scalable Web3 mobile applications.”  The Celo community voted in late March on a proposal to join the program, with 93 community members voting yes and three objecting. The community voted to allocate 5,980,314 CELO to the node operators, the entities that run the oracle infrastructure and help fetch data, to support Chainlink feeds on the Celo network over a three-year term.  Chainlink has been forming major partnerships lately for its Scale program. StarkWare, a creator of layer 2 blockchain scaling systems, said in February it was joining the program.

We’ll hear discussions ranging from global regulatory policy around crypto to how industry and lawmakers alike are approaching the question of privacy and privacy tool usage in crypto. I’m landing in Austin, Texas, today (Tuesday) – shoot me a note, maybe we’ll meet up. Reminder: you can still buy a discounted ticket, including a virtual ticket if you’re not in Austin.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Policy Summit  The narrative  CoinDesk is hosting a Policy Summit on Friday specifically focused on regulatory and related issues within the industry.  Why it matters  What is happening? That’s a question we'll be discussing during the week.  Breaking it down  It’s been a bad year for crypto. Celsius Network suspended withdrawals on June 12 last year, the day after Consensus 2022 ended. Since then we’ve seen a number of other bankruptcies, the collapse of the FTX exchange and increased attention from policymakers watching thousands of their constituents lose access to millions of dollars’ worth of crypto.  Since then the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has ramped up its efforts to police the sector, while U.S. bank regulators have begun issuing statements and guidance warning companies under their charge to be careful around crypto (to say the least). The European Union has finally approved the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) legislation that's been in the works for years, and member governments are soon going to implement the multinational framework. Regulators in places including Hong Kong and the U.K. are revisiting how they approach crypto.  There's also this sharp contrast between the U.S., where lawmakers are still discussing and debating crypto issues without moving legislation, and other regions where we're seeing firm laws and additional guidance tailored to the crypto sector.  We'll hear about all of these issues during the policy summit this week.  I’ll be moderating four sessions: one-on-one discussions with Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero; and our annual Lawmaker Town Hall with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.).  We'll also hear from Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis, Binance Financial Crime Compliance Head Tigran Gambaryan and even Captain Kirk, aka William Shatner.

The U.K. has been looking to construct a new regime for ""crypto – that one-time symbol of alternative rebellion – [that] has become more widespread,"" Pritchard said. In February the U.K. government's financial arm, the Treasury, launched a crypto consultation where it is seeking feedback from stakeholders on how to regulate the sector.  The FCA is one of the main crypto regulators in the country along with the Treasury, and it has been registering crypto firms to operate in the country. The consultation set out that the FCA may host a new authorization regime for crypto companies including overseas companies, which is ""an uncharted territory"" for the FCA, Pritchard said. It is also planning on launching a promotions regime for digital assets as well.  ""Let’s work together to shape our rules and regulations to benefit markets, consumers and firms as crypto goes from niche to mainstream,"" Pritchard said. ""Let us do it with our minds open to the potential gains and our eyes open to the risks.""  The FCA is known for being critical of the crypto sector, a stance not helped by the fact that crypto received by illicit addresses hit a record high of $20.6 billion last year, according to Chainalysis, or the collapse of the FTX exchange. The FCA has repeatedly warned consumers about crypto risks.  Out of the crypto applications the FCA got from firms looking to register with them 195 were either refused or withdrew, Pritchard said. Only 41 crypto firms have managed to register with the FCA.  However, the FCA has also started listening to the crypto industry at its engagement meetings with the industry, industry advocates have said.

The European Parliament last week voted on the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is set to offer a licensing regime for wallet providers, exchanges and stablecoins as of 2024. Equivalent bills in the U.S. have failed to gain political traction.  Europe is “showing us with Web3 they're ahead of the game of the United States,” despite the European Union’s stumbles on previous internet technology, McHenry said. “That should send chills up the spines of Americans, because economic growth comes out of that technology ingenuity.”  “That the Europeans have a technology-forward law line here shows how behind the United States is,” he added. “We should be the leader of the world when it comes to technology deployment, not running second to Europe.”  McHenry was optimistic about prospects for his bills on stablecoins and crypto market structure, despite criticism from Democrats. In the meantime, many crypto players have been left operating in a legal gray area.  During a hearing last week, McHenry urged Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler to take a clear position on whether individual crypto assets such as ether (ETH) constitute regulated securities or commodities.  EU officials have urged other leading jurisdictions to follow the lead taken by MiCA to ensure consistent global protection. During an April 19 debate, members of the European Parliament said the law would end the “Wild West” of unregulated crypto and restore confidence lost following the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  On Tuesday, MiCA also won plaudits from the U.K., where lawmaker Lisa Cameron, who chairs a cross-party grouping on crypto issues, said MiCA was a ""significant positive step"" toward regulatory clarity, which can provide a ""useful blueprint"" for the U.K.'s own crypto law.

Its price briefly touched $1.35 in the early hours of Tuesday. However, as of the time of writing, it is back down to $1.31. Arbitrum Still Has A Long Way To Go The ARB airdrop to DAOs has so far not had the effect on the price of the digital asset as expected, but that has not eliminated the bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency. Analyst Jack Niewold took to Twitter to share that he expects ARB to flip the likes of XRP. However, ARB is still trading sideways but this can also be attributed to the general market downtrend which has seen the majority of the market lose their gains from last week. If this slow momentum continues, then it is unlikely that ARB will meet the expectations for its price. ARB price continues downtrend after DAO airdrop | Source: ARBUSD on TradingView.com On the bright side, Arbitrum is still showing strength volume-wise.

UPDATE (April 25, 17:41 UTC): Adds denial from Poolin and WuBlockchain's details on the potential mislabeling of the wallet by CryptoQuant.  A mining firm moved $150 million worth of bitcoin from its wallet to Binance on April 21, according to CryptoQuant data, around the time the world's largest digital asset dropped to $28,000.  This marks the biggest outflow from a mining entity since December 2020.  CoinDesk wasn't able to immediately confirm the identity of the firm that moved the bitcoin.  CoinDesk reported yesterday that it was Poolin that moved the funds, a mining pool that froze users wallets in September due to liquidity issues, citing CryptoQuant.  On Tuesday, Kevin Pan, CEO and founder of Poolin disputed the data to CoinDesk, adding that the wallet address doesn’t match up to the company’s profile and activity. Meanwhile, news outlet WuBlockchain tweeted that it might be a case of mislabeling of the address. CryptoQuant couldn't be reached for comment.  While the data firm had originally mislabeled the wallet as Poolin's, they confirmed that the overall context is correct, meaning it was a mining firm that moved the $150 million.  CryptoQuant added on Wednesday that it was likely Bitmain-affiliated AntPool that moved the funds. AntPool could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.

The “Google for Startups Cloud Program” initiative, which provides support for startups and emerging projects, will now be offered to builders in the Web3 industry to scale their projects faster and more securely, according to a press release on Tuesday. Eligible projects from pre-seed to Series A, will be able to apply for the program, which includes up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits, over two years, as well as other technical support, the press release said.  Google, a Web2 powerhouse, has been pushing further into the Web3 world in recent years by helping developers use its technical expertise to build projects. Earlier this month, the Celo Foundation said that it was working with Google Cloud to offer workshops and cloud computing services to developers and Web3 founders building on Celo.  Last year, BNB Chain, a blockchain closely linked to the crypto exchange Binance, said it was joining with Google Cloud to support the growth of early-stage Web3 and blockchain startups.  “Google Cloud has been working closely with Web3 companies for several years,” James Tromans, head of Web3 engineering at Google Cloud, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “We are committed to supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, and the expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program to the Web3 community reinforces our goal of equipping blockchain developers with the tools they need to succeed.”  Other program benefits will include early access to Google Cloud’s Web3 products and training on latest cloud-based technologies, according to the press release.  The program will give projects access to capital from various partners, including a total of up to $3 million in investments from the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund. Eligible projects could also receive a $1 million grant from each of Google Cloud’s foundation partners: Aptos, Celo, Flow, HBAR Foundation and the Near and Solana foundations, the press release said.  “The expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program for Web3 means giving startups the ability to build on our fully managed, serverless platform, as well as the resources and community to be successful without creating technical debt that slows them down,” Tromans said in the statement.  The move comes as Google Cloud’s topmost competitor, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is ramping up its own efforts to increase its market share into the Web3 industry. In January, layer 1 blockchain Ava Labs said it partnered with AWS to accelerate Web3 adoption, and a month after, AWS posted that it's looking to hire Web3 staff for its cloud services.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | BNB,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/25/google-cloud-to-help-web3-builders-fast-track-their-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dca4a39e0f1b391a1bd59e2d6389fbe0bf2d1c87-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42393705,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2aWr,1682431142,Introducing CoinDesk’s ‘Consensus at Consensus’ Project,"This week, about 12,000 people will congregate in Austin, Texas, for Consensus – the largest and most influential annual conference of the global digital assets community. While sessions with boldface names including Chelsea Manning, Balaji Srinivasan and William Shatner are sure to attract big crowds at the Austin Convention Center and from virtual ticket holders, some of the most important conversations will be taking place offstage.  For Consensus 2023 we at CoinDesk are adding something new and timely: intimate group discussions in which a cross-section of interested parties – including developers, investors, government officials, entrepreneurs, and nonprofits – will seek solutions to the crypto industry’s thorniest challenges. Coinciding with CoinDesk’s 10-year anniversary, it reflects a commitment to use our convening and publishing clout to help the Consensus community move the industry forward in a collaborative and constructive way.  The 11 discussions will attack the most pressing issues challenging the industry today, including the newly urgent subject of regulation, finding the balance between privacy and transparency, how to bring self-custody to the mainstream and the future of crypto media.  Sometime after the event, we will publish the findings of the deliberations in CoinDesk’s first-ever ""Consensus @ Consensus Report"" intended to point a way forward for an industry that is rebuilding in the wake of a wrenching downturn. We're undertaking this project in collaboration with David Shrier, professor of practice for AI and innovation with Imperial College Business School in London and a founding faculty member of its Centre for Digital Transformation.  Examples of topics include: protecting the privacy rights of users while furthering the goals of law enforcement and regulators; making good on crypto’s early promises of individual empowerment and social inclusion; using the technology to address environmental challenges within and outside the industry; and building and governing new forms of digital communities.  We plan to make the discussions a routine feature of the conference, reinforcing Consensus’ status as the annual gathering of the crypto and blockchain community’s far-flung, disparate stakeholders where they collectively try to find common ground for the year ahead.  Given the many unsolved issues around standards, regulation and technology exposed by last year’s tumultuous downturn in crypto markets, we see this as a vital contribution for CoinDesk and Consensus to the advancement of the technology in the broadest public interest.  A variety of formats  Four of the off-stage conversations will be invitation-only and subject to the Chatham House rule, meaning the ideas conveyed in the room may be reported only without attribution. This is meant to give those participants whose institutions hold a tight rein over their public statements a safe space for candid, constructive discussion.  We’re calling these sessions “charrettes,” an architectural term defined by Oxford Languages as “a meeting in which all stakeholders in a project attempt to resolve conflicts and map solutions.” In the spirit of openness that defines the crypto community at its best, during the conference select representatives from the charrettes will take the stage to share and discuss the takeaways from their conversations.  Participants in the charrettes were chosen by CoinDesk’s content staff, drawing, in part, on the recommendations of an advisory council.  Four other discussions, known as brainstorms, will be Town Hall-style sessions open to all Consensus attendees with invited speakers leading the conversations. Three others, known as convenings, will have a hybrid structure, combining roundtable discussions with interactive discussions.  A select group of CoinDesk staff will be assigned to listen to each of these discussions and then summarize and synthesize the takeaways in the ""Consensus @ Consensus Report"", scheduled for publication on June 5.  It’s a challenging but exciting time for the industry, buffeted like never before by economic, political and technological change. At CoinDesk, we don’t tell people how to address these challenges but believe that by encouraging frank, constructive multi-stakeholder dialogue like this we can help foster a collective effort to do so in the interests of humanity.  The conversations  Here’s a breakdown of the 11 sessions:  How Does Crypto Improve its Image? There’s no question the crypto industry is viewed less favorably than in 2021. Beyond the obvious – i.e., stop defrauding people – what, if anything, can be done to better market the technology to a skeptical public?  The Digital Future of Public Money: The evolution of public money is rapidly accelerating as countries around the globe explore central bank digital currencies (CBDC). But critical questions about privacy, financial inclusion, global standards, interoperability and the role of private sector stablecoins remain.  Reimagining the Content Economy: How to Restore Choice, Agency and Engagement for Consumers, Creators, Publishers and Brands: The Web2 economy is dominated by centralized platforms that sit between creators/publishers and users, hoovering up vast amounts of data on both. The Web3 idea that creators can directly engage with their audiences promises to change all that and opens new business models. What must happen for non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other such tools to live up to this potential?  Crypto’s Environmental Conundrum: How Can Blockchain Accelerate ESG and Protect the Planet? There’s been a heady debate over Bitcoin’s carbon footprint and whether it can drive renewable energy development. But there are also many projects using tokens and blockchain-based data-sharing to help businesses, investors, nongovernment organizations (NGO) and users coordinate climate action. Can these different stakeholders converge on a holistic approach?  The Quest for a Global Regulatory Framework: Supra-national organizations including the International Monetary Fund, Financial Action Task Force, Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board are calling for worldwide regulatory standards for crypto, to stop wily actors from migrating to the most permissive jurisdictions. Is such uniformity politically feasible? Is it even desirable? (Invitation only.)  Privacy, Transparency and Law Enforcement: Where is the Path to Equilibrium? Law enforcement, financial regulators and the taxman want to make even the smallest crypto transactions legible, but users want privacy. What is the appropriate balance? (Invitation only.)  No More FTXs: Finding the Right Tech and Policies for Self-Custody to Go Mainstream: FTX and other exchange bankruptcies have underscored the danger to users of trusting centralized entities with the keys to their crypto. But custodying your own keys has a serious adoption problem, for myriad reasons. How can policymakers create effective guardrails for consumer protection without undermining crypto’s empowering attributes? (Invitation only.)  Can (and Should) DeFi Defy the Regulators? Without the traditional middlemen to deputize, regulators are struggling to figure out how to police decentralized finance, a sector which has held up during the crypto winter but which continues to suffer from software breaches, bugs and rug-pulls. Is the traditional regulatory model appropriate for decentralized finance (DeFi), or should policymakers work with the industry on software standards to protect users? (Invitation only.)  Brainstorm: From New Currencies to New Societies: The Way Forward for DAOs, Network States and NFT Communities: Builders of new types of communities – online, IRL and hybrids – roll up their sleeves and discuss how they’ve addressed challenges from 60,000-foot strategy to immediate on-the-ground tactics in a zero-trust world with high trust expectations.  Brainstorm: Grassroots Innovation: Realizing Crypto’s Empowerment Promise for Social Inclusion: Crypto advocates often talk up the technology’s social impact but its potential has been hindered by clunky user experiences and a bias in funding toward fast-buck-making ventures.

It comes at a time when the SHIB price is facing a make-or-break moment, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Exciting Updates For The Shiba Inu Community? The lead developer was responding to a user of the group who pointed out that the last Medium update on the ongoing development of the layer 2 network was made a while ago. Kusama responded that the project is progressing rapidly and that members of the Shiba Inu community already have plenty of updates: I think the army has plenty of updates as the chain activity and all the tokens are very public. We’re in go mode, not bro mode. What exactly Kusama means by this can only be speculated. In the last medium update on Shibarium, he announced that the layer-2 technology will be released on the mainnet before the end of 2023. However, an exact date is not yet known. The latest comment by Kusama suggests that significant progress is currently being made towards the mainnet launch. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Faces Make-Or-Break Moment On the other hand, the Shiba Inu lead developer could just be hinting at the progress being made throughout the ecosystem. Bone Shibaswap (BONE), the governance token of the Shibaswap ecosystem, recently received a listing from the major crypto exchange OKX. In addition, Kusama recently announced the forthcoming release of ShibaSwap 2.0 in a Telegram message. Remarkably, it is not uncommon for Kusama to use metaphors to announce progress in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Even before the launch of the beta version of Shibarium, the developer posted numerous encrypted messages. Just yesterday, Kusama stated that he was working with Shiba Inu team members to achieve “the impossible.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales On Buying Spree, Add 311 Billion Tokens During Price Dip SHIB Price Still Faces Make-Or-Break Moment The deep correction in the crypto market has caused the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price to break down an ascending triangle pattern that has been developing since early March. Now SHIB is trading near the crucial support level at $0.00001005. If SHIB breaks this level to the downside as well, the uptrend that started earlier this year would be in jeopardy. SHIB needs to stay in the trading range between $0.00001005 and $0.00001151 to avoid a break of the trend in the higher time frame. If the bulls fail to defend the trading range, a decline to $0.00000965 would be the most likely scenario before SHIB could possibly fall back to the $0.00000855 price level. Currently, a symmetrical triangle pattern has formed in the 2-hour chart. An upward breakout towards the middle part of the aforementioned trading range is key (near $0.00001096). Otherwise, a break to the lower levels could be next.

Let’s Examine The Metrics,"AVAX, the native token of Avalanche blockchain, has been making headlines lately as the Avalanche NFT transfers soared to record figures in the month of April alone. As the blockchain world continues to expand, the surge in NFT transfers on the Avalanche network raises a burning question – Will this help AVAX price go up? Let’s explore the possibilities. Related Reading: Total Ethereum (ETH) Locked Hits New Highs On Increase In Deposits Over Withdrawals AVAX NFT Collections, dApps Gain Traction On Avalanche Network The AVAX token is set to benefit from the latest surge in NFT transfers on the Avalanche network, which has seen over 2 million NFT transfers in April alone, five times greater than March. This trend can be attributed to the blockchain’s fast and low-cost transactions and scalable platform, which has made it a preferred choice for NFT creators and collectors. $AVAX NFTs are smashing records! In April alone, the @avax network recorded over 2 million transfers — 5 times more than the previous month of March! pic.twitter.com/3z59MkGUc3 — Emperor Osmo🧪 (@Flowslikeosmo) April 23, 2023 The surge in Avalanche NFTs can also be traced to the popularity of blue-chip AVAX NFT collections such as Chikn and Doggerinos, which have experienced significant volume spikes in recent months, according to AVAX NFT Stats. The growing interest in the Avalanche network has also translated into a rise in activity on dApps such as Trader Joe, a leading DEX on the network. As a result, the Avalanche network has seen a substantial increase in transaction volume and quantity, suggesting that AVAX is poised to gain further traction in the blockchain and crypto space. In the past month, Trader Joe has seen a 184% surge in the number of unique active wallets on its platform, reflecting the increasing demand for decentralized trading on the network. The future appears promising for the AVAX token, as more users explore the platform’s potential for NFTs and dApps. So-So Performance By AVAX The AVAX token’s performance has been somewhat lackluster in recent days. Over the past week, the price of AVAX has experienced a substantial decline of 20.65% according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this, it has managed to gain 1.17% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $16.97. Source: CoinMarketCap The mixed results on the Avalanche network suggest that while there is growing interest in NFTs and dApps, there are still challenges to overcome. The decline in active addresses may be a reflection of users exploring other platforms or simply taking a break from trading on the network.

42393697,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2Zmh,1682428045,DeFi Protocol DFlow Raises $5.5M to Bring Payment for Order Flow to Crypto,"Decentralized-finance protocol DFlow has raised $5.5 million in a financing round led by crypto venture-capital firm Framework Ventures, the project said on Tuesday.  Other investors included Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Cumberland, Wintermute Ventures, Spartan Group and ZeePrime. DFlow previously raised $2 million in a seed funding round in early 2022.  DFlow is a DeFi protocol that allows market makers to purchase order flow directly from wallet applications, with the guarantee that the market maker will provide execution at the best price. DFlow defines best price as the best public price aggregated against both centralized and decentralized exchanges.  The firm says current crypto trading is costly for retail customers and lacks the execution quality characteristic of traditional equities markets.  “If you look at equities markets, retail investors don’t trade directly on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), they trade on Robinhood against market makers, who may hedge on NYSE,” said DFlow founder and CEO Nitesh Nath, who previously worked as a quant researcher at Chicago-based trading giant DRW.  “We’re improving that system in crypto, but the high-level ideas are similar. [The difference is] with the DFlow model, the process by which market makers are selected is decentralized in an open/fair auction and the barriers to entry are drastically lowered,"" he said.  With stocks, brokerages such as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) strike deals with institutional market makers like Citadel Securities to sell them order flow from retail investors. The practice, called ""payment for order flow,"" came under scrutiny during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the GameStop (GME) trading frenzy last year.  With the crypto version of that practice, market makers would place bids with wallet applications for the privilege of trading against trades placed through the wallet. DFlow says blockchain technology would bring transparency to the “black box” process of payment for order flow, because the market-maker auctions would be visible on-chain and enforced by smart contracts. It will also introduce an open-source reputation tracking algorithm to score market markers, meaning the public can review the criteria used to select market makers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/25/defi-protocol-dflow-raises-55m-to-bring-purchase-order-flow-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/425d67a7d6e5b13cf111af8b9e618e6687a97aca-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon Exchange Supply Rises As Whale Makes 60 Million MATIC Deposit According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, around 7.92% of the entire MATIC circulating supply is on exchanges now. The relevant indicator here is the “supply on exchanges,” which measures the percentage of the total Polygon supply that’s currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are currently depositing a net number of coins into exchanges right now. Since one of the main reasons why holders may transfer their MATIC to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the price of the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator imply withdrawals are taking place on exchanges currently. Such a trend may be a sign that investors are accumulating the asset at the moment, and hence, can be bullish for the price in the long term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Polygon supply on exchanges over the last few months: The value of he metric seems to have sharply risen in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Polygon supply on exchanges (colored in red) has seen a sharp jump during the past day, suggesting that these platforms have received a large amount of the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘ESR’ Continues To Show Bullish Divergence, Will Price Follow? In total, this inflow spike saw around 60 million MATIC entering the wallets of the exchanges. The source of this deposit looks to have been a single whale entity, which is in fact one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert has also caught the transfer and has revealed that the transaction was coming from a wallet attached to the Polygon staking service, and its destination was the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. 🚨 🚨 🚨 60,000,000 #MATIC (59,472,041 USD) transferred from Polygon Staking to #Binancehttps://t.co/2m1PJNgY2a — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 24, 2023 After this inflow, the MATIC supply on exchanges has risen to around 7.92%, which is a five-week high for the indicator. From the chart, it’s visible that this spike has only come after the cryptocurrency’s price has taken a sharp hit. Generally, whales make such deposits to sell when prices are high. However, the odd timing of this deposit may be a sign that this humongous holder thinks the decline would only extend in the near term, hence why they have decided to sell here. Related Reading: What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says This would only be true, of course, if the whale truly intends to sell with this deposit. It’s possible that the transfer has only been made to utilize some of the other services offered on platforms like these, in which case, the price would probably feel only a neutral effect from the deposit.

The main company was valued at $10 billion during a $200 million fundraising round in early 2022. The bear market has since crept in, however, and all but stalled investments, and yet Alchemy continues to back early-stage investors.  Alchemy Ventures invests off the main company’s balance sheet and every dollar put out has to tie back to the top-level goals for the Alchemy ecosystem, Alchemy Ventures head Paul Almasi told CoinDesk in an interview.  The venture arm isn’t as return-focused as a traditional venture-capital fund. While returns are still important, the firm has three other primary goals: attracting early-stage founders to the Alchemy ecosystem, gathering strategic intelligence to make better decisions and hiring more people through acquihires or full acquisitions.  “It’s very important for us that we want to align ourselves with Web3 missionaries, not mercenaries,” Almasi said.  Investment strategy  Alchemy Ventures invests across blockchains and use cases, but its areas of particular interest include end-user applications and infrastructure or developer tools that help drive end-user adoption.  “We felt strongly that the ideas and products that are going to define Web3 for the next 20 years are going to be built in the next two to three years. So we have to do everything in our power to help make that happen,” Almasi explained. “And for us being an infrastructure platform, we strongly believe that those ideas are going to be brought to life by developers.”  Alchemy Ventures invests an average of $150,000 to $250,000 per company, and about three-quarters of the investments are in pre-seed or seed-stage rounds. The firm offers operational support, including early product feedback, customer introductions to help validate the product’s market fit and recruiting, Almasi said. Alchemy Ventures is also preparing to launch Alchemy Connect in the coming weeks, a full-service platform and social network of sorts for founders.  Alchemy Ventures has made 84 investments to date across two portfolio tracks. The first track is it core business of paying cash for equity. The other track is its accelerator program under which Alchemy offers credits from itself and from third parties like Amazon Web Services in exchange for equity. Forty-six of the firm’s portfolio companies have gone through the accelerator side.  “Right now, founders need a lot of help, so this accelerator portfolio is really a white-glove, immersive program that removes the biggest costs that come with finding product market fit in Web3 – outside of human costs – which are infrastructure costs,” Almasi said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/25/alchemys-venture-arm-wants-to-align-with-web3-missionaries-not-mercenaries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c7a0b6838ed52daca6e25834edf1eaa6824f0e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) asked a federal court on Monday to force the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to respond to a petition it filed last year asking for formal rules for digital assets, in particular whether existing securities laws apply to digital assets. The move comes after the SEC warned Coinbase last month that it expected to sue the exchange over allegations of listing and offering unregistered securities.  Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average is in focus after the cryptocurrency fell 11% from a 10-month high of $31,000 it hit last week. The decline has brought attention to bitcoin's 50-day simple moving average, which now sits at $27,244. According to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, a potential violation of the 50-day SMA support would challenge bullish market sentiment. ""The market has erased its previous growth momentum and is now testing the strength of the medium-term uptrend in the form of the 50-day moving average,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email. ""A break below this would call into question the bull market's strength, while a consolidation below $26,600 could be the prologue to a more profound decline.""  The U.K.'s Standard Chartered Bank said crypto winter is finally over and bitcoin has the potential to reach $100,000 by year end. The climb to six figures could be driven by a number of factors, including the recent banking-sector crisis that helped to “re-establish bitcoin’s use as a decentralized scarce digital asset,” the bank said in a report on Monday. “Against this backdrop, bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance,” analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote. Bitcoin has gained 65% since the start of the year.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 90-day moving average of the flow of bitcoin out of and into centralized exchanges.  The metric has flipped positive this year, indicating net inflows, perhaps a sign of investors looking to liquidate holdings or use coins for margin trading.  ""So far in 2023, there has been a slight net influx of BTC onto exchanges, but it pales in comparison to the influx of 2019,"" analysts from Blockware Solutions said.  ""2022 featured the largest net exodus in exchange balances of all time. The previous largest next exodus in 2020 preceded a parabolic bull run,"" the analysts added.

42393711,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2bBt,1682424300,Bitcoin-Tether Pair Is Most Liquid on Binance Even as TUSD Pair Sees Higher Volume,"Trading volume on Binance of bitcoin (BTC) denominated in ArchBlock's dollar-pegged stablecoin trueUSD (TUSD) has surged over the past four weeks after the crypto exchange introduced zero trading fees in the pair on March 23 while simultaneously reintroducing fees for all other pairs.  Still, the trade denominated in tether (USDT), the largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market value, remains the most liquid, allowing large orders to execute with relatively less impact on the cryptocurrency's price than the TUSD trade.  ""Market depth data on Binance shows us that BTC-USDT is still king from a liquidity standpoint, with market makers evidently more comfortable with exposure to Tether over TUSD,"" Conor Ryder, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a market update last week.  Liquidity conditions are commonly assessed with the help of a metric called market depth – a collection of buy and sell offers within 1% or 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.  The more significant the depth, the more liquid an asset is said to be and the less the slippage. Slippage is the difference between the expected price at which a trade is placed and the actual price at which the transaction is executed. Slippage usually occurs when there is low market liquidity or high volatility.  The chart shows liquidity in BTC/USDT was $30 million at the 1% depth last week or 200% greater than $10 million in BTC/TUSD. In other words, traders might be better off executing large orders in the BTC/USDT pairs than the BTC/TUSD pair.  TUSD's market depth has improved sharply from practically zero to $10 million in a month, surpassing BUSD to become the second-most liquid pair on Binance.  The BTC-TUSD pair accounted for 50% of the total bitcoin market volume on Binance last week.  ""For as long as zero-fee trading lasts on BTC-TUSD, TUSD needs to be considered a top stablecoin in crypto, whether people like it or not. Similar to how Binance favored BUSD, TUSD is the benefactor of increased volumes now, even if the reasons why Binance granted TUSD this gift are unclear,"" Ryder said.",NEUTRAL,TUSD,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | TUSD,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/25/bitcoin-tether-pairs-most-liquid-on-binance-even-as-tusd-pairs-see-higher-volumes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b4fb6d42e912a59c711e2fdc1e552dcf931c2fe-3960x2040.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

From April 19, 2023, it moved into a downtrend gradually to its current price level of $0.966 today. The recent price volatility and decline experienced by Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to have a ripple effect on other tokens in the market. However, MATIC remains above its January 1 price of $0.76 despite the decline, holding onto most of its gains. Nevertheless, a sweep of previous lows remains possible if the bears maintain their charge. Investors and the general crypto market hope the current decline is a minor correction, not a downtrend similar to the crypto winter of 2022. Will MATIC Pivot Off The $0.9321 Critical Support Level? Some major cryptocurrencies are in a downtrend, excluding a few altcoins with minor gains. The impending US rate hikes and other factors, such as rising bitcoin mining difficulty, could affect the market negatively.

Also, with the recent upgrades, users can create Optimistic Rollup chains and ZK Rollup chains as required by the developer. Its multi-functionality is one of the reasons its community is optimistic about a rally in the coming weeks. MATIC is in a downtrend forming a third consecutive red candle on the daily chart with lower lows. It has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish trend in the short and long term. MATIC moved into the downtrend on April 19, forming a long red candle that closed below the 50-day SMA. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 31.91, descending into the oversold region of 30. It implies that the bears are in control of the asset’s price. However, MATIC is approaching the $0.9321 support level, which previously acted as a pivot point on January 1, 2023. MATIC’s RSI will move to the oversold region when its touches this level forcing the bulls to rally again. Expect a price increase once the asset enters the overbought zone.

42393723,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2ah7,1682424000,Web3 Entertainment Studio Toonstar to Release NFT-Backed TV Series ‘Space Junk’,"Web3 entertainment company Toonstar will soon release a new non-fungible token (NFT)-backed animated television show called “Space Junk.”  The comedy series, a story about trash collectors in space, is written by “Workaholics” producer Dominic Russo and stars “Napoleon Dynamite” actor Jon Heder and “School of Rock” actor Tony Cavalero.  The producers presented the world premiere of the first episode at Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas. The creators, voice actors and producers then gathered onstage for a discussion about the inspiration for and behind-the-scenes negotiations of the series.  Fans of the show will be able to mint “Space Junk” NFTs on the Theta blockchain, giving them an opportunity to engage with the project’s intellectual property (IP) through building the show’s narrative, creating characters and participating in token holder-only experiences.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  John Attanasio, CEO and co-founder of Toonstar, told CoinDesk that the model of “Space Junk,” as well as other Toonstar productions, helps break down traditional creator regimes that have existed for years in Hollywood.  “Our mission really is twofold – one is to create original entertainment IP using Web3 as a springboard and the other is giving opportunities to new and diverse creators that may not have had a chance to … get something made,” said Attanasio.  “Space Junk” will also incorporate artificial intelligence into its content generation process. The show will feature a robot character named “Wellbecca” that is fully AI-generated and encourages fans to interact with her.  “It's really cool knowing that we have the inclusion of the audience and the community, and having a little bit more of that interaction in terms of them really putting forth ideas,” Heder told CoinDesk. “I'm very curious to see how that will come about.”  Toonstar landed on the map in March 2022 after it released its show “The Gimmicks” with actress Mila Kunis, allowing token holders to help choose the direction of the show. In July, Toonstar partnered with retailer Hot Topic to release NFT-linked merchandise for the show.  Space Junk NFTs will be available to mint on May 15, and the show will be available for streaming on May 19.

However, this wouldn’t have been the case if the Pepe Coin smart contract deployer had not chosen to do what was good for the project and, by extension, the community. The team renounced the deployer contract, sending it to a null address. Doing this meant no one could tamper with the smart contract and effect changes that could destroy the meme coin’s credibility. Intervening For Credibility According to curious online sleuths, the deployer of Pepe Coin smart contracts had “god-like” powers before changes were made. For example, the team could limit the number of token transactions, modify the maximum token trading amount, the maximum position a trader can initiate, or even suspend trading of a given address. Moreover, the smart contract included a black listing function. Subsequently, this effectively empowered the team to bar certain addresses from holding and trading the token. Related Reading: PepeCoin (PEPE) Rallies By 42% As Interest In Memecoins Rises With this, observers noted that Pepe Coin, though popular, wasn’t decentralized as many thought and project owners could, at any time, rug pull investors. A rug pull is a common scam in decentralized finance (DeFi) where a team builds a project, in this case, Pepe Coin, convinces users to supply liquidity and buy the token. Afterward, the team leaves the project and sells their portion forcing prices lower and leaving investors holding mud. The possibility of the team pulling out a rug pull was plugged when the deploying smart contract was sent to a null address on April 14. The Rise Of Pepe Coin Pepe Coin is a meme coin that has no utility. Instead, the team behind the project aimed to ride on “Pepe the Frog,” created in 2005 by Matt Furie. The meme coin project has no connection to Furie. Pepe Coin was launched in mid-March and with little fanfare. There was no presale, and the total supply was 420.69 trillion. Days after launching, Pepe Coin exploded to be one of the most popular meme coins. The token has surged to command a market cap of over $105 million. It has a slot in the top 300 projects by market capitalization, according to the coin tracker, CoinGecko. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100?

42393701,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2a25,1682415882,Bitcoin Whales Spook Crypto Twitter With Sudden Wallet Movements,"Investors who held large amounts of bitcoin (BTC) and didn't move their coins for years are suddenly showing signs of life, sparking conversations on Crypto Twitter about the possible reasons behind the activity.  The investors are known as ""whales"" because they hold large amounts of tokens in their digital wallets. They can influence the price or sentiment around a token because of the size of their holdings.  One such wallet, which was last active in 2012, moved more than 400 bitcoins ($11 million) over the weekend, data shows. The bitcoin whale moved 360 bitcoins to one wallet and 40 bitcoins to other wallets. The whale had purchased 900 bitcoins in 2012, holding onto the asset ever since then, with a nearly 40,000% gain on the initial investment.  The movement comes on the back of several other whales moving large quantities of bitcoin and ether (ETH) in the past few weeks.  Another whale wallet moved 279 bitcoins earlier in April after over 10 years of inactivity. The whale received 1,128 bitcoins between 2012 and 2013 when the price fluctuated between $12 and $195. The holdings are now worth $31 million.  Ether holders are moving their tokens, too. Last week, a participant in the ether initial coin offering moved 1 ether to another wallet after eight years of inactivity. The wallet holds more than 2,356 ether purchased at 31 cents apiece in the ICO. It's now valued at over $4 million.  The identities of these whales are unknown, and none of them has said publicly why they are making the moves.  The silence has spurred speculation on Crypto Twitter, with possible reasons ranging from developers of the dark web site Silk Road getting access to the whales' wallets to insiders in the know moving tokens ahead of bad news. Some have speculated that the holders' wallet passwords have been cracked.  “We’re now at waay too many 10+ year wallets springing to life on multiple assets all of a sudden,” crypto investor Adam Cochran said on Twitter. “Unless these wallets are somehow related to Mt Gox cold storage, then some old wallet generator has to have been cracked.”  Mt. Gox, which was once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, closed shop in 2014 after it was revealed that it lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoin.  Cochran’s reasoning may be plausible, because old wallets have repeatedly been the target for hackers and online thieves.  Earlier this month, Taylor Monahan, founder of MyCrypto, a wallet manger for ether, flagged a massive “wallet draining operation” that seemed to affect whales and early holders of ether.  Monahan estimated more than 5,000 ether were drained from such wallets in the sophisticated attack. “My best guess is that someone has got themselves a fatty cache of data from 1 plus yr ago & is methodically draining the keys as they parse them from the treasure trove,” Monahan tweeted at the time.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/25/bitcoin-whales-spook-crypto-twitter-with-sudden-wallet-movements,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cc79a3fd77f12a1090a2af51d5faba7b21f7e13-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts have raised concerns about the behavior of investors who bought relatively large amounts of PEPE after its issuance on the Ethereum blockchain, turning about $1,200 of initial capital to over $9 million in just a few days.  The frenzy surrounding the frog-themed token last week sent the coin's market capitalization of a few thousand dollars to over $150 million and created massive hype, attracting liquidity from traders and spurring scores of look-alike tokens on other blockchains.  Exit liquidity remains a concern. Data shows trading pools for pepecoin on decentralized exchange Uniswap hold less than $4 million in available liquidity as of Tuesday, and so a sudden sale by a top holder is likely to hit prices immediately.  Trading volume for PEPE on centralized crypto exchanges has ballooned to an average of $300 million daily, but market liquidity remains relatively thin – which may, again, cause a steep drop in prices should a large holder liquidate his holdings.  The wallet holding the largest amount of PEPE is sitting on over $1.1 million worth of the tokens after acquiring them for a few hundred dollars' worth of ether (ETH), data from Flipside Crypto complied by pseudonymous @deebs_defi shows. The same wallet also owns $1.1 million in shiba inu (SHIB) and $1 million in floki (FLOKI), suggesting the owner is an active meme-coin trader. The investor holds $43,000 worth of ether.  While this wallet holds the largest amount of PEPE in a single place, other top holders may have spread their holdings across several wallets.  Data from Lookonchain shows five wallets connected to ""pepecexwallet.eth,"" which received funds from the PEPE deployer contract, cumulatively purchased over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385, selling the stash days later for over $1.23 million.  The sales were mainly made through Uniswap, and a smaller amount was sold on crypto exchange Huobi.  Crypto analysts on Twitter, such as pseudonymous @louround_, said last week that almost 3% of PEPE holdings are connected to each other. He cited data from wallet analysis tool Bubblemaps.  “This causes a major risk for the market and holders as those wallets hold a token value superior to all the on-chain available liquidity,” @louround_ tweeted.  Crypto exchanges MEXC Global and Huobi are the largest commercial PEPE holders, with over 5.5% of the supply held.  PEPE was recently trading at $0.000000233615, down 22% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.",NEUTRAL,SHIB | PEPE,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/25/pepe-coins-top-bull-also-has-millions-in-shiba-inu-but-holdings-suggest-risk-for-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb70fb0a5a96033e994120e4c51ddbde71d6d806-483x272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This marks a new record high for the amount of ETH locked on the Ethereum network since the Shapella upgrade. With the TVL of Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks hitting an all-time high, many are speculating about the potential for further growth and adoption of these companion networks. After the Shapella Upgrade was put in place, the price of Ethereum [ETH] became more volatile. Still, the Ethereum network has gotten a lot of attention, as shown by the fact that most deposits have been made on its beacon chain. There have been more deposits compared to withdrawals on the networrk. As more and more users turn to Layer 2 solutions to address the high fees and congestion on the main Ethereum network, it remains to be seen how this trend will continue to evolve in the coming months. Source: Nansen Nansen’s records show that since the Shapella upgrade, the amount of ETH locked on the Ethereum network has reached a new all-time high. As of April 24, the total amount of ETH locked was 18,879,775 ETH.

The TVL of Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks, which are complementary networks to Ethereum, also increased along with the rising value of ETH in April, peaking at a record high of $10 billion on mid-April. Source: L2Beat Despite a decline in crypto prices, the TVL has since remained at around $9.22 billion, more than double its value at the start of the year, according to L2Beat, a layer 2 analytics site. However, it is worth noting that there is currently approximately 4.7% of the total ETH on the Beacon chain waiting for full exit, which includes rewards amounting to 894,671 ETH.

12085484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528451,1682412030,Bitcoin Wyckoff And Elliott Wave Predict This Next Price Move,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price has been trading in a range between $27,000 and $28,000 since Friday last week, with $27,800 currently being the most important resistance level to kick off a move to the upside. As recently as last Tuesday, BTC was trading above $30,000 before plunging more than 10%. However, Wyckoff and Elliott Wave analysts agree that the move is not a cause for concern. According to trader and market psychology coach Christopher Inks, a minimum target of $42,350 is expected for Bitcoin as part of its next bounce. Here’s What Wyckoff Analysis Says About The State Of Bitcoin The Wyckoff method was invented by Richard Wyckoff in the early 1930s and proposes to read the market using causal fundamentals that actually predict market movements. The accumulation and distribution schemes are probably the most popular part of Wyckoff’s work in the crypto and Bitcoin community. The models break down the accumulation and distribution phases into five phases (A through E), along with several Wyckoff events. Inks writes in his analysis that Bitcoin is most likely in an accumulation according to the Wyckoff method. “The Elliott Wave count may or may not be correct locally. We want to see an impulsive breakout above that ascending red dashed resistance to signal that the wave ((ii)) flat structure may be complete, but a breakout above wave (b) is required to add confidence to that count,” writes Inks, who shared the chart below. If Inks’ count is correct, then another breakout has the daily pivot as its target. This means that the wave ((iii)) of 3 from here has a minimum target of $42,350 per Bitcoin. According to the analyst, this theory is also supported by the fact that the RSI on the daily chart is currently showing a hidden bullish divergence, with confirmation that it is complete still pending. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000 By End of 2024 In addition, the Stoch RSI on the daily chart has moved back into the oversold area, so a breakout from the oversold area would further support the assumption that the wave ((ii)) is complete, the analyst says and concludes: We can also note the red parabola. While price remains above that curved line we should continue to expect higher, overall, rather than a larger pullback. Let’s see if we can get that rally from somewhere around this area. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback Todd Butterfield of the Wyckoff Stock Market Institute agrees with Inks. In his latest analysis, Butterfield writes that Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off on low volume last week – as expected. This is “another low-risk buying opportunity,” according to the renowned analyst. The technometer is at 38.5 for BTC/USD and 40.4 for BTC/USDT. Via Twitter, he commented: Bitcoin has not reached oversold and the price action had me staying on the sidelines for a moment. An oversold Technometer is not a close your eyes and buy, but an indication that we could be forming a bottom, or due for some sideways/higher. At press time, the BTC price stood at $27,236, moving once again closer to the lower end of the range, probably for one more sweep of the low.

The pullback has some analysts focusing on a key average of bitcoin's price for cues about the next possible move in the cryptocurrency.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded at $27,400 at press time, down 11% from its 10-month high of $31,000 reached on April 14, CoinDesk data shows. The decline has brought attention to bitcoin's 50-day simple moving average, currently at $27,244.  According to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, a potential violation of the 50-day SMA support would challenge the bullish market sentiment.  ""The market has erased its previous growth momentum and is now testing the strength of the medium-term uptrend in the form of the 50-day moving average,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email. ""A break below this would call into question the bull market's strength, while a consolidation below $26,600 could be the prologue to a more profound decline.""  The 50-day SMA is one of the most widely tracked technical lines in traditional markets and cryptocurrencies. Crypto analysts have previously tracked crossovers above/below the key average to confirm bullish and bearish trend changes.  Sellers tried to penetrate the 50-day SMA on Monday but failed. If the breakdown happens, the focus would shift to the next support at $25,200 – the level that capped the upside between August 2022 and February 2023, as seen in the weekly chart above.  According to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, the SMA support may be fleeting and could soon pave the way to a deeper decline.  ""Bitcoin is testing the 50-day SMA, a minor level where short-term oversold conditions should generate a brief pause before bitcoin resumes lower toward key support (~$25,200),"" Stockton said in a note to clients late Monday.  Oversold conditions illustrate a notable and consistent downward move in price over a specified period of time without much pullback. Technical analysts use indicators like the relative strength index and stochastic to gauge overbought/oversold conditions with charts that have different time frames (daily, weekly, hourly).  That said, if the SMA continues to hold ground, a new leg higher consistent with the broader bullish outlook would likely resume.  ""The recent breakout [March move above $25,200] and positive weekly MACD support a bullish intermediate-term bias, with next major resistance near $35,900,"" Stockton noted, using the acronym for ""moving average convergence/divergence.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/25/bitcoins-50-day-average-becomes-focal-point-for-crypto-analysts-after-11-price-pullback,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a640137869c9bc5d19d3ba105d2010b6f5c92501-1920x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(Fundamental Analysis),"Summary Monero is a well-designed privacy coin with features that give it some important advantages over Bitcoin. These advantages include privacy, better fungibility, ASIC resistance, dynamic block size, a faster block time, and a very objective community. Monero is misunderstood and undercovered, making it a sort of “deep value” play in the digital assets space. There are some common criticisms of Monero, and I address them. The ultimate risk of Monero is that it nevertheless fails to make known its benefits as a decentralized money candidate. I rate it a speculative buy. Monero ( XMR-USD ) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was first launched in 2014. It has gained a reputation as one of the most secure and anonymous digital currencies available and it is probably the cryptocurrency which best exhibits the physical qualities of money. Yet, it isn't talked about much in crypto industry circles or on investment sites. This article brings some clarity onto what XMR is and what its investment merits are. The bottom-line up front is that XMR has a lot of strengths as a cryptocurrency aiming to be money due to its fungibility and greater potential for decentralization. Much of this potential does not seem to be priced in when we compare its market capitalization to that of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the dominant cryptocurrency aiming to be money. The drawback is that Monero is yet to achieve the kind of network effect Bitcoin enjoys, and this is probably its biggest headwind. Monero's Features Monero aims to be money. Among all cryptocurrencies, XMR probably best meets the physical characteristics of money: Scarce and Unduplicatable - There needs to be, at any given moment, a limited amount of money and an assurance that new money cannot suddenly be introduced into the money supply by people duplicating it. Transportable - Money should be convenient to move around. Divisible - Money can be divided into smaller and smaller units. Fungible - Each unit of money meant to be a certain value is identical and indistinguishable from other units also meant to be that certain value. Durable - Money must be able to withstand wear and tear so that it can be used repeatedly. Bitcoin is not truly fungible. Every satoshi on Bitcoin has a public transaction history which can be traced back to when it was first mined. Imagine if each dollar bill came attached with a list of who owned it previously, and that this list stretched all the way back to when the bill was first printed. Also imagine if anyone could have access to the list on any dollar bill. The result would be that dollar bills would no longer be fungible. Some bills might be worth more because they were once owned by a celebrity. Some bills might be worth less because they were used by criminals and people understandably don't want to be associated with illicit activities. BTC suffers from this exact problem because the entire transaction history of each BTC is always visible to anyone. There is an ongoing discussion of how Ordinals NFTs, a technique of inscribing data onto individual satoshis, will permanently mark certain satoshis and forever reduce the fungibility of the network and hurt BTC's chance of becoming money. Because Bitcoin is a publicly accessible and totally transparent database, it runs the risk of having satoshis used to store data for other things. Imagine dollar bills being used as tiny canvases for paintings or a place to write down intellectual property. If this happened to a lot of dollar bills, the effective supply of fungible bills would be in question. Monero does not have this issue because the blockchain is designed for privacy. Without getting into overly technical details, Monero ensures privacy and security through a combination of three cryptographic techniques: Stealth Addresses - In a normal blockchain, sending crypto involves the recipient's public address. Everyone can see that the recipient received it. On Monero, the sender uses the recipient's public address to generate a one-time stealth address which receives the funds for the recipient. Only the recipient's private key can access the funds in the stealth address. Different stealth addresses generated from the same public address cannot be linked together or traced to the public address. Ring Signatures - Monero mixes users' transactions with that of other users so that it is difficult to trace which transaction came from which original source. A given transaction can come from a ""ring"" of different equally probable sources. Ring Confidential Transactions - Monero hides the amount sent within transactions as well using a variation of ring signatures. These techniques ensure that the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are all hidden from the public. This is functionally as private as transactions using physical dollar bills. This privacy creates an unknowable transaction history and guarantees XMR's fungibility. By being digital, XMR is also much more transportable and divisible than physical currency. As a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, Monero has the potential for the same amount of security and immutability as Bitcoin. PoW ensures illegitimate transactions can only be processed if the perpetrator performs more computational work than the rest of the network. The larger the network, the harder it would be to cheat the intended spending mechanisms. Monero is better than Bitcoin insofar as being a blockchain that promotes decentralization. Monero uses the ASIC-resistant RandomX mining algorithm. ASIC means ""application-specific integrated circuit."" While ASICs can be specifically optimized for Bitcoin mining, they cannot be optimized for Monero mining. The result is that Bitcoin miners will require capital-intensive investment into ASICs to remain competitive while anyone with a normal personal computer can be competitive as a Monero miner (one could still get more computers to be more competitive in Monero mining, but the point of ASIC-resistance is that it would be hard to specifically optimize computers with the intent to use it for mining XMR). This increases Monero's potential for greater decentralization because barriers to entry and profitability are lower. In contrast, a large percentage of Bitcoin's hash rate belongs to several large-scale mining rigs filled with ASICs. Another benefit of Monero is its dynamic block size . While Bitcoin blocks have a hard cap on how big they can be (currently at about 4 MB depending on the type of transactions in the block), Monero's miners can increase the block size to service an increase in transactions. Block size limits drive up transaction fees during times of high transaction demand because fee bidding determines which transactions are included in the next block. A dynamic block size allows Monero to expand the transaction capacity, effectively creating more supply to meet demand increases and keep prices stable. Furthermore, the Monero network takes an average of 2 minutes to add a new block. Bitcoin takes an average of 10 minutes. As a result, Monero transactions appear and are confirmed faster. The table below compares the two. Together, the dynamic block size and the faster block time affords Monero a better overall user experience. Comparison between Monero and Bitcoin block times (Monero.how) All these features-privacy, fungibility, ASIC-resistance, dynamic block size, faster block times-collectively give Monero an edge over Bitcoin at being decentralized money. Currently, Bitcoin's only strength as far as this comparison goes is that its hash rate is much higher than Monero's. The chart below shows just how true this is. I had to show the logarithmic scale because Monero is on the horizontal axis in a linear scale chart. As of April 2023, Bitcoin's hash rate is 370 x 10^18, Monero's hash rate is just under 3 x 10^9. XMR and BTC hash rates in the last 3 years (BitInfoCharts) But this alone warrants a higher price for Bitcoin. Hash rate embodies the work used to secure the network. Even though Monero as a tech stack is superior to Bitcoin, it simply does not have Bitcoin's security. If a portion of Bitcoin miners decided to 51% attack Monero, they could succeed because they have much more computing power. Of course, Monero's ASIC-resistance does offer some protection against such an event. Monero might be better protected than say Bitcoin SV ( BSV-USD ) or Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). Those two Bitcoin hard forks have much higher hash rates than Monero, but they are not ASIC-resistant. The robustness of the ledger will always be critical to the long-term adoption of any decentralized currency. Monero's smaller hash rate is a weakness it must overcome to increase its market share. The frustrating reality Monero believers must come to terms with is that Monero's superior features do not matter if the ledger isn't secured by a high hash rate. This is the same headwind faced by BSV and BCH. Both blockchains add interesting things to Bitcoin but neither coin (nor XMR) is even in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies by market cap. Monero's Headwinds Bitcoin's dominance in hash rate is a testament to its superior network effect. This network may be the biggest headwind for XMR adoption. People who enter the crypto space hear about BTC first. Prospective miners usually aim to be Bitcoin miners. This is a flywheel effect which continuously reinforces Bitcoin's security and dominance. Monero might escape this cycle if the Monero community can sufficiently educate enough people about Monero's benefits. The good news is that there are several real benefits which aren't exceedingly hard to communicate or understand. For investors who believe strongly in finding misunderstood but established assets, XMR likely presents one of the most attractive opportunities in the entire digital asset space. The bad news is that XMR's real benefits need to be actually realized by users, and this process could take a very long time. Even the process of educating people about Bitcoin can take a while and understanding Bitcoin is pretty much a prerequisite for understanding Monero and its advantages. Another headwind is that Monero's emphasis on privacy allows it to be unfairly but understandably associated with illicit activities. This makes the ""public relations"" for Monero trickier to navigate. BTC is more traceable than cash, and this fact automatically nullifies any serious arguments of BTC being useful for crime. XMR, on the other hand, is nearly the perfect tool for criminals who desire an untraceable medium of exchange. The only way it could be better is if people used it more often. Whether this means Monero ought to warrant negative government attention is a normative assessment. The fact is that it already has to some extent and will likely face increased regulatory opposition as it gains more recognition. Overcoming this headwind will also require educating the public. If enough people can see that XMR's privacy protection is a requirement to create a truly fungible decentralized currency, then the criminal use case may be regarded by the mainstream as an unfortunate side-effect of innovation. For example, the Internet enables cybercrimes, but no one seriously believes this is a good reason to shut down the Internet. Addressing Some Criticisms of Monero Some in the crypto community have raised criticisms of Monero. One such criticism is that Monero's ""tail emission"" makes XMR a perpetually inflationary asset, which seemingly runs contrary to sound money principles that BTC proponents tout as a major benefit of Bitcoin. First, what is the tail emission ? Bitcoin miners get a ""block reward"" in the form of an amount of BTC distributed to the miner when a new block is successfully mined. The specific amount of BTC is determined by a halving schedule , in which the reward is halved every 210,000 blocks (since Bitcoin's block time is 10 minutes on average, this works out to 2.1 million minutes, or one halving every ~4 years). Eventually, the reward will become smaller than a satoshi and the block reward will cease to introduce any new satoshis to the supply. This will occur in the year 2140, when all 21 million BTC will have been mined. Monero does a similar thing, except instead of a zero-block reward at a certain point, it does a 0.6 XMR block reward into perpetuity. This reward is called tail emission. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero halving has already ceased as of May 2022 and it is now in the tail emission phase. This is in fact inflationary, but not in the way the critics have framed it. A regular, fixed number increase in the supply is an asymptotically-zero percent inflation. XMR started tail emissions when there were about 18.132 million XMR in circulation. At a rate of 0.6 XMR per block and 2 minutes per block, this is a fixed 157,680 XMR added to the supply each year. The annual inflation rate would be this fixed 157,680 divided by an ever-increasing denominator of existing supply. Currently, the inflation rate is under 1% and it will only asymptotically approach 0. There is also the argument that tail emission is necessary to incentivize continuous mining. PoW miners are compensated through two sources: block rewards and transaction fees. The total compensation must exceed the cost of mining, which includes electricity and capital expenditures on mining machinery, for miners to remain profitable. Because there may not always be transactions to include in blocks, miners might experience periods without earning any transaction fees. Unless the block reward can compensate them, there is a chance that the network will experience a significant decrease in mining activity and therefore a decrease in security. Some people view this as a ticking time bomb for Bitcoin security. When the BTC block reward becomes 0, the miners would be solely reliant on consistent fees revenue. Because there may or may not be (consistent) fees, it follows that there may or may not be stable security once block rewards go to 0. To this point, one could argue that by 2140 if Bitcoin has achieved sizeable adoption, then there probably will be consistent fee revenue. Usage should at least be global and spanning all time zones, so every moment will have users ""in business hours."" Another criticism of Monero is that privacy isn't really a necessary feature since the effect can be replicated on Bitcoin using privacy-oriented wallets and other backward-compatible upgrades (soft forks). While these are technically solutions for privacy on Bitcoin, they are not mandatory for all users. This has the effect of reducing the anonymity set and singling out people who opt for privacy. Because there is an additional step (and cost) for privacy, there may be some implication of culpability for all who do it. In contrast, privacy is the default on Monero and there isn't really a way around that. This of course might imply that everyone using Monero has a similar implication of culpability, but that argument must dismiss all the other reasons to use Monero outside of privacy. With Bitcoin, users opting for privacy are clearly opting for privacy whereas Monero users might be in it for the faster block time or lower barriers to mining. Monero is sometimes criticized for being centralized because it has a history of hard forks every few months. ASIC-resistance is a quality that requires regular hard forks because specialized mining software and ASIC-resistant software are effectively locked in a constant arms race. Privacy is also an arms race because new encryption and cryptographic technologies are always being conceived. Monero developers have been vigilant in studying these developments and implementing them. The issue with the centralization critiques is that hard forks are agreed upon by the vast majority of the Monero community - the software upgrades are widely perceived as beneficial to the network. No one is forced to comply with the forks by updating their software, but in fact most of the community voluntarily do so anyway. Older versions of Monero are basically inactive and the newest fork is always the undisputed, canonical chain. A good comparison with Bitcoin is that while Bitcoin users tend to prefer the older version, Monero users tend to prefer the newer version. It is unreasonable to say one set of users is more centralized than the other if every individual in both sets are just doing what they want. Monero's Undermentioned Tailwind Monero has an extremely objective and intelligent community. As I researched (and continue to research) Monero, I was very impressed by the community's honesty and culture. Because cryptocurrencies like Monero lack a central planner for its activities, the community becomes a substitute akin to gaining insight into how ""management"" or ""governance"" works. Unlike the Bitcoin community, Monero doesn't seem to have extremely outspoken ""maximalists"" or ""maxis"" who regurgitate bite-sized talking points and angrily dismiss acute criticisms. Maximalism sometimes approaches religious fanaticism in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is off-putting to newcomers, it strengthens groupthink and confirmation bias, and it is generally just stupid. As a community, Monero does "" Skepticism Sundays "" on Reddit where criticisms are encouraged. The guidelines specifically say: Please stay on topic: this post is only for comments discussing the uncertainties, shortcomings, and concerns some may have about Monero. NOT the positive aspects of it. Discussion can relate to the technology itself or economics. Talk about community and price is not wanted, but some discussion about it maybe allowed if it relates well. Note that XMR price is not a desired topic. Note that positive aspects (which add to confirmation bias) are not allowed. Note that these discussions occur every Sunday. This is just one example of the healthy culture in Monero being a tailwind for iteratively developing the best decentralized currency. It is precisely this willingness, even discipline, to openly discuss shortcomings that allows Monero to maintain cohesion after numerous hard forks. The community is well aligned with the overall mission for privacy, security, and decentralization and tech upgrades are seen as the means to achieve this mission. It is yet to reach critical mass because most people simply don't know about Monero. All they see from crypto are Bitcoin, altcoins, and some memecoins and their ""analysis"" is little more than drawing lines on the chart. Should You Buy XMR? I am not long XMR, though I hold the technology and its community in very high regard and plan to personally contribute to Monero in the future. It's probably clear from this article that I like Monero as a technology over Bitcoin. Monero is like a better version of Bitcoin in almost all ways except the current hash rate. But hash rate is a major factor and its importance cannot be overstated. XMR is a speculative bet that a good amount of people will realize Monero's edge and choose XMR over BTC. A lot of them might decide that the low barriers to mining is worth an attempt to participate in the network. This would increase Monero's hash rate, security, decentralization, and network effect. Concurrently, some people who transact with BTC might decide to use XMR instead. XMR's market cap is $2.9 billion while BTC's is $531 billion - BTC is over 180 times larger than XMR. If these things occur and XMR gets to just 5% of Bitcoin's market share, XMR could easily be a multi-bagger from present levels. Assuming the market cap scales with market share, this would be about a ~10x increase. But this might never occur, and BTC might never even catch on. This is of course a ubiquitous risk for digital assets. I think there is a margin of safety which comes from an uninformed and presently uninterested public. This is based on Monero's very real merits and its relatively small size compared to Bitcoin, and on how undercovered and even ""miscovered"" (coverage tends to be focused on illicit use cases and little else) XMR is. Thus, I rate XMR a speculative buy - a good chance of going nowhere but a visible path to outsized profits. XMR appears a great ""deep value"" play in digital assets today. If there was a clearer method for educating people about Monero with a high probability of success, I would be pretty comfortable with giving a strong buy rating and personally taking a big position. This would be the catalyst for the deep value to materialize. The problem with going long right now is that it isn't convenient. Most crypto exchanges available in the US don't have XMR as a tradable asset. XMR's privacy renders KYC utterly meaningless. Since sender, receiver, and amount transacted are all hidden, no one can tell what happens to the XMR after someone buys it from an exchange and moves it to a self-custodied wallet. Another way to get XMR is to mine it. Because of ASIC-resistance, a normal personal computer can be used to join a mining pool and start earning XMR from block rewards and transaction fees. There are plenty of options to start mining XMR with a personal computer. So, should you invest? The answer is an admittedly anti-climactic: ""it depends."" It depends mostly on your investment style and whether you want to take the time to get familiar with the nuance of owning a highly promising digital currency and privacy technology.",NEUTRAL,XMR,MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | XMR | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4596184-monero-long-term-opportunity-digital-assets?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12084297.jpeg

As excitement grows, the value of FLOKI has surged by almost 50% in just one day, with gains of nearly 10% in the past week, making it one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. With FLOKI’s current price at $0.00004099, investors and meme enthusiasts alike are eagerly awaiting what the future holds for this beloved crypto.

Floki Inu: Recent Price Gains and Increased Attention While Floki Inu is just one of many similar meme coins, its recent price gains and increased attention have set it apart from the pack. In February 2023, FLOKI saw a surge of more than 40%, thanks in part to the continued support and interest from Tesla and Twitter CEO and meme coin enthusiast, Elon Musk. We just dropped a new video on our YouTube channel sharing the exciting news that $FLOKI is now available on #BinanceUS!

However, Floki Inu has continued to gain traction and was recently listed on two prominent exchanges, BigONE and BitForex, in addition to Binance.US. Binance Responds To Demand For Meme Coins With New Liquidity Pools Binance has earlier announced the creation of seven new liquidity pools to cater to the growing demand for meme coins like, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin. This move has generated a lot of speculation in the crypto community about a potential meme coin rally, with many investors expecting more retail participation as exchanges continue to support these altcoins. As a result of this announcement, emerging meme coins such as Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) experienced gains of more than 10% following news of a major exchange listing. The creation of these new liquidity pools is a positive sign for the meme coin market, indicating that these altcoins are gaining greater acceptance and recognition from investors.

42393718,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2kND,1682385496,First Mover Asia: Crypto Flat as Markets Await Tech Earnings,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto markets are playing the waiting game as tech's expected mixed bag of earnings may push things down as the week progresses.  Insights: Do Kwon is in a Montenegro jail on charges he sold unregistered securities, but his attorneys raised a reasonable point about the SEC quest for unlimited jurisdiction over the asset class.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,192 −11.8 ▼ 1.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,514 −335.0 ▼ 1.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,845 −37.6 ▼ 2.0% S&P 500  4,137.04 +3.5 ▲ 0.1% Gold  $2,007 +27.5 ▲ 1.4% Nikkei 225  28,593.52 +29.2 ▲ 0.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Good morning, Asia.  Markets in the region are opening flat, with both crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) markets not doing much.  Bitcoin is currently at $27,514, down 1.2%, while ether is down 2% to $1,845.  Ether's relatively stagnant position comes as the protocol's Shanghai upgrade brings record-breaking inflows into the ecosystem as stakers reinvest their rewards.  Data from Coinglass shows that while the market is still relatively flat, the majority of liquidations are coming from short positions, suggesting the market has legs.  Around Asia, the Nikkei 225 opened slightly in the green at 28,714 while Korea's KOPSI is flat at 2,521.  In the U.S., Wall Street is awaiting earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet, which are scheduled for April 25.  Crypto remains tightly correlated with the Nasdaq, as CoinDesk reported earlier this month, which reiterates the narrative that it's another risk asset rather than a safe haven from economic malaise, thus making tech earnings as important as ever.  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA +0.9% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP −3.7% Currency Gala GALA −3.3% Entertainment Cardano ADA −3.2% Smart Contract Platform     Insights  Do Kwon Has a Point  Do Kwon is back in court in the U.S. – via his lawyers because he’s in jail in Montenegro – asking for the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against him alleging he sold unregistered securities to be dismissed. UST, the algorithmic stablecoin of Kwon's Terra ecosystem, is currency, not a security, is the argument being presented.  The SEC lacks a “clear congressional authorization” to regulate digital assets, the docket reads, pointing out that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman has changed his mind “about whether cryptocurrencies are securities, and currently asserts that stablecoins (like UST) are not.”  Kwon isn’t the only target here. The SEC is continuing its campaign of regulation by enforcement: attempting to get insider trading charges added to a case of a fired Coinbase product manager, thus having a wide net to call everything a security; or sneaking in allegations that all exchange tokens are securities in a complaint against former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, which went uncontested as she submitted a plea deal to prosecutors.  “Backdoor rulemaking” is one way to describe it.  In contrast, many jurisdictions in Asia are moving in the opposite direction: creating legal frameworks to properly define crypto – not apply frameworks from the mid-twentieth century – and regulate it as the unique asset class it is. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has this already set up, Hong Kong is working on its own framework, and even Taiwan is rolling out a rulebook.  Kwon is no saint, and is in a lot of trouble after being caught in Montenegro with a fake passport. But his counsel is putting forward a good argument about crypto regulation in the U.S., and the SEC’s quest for unlimited jurisdiction over the asset class.  Perhaps in his fall, he’ll create an important precedent for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S., and in the end, we’ll thank him for accelerating a push for regulatory clarity.

Coinbase filed an Administrative Procedure Act challenge against the SEC on Monday. The exchange asked the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to order the SEC to provide ""regulatory clarity"" around how existing securities laws might apply to the digital asset sector.  Read more: SEC Warns Coinbase It's Pursuing Enforcement Action Over Securities Violations  The SEC warned Coinbase last month it expected to sue the exchange over allegations of listing and offering unregistered securities products. Coinbase is expected to respond to the specific allegations by the end of April.  Monday's filing, however, is a preemptive move by Coinbase to argue that the SEC's approach doesn't provide sufficient regulatory guidance for U.S. companies operating in the crypto sector.  ""It is widely recognized – including by a sitting SEC Commissioner – that existing SEC registration and disclosure requirements are incompatible with digital assets, which differ fundamentally from the stocks, bonds and investment contracts for which the securities laws were designed and that the SEC traditionally has regulated. The SEC at a minimum must set forth how those inapt and inapposite requirements are to be adapted to digital assets. But the SEC has refused to do even that,"" the filing said.

The exchange's native token, also named GMX, has surged by 78% since the turn of the year as capital continues to flow to Arbitrum-based protocols. Total value locked (TVL) on Arbitrum is at $2.1 billion as it gears up towards a record high; $567 million of that value is from GMX, according to DefiLlama data.  At press time, more than 96% of community votes approved the integration, with almost 2 million GMX tokens being used to vote.  A shift toward low-latency trading demonstrates how the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has evolved. Trading firms and hedge funds require lower latency platforms to ensure they can execute sophisticated trading strategies without being subject to delays.  ""The low-latency oracles will bring the industry one step closer to the performance level that currently exists outside of it, while our economic alignment helps set the foundation for a more sustainable ecosystem,"" said Johann Eid, vice president of Go-To-Market at Chainlink Labs.  The new oracles will also help mitigate the risks of front-running.
