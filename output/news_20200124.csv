42403858,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgtyG,1579901400,Major Australian Exchange Expands to Singapore for Crypto-Friendly Regs,"Independent Reserve, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Australia, is expanding to Singapore after an ""overwhelmingly positive"" response from the regulator.      Adrian Przelozny, CEO and founder of the Sydney-based exchange, announced Friday it had expanded its trading services to users in Singapore, saying in a statement that his team ""felt the time was right to make this move.""      Przelozny referenced ""a number of positive moves by Singaporean regulators"" as part of his reasoning.      Independent Reserve offers a host of retail and institutional trading features, including a spot marketplace and over-the-counter (OTC) service. The exchange introduced insurance coverage against theft or loss of digital assets held in a client's account in February 2019.      Established in 2013, Independent Reserve claims it has more than 120,000 customers and 8,000 self-managed super funds (SMSFs), a private superannuation fund operated by its members and regulated by Australian law.      Singapore adopted an open-arms approach to cryptocurrency regulation when the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country's de facto central bank and financial regulator, created a legal framework – the 2019 Payment Services Act – that effectively brought all cryptocurrency payments providers under its jurisdiction.      The Payments Services Act was one of the main factors that influenced the Independent Reserve's decision to move to Singapore, according to Przelozny.      ""Having worked closely with Australian regulators, and as the only Australian exchange to have insurance on crypto assets, the response we’ve received so far from the Singapore market has been overwhelmingly positive,"" Przelozny said.      A number of other exchanges, attracted to Singapore's regulatory regime, have also expressed an interest in moving to the country. Binance announced plans to set up a new fiat-to-crypto exchange in the country last year. A group of ex-Morgan Stanley bankers launched a crypto derivatives exchange in December after MAS published a proposal to regulate these types of financial products.      New Singapore users will now have access to an institutional trading platform for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, litecoin and XRP. Singaporean dollar trading pairs will be integrated into its platform and will operate as a wholly separate entity from the Australian-based platform, Independent Reserve confirmed.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/24/major-australian-exchange-expands-to-singapore-for-crypto-friendly-regs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfd666ddea37408ca0ebfb58a6ceec4c5d93c14c-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It raised $18 million in a token sale to strategic investors last year, followed by an initial exchange offering on the Binance Launchpad in May, selling an additional $5 million worth of tokens.      For users of certain exchanges, this swap will be automatic. According to a source familiar with the matter, most ONE tokens already sit on exchanges.      Unlike some prior token swaps, such as EOS, there's not a way for users to manually conduct the swap. Holders of either of the tokens will need to load them onto an exchange participating in a bridge with Harmony. Once on such an exchange, the tokens can then be withdrawn, but they will only return as the ONE native coin.      Token swaps were a major theme of 2018 coming out the initial coin offering boom, but they've been less common as more companies have shied away from selling cryptocurrency ahead of their functionality.      According to a Harmony spokesperson, only Bitmax currently has the swap live as of this writing. Binance should be operating the swap as of Feb. 3.      The announcement also indicates other partners will enable the swap soon, including HonestMining (a staking service), and exchanges including Huobi, Gate.io and Kucoin. Holders will be able to earn additional ONE coins by staking, but they will need the native version to do so.      Harmony has also integrated with several hardware wallets for storage offline, such as Ledger and SafePal.      The Harmony network is live now, though not all the features are. For example, validating nodes remain permissioned, but this will eventually become open. Validators will be rewarded with new ONE tokens in reward for securing the network, under Harmony's proof-of-stake system.      Harmony had a pre-mine of 12.6 billion ONE tokens issued on the ethereum and binance chains, 36.9 percent of which was sold in the seed and launchpad sale.      The company has not yet announced whether or not there will be a deadline to make the swap.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/24/harmony-kicks-off-migration-from-ethereum-and-binance-chains-to-its-own,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b53f429408db36f2bbafeb982df38b09a190d36-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgu0E,1579887008,"Notes From the WEF: Oil-Producing Nations Want Dollar Alternatives, Just Not Bitcoin","DAVOS, Switzerland – Most Middle Eastern elites at the World Economic Forum are highly skeptical of bitcoin, but there are whispers about its potential for cross-border settlements in the energy sector.      According to Egyptian businessman M. Shafik Gabr, chairman of the ARTOC Group for Investment & Development, some Middle Eastern nations are already exploring the possibility of settling oil contracts in bitcoin. But he declined to specify which, and most of the leaders gathered in Davos for the annual conference that wrapped up Friday are adamant they see bitcoin’s post-sovereign nature as anathema.      Fellow Egyptian investor Ahmed Heikal, CEO of Qalaa Holdings, said he’s not bullish on bitcoin because it “doesn’t have the legal framework” for such wholesale deals. If nations or energy enterprises are to use bitcoin, he argued, it won’t be for at least another decade.      Delegates from Oman to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia all expressed similarly dismissive views about bitcoin as an asset, often referring to it as a gambling conduit. But when asked if it could still be used to settle oil contracts – especially considering the United States’ aggressive economic pressure on energy exporters Iran and Iraq – one Omani politician, who did not want to be identified, teased, “It depends on who's asking.”      U.S. sanctions are top-of-mind across the region, as when President Donald Trump urged Europe not to trade with “unfriendly” energy suppliers. Iraqi President Barham Salih pushed back with a speech on Wednesday that asserted it was Iraq’s sovereign right to have relations with neighbors on its own terms.      Saudi Arabian businessman Hamza Alkholi, CEO of Al-Kholi Group, dismissed the idea that bitcoin-denominated oil contracts could ever be more than an outlier.      “We’ve been trying for 30 years,” he said, referencing efforts to move beyond the U.S. dollar by settling oil contracts in euros. “Until bitcoin is regulated like the stock market, I don’t see that happening.”      Crescent Enterprises CEO Badr Jafar, who is heavily invested in the oil and gas industry, agreed there’s no urgency among most players in his industry to move away from the dollar. Leaders and businessmen still don’t “trust” cryptocurrency, Jafar said, and he expects central banks would push back if bitcoin gained more significant usage.      However, if oil contracts were to be settled in currencies beyond the dollar, Jafar said that might be driven by political factors related to Russia and China.      And soon there will be a digital currency issuer eager to help dollar-weary energy suppliers find alternative settlement systems. Equally concerned about “trust,” China is hyper-focused on both compliance and global market opportunities.    China's new Silk Road?    Chinese businesspeople see Eurasian crypto ventures as a stepping stone toward addressing more complex commodities markets.      China Blockchain Delegation Chairman Danny Deng said China’s blockchain-based currency, which he expects the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to launch on a limited scale in 2020, could offer a backbone for energy markets.      “Bitcoin has a larger and larger ecosystem, but it still can’t afford the trading volume of such a commodity,” Deng said. “The traders of oil and gas are using leverage. That leverage must be backed by financial systems. Regions, like Iran … may use bitcoin or other payment systems. But other countries that don’t have this problem may play an important role in national [cryptocurrency] settlements.”      From his perspective, fiat currency has become too political, rather than a strictly commercial tool. One of China’s most revered bitcoiners, Wang Wei, a leader of nearly a dozen associations from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Advisory Committee to the China Mergers and Acquisitions Association, said bitcoin lost its chance to be the dominant currency for settlements and will instead primarily be a store of value.      Several Chinese businessmen who work with the government and PBoC agreed the bank could offer an alternative to dollar settlement systems by 2021. For example, Zhang Shousong, secretary general of the China Blockchain Application Center, said by the next Davos conference PBoC’s digital currency will be operational “not only in China, but all over the globe.”      Given the tenor of public officials’ statements, Deng said cryptocurrency rails are “on a fast track.” Shousong added it’s “not like Libra, it’s certainly going to launch,” referring to the Facebook-initiated global currency project whose debut remains uncertain.      In the meantime, Wei has taken Chinese-speaking Kazakhstani entrepreneur Tilektes Adambekov under his wing and helped the latter establish the licensed EBX crypto exchange in Kazakhstan, the world’s 10th-largest oil exporter. Adambekov joined the Chinese delegation for lunch in Davos to discuss the future of global markets over foie gras and fig chutney in a mountaintop restaurant with a panoramic view. Adambekov quoted Mao Zedong in a thank you speech to the delegation, which prompted resounding applause.      From the delegation’s perspective, Adambekov is a perfect fit for China’s aspirations. He spent eight years working in China before returning home to focus on serving Russian-speaking crypto markets across borders. Plus, Kazakhstan has an open regulatory framework and is strategically situated along the path of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. Adambekov said his exchange aims to support tokenized oil and gas options, settled in national cryptocurrencies yet offering bitcoin liquidity.      From China to Oman, all businesspeople and diplomats agreed the dollar will remain king in commodities markets for the near future. But alternative options may already be on the horizon.      When asked if such options could usurp the greenback by 2025, Matthew Blake, the World Economic Forum's monetary systems lead, said the dollar’s role is so pronounced that “to displace it in a meaningful way would take longer than four years.”      Bitcoin may, or may not, participate in that shift.      “Bitcoin has demonstrated some of the qualities that a distributed currency can possess,” Blake said. “It’s also had challenges too. The role of a currency is to have a store-of-value with an inherent level of stability. There needs to be liquidity. In the case of bitcoin, it hasn’t had those qualities thus far.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/24/notes-from-the-wef-oil-producing-nations-want-dollar-alternatives-just-not-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a84b0731cd4de38674db14b9b1cdce2c13b0b604-2560x1723.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgu59,1579881837,"Crypto Exec’s $1.8M SIM-Swap Lawsuit Has ‘Critical Holes,’ Says AT&T","AT&T says a lawsuit over a $1.8 million crypto hack fails to show how the U.S. telecom giant was responsible.      The case, brought by VideoCoin's head of strategy, Seth Shapiro, in October, alleges that, in 2018, AT&T employees were responsible for transferring control of his phone number to hackers, who used it as part of a SIM-swap scam that drained his exchange accounts of more than $1.8 million worth of cryptocurrencies.      In a Jan. 22 filing in support of its December motion to dismiss the case, AT&T says Shapiro's allegation has a ""fundamental problem"" because it ""jumps"" from hackers gaining his phone number to the withdrawal of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.      With the hackers allegedly having paid off AT&T employees – who've since been fired and are being prosecuted in criminal court – to gain control of his phone, Shapiro's lawyer, Andrew Calderon, has accused the company of ""systemic negligence."" He previously told CoinDesk: ""AT&T has a rich and troubling heritage of taking less than adequate measures to protect its customers’ data from unauthorized access.”      But according to AT&T's December dismissal motion, Shapiro's allegation relies on ""bare thin conclusion."" Hackers needed more than a phone number to access exchange accounts, the dismissal filing reads, and the plaintiff has not said how hackers knew about his accounts and how they knew he was an AT&T customer. The motion also says Shapiro has not conclusively shown how the fault for the hack lies at AT&T's door.      Wednesday's filing further claims: ""Mr. Shapiro’s request that this Court assume that the SIM swap must have led logically and foreseeably to the theft is unfounded."" The filing also refutes the plaintiff's claim of ""intentional misconduct"" for disclosing information, like a Social Security number and exchange passwords, that AT&T says it would never have ever had in its possession.      The firm's lawyers also highlight that Shapiro has not said whether his phone was used for any two-factor authentication mechanisms on his exchange accounts.      ""Mr. Shapiro blames AT&T for the theft, but he is wrong, and his complaint states no viable claim against AT&T under any theory,"" December's filing reads. The complaint ""overreaches at every turn to blame AT&T for conduct that it did not control"" and the lawyers suggest ""Mr. Shapiro's own negligence"" could be to blame for the hack.      AT&T further states in the latest filing that, in his opposition to the motion to dismiss, Shapiro ""ignores critical holes in his allegations"" and is requiring the court to make ""wild guesses.""      Shapiro's opposition to the motion to dismiss, filed in early January, states: ""Unable to deny its involvement in these criminal acts, AT&T marshals a host of red herring, whataboutism inquiries to make it appear as though the theft of Mr. Shapiro’s funds was utterly unforeseeable and unrelated to the SIM swap.""      AT&T faces a similar case brought by crypto investor Michael Terpin in 2018, who claimed he lost $24 million in a similar SIM-swap hack. A Los Angeles court said in a ruling last summer the telecom company must answer the lawsuit.      In the case of Shapiro, the court will hear AT&T's motion for dismissal in the Central District of California, Western Division, Los Angeles on Feb. 18.      The leader of the hacking group responsible for Shapiro's loss, 21-year-old Joel Oritz, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison after pleading no contest to charges of orchestrating 13 SIM swaps in April 2019.

42403872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdguA4,1579878000,Your PGP Key? Make Sure It's Up to Date,"Identity thieves now have another tool at their disposal: bitcoin hashing power.      That’s the conclusion from a new cryptanalysis paper published earlier this month on SHA-1 (pronounced “shaw”), a once-popular hash function created by the National Security Agency (NSA) and disapproved in the mid-2000s after failing against theoretical hack attacks.      SHA-1 continues to see use in certain circles, such as on source code program Git and other legacy products for sending secure transmissions on computers, according to Gaetan Leurent of France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology and Thomas Peyrin of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, authors of the paper.      Despite notices in 2006 and 2015 from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for federal agencies to stop using the hash function, and other studies warning of SHA-1’s flaws, academics are still warning firms to switch hash functions.      “SHA-1 signatures now offers virtually no security in practice,” the paper notes.      By renting spare hash power from bitcoin miners – made feasible during bear-market lulls – Leurent and Peyrin were able to conduct an impersonation attack by forging a fake key assigned to another’s identity.      Hash functions, a one-way cryptographic scrambler comprising the basic security of cryptocurrencies, can also be used for verifying individual identities.      In PGP keys, the intended message (called plain text) is compressed and scrambled through a one-time-only “session key.” Paired with a public key, users can safely transmit information to someone else. To decrypt the message, recipients match their private key with the session key to recover the plain text.      According to the paper, PGP keys – often used to self-verify users – can be broken with $50,000 worth of rented hash power, a small sacrifice for government agencies, not to mention black hat hackers.      How? Through collision attacks wherein different inputs result in the same random hash. When this occurs, two parties have access to the same key.      “It's so cheap because the GPU computation is nowadays very cheap,” Peyrin said in a phone interview. “That's going to go down more in the coming years. Our attack is costing maybe $45,000 now but in, let's say, five to 10 years, it's going to cost like less than $10,000.”      While many users have moved on from SHA-1, Leurent and Peyrin noted two popular mainstream self-verification tools, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and GnuPG, are at risk of impersonation attacks through hash function collisions for certain legacy applications. The latter is now rejecting SHA-1 based signatures based on the research, the academic said.      “We don't have the numbers about how many actually YubiKeys (a popular self-verification device) are using the old versions,” Peyrin said. “A lot of people are used to using SHA-1 unfortunately and one of the reasons is because of legacy purposes. It costs a lot of money simply to move away.”    A day in the life of a hash function    The same week the vulnerability in SHA-1 was exposed, a new one emerged: BLAKE3. Four cryptanalysts, including zcash creator and cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox, presented BLAKE3 as another alternative to the many hash functions available today for commercial use.      Wilcox told CoinDesk the use of Merkle trees was a motivation for developing a new standard along with his colleagues. First patented in 1979 by Ralph Merkle, Merkle trees – used in cryptocurrencies – efficiently store verified data and allow machines to conduct the same computations simultaneously in what is called “parallelism.” As the BLAKE3 paper notes, the use of Merkle trees “supports an unbounded degree of parallelism.”      Translation: it's a very fast hash function.      Mostly intended for verifying video streams, the hash function is based on the BLAKE family of functions such as BLAKE1 and BLAKE2.      SHA-1 has its own family members as well: SHA-2 and SHA-3. Unlike its BLAKE cousins, however, the SHA family was created out of the need to fix SHA-1 after a 2004 bombshell paper which broke multiple hash functions. In fact, bitcoin’s hash function, SHA-256, is a member of the same family (created as an alternative to SHA-1).      Following the 2004 paper, SHA-2, created three years earlier, was expected to be broken as well as researchers assumed its older brother’s failings would be genetic traits.      Still, most security experts at the time thought it was bust leading to a NIST competition for a replacement in 2007. Hence, SHA-3.      Years later, and SHA-2 is still rocking and rolling while its brother continues to take a pounding. The cost of launching an attack on applications utilizing SHA-1 continues to depreciate, starting in the millions of dollars worth of rented GPU equipment to only thousands under Leurent and Peyrin’s research.      So what about BLAKE3 and other hash functions such as crypto’s SHA-256? While all hash functions go the way of SHA-1? Not quite, said BLAKE3 lead author Jack O'Connor.      “We learned quite a lot about how to build crypto in the 90s. What you might think of as a natural life and death cycle of hash function might be incorrect to assume. Look at SHA-1 and ‘say okay, you know born and died, depending on how you count it 2015 or 2005, like a 12- to 15-year life cycle,’” O'Connor said.      “That's probably not the best way to understand how hash functions work because we were learning a lot in the 90s and we are not repeating the mistakes that were made with SHA-1,” O'Connor said.      You can paint a landscape a thousand ways, however. It’s unfair to extrapolate from SHA-1’s demise to other functions as it depends on how future technology counters more secure and powerful hash functions rolling out today such as BLAKE3.      “One story that people tell is, ‘All secure hash functions eventually fail – they have a finite lifespan.’ Another story is, ‘In the early 2000s, cryptographers learned how to make secure hash functions – before that, they all failed, after that, none of them did,’” Wilcox said.      “It’s important to realize that both of these stories are compatible with the data, so anybody who tells you that they know which one is the true story is drawing conclusions beyond the data,” he concluded.

42403857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgtxH,1579870938,10% of Central Banks Surveyed Close to Issuing Digital Currencies: BIS,"A fifth of the world's population may well have access to a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in as little as three years, according to a new survey.      An annual study carried out by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) asked 66 central banks if they were working on CBDCs and, if so, what type and how far along they were.      Released Thursday, the report found 80 percent of the 66 banks surveyed were engaged in some form of work surrounding CBDCs, with nearly 40 percent having moved to experiments and developing proofs of concept. Overall, the number of banks working on some form of CBDC project increased 10 percent from BIS' 2018 survey.      Out of the 66 banks polled, 21 came from developed economies with 45 from emerging economies (EMEs). In total, the banks surveyed covered 75 percent of the global population and 90 percent of global economic output.      Although around 70 percent of central banks said it was unlikely they would release a CBDC in the forseeable future, another 30 percent of respondents said they had active plans to issue some form of digital currency, with about 10 percent saying they were already developing pilot projects.      Asked how close some of these CBDC projects under intensive development were to completion, 20 percent said a CBDC could be issued within the next six years.      Another 10 percent were reported to be ""imminently close"" to launching a digital currency to the general public, possibly by 2023, according to the report: ""Central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population say they are likely to issue the first CBDCs in the next few years.""      BIS does not explicitly name any of the central banks that are close to issuing CBDCs, but the report includes two test cases from the central banks of the Bahamas and the Eastern Caribbean, which have both confirmed digital currency pilot projects.      It's also well known China, a country with more than 1.2 billion people, has also developed its own CBDC. Designed as a new payments solution, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said in November the digital yuan initiative was currently in the testing stage.      Furthermore, seven central banks, including the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as BIS, all announced Tuesday they had formed a working group to share findings of the ""economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability"" of CBDCs.      Although many EME central banks said they had other priorities, the BIS survey concluded that emerging economies generally had more incentive to issue CBDCs. Every bank that had progressed to active development or pilot projects came from an emerging economy, researchers found.      ""EMEs have generally stronger motivations than advanced economies to work on general purpose CBDCs,"" the survey said. EME respondents said CBDCs could help promote financial inclusion and increase stability, as well as improve payments efficiency and safety. In comparison, the survey found central banks from developed economies felt digital currencies may only prove to be ""very important"" for improving payments safety.      But central banks from emerging and developed economies believed CBDCs could address the declining use of cash as a means of payment. ""EME central banks [are] aiming to reduce reliance on cash, and advanced economies [are] acting to pre-empt any issues that might be faced by the general public in accessing central bank money,"" according to the survey.      Public interest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remained static, responded central banks. Similar to the 2018 survey, many respondents said it remained a peripheral activity in their jurisdictions, with limited viability as an alternative payments solution. Few respondents said the motivation for CBDC research stemmed from any concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/24/10-of-central-banks-surveyed-close-to-issuing-digital-currencies-bis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0a1d55e02b16303240606ef7a0321ad231cded0-1500x959.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgu95,1579867200,"Notes From the WEF: Cash Is Dead, Long Live Digital Cash","DAVOS, Switzerland – Consensus is building on one issue at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland: Cash is dead.      “Physical money is out,” said B.S. Kohli, an economic advisor to the head of the Indian state of Punjab. Mothanna Gharaibeh, Jordan’s minister of digital economy and entrepreneurship, agreed.      As of this year, Gharaibeh said, Jordanians can no longer pay for government services, from taxes to hospital bills, with cash. They must use electronic payment systems like bank transfers or mobile wallets.      “It’s going to be a tough transformation,” he said, referring to the nation’s poor and unbanked populations. “But refugees can take mobile wallets using their UN Refugee Agency ID cards. … We just need to stop printing [bills] and put it instead on mobile accounts or in bank accounts.”      Unlike many dollar-dominance-skeptics in Davos for the forum, Gharaibeh said pegging Jordanian dinars to the dollar has served the smaller nation well for decades. He doesn’t see any need to reinvent money, just remove the anonymous properties.      “Because we need to stop tax evasion,” he said.      Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari – author of the bitcoin community cult classic ""Sapiens"" – said he’s skeptical of bitcoin.      “Money is going in the direction of more and more trust,” he said. “Bitcoin is based on mistrust. It’s basically a return to gold.”      On the other hand, Harari predicted the complete elimination of financial privacy could happen “very quickly,” which he described as a “dangerous” prospect.      Ask almost any economist, banker or politician at the WEF about financial privacy and they’ll scoff. With shockingly few exceptions, most will say more financial data collection and passive surveillance will benefit society. (When pressed, they might emphasize the importance of encryption and regulating access to the data.)      RegTech expert Diana Paredes, an investment banker turned CEO of the compliance startup Suade Labs, agreed the sentiment among her public- and private-sector clients is “cash is dead.” However, she added, it’s the job of policymakers to protect consumer interests.      “What we should be doing is regulating privacy around [electronic payments],” she said. “I want to own my data. It should belong to me, not the bank.”    Bitcoin in Davos    Fear not, bitcoiners: Not all members of the Davos elite are pushing for e-fiat authoritarianism; some leaders here see a future where bitcoin continues to thrive.      “Bitcoin is a fantastic idea, as long as it is monitored,” Kohli said, praising the compliance standards already upheld by bitcoin-friendly Swiss banks.      Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, offers a shining example of a bitcoin-friendly politician.      He said decentralized digital assets will have a role to play in the future of France, as long as organizations like the crypto custody startup Ledger and the bitcoin development startup ACINQ continue to pay taxes and uphold regular compliance standards.      “We don’t want digital companies issuing their own currencies like sovereign states,” he said, making a subtle dig at Facebook’s Libra. “But we believe [bitcoin] can reduce the costs and delays of international payments. … We strongly believe in fintech.”      Likewise, Mariam Al Muhairi of the state-backed Dubai Future Foundation says her team will spend 2020 exploring how to support companies that want to use digital assets.      “It’s to help regulate that area,” she said, emphasizing the team is still in the research phase. “There are entities that do own and use [cryptocurrency].”      Paredes added the best way to protect bitcoin’s usability is to educate regulators about specific use cases so they can make laws and compliance standards without jeopardizing projects of value.      The divide between cypherpunks and banks grows ever more narrow when experts drill down to the specifics.    Common ground    Most crypto veterans at the WEF were just as enthusiastic about central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as the bankers themselves.      For example, Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of Aza Financial (formerly known by the name of its retail product, BitPesa), said she’s “really excited” about the People’s Bank of China issuing a CBDC. She sees this as yet another customer onramp that complements the fact bitcoin makes up 7 percent of her company’s monthly volume.      MakerDAO Foundation CEO Rune Christensen agrees: “Generally I think it’s really good for the trend of digitizing the economy,” he said of the CBDC trend. “It’s just a step toward more blockchain adoption.” His project’s DAI stablecoin, he told CoinDesk, could one day be the liquidity backbone for the world’s CBDCs.      Meanwhile, Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming said his internet infrastructure company generally takes a proactive approach to promoting censorship-resistance, even as his team supports clients such as banks and similar institutions in the public sector.      “What goes over our network isn’t really our business. And we don’t think it’s our job to figure that out because that would be kind of creepy,” he said, adding the company runs gateways to both ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).      From Graham-Cumming’s perspective, bitcoin is an impressive experiment because it actually works and continues to work, regardless of political and technical challenges. Yet, Cloudflare is more focused on ethereum.      “When you look at the smart contract stuff, that’s a programming language. We think someone is going to build something interesting with ethereum and we hope they’ll find our services useful,” he said. “As people start to work with new organizations for financial transactions, they need to ask how that organization is thinking about security. … We’re all resting on top of something else.”      The only way to protect privacy in a world of digital cash, he said, is with a combination of good regulatory policies and standard “best practices” that promote security throughout the ecosystem’s architecture.      “The idea of Web3 is that you should be resilient,” he concluded.

Notably, bitcoin has now erased nearly 40 percent of the rally from $6,853 to $9,188 witnessed in the 17 days to Jan. 19.      Further, bitcoin is now down 10 percent from the recent high of $9,188 and is reporting a 3 percent loss on a 24-hour basis.      All that said, prices are still up 15 percent on a month-to-date basis. That number, however, could decrease over the next couple of days, as the short-term charts are indicating bearish conditions.    Daily chart    Bitcoin fell 3.21 percent on Thursday, its biggest single-day decline in over a month, and closed (UTC) below $8,460, confirming the reversal lower signaled by the big bearish outside day candle created on Jan. 19.      The downturn in price is backed by bearish readings on key indicators.      For instance, the MACD histogram is now producing deeper bars below the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index has dived below an ascending trendline.      All in all, BTC looks set to extend losses toward the psychological support of $8,000. A violation there would expose the 50-day average support at $7,678.    4-hour chart    The bearish case put forward by Thursday's range breakdown will remain valid as long as prices are held below $8,460, the level which capped downside multiple times in the first half of this week.      A bullish revival would require prices to cross $8,750 on strong volumes. That would open the doors for a re-test of recent highs near $9,200.

I’m not sure we want to be first but we certainly don’t want to be last either, so I expect we’ll be on the leading side of that, not the lagging side,” Garlinghouse said.      He also said his cross-border payments company has been in communication with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the regulatory status of the cryptocurrency XRP.      “We have been talking to the SEC for some period of time,” he said. “I feel like educating regulators is part of my job and I think that’s been a really constructive process.”      It was the first time both of those points were addressed publicly by the firm, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation.      Garlinghouse made the comments at a Ripple-sponsored session at The Wall Street Journal lounge at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.      The San Francisco-based startup, which is working in concert with the financial services industry to rewire the world’s cross-border payments system, recently raised $200 million at an eye-popping $10 billion valuation.      The blockchain firm also announced on Wednesday its XRP sales fell significantly in the last quarter.      Sales dropped 80 percent from the $66.24 million sold in Q3 to just over $13 million in Q4, according to Ripple's XRP Markets Report. The drop is partly due to Ripple's suspension of programmatic sales, which accounted for $16.1 million in the previous quarter.

According to a Reuters report on Friday, about 70 lawmakers from the party feel a digital yen is needed to counter the approaching launches of Libra and China's digital currency.      The effort – aimed at keeping Japan at the forefront of fintech innovation – would be a joint project between the government and the private sector, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Norihiro Nakayama told the news agency.      “China is moving toward issuing digital yuan, so we’d like to propose measures to counter such attempts,” Nakayama said Thursday. The initial stage would be to research the prospect of the digital coin.      The ruling party group is led by former Minister of the Economy, Trade and Industry Akira Amari and would put the plan before the government possibly next month.      The initiative would seem to counter the view of the country's central bank, which said last June that to issue a digital yen would mean dropping cash. ""Eliminating cash would make settlement infrastructure inconvenient for the public, so no central bank would do this,” Masayoshi Amamiya, deputy governor of the bank of Japan (BoJ), said at the time.      However, it seems to be keeping an open mind. Earlier this week, the BoJ joined five other banks in forming a new working group with the Bank of International Settlements to share research findings about potential cases for central bank digital currencies.       Further, Reuters says Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament today the government will work with the BoJ to examine digital currencies and ways of improving the yen as a means of settlement.      In developing a digital yen, former BoJ board member Takahide Kiuchi said in the report, the central bank would seek to avoid restricting private-sector innovation. ""The best way could be to issue a hybrid-type digital currency that is operated and issued by private firms, with the central bank’s involvement,” he said.      After the Facebook-led Libra project was announced last summer, Japan's regulators expressed concerns about the potential risks of the stablecoin.

42403848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgsqP,1579852811,Ripple Reports Selling Just $13M of XRP Last Quarter,"Ripple's XRP sales fell dramatically in the last quarter of 2019 – at least partly due to change in how the company sells its store of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, the company said Wednesday.      XRP sales in Q4 dropped 80 percent from the $66.24 million sold in Q3 to just over $13 million, according to Ripple's XRP Markets Report. The drop is at least partly attributable to a total suspension in programmatic sales, which accounted for $16.1 million the previous quarter. Over-the-counter (OTC) trades also dropped 74 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ).      ""In Q3 2019, Ripple further reduced XRP sales and paused programmatic sales. Ripple maintained this approach throughout the entirety of Q4,"" the market report reads. Ripple said OTC trades had remained focused in providing liquidity and utility to partners in ""strategic regions,"" which included Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.      Ripple announced in June it would adopt a more ""conservative approach"" to quarterly XRP sales to address concerns of misreported volumes from cryptocurrency exchanges. This came into effect soon after the company sold $251 million worth of XRP tokens in Q3.      Programmatic sales were made directly to exchanges and used to make up the majority of XRP sales figures, accounting for $144.6 million in Q2 2019.      Ripple also said in Wednesday's report its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) tool, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, had proven to be successful with clients. The dollar value of XRP transacted through ODL increased 650 percent between Q3 and Q4, with transaction volumes increasing 390 percent QoQ.      Excluding the billion tokens released at the beginning of January, the company's escrow accounts currently hold approximately 48.9 billion XRP tokens.

Submitting a pull request to the code for Bitcoin Core (the reference implementation, or standard version of bitcoin software from which others are derived) does not mean the change is official. But it's a key step. While many in the bitcoin community are excited about the upgrade, the process of turning the idea into code has been mostly happening behind-the-scenes. Wuille's ""pull request"" pushes it into the spotlight, signifying the code is closer to ready.      Though Wuille submitted the pull request just a couple of days ago, several bitcoin developers, including John Newberry, Ben Woosley and Adam Ficsor, have already left review comments, in another sign of how highly anticipated the change is.      In another key, if more symbolic milestone, the three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), which are like blueprints of the changes, have also been assigned numbers on GitHub.      A key part of the proposal is Schnorr, a cryptographic signature scheme for proving ownership of coins. It's better than what bitcoin has right now in that it paves the way for scalability improvements and allows developers to build new technologies on top of bitcoin.      Using Schnorr, Taproot adds smart contract capabilities to bitcoin that would strengthen privacy. For example, the transactions that open and close payment channels on the lightning network, allowing speedier transfers of small amounts, would not look much different from normal transactions (at least, up to a point). So it would be harder for blockchain voyeurs to discern what a user is doing.    Leaderless change    As a decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin doesn't have a single leader who can push through changes. As such, a major change like this (called a ""soft fork"" in bitcoin) can only get absorbed if just about everyone agrees with it.      If no one in the community comes up with any valid objections to Taproot (such as uncovering a security vulnerability) it could become the biggest change the digital currency has seen since 2017, when scaling upgrade SegWit was locked in after a long and often savage debate.      So far, it looks like the change has all but unanimous approval from developers. Bitcoin Core contributor Anthony Towns organized a review group where developers scrutinized the BIPs, submitting comments and suggestions. Any developer who wanted to join could.      This ""army"" of developers finished their review of the protocol change earlier this month. Of those, 16 submitted a ""survey"" at the end outlining their feedback, including whether they think the upgrade is a good idea. All 16 approved of the changes.      There's still a lot of work to do. While many scrutinize the code looking for improvements or errors, some developers are debating the best way for the decentralized, global network to adopt the change with as few bumps as possible – which SegWit's heated debate showed is far from a given.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/24/bitcoins-privacy-and-scaling-tech-upgrade-taproot-just-took-a-big-step-forward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa9b3ee1c1fe10c007d13e417a92a09e87b07674-558x335.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
