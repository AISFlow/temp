42412474,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl50pM,1680217988,Circle’s USDC Remains Dominant in DeFi as Pressure Eases on the Stablecoin,"Circle-issued USDC has preserved its status as decentralized finance’s (DeFi) dominant stablecoin as the aftershocks of its key banking partner's collapse earlier this month subside, crypto analysts told CoinDesk.  USDC has regained balance in DeFi protocol Curve’s 3pool exchange pool, an important infrastructure for supporting stablecoins trading. The surge suggests that pressure has eased on the token, noted Riyad Carey, research analyst at digital asset data platform Kaiko.  The pool, which has some $440 million in assets, is an important platform within the DeFi ecosystem, where crypto investors can exchange USDT, USDC and DAI stablecoins. Curve pools also serve as an exit door during times of stress in crypto markets.  On March 10, USDC suffered from the sudden implosion of its reserve banking partner Silicon Valley Bank. The collapse rocked the stablecoin market, causing multiple tokens to temporarily deviate from their price peg, including USDC and DAI.  Anxious traders raided the pool to ditch USDC and DAI tokens and flock to the perceived safety of the largest stablecoin, tether (USDT). During the tumult, USDT’s share fell to 2.4% in the pool’s liquidity, per a Dune Analytics dashboard by Subin An, a data analyst for crypto fund Hashed.  Now, USDC makes up 36% of its assets, with DAI and USDT comprising 37% and 27% shares, respectively.  “While USDC has had some large outflows, it appears that the tide could be beginning to turn in DeFi,” Carey told CoinDesk. “Curve's 3pool has become more balanced, a sign that fear around USDC (and DAI) has begun to subside.”  Data shows that USDC has managed to maintain its dominant position in DeFi despite the crisis, Andrew Thurman, analyst at blockchain intelligence firm Nansen, explained.  According to Nansen data, USDC is still a widely used trading pair in decentralized exchange pools, and top USDC holders include DeFi protocols, bridges and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  Last week, decentralized lending protocol MakerDAO voted to confirm USDC as the top reserve asset for its DAI stablecoin.  “I'd say that its dominance might have been chipped away a bit, particularly ceding ground to tether, but it's still the largest and remains systemically important,” Thurman said.  USDT, with a $80 billion in market capitalization, has reached a 22-month high in market share on the $132 billion stablecoin market. The token is mostly used for facilitating trading on centralized exchanges.

The new integration announced Thursday is called Ticket 3.0 and is an expansion of its existing relationship with NFT ticketing company TravelX, which launched in September 2022. The NFT ticketing technology, built on the Algorand blockchain, allows passengers to change their name, transfer or sell their ""NFTickets"" independently.  Flybondi says the NFT ticket ""offers a more flexible travel experience that allows passengers to even buy in advance without having to define their travel plans or who the travelers will be."" In return, the airline is able to reduce customer service costs and increase its revenue from trading fees.  TravelX chief blockchain officer Facundo Martin Diaz told CoinDesk in September that the company does not charge a fee when users initially purchase a ticket but it does receive a 2% transaction fee when trades are made on the secondary market. Airlines also get a 2% cut, he said.  Passengers can purchase travel tickets through the Flybondi website using fiat currency, and TravelX issues a synchronized NFT ticket on top of the regular e-ticket. Travelers can then create a Ticket 3.0 account to manage and store their NFTs through Flybondi. Ticket-related rules and conditions are integrated into the NFT's smart contract by the airline.  ""With this launch, we seek to generate a positive impact in the aviation industry through innovation and an application of blockchain technology,"" said Flybondi CEO Mauricio Sana in a press release. ""Changing the rules of the game is never easy, but we know that it is our objective to evolve and offer our passengers a new stage of the freedom to fly.""  TravelX partnered with Spanish airline Air Europa in April 2022 to launch a series of NFT tickets linked to special perks and events. Latin American crypto exchange Lemon integrated TravelX onto its platform in October 2022, allowing users to buy and sell airline tickets.  TravelX has also made its infrastructure open so that other exchanges or marketplaces can use the TravelX API.

Bitcoin was lingering just below $28,000, while ether dropped under $1,800, both down about 1.5%.  The third and final estimate for Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), showed the U.S. economy expanded by 2.6% during the fourth quarter of 2022, slightly below expectations of 2.7% The GDP figure was revised downward from prior estimates of 2.9% and 2.7% because consumer spending and exports were lower than initially calculated.  The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index rose 3.7% in the fourth quarter, aligning with the consensus estimate, while initial jobless claims of 198,000 exceeded expectations of 192,000.  Corporate profits declined 2% in the fourth quarter following a decline of less than 0.1% in the previous quarter.  Crypto markets’ quiet response implies investors were largely unmoved by the data, which offered faint encouragement the U.S. economy was contracting, a precursor to lower inflation. BTC traded 0.19% higher during the hour of release, while ETH trimmed its price by 0.9%.  Digital assets have tended to respond more favorably to declining economic signals that would allow the Federal Reserve to scale back its diet of hawkish interest rate hikes and more negatively to indicators that the economy is expanding, usually a harbinger of higher inflation.  The probability of the Fed approving a 25 basis point rate (bps) increase at its next meeting on May 3 leaped from 40% to 50% on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which measures rate probabilities.  Crypto investors should particularly note the upward revision in PCE from 3.2% in January because it illustrates the extent to which the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee had been chasing inflation. The current mark aligning with estimates also supports FOMC base case assumptions about a declining economy.

42421278,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmWL,1680203610,3 Strategies Crypto Firms Can Use to Land a New Banking Partner,"If your crypto firm is on the hunt for a new bank, you are not alone.  The recent collapse of three crypto-friendly banks has added a fresh obstacle for digital asset firms that are still grappling with the impact of crypto winter and a regulatory crackdown.  But communications can play a key role in helping you define your public image and potential risks associated with your business – factors that potential banking partners are watching closely.  Brett Philbin is an executive vice president, Rachel Millard is a senior vice president and Rosie Gillam is a senior vice president in Edelman Smithfield’s Financial Services Practice.  Below are three strategies that can aid in the banking courtship process:  Clearly articulate your focus on risk and compliance  There is high value in ensuring that the controlled elements of your business are front and center. Crypto is the least trusted of financial services subsectors, according to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, which in November surveyed more than 32,000 respondents across 28 countries.  That’s a big reason why it’s critical that licenses, registrations and compliance standards are included in a prominent place on your website. Consider making them central to your “about the company” message. Highlight any compliance or financial health measures your company takes. Ensure your risk management officer or chief financial officer is featured on the website along with their bios.  See also: When Will Crypto Learn From the Mistakes of Banks? | Opinion  This step sends the message to prospective banking partners that you have someone in-house who can interact with them in the way they’re accustomed to working. These seemingly minor changes are valuable: They highlight the measures you have taken to reduce risk within the company.  Revisit messaging on your corporate website and social channels  Assume potential banking partners will do their homework by visiting your corporate website and your corporate social channels to deepen their understanding of your business, your leadership team and recent developments that could impact whether or not they choose to partner with you.  Make certain that critical information is accessible and understandable (spend time carefully crafting your “about” page). This is especially important if you operate in a niche category within the broader crypto ecosystem.  A decentralized exchange, for example, should be explicit in explaining how it differs from a centralized exchange, to help less-adept audiences understand the nuanced differences between the two.  Beyond the website, be sure to conduct a quick refresh of your social channels. Your online presence and demeanor can play a role in the evaluation process. Use these channels to communicate updates about the company, including any recent developments that demonstrate long-term viability such as customer wins, partnerships and product launches.  On the other hand, while Crypto Twitter is awash with policy hot takes, consider whether your company is in the best position to contribute to this conversation. Banks evaluating potential partners may weigh the liability associated with a firebrand company leadership willing to tweet at any regulator without regard for the impact it could have on their image.  Engage trade associations to fight some battles  For many organizations, it’s better to skip the hot-take policy tweet and instead consider engaging with industry trade associations to carry forward those concerns and objectives.  See also: How Policy Shaped Crypto's Banking Prospects | Opinion  Trade associations carry weight within Washington, D.C. They are able to take tough policy positions publicly and generate media interest in them in a way that individual companies cannot.  These organizations can also help broker productive and impactful backroom conversations with policymakers and facilitate introductions to potential partners and allies that can be helpful in driving longer-term growth strategies for your business.  Now more than ever, it’s clear the first stop on the road to mass crypto adoption is for firms to find a bank they can trust. The right communications strategy can help ensure you don’t end up having to settle for a tier-2 or tier-3 banking option. Employ these tactics to expedite your transition to a new banking partner today.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,"Brett Philbin, Rachel Millard, Rosie Gillam",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/30/3-strategies-crypto-firms-can-use-to-land-a-new-banking-partner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a940d1b36de3e6b5eecc67f238529227fd5de9a6-5149x2896.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He said bitcoin’s price performance shows it to be diverging from other digital assets such as ether (ETH) and traditional financial assets such as gold and U.S. 10-year Treasurys.  In the past month, Connors noted, the value of the largest crypto by market cap has risen by over 20% compared to gold, up by about 8%, and U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which have decreased by 4.3%. In the last two weeks, the bitcoin price rose by about 15%, to above $28,000 on Thursday.  According to Connors, recent bank failures are still putting traditional finance (TradFi) markets at risk, with equities and corporate debt having more downside. In the past month, Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) have closed or been taken over by regulators.  “We’re still in an uncertain period,” Connors said.  At the same time, he said, the U.S. is turning ""regulatory screws tighter"" on the digital asset industry, with the Biden administration trying to exert control, but not kill, that industry, he said.  Connors also sees bitcoin rallying, in part, because of the enforced departure of some of the industry’s biggest players – Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.  “It was very unusual to have someone hoard some bitcoin and then sell it in May like Do Kwon did,” Connor said. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges Kwon, recently arrested in Montenegro, had been periodically transferring bitcoin from a wallet to a Switzerland-based bank and converting the tokens to cash.  “It was also unusual to have a multibillion-dollar fraud like FTX that causes more FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],” he said of the now-bankrupt exchange. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas, extradited to the U.S. and faces a number of charges. He goes on trial later this year.  “That’s gone,” said Connors about the two arrests. “That’s why bitcoin’s up 63% this year.”  Read more: First Mover Americas: Investors Dig Risk Again",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/30/bitcoin-is-still-in-its-safe-haven-period-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d770427b8d2648057ba07f9f3d40b15906621320-1080x608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from the Grenada Broadcasting Network this week, Sun was stripped of his status as ambassador sometime after elections held in June 2022, when the New National Party, which granted Sun his position, was ousted by the National Democratic Congress.  GBN reported that all ambassadors were recalled sometime in the ""early months"" of the now nine-month-old administration, though Sun hasn't publicly acknowledged the loss of his position. The report follows weeks of speculation on both social media and in the press that Sun may have lost his credentials.  Sun was appointed as World Trade Organization ambassador by the government of Grenada in 2021.  Since his appointment, Sun has touted his credentials, styling himself ""His Excellency"" in interviews and on his social-media accounts. Sun tweeted from his diplomatic Twitter account (@HEjustinsun) as recently as October, and, as of press time, he still maintained the ""H.E."" honorific on his personal Twitter account.  Sun acknowledged the loss of his credentials on Friday, tweeting that his term as the Ambassador of Grenada to the WTO would be ending, ""effective 31 March 2023.""  Officials with Grenada's foreign affairs office and government information services didn't return requests for comment about Sun's diplomatic status.  Sun was sued for fraud and securities violations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week. Sun, along with three of his companies including the Tron Foundation, was accused of manipulating the market for Tron's native token, TRX, through ""extensive wash trading"" and for ""orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX … without disclosing their compensation.""

42421273,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmRB,1680197905,Anti-TikTok Politicking Shows Worst Tendencies of U.S. Pols,"It’s clear enough now to say that Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-Mo.) attempt to force a vote in the U.S. Senate to block the popular social media app TikTok is a sideshow. Today, his grandstanding was curtailed by fellow Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who voted against Hawley’s motion on the grounds that a ban would be unconstitutional and an affront to American values. But there are still remaining efforts in the works in the U.S. political apparatus to ban the app, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These machinations reveal a growing and ugly tendency among American political leaders looking to ring-fence and control technological progress, and expand the surveillance state over U.S. citizens and our allies. CoinDesk readers are likely familiar with “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a phrase coined by Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter to explain a seemingly coordinated effort by the Biden administration, Federal Reserve, U.S. judiciary, elected politicians and unelected financial regulators to force out crypto as we know it.  Of particular concern is the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, introduced by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), which has received bipartisan accolades in the Senate and a statement of support from the administration. The act, if passed, which seems likely amid the anti-TikTok ferment, would give the U.S. Commerce Department power to impose restrictions on essentially any “foreign” technologies that pose national security risks.  See also: Senator Who Wrote Controversial Crypto Tax Rule  Essentially, the RESTRICT bill gives wide latitude to the U.S. executive branch to survey and restrict “information and communications technologies” developed by “adversarial nations.” If that sounds surreally broad, it’s because it is – the bill cites “desktop,” “mobile” and “web-based” applications by name. So, everything you can do with a computer? Well, yes, if it happens to use “software, hardware or any other product or service integral to telecommunications” developed in China or other hostile nation.  RESTRICT doesn’t call out blockchain specifically, but crypto would surely be covered as everything from landlines to satellites to edge computing is, too.  The legislation could be updated, but as it stands it presents a severe risk to technological development and individual human rights. Virtual privacy networks (VPN), used for web-surfing privacy, could be negatively affected. It could fragment the global development process of tech, including crypto, and essentially move us towards a world where who uses what app is decided based on national borders. That’s at least part of the reason why technologist Balaji Srinivasan called the RESTRICT Act the U.S. version of China’s Great Firewall.  Elsewhere, the Biden administration has opened a review of TikTok, and seems likely to try to force ByteDance to divest itself of the app. On Feb. 24, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) introduced the Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries (DATA) Act in the House of Representatives that would enable the president to block transactions associated with the import or export of Americans’ “sensitive data” – also in the name of national security. At the same time, U.S. lawmakers are weighing the renewal of 9/11-era Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which empowers U.S. authorities to force U.S. tech giants (i.e., Google, Meta Platforms and Apple) to spy on non-U.S. citizens’ email, phone and online communications.  Listen, I am not one of the 150 million U.S. users of TikTok – I think almost everything that comes from the app isn’t worth the headspace, except for that flamboyant lawyer who tells watchers not to talk to cops – but I don’t think it should be banned. Especially based on such spurious charges that Sen. Hawley and ex-President Donald Trump tried to advance: that it’s a tool for warrantless espionage by the Chinese Communist Party. No doubt TikTok is not only rotting brains but intentionally misusing or unintentionally mishandling user data.  See also: Privacy Is a Human Right – and the 118th Congress Must Pass Protections | Opinion  I also understand the DATA and RESTRICT acts and other efforts could be used to rein in the well-documented privacy and data abuses performed by the U.S.-based tech giants. At some point the government will have to figure out how to best regulate Big Tech, but there is a right way and a wrong way. Balkanizing the internet through unaccountable executive powers is not the right way. For decades the U.S. government has protected the free flow of information and services on the open internet. We should preserve that, especially in contrast to how U.S. adversaries China and Russia manipulate their local webs.  It’s all the more important that laws like this are not passed – that the U.S. does not become its enemies. Especially because, the alternative – crypto – is getting the boot.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/30/anti-tiktok-politicking-shows-worst-tendencies-of-us-pols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1301c74597a79cac2deeff107b3f9b2cd3d4dd90-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under its Web3 art division, Pace Verso, QQL: Analogs is Pace Gallery’s first show featuring works from a single artist that originated on-chain. The exhibition features 12 large-scale physical paintings that originated from the same QQL algorithm that generated the QQL NFT collection, which was co-created by Hobbs and pseudonymous generative artist Dandelion Wist.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends? Subscribe to The Airdrop here.  Hobbs said at the show’s press preview that he’s enthusiastic about bringing digitally native art to the eyes of viewers in person through physical derivations, providing a richer experience for enjoying the art.  “As a digital artist, you lose control of how people see work, especially when viewed on a small screen,” Hobbs said, explaining that the “hybrid” nature of his work allows viewers to ingest the work in a more enhanced format.  As NFT markets have been hit hard by crypto winter, Hobbs has kept interest in digital art alive as buyers have continued to flock to his work. Last September, one wallet scooped up over $900,000 worth of Fidenzas – his most popular NFT collection, which he released a year prior. Days later, he raised $17 million by selling mint passes for his QQL collection.  Beyond QQL, digitally native art has been finding its place in museums and galleries around the world. In February, NFT issuer Yuga Labs donated a CryptoPunk to the Centre Pompidou museum in Paris. Days later, NFT influencer and collector Cozomo de’ Medici donated 22 digitally native works to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Much like popular AI photography application Lensa, Unstoppable’s AI avatar software draws from a series of images to create unique and realistic PFPs that are computer generated. Users who pay a fee of $14.99 can upload up to 20 images of themselves, and within an hour can access 200 images generated by the software. These images can then be minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) on sidechain Polygon and used as an Unstoppable PFP.  The PFPs minted by users are also available for purchase on secondary marketplace OpenSea.  Lisa DeLuca, senior director of engineering at Unstoppable, told CoinDesk that bringing AI innovation to Unstoppable will help users further tap into their digital identities as they connect their domains across decentralized applications, games, metaverses and more.  “The cool thing about AI is it adds a technical flair to who you are in a digital representation that allows you to be creative and show that side of you, and also show that you're experimenting in the space of AI,” said DeLuca. “It just allows you to nerd out a little bit when you're showing off your digital identity.”  Unstoppable has been pushing out products with a mission to help users build out their Web3 identities.

Lawmakers supported a move proposed by the Assembly’s Economics Committee last week that seeks to stop harmful promotions involving risky financial products, medicine and cosmetics.  The approval deals an extra blow to the sector just before it prepares for a toughened registration regime, driving consumers into the hands of foreign influencers, said Adan, which represents the French crypto industry.  “Adan hopes that debates in the Senate will allow the reestablishment of a version more suited to the development of all the innovation of Web3, while guaranteeing user protection,” the lobbying group added.  Lawmaker Arthur Delaporte, one of the architects of the legislation, last week said it would help value the work of legitimate influencers. His proposal was to forbid promotions for crypto firms unless they hold a license, which no company does in France.  If the measure becomes law, France would join countries such as the U.K. and Belgium in seeking to tighten promotion of crypto products.

Bankman-Fried's attorney, Mark Cohen, told the court that while the defendant pleaded not guilty, he was not acknowledging the more recent sets of charges because they came after his extradition from the Bahamas.  ""My client is not acknowledging he can be tried,"" Cohen said.  Reuters first reported the plea, after reporting earlier on Thursday that Bankman-Fried was likely to plead not guilty to the charges.  Federal prosecutors also took time at Thursday's hearing to discuss their progress reviewing the contents of seven electronic devices produced by Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors told the judge the process was going slower than expected due to the size of the devices and the amount of information. So far, approximately 6 million pages of documents have been produced in the case. One device, identified as Laptop B, is a sticking point for Bankman-Fried's defense.  ""We do have a concern about Laptop B,"" said Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's lawyer. ""That relates to a cooperating witness who will be an important witness on trial.""

""[Davies and Zhu] have made only selective and piecemeal disclosures ...

Crumpler and Farmer also attempted to serve a court-approved subpoena to Davies via Twitter on Jan. 5, but Davies ignored it despite being active on the social media site, the filing added.

42421271,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmO5,1680187600,Editorial: It Sure Looks Like the U.S. Is Trying to Kill Crypto,"When walking my dogs, I often run into a septuagenarian named “Harry” (not his real name), a former New York City detective who each morning feeds a colony of stray cats at a nearby golf course. We’ve bonded over animals, but that’s where the touchy-feely part of Harry starts and ends. His worldview includes belief in several QAnon conspiracy theories, and that another American Civil War is around the corner. He’s been waiting for the “signal.”  Sometimes I engage with Harry, other times I just listen. Sometimes we talk about cryptocurrency while he says “hello” to the pups. A couple of days ago, I told him it’s been a rough stretch for the sector, with a banking crisis and government pressure ramping up fast.  Kevin Reynolds is CoinDesk's editor-in-chief.  He responded quickly: “Did you really think that central banks and governments would allow a competitor to fiat money to exist?”  That stopped me cold. Here he was spouting a conspiracy theory that I’d been finding it increasingly hard to argue against.  Over the course of just a few weeks, it has become increasingly easy to believe – rightly or wrongly – that in its understandable desire to Do Something in the wake of the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the regulatory and administrative state of the United States of America is trying to kneecap (if not out-and-out neuter) all of crypto as a technological project within its borders.  As conspiracies go, this one doesn’t need much suspension of disbelief. Even well-placed observers, including former regulators, have characterized this as a coordinated attack. Heck, the current administration’s animus against cryptocurrency is clear in official statements, and then there’s all the actions. After ignoring industry pleas for guidance and regulation for years, the U.S. government seems to be going after all parts of crypto with a vengeance.  The assault has included a series of enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against regulated U.S. crypto entities including Kraken and Coinbase, while just this week the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance. The Biden administration last week also released its “Economic Report of the President,” which made the case that cryptocurrency is not a useful technology while focusing on a series of crypto-inspired criminal frauds that unfolded in recent years.  My reasons for disbelieving that there is coordinated ill-intent are twofold, one rooted in idealism and the other cynicism. First, this is the U.S., the land of opportunity and freedom. A deliberate attack against the economic freedom that crypto represents would run against this country’s values. Second, this is the U.S., the land of crumbling infrastructure. Our leadership can’t even muster the coordination necessary to repair the country’s bridges and railways. It is too depressing to imagine they might be more aligned on destroying the financial infrastructure of the future than maintaining the physical infrastructure of the present. Supporting the lack-of-coordination side of the argument is how the CFTC, in its suit against Binance, claims the cryptocurrency ether is a commodity while the SEC and the New York Attorney General both argue it’s a security.  But whether this is a coordinated effort against crypto or not may be irrelevant. Some people are convinced it’s real, and not just my friend Harry. The idea is rampant now: The U.S. has it in for crypto. So some firms are looking at moving overseas, while others are worried they will lose or be unable to obtain bank accounts. And it’s not just industry folk who believe this. Bankers, for instance, are declining invitations to speak at crypto gatherings, fearful of painting targets on their institutions’ backs.  Without a significant change of course by the Biden administration, the view that the U.S. is anti-crypto will soon become too entrenched to uproot. The fact that most of the U.S. government’s actions have been punitive rather than constructive is a huge factor.  Regulators and the White House need to make it clear that crypto has a future on U.S. shores, and there’s no better way to do that than by giving the digital-asset industry the clarity it has been begging for. Blueprints for a more appropriate framework have been laid out in proposed legislation such as the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act in the Senate. We, along with much of the crypto world, would welcome such clarity, but regulators and many other lawmakers have seemed reluctant to provide it.  Existential threats  CoinDesk almost never adopts a formal position on issues. As noted in the past, we typically leave the task of presenting the organization’s common perspective to the breadth and balance of the newsroom’s reporting, rather than taking an official point of view on any given topic. That we are doing so here reflects our view that, in this case, our position should be made clear. The editorial leadership believes the threats facing crypto due to recent U.S. actions – regardless of whether they’re deliberate – are existential enough to merit taking a stand on behalf of a technology and industry that are a potential good and a force for economic empowerment.  We do not believe these attacks will succeed in their stated goal of protecting Americans from fraud and scams. Early reactions suggest it is highly likely to push technological innovation outside of U.S. borders. This would, among other impacts, make entirely fraudulent activities indistinguishable from legitimate efforts at innovation for all but the most savvy insiders.  We are alarmed by signs the crackdown exceeds the authority of regulators under current law and violates the spirit of freedom and innovation that underpin the U.S. and the cryptocurrency world.  It looks like regulators are attempting to block cryptocurrency firms from accessing conventional banking services. Former Congressman Barney Frank, architect of stricter banking regulations following the 2008 financial crisis, has alleged that Signature Bank, where he was a board member, was forced into liquidation by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) because “regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message.” NYDFS has denied that allegation.  The editorial leadership believes the threats facing crypto due to recent U.S. actions are existential enough to merit taking a stand.  But the claim seems to be supported by banking authorities’ recent moves. On March 16 Reuters reported the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) was requiring potential buyers of Signature Bank to pass over the bank’s crypto clients, essentially denying them further banking services. The FDIC denied this – yet when the sale went through, crypto customers were indeed excluded from the acquisition.  Some have dubbed this sub-rosa effort “Operation Choke Point 2.0” – an apparent sequel to an Obama-era campaign to de-bank legal but politically undesirable businesses including gun manufacturers and payday lenders. These measures appear to circumvent not only due process but to repeat violations for which previous administrations have already been firmly disciplined by both legislators and the legal system.  Strikingly, the current head of the FDIC, Martin Greunberg, was an architect of the original Operation Choke Point.  That effort was ultimately met with a wave of lawsuits and hearings that, by and large, concluded the government had abused its power. In part to help settle various lawsuits, the FDIC promised internal reforms to prevent regulatory overreach against legal businesses, including putting an end to unwritten suggestions to banks about their choice of customers. The sincerity of that promise now seems questionable.  CoinDesk is working to uncover the real story behind recent incidents and discover whether there really is a coordinated effort to starve the crypto industry. But the appearance of the abuse of government power is enough to justify raising an alarm, even before the full picture is clear.  Indiscriminate daisy cutter  This appearance of an unstated anti-crypto agenda must be distinguished from recent legal actions against specific swindlers who have victimized the crypto world. We know very well that crypto, like many frontier technologies before it, is extremely appealing to fraudsters. We applaud the prosecution and likely imprisonment of alleged criminals including Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried. We actively work to stop fraud: CoinDesk’s award-winning journalists were substantially responsible for uncovering massive alleged fraud at FTX, and we warned investors away from both the crypto lender Celsius Network and Kwon’s Terra before they collapsed.  But denying the developers of cryptocurrency tools and the creators of cryptocurrency services the ability to manage their dollar funds in U.S. banks is not an anti-fraud measure. It is a daisy-cutter bomb likely to cause indiscriminate carnage. Failing to establish a clear framework for the regulated issuance of digital assets, similarly, ultimately makes frauds harder for consumers and law enforcement to stop, because it eliminates any route to legitimacy for even the most high-minded digital asset-based projects.  This apparent effort to strangle crypto is also having significant knock-on effects. As mentioned earlier, bank officials are markedly less willing to speak on the record about crypto or to take part in public panels on the subject believing that they will somehow fall afoul of regulators. And forget about trying to get a central banker to speak on the record. As a result, the debate over the future of the industry risks becoming a pro-crypto echo chamber, rather than a crucible from which real truths, and real innovations, can emerge.  There is also the risk of crypto becoming politicized. The digital-asset community has often shunned party politics, preferring to uphold larger principles of freedom and personal autonomy. In fact, constructive, bipartisan crypto legislative proposals have largely been the norm – most notably the comprehensive bill sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). But now the perception that the administration is anti-crypto is threatening to destroy that open collaboration. How someone feels about crypto could soon depend on political affiliation. No one wins if that happens.  Cryptocurrency does have real-world uses and benefits, including serving as a financial alternative for those facing repression and violence around the world. In just one example, cryptocurrency allowed $100 million in aid to quickly reach Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion – faster than aid was able to move through more formal government channels.  More broadly, crypto has become a nexus of advocacy for tools that resist the dangerous concentration of digital power in the hands of companies whose hoards of data make surveillance and censorship their primary stock in trade. The worrying rise of surveillance capitalism is a topic of clear concern for many of the legislators whose authority bank regulators currently appear to be usurping.  While speculation drives much of the market activity in digital assets (much like the market for technology stocks), their prices are also driven by real demand from current users. Billions of dollars in value move around the world over the Bitcoin network every day.  Un-American  Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies would survive even a sweeping, indiscriminate regulatory crackdown functionally unscathed. That’s their entire point: These systems were conceived with the goal of empowering individuals to control their own fates in the digital era, separately from government and corporate structures.  In this respect, cryptocurrency tests principles of government restraint foundational to the American ethos. The religious, free speech and other rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution are blueprints for the spread of liberty around the world. They have helped increase human flourishing, happiness and wealth for millions.  These protections seem normal to many Americans now, but they were once considered dangerous and destabilizing forces by established powers. To this day, even on American soil, authoritarians persistently return to old habits, seeking the illusion of safety through censorship and restriction.  Given that reality, it will clearly be the project of many years to make financial autonomy as much of a taken-for-granted protection in democratic societies as freedom of speech and religion are today. If I’m wrong and authorities do intend to restrain that progress, they should declare that goal openly and pursue it through transparent democratic channels.I hope my conspiracy-theory-believing friend is incorrect and the Biden administration is not out to kill crypto. Assuming that’s the case, the White House needs to clearly demonstrate its positive intent. For instance, it should support a bipartisan effort to legislatively mandate that the SEC establish clear guidelines on securities laws as they pertain to digital assets. Given the rampant cynicism that has erupted in response to the government’s heavy-handed actions toward crypto, nothing short of that will make the industry believe it doesn’t need to flee the U.S. in search of safety.

Media outlets first reported on a potential new round last August.  The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit against competitor Binance have made many digital-asset owners wary of leaving their tokens in the hands of others. Ledger’s hardware products allow users to store their assets in a secure, physical location.  “As you know, 2022 was a trying year for the crypto industry, including the collapse of significant crypto exchanges and shifting macroeconomic conditions,” wrote Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier in a post addressing the Series C extension round. “In this tough environment, Ledger has consistently shown strong resilience and growing adoption for the hardware and services parts of our business. Since Ledger’s inception, we’ve seen the market go up and down, people question whether crypto should exist at all, but our commitment to blockchain innovation has been unwavering,” he added.  Paris-based Ledger will have a second close for the funding round in the middle of April and a third could follow depending on demand, according to Bloomberg. Investors in the round included returning backers 10T, CapHorn Invest, Morgan Creek Capital and Cathay Innovation. New investors included True Global Ventures, Cite Gestion SPV, Digital Finance Group and VaynerFund.  The $1.4 billion valuation would be roughly steady with Ledger’s last round of fundraising, which brought in $380 million in June 2021.

Bitcoin was up 1% over the past 24 hours to about $28,500. It reached an intraday high of $29,100 but has since retreated a bit. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 advanced 0.4% after a rally on Wednesday to enter into a bull market for the first time in nearly three years.

The exchange didn’t specify what digital assets it had found. OKX said in a release it conducted investigations to identify any FTX-related transactions on its exchange, and upon discovering assets and accounts linked to FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm that is affiliated with FTX, it moved to secure the assets and freeze the connected accounts. Shortly after the collapse of FTX, a hacker siphoned $600 million from the exchange's wallets, leading to fears that FTX accounts on other exchanges were compromised.

42421268,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmM1,1680179400,How Advisors Can Prepare for Ethereum’s Unlock,"The Ethereum network is set to undergo its next upgrade, called Shanghai, on April 12, 2023. When the Shanghai upgrade is implemented, this will effectively unlock the ether (ETH) that has been staked since the “Merge.”  In September, when Ethereum underwent the Merge, a significant upgrade to its blockchain, it switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.  A key benefit of the upgrade is the new Ethereum network allows individuals to run a validator node, staking their own ether in order to help secure the network in the absence of the traditional mining infrastructure that had secured Ethereum since its original launch.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Market participants are motivated to stake their ether because they are now able to generate rewards, paid in ETH, from the network for their staking contributions. It no longer requires significant upfront investment into mining hardware and software to reap the blockchain rewards from the Ethereum network.  The downside to staking Ethereum after the upgrade was that those staking (or those running validator nodes) were required to stake their ETH until the next upgrade. This lack of liquidity for ETH holders created an illiquid amount of ETH that was unable to be sold during the last few months.  Selling pressure?  Many critics of Ethereum have said that this has created false supply and demand levels and liquidity on the network. While Ethereum has rallied over the last few months, many investors are concerned that when the staked Ethereum becomes liquid, the selling pressure (due to an increase in liquid ETH) will drive down the price of Ethereum.  There are currently 16 million ETH staked, which will be available for withdrawal once the Shanghai upgrade is live. Not all of these 16 million ETH will be liquid at the same time, as developers have implemented a queue for withdrawals. ETH will be available for withdrawal every 12 seconds, and only 16 withdrawal requests can be met at each opening.  Those wishing to withdraw have two options. First, they may request to withdraw only the rewards they’ve earned from their validator nodes. Second, they may request to exit their validator nodes entirely, withdrawing the 32 ETH that is required to run a validator.  While analysts have attempted to determine the demand for ETH withdrawal, it’s nearly impossible to predict with accuracy. Human emotion, often driven by price and market sentiment, will come into play when the ETH is unlocked.  Some believe the Shanghai upgrade will cause an increase in selling pressure as the 16 million “locked” ETH becomes liquid, while others believe that the new liquidity options will increase the demand to stake ETH.  The advisor takeaway  In general, the shift to proof-of-stake has caused the fundamentals of Ethereum significantly. The ability to stake ETH has created a new opportunity to earn rewards.  Advisors and those managing crypto portfolios can look at the Shanghai upgrade, in particular, in a few different ways.  The upgrade makes the Ethereum network more efficient and cost effective to use – gas fees are set to decrease significantly. The long-term outlook of Ethereum has increased, as the usability and costs have gone down significantly. Many believe that this increases the likelihood that Ethereum will continue to grow and strengthens the investment thesis of Ethereum.  Others who are looking to trade the price of Ethereum may be encouraged by the Shanghai upgrade, as it will surely increase volatility, at least temporarily. If you’re looking to trade the crypto markets, be prepared to navigate the market because this is a significant change and will likely have many moving parts.  For advisors, I believe that the upgrade is a significant positive change to Ethereum. During the bull market of 2020 and 2021, many competitors to Ethereum gained market share as a result of Ethereum becoming difficult and expensive to use. Other layer 1 smart contract blockchains grew tremendously compared to Ethereum as users and investors flocked to coins they viewed as better opportunities.  It would be wise to remember that Ethereum is still the second largest blockchain network – and after the successful upgrade, many of the reasons individuals used to justify investments into other coins may be challenged. Ethereum is now an incredibly secure and efficient smart contract cryptocurrency and, in my opinion, the roadblocks that pushed investors away from Ethereum have been rectified and removed.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/30/how-advisors-can-prepare-for-ethereums-unlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22802261007c65cb4ca5212f559762dc1bf31118-2309x1299.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Tuesday, a federal grand jury had added a 13-count indictment that accused Bankman-Fried of authorizing the transfer of $40M in crypto intended for one or more Chinese officials to regain access to assets, amounting to more than $1B in crypto held by FTX sister firm Alameda Research, which had been frozen by China. That added to eight counts of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly stealing from FTX customer funds in his original indictment , followed by 12 more counts for alleged bank fraud, unlawful political contributions, and unlicensed money transmitting in a February indictment. The new charges mean Bankman-Fried could face decades in prison if convicted, Reuters said. His trial is scheduled to start Oct. 2, 2023. He is currently confined in his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, on $250M bond pending trial. The 31-year-old founder of FTX has already pleaded not guilty to eight counts of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly stealing billions in FTX customer funds. In December, two key FTX and Alameda Research employees — Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud charges in a cooperation deal with the Southern District of New York.

42387793,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtMpp,1680175851,Bitcoin Volatility Likely as Options Worth $4B Expire on Friday,"Bitcoin (BTC) could see wild price swings heading into the weekend as options contracts worth billions of dollars tied to the cryptocurrency are set to expire on Friday.  At press time, the quarterly expiry on the dominant crypto options exchange Deribit comprised 81,052 call options worth $2.24 billion and 60,261 put options worth $1.73 billion, according to data from Amberdata. Deribit, which accounts for almost 80% of the global crypto options activity, will settle the quarterly options at 08:00 UTC on Friday. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC.  ""There is massive quarterly options expiry tomorrow,"" said Dick Lo, CEO and co-founder of TDX Strategies. ""The Street is potentially short gamma on the top side. That plus thin liquidity could lead to big chops in both directions.""  Options are derivatives contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Call options give the right to buy; puts the right to sell. Investors use options to hedge their positions in the spot or futures market against adverse price movements and speculate on future trends in valuations and volatility.  On the other side of the transaction are dealers or market makers, who provide liquidity to an order book by creating buy and sell orders. Market makers earn money from the spread between the bid and ask price and trade the underlying asset to keep their net exposure market neutral. Their hedging activity often breeds volatility, especially in the lead-up to major expiries, like the one due on Friday.  Bitcoin has rallied 23% this month, predominantly because of the U.S. banking crisis and resulting reduction in Federal Reserve interest-rate expectations. The rally spurred demand for call options at higher strike prices, leaving market makers with a large negative or ""short gamma"" position on the top side. Being short gamma on the top side means holding a sell position in call options, which offer holders protection against price rallies.  If bitcoin were to extend gains ahead of the weekend, market makers will be forced to hedge their short gamma exposure by purchasing the cryptocurrency in the spot or futures market. That, in turn, could bring more upside volatility.  ""Due to bitcoin's price rally caused by the banking crisis in mid-March, a large amount of negative gamma was in the hands of market makers,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin. ""There is a lot of negative gamma at strikes $28,000 and $29,000, which means the upward price movement will push market makers to buy.  ""When the gamma is the most negative and the price rises/falls by 1%, market makers have to buy/sell about $50 million worth of BTC spots or futures to hedge their exposure,"" Ardern said.  Bitcoin rose past $29,000 early Thursday, only to fall back quickly to $28,300 in a two-way move reminiscent of the volatile bull market days of early 2021. The gamma squeeze by market makers likely caused the pop and drop, according to Ardern.  The impact of market makers' hedging could be more pronounced than ever, thanks to worsening liquidity conditions. Liquidity, as measured by the 2% market depth, slipped to 10-month lows early this month, making it hard for traders to execute large deals without causing big price movements.

The initiative builds on a recent trial led by Euroclear with the French central bank to use blockchain technology for bond transactions, with a central bank digital currency used as payment – extending the idea beyond a mere experiment to cover live transfers of security tokens.  “Euroclear is building and is finalizing the first minimum viable product of a DLT platform for issuance and settlement of digital bonds,” Bart Garré, a lawyer for Euroclear, told CoinDesk at an event in Brussels.  Garré said that Euroclear doesn't have definitive timeline but that the platform could be launched as soon as this year. The trading platform will link to legacy bond markets to ensure liquidity, he added.  The project doesn't necessarily depend on the changes brought by the European Union’s DLT pilot regime, which is designed to make trading stocks and bonds easier by using crypto-style technology, Garré said. That pilot program started last week. Garré, however, added, that Euroclear is facing legal assumptions, including what constitutes an account or a message to transfer funds, as well as concepts in property law.  “How do you transfer ownership? Do you need to change the law to be able to do that?” Garré asked, adding that to take collateral “can be done with a very minor change in the financial collateral law.”  Read more: Bye-bye Brokers: EU Tries Stock Trading, the Web3 Way",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/30/euroclear-finalizing-dlt-bond-settlement-platform-staffer-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d7923e3bc2b91d459e1ffc9fe6ef709b7a2f66e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387783,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtM9j,1680170400,"Axie Infinity’s Ronin Blockchain Overhauls Tech, Expands to New Game Studios a Year After $625M Hack","Last week marked the one-year anniversary of the Ronin network hack, when the blockchain that powers the non-fungible token (NFT)-based Axie Infinity video game was exploited for a record-shattering $625 million. That attack – which U.S. authorities traced to North Korea’s Lazarus hacker group – remains the biggest-ever hack of a blockchain network in terms of value stolen.  Now, almost exactly a year to the day after the Ronin hack made mainstream headlines, Sky Mavis, the company behind Axie Infinity, says it is overhauling Ronin’s core systems to make the network more decentralized and less susceptible to the kinds of single points of failure that doomed it last year. Along with the upgrade, Sky Mavis says it has partnered with other game development studios to build out the Axie universe and expand Ronin to new blockchain-based video games.  A year on from the attack, “I think we see the incident as a badge of honor,” Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin told CoinDesk. “We've seen so many projects crumble under adversity this year, so we're really proud to be here and to be building.”  New year, new Ronin  Axie Infinity was among the first breakout “play-to-earn” web3 games, allowing players to earn crypto and trade in-game items via blockchain. According to Sky Mavis, the game has earned $1.3 billion in revenue since it launched in 2018.  Axie Infinity initially lived on Ethereum, but the chain’s relatively high fees and sluggishness presented challenges to Axie's growth and accessibility. These issues were the initial impetus behind Ronin – a faster, cheaper “sidechain” that can swap assets with Ethereum but has its own app ecosystem and security apparatus.  Ronin’s upgrade will change the consensus mechanism used to operate the network – transitioning the chain from “proof-of-authority” to “delegated proof-of-stake.”  Under the old system, the Ronin network was secured by a small group of entities hand-picked by Sky Mavis. The small group tasked with securing Ronin in its early days is partially to blame for leaving it vulnerable to attack last year.  The new system will allow users to “stake” some of Ronin’s RON tokens to earn interest and help curate the set of validators that operate the network. “Now, anyone with a minimum of 250K RON can become a validator and take part in block production,” Sky Mavis said in a statement. “At the same time, any RON holder can stake their tokens and participate in validator selection.”  RON was trading at $1.12 at press time, according to CoinGecko, meaning one would need a minimum of over $250,000 to be eligible to become a validator.  Ronin’s place in the Ethereum scaling race  The Ronin upgrade comes as a new class of Ethereum scaling chains, called layer 2 rollups, are aiming to solve some of the same goals that the gaming-focused Ronin chain initially set out to achieve: lower fees and quicker transactions. Some of these chains specifically target gaming as a potential use case.  These networks have systems, moreover, that will eventually allow them to borrow Ethereum’s native security – meaning they won’t rely on the sort of cross-chain bridge technology that was targeted in last year’s Ronin hack.  Read more: Ronin Attack Shows Cross-Chain Crypto Is a ‘Bridge’ Too Far  Ronin’s builders say it will be a while until a game as large as Axie Infinity would be able to safely shift to one of these more cutting-edge scaling chains, however. “They're the innovators when it comes to doing the work that will get us to a more decentralized and scalable future,” said Zirlin. “But there's still work to be done. It's not a solved problem.”  Zirlin noted that Sky Mavis worked to reimburse users of last year’s hack (albeit a few months later, at discounted crypto values) and took other technical steps – beyond upgrading Ronin’s consensus mechanism – to prevent similar attacks from taking place in the future. “We've also hardened Sky Mavis's internal security measures, increased the headcount of our security team, and upgraded our on-chain monitoring,” he added.  Moving beyond Axie  Sky Mavis has worked over the past year to expand the Axie ecosystem past its original playing-card-style video game, which has seen a huge hit to its popularity over the past several months. (The game had 400,000 active users in the past 30 days, compared to nearly 3 million users during its 2022 peak, according to ActivePlayer.)  The player decline can be traced, in part, to the wider crypto market crash, which took a pounding on Axie’s in-game economy. But Sky Mavis might also have itself to blame for Axie’s falling user count; while the game has a dedicated fanbase, it has long faced criticism from players who say its once-lucrative “play-to-earn” mechanics masked dull gameplay and an exploitative economic model.  Sky Mavis has worked to improve upon Axie’s core gameplay over the past year with big upgrades and new game modes, but the long-term vision for Ronin always involved expanding beyond the Axie IP.  The new teams building games on Ronin include Tribes Studio, Bali Games, Directive Games and Bowled.io – studios that staff alums of DICE, LucasArts, Square Enix, and Ubisoft among other AAA game-makers.  “Selected partner studios have the opportunity to access Axie IP for their titles or build entirely new games with distinct IP on top of Ronin.” Sky Mavis explained in a statement.  “We're really building out this ecosystem of infinite experiences,” said Zirlin. “With this upgrade to Ronin and the announcement of these game studios, we're showing that we're expanding the Axie universe. We're also now going beyond Axie, to incubating and really becoming this launchpad for the best and most thoughtful web3 gaming experiences.”  CORRECTION (March 30, 2023 10:08 UTC): A previous version of this article misidentified Machines Arena, a video game, as a game studio.",POSITIVE,RON,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | RON,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/30/axie-infinitys-ronin-blockchain-overhauls-tech-expands-to-new-ip-on-anniversary-of-600m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afea30dc26b76fb46bdeed2078d1620b1fcaf441-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A digital yen pilot program involving the BOJ and other financial stakeholders starts at the same time.

42387791,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtMgT,1680166345,XRP Trading Volumes Surges to Billions of Dollars on South Korean Crypto Exchanges,"The South Korean crypto trading mania has seemingly returned, fueled by a surge in XRP tokens.  Trading volume for XRP spiked to billions of dollars on UpBit, Bithumb and Korbit, three of Korea's top exchanges by volume, on the back of the token's 26% rise in the past week.  In the past 24 hours, XRP trading made up 37% of all volume on Bithumb, 18% of volume on UpBit and a staggering 50% of all volume on Korbit, data from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap shows. These volumes were against the U.S. dollar on UpBit and against the Korean won on Bithumb and Korbit.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) usually account for the majority of the trading activity on these exchanges, which makes the XRP volume surge an anomaly.  UpBit led global XRP trading volumes with over $790 million worth of tokens traded in the past 24 hours. Crypto exchange Binance, in comparison, traded a relatively smaller $720 million, CoinGecko data shows.  In crypto circles, South Korean traders are infamous for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens. The so-called Kimchi Premium originates from the region – where prices of bitcoin on local exchanges can trade at a premium of as much as 30% compared to international counterparts, driven by local demand.  Some of that volume may be attributable to wash trading, a manipulative technique where in a traders continually buy and sell the same asset to drive up volumes in order to create a false impression of market activity.  The interest in XRP comes amid speculation that the token might be classified as a commodity by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), after the CFTC classified bitcoin and ether as commodities in a lawsuit against Binance.  This in turn may hurt the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) case against Ripple in which the regulator claims that XRP tokens are securities. Classification as a commodity could mean Ripple wins the case – which some traders consider bullish for XRP.  ""The bullish impulse stems from Ripple's case versus the SEC, where optimism for Ripple's win seems to be becoming more dominant,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a market update on Wednesday  ""Maybe that Ripple win sets off a bullish impulse down the risk curve (alt season),"" Harland added.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/30/xrp-trading-volumes-surges-to-billions-of-dollars-on-south-korean-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0132a45bf2da5fbd328b67d1ca9912bac1826873-2937x1652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price briefly crossed $29,000 on Thursday before retracting to trade around $28,500. Major tokens such as ether (ETH) and XRP fell over 24 hours, pausing a multiday rally.  On-chain data suggests some traders and whales – a colloquial term for holders of large amounts of tokens – are taking profits after weeks of gains, which may fuel a decline in the coming days.  “On-chain data shows three conditions that are worth noting in the context of bitcoin's current rally,” analytics firm CryptoQuant said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  “Short-term holders are taking profits at the highest profit margin in more than a year. There’s a recent increase in spending activity in large bitcoin holders (whales) and a slight decrease in their holdings. And price valuation momentum is increasing to overvaluation territory,” the note said.  Data from CryptoQuant's Short Term Output Profit Ratio tool, which calculates the ratio of price received/price paid for assets held between one hour and 155 days, spiked above 1 in the past week, indicating investors were probably selling token holdings at a profit.  Data tracking whale wallets showed over 320,000 bitcoin were moved, or spent, by large entities in the past week.

The company also acquired an additional 6,455 BTC in Q1 2023 to bring its total holdings to 138,955. MicroStrategy is positioning itself for a massive bullish move leading up to the next crypto bull run even though the company diluted shareholders in the process. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) shares have been on an absolute tear so far in 2023 ever since I previous wrote about MSTR stock on January 6th, 2023 when MSTR traded at $160. MSTR stock is up 75% YTD and the entire narrative surrounding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has changed drastically since my previous MSTR article. Data by YCharts The 2023 Banking Crises Explains the Case for Bitcoin The 2023 banking crisis explains why so many people worldwide are turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven when banks collapse and play risky games with their customer's deposits. Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse are the biggest banks to collapse in 2023 but I think there will be several more bank failures in the next several months. US banks have over $600 billion in unrealized losses and that number should continue climbing as long as the Fed refuses to lower interest rates. MicroStrategy's Q4 2022 Results and Recent Bitcoin Purchases Let's be honest: most of us are holding MicroStrategy stock for its Bitcoin holdings and aren't too worried about how the underlying company is performing in the short term. MSTR shares were literally left for dead over nearly 2 decades until Michael Saylor became a Bitcoin maximalist and held BTC on MicroStrategy's balance sheet in 2020. MicroStrategy did pretty well in Q4 2022 as Phong Le began transitioning well into his new role as CEO of the company. Total revenue hit $132.6 million in Q4 2022 while net income reached $193.7 million for the quarter. Impairment charge on the company's Bitcoin holdings made up $197.6 million of the quarterly losses so MicroStrategy's core business made a small net profit of $3.9 million. Since my last MSTR article, MicroStrategy has bought the dip and acquired more Bitcoin at very attractive long term prices. In Q4 2022, MicroStrategy purchased 3,204 Bitcoin at an average price of $17,616 per coin. So far in Q1 2023, MicroStrategy purchased 6,455 Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $23,238. Both of these purchases are far below the company's total Bitcoin acquisition price of $29,817, which helped lower MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin cost basis. Each MSTR share holds around 0.0128 BTC respectively, which makes MicroStrategy a solid alternative to buying Bitcoin outright or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). Why MicroStrategy Repaid Its Silvergate Loan For those of you wondering about the $205 million Silvergate loan, MicroStrategy paid off the entire loan at a 20% discount to move on from the bankrupt crypto bank. Silvergate is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and could use any form of cash at this moment to help settle with its depositors. MicroStrategy saved $44 million by paying the loan early, which was due to mature in 2025. The only downside is that MicroStrategy offered 1.3 million new shares to repay the Silvergate loan and acquire more Bitcoin. As far as I know, the MicroStrategy stock sale was diluted by 10% to 10.5 million as of Q1 2023. It's not an ideal situation but the company made a smart move by paying off its Silvergate loan and buying the recent Bitcoin dip. Bitcoin is a deflationary asset that continues gaining in value as the US dollar loses purchasing power. A lot of people are aware of Bitcoin's potential due to the recent banking crisis and I think Bitcoiners are pretty excited as we approach the 2024 halving around 13 months from now. Risk Factors Bitcoin has performed well year to date but nothing is guaranteed in such a tough economic climate. The biggest risk would be Bitcoiners losing trust in Bitcoin and moving to another cryptocurrency or asset class. MicroStrategy doesn't have any major debt commitments until 2025 so the company looks pretty safe right now financially. What's Next for MicroStrategy? I wouldn't worry about the recent dilution now because MicroStrategy killed two birds with 1 stone by eliminating its Silvergate loan and acquiring more Bitcoin at a lower than average cost basis price. The global banking sector is facing major turmoil and that's a good sign for Bitcoin in the long term. I still believe the crypto bull market run will began in April 2023 as more bank failures and bailouts put fear in the entire global economy. For now, I'm holding my MicroStrategy shares and waiting patiently for the next Bitcoin halving to consider taking some profits off the table.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591143-microstrategy-buying-the-bitcoin-dip-was-a-smart-move?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11209692.jpeg

Shortly after the collapse of FTX, a hacker siphoned $600 million from its wallets, leading to fears that FTX accounts on other exchanges were compromised.
