42402576,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgnn,1549321245,A Court Date for QuadrigaCX: What to Expect at Today's Hearing,"The troubled crypto exchange QuadrigaCX has appealed for creditor protection, setting the stage for a significant court hearing on Feb. 5 in Canada.  Last Thursday, the exchange's appeal was made before the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, with QuadrigaCX claiming that doesn't have access to wallets containing some $137 million (U.S. dollars) in cryptocurrency. As such, it has claimed to be unable to repay more than 115,000 customers who are owed funds – and creditor protection is being sought to forestall any lawsuits while it attempts to find a solution.  To that end, QuadrigaCX is seeking to have professional services firm EY oversee its proceedings. Tuesday's hearing, at 830 a.m. EST, will see the companies go before the court.  Christine Duhaime, a financial crimes attorney and managing partner with Duhaime Law, told CoinDesk that the most likely outcome during the hearing will be that a monitor – in this case, likely Ernst and Young – will be appointed.  Quadriga’s filing was not just for a monitor, however. Applying for creditor protection means it is trying to prevent customers from suing to recover lost funds, she noted.  Duhaime explained:  “There are many unanswered questions though, for example, why have the wallet addresses not been disclosed? As you know in Bitcoin world, people know the pooled wallet addresses of exchanges – its not confidential or business information so that’s an unanswered question that a Court eventually will have to address. Someone is eventually going to bring an application for disclosure of all the wallet addresses.”  “Transparency is going to be critical for Quadriga and providing the wallets addresses is the first step to transparency,” she added.  EY proposal  The professional services firm EY has already submitted an initial report after discussing the situation with QuadrigaCX, according to a filing obtained by CoinDesk.  “The Proposed Monitor understands that Quadriga is experiencing a liquidity crisis and has been unable to satisfy withdrawal requests from users. Additionally, Quadriga has been unable to locate a significant amount of cryptocurrency following the death of the Applicants’ founder and Chief Executive Officer, Gerald Cotten,” the filing states.  The filing notes that the company has not yet been able to verify the details included in Quadriga’s initial filing, though it “has assumed the integrity and truthfulness of the information and explanations provided to it.”  In its report, EY explains that a number of factors resulted in Quadriga’s current issues, including its lack of a corporate bank account and Cotten’s death.  Most notably, EY has recommended that Quadriga maintain the suspension of its website. The exchange first took down its trading platform last week, after voting in new directors to run the company.  The firm has also recommended that Quadriga receive creditor protection under the Canadian Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act.  Doing so, it explains, will allow for a full investigation of the exchange and its business, which will determine what assets are available for distribution and what is actually owed to users (in its report, EY claims that Quadriga only owes funds to 92,000 users – far fewer than the exchange's claim of 115,000 users).  Plan pitched  If granted, Quadriga has a rough plan to operate through the next 13 weeks, or until April 28, the EY report says.  Duhaime noted that unless customers or shareholders have an opportunity to file affidavits or other submissions prior to the hearing opposing this protection, it is likely that Quadriga will receive the court's approval.  Customers can appeal this decision, “and they can take action to protect their interests and seek the return of their funds"" – but that would be dependent on the order issued Tuesday, she explained.  Duhaime did question why Quadriga filed for creditor protection in Nova Scotia, rather than British Columbia, where the companies affiliated with the exchange are registered.  “One of Quadriga’s new directors is resident in British Columbia. Quadriga’s only known former accountant and auditing firm is in British Columbia. One of the [companies] is cease traded in British Columbia which means that the British Columbia Securities Commission has jurisdiction over that company. Its corporate records are in British Columbia. Most of its shareholders are in British Columbia and a sophisticated transfer agent in British Columbia, is in charge of shareholder matters for that company,” she noted, adding:  “In my opinion, I cannot see a Nova Scotia judge, if he or she is apprised of all of the actual matrix regarding the connections to BC, concluding that a Nova Scotia Court has jurisdiction. It may happen that a Nova Scotia Court accepts jurisdiction but usually a Judge would ask the party to prove the jurisdiction issue, especially in this case where the applicant is seeking an order to prevent litigation so the rights of parties across the country are affected.”  Funds recovery  The most important issue in the case revolves around the wallet addresses, Duhaime said. As far as Quadriga is concerned, the most important priority should be “making [customers] whole.”  EY's report says there are two initial sources of funds that can be recovered quickly: the cash held by Quadriga's payment processor in the form of bank drafts, and any cryptos or fiat held by third-parties.  The company may also look into selling the QCX trading platform, as it is potentially ""a saleable asset of considerable value.""  As these sources of funds are liquidated, the company added, it will hire ""cryptocurrency forensic advisors"" to try and locate or access the missing coins.  Duhaime noted that in other cases, an exchange might track wallet addresses and have other exchanges it is working with freeze any activity to preserve funds. But that has not happened with Quadriga.  Quadriga has also not yet asked for a court order to freeze its assets as a form of protection for customers.  ""People may query why a freezing order makes sense but if you are an exchange and your wallets with all your funds are suddenly not accessible, wouldn’t you rush to get a court order to stop anyone else from possibly spending those funds or transferring them to other parties?"" she told CoinDesk.

The news of the hires – first reported by Cheddar – demonstrates that the social media company is moving ahead with its blockchain ambitions, which were first revealed last May with the announcement of a new, dedicated blockchain unit.  The researchers behind Chainspace may be well suited to help Facebook scale blockchain across a range of applications. According to its website, Chainspace uses sharding – the process of breaking a database into smaller units – to alleviate the scaling problems faced by blockchain networks.  Four out of the five researchers behind the academic paper on which Chainspace is based will be joining Facebook, according to Cheddar. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the startup itself or its technology weren't acquired, but that some of its staffers had joined Facebook's internal blockchain group.  “Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don’t have anything further to share.”  The social media giant is currently hiring for 11 blockchain roles, according to Facebook's careers site. That's up from five last December. According to job-description boilerplate, Facebook's blockchain team operates as ""a startup within Facebook,"" adding:  ""Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don't have now – that could be things like healthcare, equitable financial services, or new ways to save or share information.""  The Chainspace website currently lists 11 staffers and four advisors on its team page. Currently sitting atop the site's homepage is a message teasing Monday's news: ""We're excited to announce that the team is moving on to something new.""

42402598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXh1Z,1549308338,BitTorrent Token Is Already Nearly 6 Times Its ICO Price,"The price of BitTorrent Token (BTT) is closing in on six times the price of its initial coin offering (ICO), which occurred just one week ago.  59.8 billion BTT tokens were sold through Binance's token sale platform on Jan. 28 at a price of $0.00012 per token, according to sale information provided by the exchange.  Up nearly 40 percent today alone, BTT is now trading at a considerably higher price of $0.000798 - representing a 565 percent increase from its ICO price, Coinmarketcap data reveals.  That sale sold out in minutes, prompting complaints from users who were unable to make purchases due to technical issues. In an attempt to compensate for the technical difficulties, the BitTorrent Foundation completed an airdrop of 5,000 tokens to each user unable to participate in the ICO.  The token sale came months after BitTorrent was acquired by Tron last summer, and weeks after a new cryptocurrency was announced that would be integrated with BitTorrent's peer-to-peer file-sharing tech. That acquisition led to criticism and some staff exits, and the unveiling of the BitTorrent Token has drawn its share of critique as well.  Since the token sale, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have listed BTT for trading. The largest markets for the token thus far are UpBit and Binance, which combined account for more than 90 percent of BTT’s $270 million total trading volume in the past 24 hours.  Given the state of the broader cryptocurrency market, BTT’s recent performance is an outlier. The seven-day return for BTT since the ICO accounts for near 600 percent.

42402592,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgzb,1549294220,"Venezuela's Crypto Exchanges, Miners Must Register Under New Rules","Venezuela has issued new rules for crypto service providers in the country, including exchange platforms and miners.  The country’s Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and Information (MIPPCI) published an official gazette last week that included the “Constituent Decree on the Integral System of Crypto Assets.” The publication in effect activated a new regulatory framework that means businesses working with crypto assets will now have to register with Sunacrip, the country’s superintendency of crypto-related activities.  Sunacrip will now establish the registration requirements and processes, and accordingly inform affected businesses, the gazette states. Those who will not register face a penalty equivalent to 100–300 petros, the country's national cryptocurrency.  As a result of the decree, the regulator has now become the highest crypto authority in Venezuela, with powers ranging from day-to-day oversight to administrative-level execution of plans and programs.  The decree lists a total of 63 articles, covering definitions of crypto terms, Sunacrip's remit, businesses' registration and audit requirements, penalties for non-compliance or criminal behavior, and more.  Sunacrip will henceforth carry out the inspection and auditing of crypto companies and can revoke licenses if they are found to be non-compliant or a danger to the public. Crypto firms found non-compliant with the new rules face imprisonment of one to three years and a penalty equivalent to 50–100 petros. Mining rigs can also be seized with the agency retaining the equipment.  The government has indicated previously that it may limit the number of crypto exchanges that are allowed to operate in the country.  Venezuela is notably one of the only nations to have launched a national cryptocurrency, and U.S. President Donald Trump ordered sanctions against the petro in March 2018, soon after it launched.  Nicolas Maduro, the nation's president, has since made a number of efforts aimed to force the adoption of the oil-backed petro, both at home and abroad.  Back in December, Maduro said that the nation would move to sidestep the U.S. dollar and use petros for oil sales starting this year, soon after adding plans to appeal to OPEC for the token to become the ""digital currency for oil.""  The country has also reportedly begun converting pension and salaries into petro from its fiat currency, the sovereign bolivar. Venezuela started selling petro to citizens last October via a government portal. Further, banks have been ordered to use the token, as have some businesses.

42402591,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgyc,1549288846,Binance's Crypto Winter Strategy: Build and Beef Up Partnerships,"Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange Binance has an ambitious mandate for its 400 employees in 2019: leverage industry partnerships to diversify the brand beyond its primary trading platform.  Trust Wallet, which Binance acquired last summer, recently joined the Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO), CoinDesk has learned. The coalition includes the exchange ShapeShift, and wallet startups BRD and MyCrypto, among many others. Guided by the foundation’s instigator, a Denver-based startup called Dapix, the coalition plans to build a protocol to standardize crypto wallet addresses across currencies and platforms.  Boosters say this protocol could eventually introduce new features to the broader fintech ecosystem, such as giving e-commerce platforms the ability to refund crypto purchases directly to a personal wallet and users the ability to send payment requests using someone’s email, comparable to apps like Venmo.  “The wallets and exchanges will be able to participate significantly in [FIO] block production,” FIO founder David Gold told CoinDesk. Since the protocol has a native token for processing fees, scheduled for beta testing later this year, Gold says the value proposition for participating exchanges is clear: “They get income from being a block-producing node on the network.”  Binance chief growth officer Ted Lin said that revenue has slowed during the market downturn, but the exchange is still profitable and doesn’t currently plan to shore up a venture capital “war chest” the way Coinbase, its Silicon Valley competitor, did with a $300 million fundraise last October.  Although it would probably take years for FIO to potentially offer Binance a significant revenue stream, Lin said the exchange’s bear market strategy is to focus on projects with long-term payoffs.  “It will ultimately come down to impact,” Lin said, describing how Binance prioritizes partnerships. “What else can we do to remove the roadblocks?”  All of this wallet infrastructure is leading up to the launch of Binance’s decentralized exchange, or DEX, later this year. Trust Wallet will be the first mobile crypto wallet to support integration with the DEX and the updated token.  Stepping back, Binance’s initial coin offering (ICO) asset BNB, which gave the startup its initial $15 million funding in 2017, is currently ethereum-based until Binance’s unique blockchain also launches later this year. Lin said pushing broader BNB adoption is another way to complement the upcoming DEX.  “If the technology requires five years of the entire ecosystem working together to create a better alternative, then we better start now,” Lin said.  Wallet usability  In the meantime, standardizing addresses and messaging software should reduce the risk of human errors while sending and receiving crypto.  This was particularly appealing to Binance because one of its growth strategies is extending its reach among the crypto-curious with fewer technical skills. That’s why the exchange also launched the educational portal Binance Academy in December 2018, with hundreds of introductory videos and articles translated by volunteers into 15 languages.  Gold said Binance has one of the biggest global user bases, over 10 million exchange accounts and 150,000 Trust Wallet downloads, according to the company’s 2018 statistics. As such, Gold says Binance is uniquely positioned to help FIO facilitate global adoption.  “[User-experience issues] can’t be solved by any individual wallet or exchange,” Gold said. “It has to be solved between them.”  Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko told CoinDesk that FIO complements Binance’s broader push to open source the wallet’s code so external developers can add support for almost any crypto, beyond the 15 tokens Trust Wallet now supports.  Standardizing software with tools like the FIO protocol could give fans of niche assets the option to enable Trust Wallet support with the same level of security and usability across platforms.  “Last year we were really focused on ethereum,” Radchenko said. “We realized there are lots of blockchains and there are going to be lots of different use cases with people with different understandings of crypto.”  Referring to a scaling update called SegWit that improves transaction efficiency, he added:  “It’s really important for everyone to stay on the same page … most of the bitcoin wallets don’t even support SegWit. That’s really bad.”  With pivotal wallet updates and a DEX on the way, BNB is the third Binance product that lends itself to helping the exchange form deeper industry ties.  Other partnerships  Beyond the Trust Wallet acquisition, Binance also invested $2.5 million in the airline payments startup TravelbyBit in 2018. This external company is now one out of many that Binance is partnering with to give BNB holders places to spend their tokens.  Late last year, Lin said Binance started reaching out to industry players to see if they would accept BNB payments or offer discounts to BNB users.  “We now receive multiple requests per day asking to incorporate BNB into their product or service,” Lin said.  In late December, the eco-friendly impact investing startup Moeda joined those ranks by enabling BNB contributions to its loan programs, where global investors issue short-term crypto loans to small businesses in developing nations. One such project, Cooperval Craft Beerhttps://moedaseeds.mybluemix.net/7a1e1a65-7d0f-446d-801f-edbf7e77407e run by a family farm in Brazil, repaid its first $8,000 loan in December.  According to Moeda co-founder Isa Yu, each of the roughly 15 international investors who contributed to that transparent loan, using BNB or Moeda’s ICO token MDA and a Brazilian real–pegged version called MDABRL for local accounting, received $800 return on their investments.  “You can choose to get out of the ecosystem by converting to MDA and trading on Binance,” Yu told CoinDesk. “Or you can choose to reinvest the MDABRL.”  There are already two more similar projects in Brazil now gathering $20,000 in crypto loans from more than 50 investors. Yu said Moeda plans to partner with Binance and expand the platform to nearly 200 projects receiving an average of $25,000 each by 2020.  “We want to work with them [Binance] closely to help the projects to grow and focus on different geographic regions,” Yu said.  Yet again, this shows how Binance looks to offer shopping and investment opportunities beyond standard cryptocurrency trades. Plus, educational initiatives at Binance Academy aim to attract newbies while the prices are low, potentially converting them into exchange users if prices spike again.  Speaking to Binance’s goals for BNB, including ongoing partnerships like Moeda and temporal events such as a discounted sale day at the Singaporean store SK Jewelry, Lin said:  “It’s showing the possibility of alternative payment methods that regular people who haven’t touched crypto are able to witness. … This has actually opened up a lot of proactive participation.”  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/04/binances-crypto-winter-strategy-build-and-beef-up-partnerships,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c97003be1d0d4e33ab1ad0dac9bb4a83f58fad76-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42402588,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdXgwe,1549288836,Kraken Acquires Futures Startup In Deal Worth At Least $100 Million,"Cryptocurrency exchange services provider Kraken has officially acquired regulated futures trading startup Crypto Facilities in an undisclosed deal valued at least $100 million.  Announced Monday, the “nine-figure"" acquisition, the largest seen in the industry so far in 2019, will enable Kraken customers to trade spot, as well as open positions offering exposure to the future price movements of cryptocurrencies, all through a unified trading interface.  As such, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell framed the merger as one that would “massively accelerate” his company’s roadmap, enabling the San Francisco-based startup to sidestep years of efforts to obtain the licenses and approvals necessary to offer a competing service in Europe.  Founded in 2014, Crypto Facilities is registered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the deal was approved by the regulator, the parties involved said.  In addition to offering cash-settled futures trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, XRP, litecoin and ether trading pairs, Crypto Facilities notably provides data to the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, an index created in collaboration with CME Group and that powers that entity's U.S. futures offering, a relationship that will continue following the acquisition.  Powell told CoinDesk:  “The deal brings our total developer team to over 100, and will accelerate Crypto Facilities by enabling us to add more assets. We plan to launch more contracts in the medium-term and Kraken also has plans to launch more assets.”  Crypto Facilities CEO Timo Schlaefer will continue on at Kraken following the exit, retaining his title of CEO. The firm will remain an independent entity within the larger Kraken Group, the exchange’s umbrella company. Further, the subsidiary overseeing the index will also remain a separate entity within the larger framework of entities.  All 25 Crypto Facilities employees, Schlaefer said, will continue on with the company.  Looking forward, Powell added that he hopes the merger will help Kraken better compete within an increasingly competitive global exchange landscape. “The objective we have is to build the most liquid futures exchange,” he said.  Powell and Schlaefer also stressed the benefits futures trading would bring for customers, as they will now be able to trade futures on nights and weekends, extending beyond the 9-to-5 trading hours of current U.S.-based offerings.  “You can margin in real time, you don't have to provision for gap risk overnight or over the weekends, you can take less margin which is more capital efficient,” Schlaefer said.  Focused on traders  Stepping back, Powell framed the acquisition as one that aligns with Kraken’s desire to stay tightly focused on the needs of exchange customers, a select group of which the company is now courting as part of its next major fundraising.  Toward this, Powell voiced his aspiration that he’d like to continue the strategy, avoiding taking on additional venture capital and instead aligning financially with its user base.  Said Powell:  “The reasons to not do more VC is that we don't really need the money, and longer term it makes sense for the business to be majority owned by the users. We'd eventually like to have our interests aligned with users.""  According to Kraken, the funding round, which would value the company at $4 billion, is set to close within weeks. Still ongoing, Powell said, is an effort to see if smaller exchange traders, those with less than $100,000 to allocate, could be allowed into the round in some way.  Even if the funding is yet to close, however, the reason for the financing is more certain, with Powell indicating a desire to use the money to complete additional acquisitions, estimating one to two more deals could take place over the course of 2019.  Future acquisitions could add to the exchange’s user base or product offerings.  Notably, the completed merger comes at a time when Kraken is also in the midst of a wider overhaul of its existing user interface, an initial version of which was released last week.  Crowded market  In conversation, Powell also spoke in more detail about how he believes the merger will position Kraken in what over the past few years has become a more competitive market for companies that provide consumers with the means to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.  In addition to exchanges like Kraken, in which users can buy and sell such assets for fiat currencies, Powell noted the development of platforms like Binance that have grown more quickly by sidestepping interactions with regulators.  “They’re not in the U.S., they're not dealing with regulation, they're not hooked up with banks,” Powell said of the difference between the firms.  More appropriate competitors, Powell suggested would be Luxembourg-based Bitstamp and Coinbase, the latter of which, while based in the U.S. has expanded services in Europe. (Kraken will not allow U.S. exchange users to engage in futures trading.)

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office announced Friday that Dawson Bakies, a resident of Ohio, is charged with stealing identities and the cryptocurrency holdings of over 50 victims across the U.S. from October to December last year via SIM-swapping attacks. The indictment lists 52 counts of “identity theft, grand larceny, computer tampering, and scheme to defraud” among other charges, according to the announcement.  “The indictment represents the first prosecution for SIM swapping by authorities in New York,"" the Attorney's Office said.  It is alleged that Bakies fraudulently linked victims' cellphone numbers to multiple iPhones owned by him, using them to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to access victims’ online accounts, including Google and cryptocurrency platforms. Among those, he managed to access 18 online accounts belonging to three Manhattan-based victims and stole about $10,000 in cryptos. He also attempted to extort one of the victims by demanding a bitcoin ransom, according to the Attorney's Office.  Manhattan authorities recovered an iPhone 6 used in Bakies' SIM-swapping fraud, which had “dozens” of text messages containing recovery passwords related to the victims’ online accounts. They also recovered a laptop that contained victims' personal information, including the three targeted in Manhattan.  Sending a warning to SIM swappers, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., said:  “We know what you’re doing, we know how to find you, and we will hold you criminally accountable, no matter where you are.”  He also called on wireless carriers to ""wake up to the new reality that by quickly porting SIMs – in order to ease new activations and provide speedy customer service – you are exposing unwitting, law-abiding customers to massive identity theft and fraud.""  SIM-swap crypto hacks are on the rise. On Friday, a 20-year-old accused of stealing over $5 million in cryptocurrency via SIM-swap hack reportedly pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Back in November, U.S.-based law firm Silver Miller filed arbitration claims against AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of victims of SIM-swapping cellphone hacks. It said at the time that one of its clients had lost over $621,000 in cryptocurrency via SIM-swap attack.

42402572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlvh,1549278931,Bitcoin Price Charts Offer Glimmer of Hope to Struggling Bulls,"View  Bitcoin has charted a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. A break above $3,450 would confirm a wedge breakout and expose key resistance lined up at $3,658 (the high of the gravestone doji candle created on Jan. 26). A violation there would expose the psychological resistance of $4,000.  The prospects of a falling wedge breakout would weaken if the cryptocurrency suffers a channel breakdown on the 4-hour chart.  The slow drip bitcoin (BTC) price sell-off seen over the last six weeks has produced a bullish pattern on the daily chart.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently down more than 20 percent from highs above $4,200 seen on Dec. 24. The pullback may have reinforced the primary bearish trend, as represented by the long-term moving average studies.  Still, all is not lost for the bulls, as the lower highs and lower lows created over the last six weeks have converged, creating a downward sloping cone or a falling wedge on the daily chart.  The falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, that is, the price will often break above the upper edge of the pattern and rally. A breakout, if confirmed, could open the doors for a strong corrective move.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.66 percent drop on the day. The falling wedge resistance is seen at $3,450.  Daily and 4-hour chart  BTC is trapped in a falling wedge – a bullish reversal setup – on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has created a minor rising channel inside the wedge, as seen in the 4-hour chart.  The prospects of BTC confirming a falling wedge breakout above $3,450 would drop if the current 4-hour candle closes below the rising channel support of $3,410. That would open up downside towards $3,314 (200-week moving average).  A wedge breakout, if confirmed, would allow a rally toward $3,658 - the high of the bearish gravestone doji candle created on Jan. 26.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south indicating a bearish setup. The falling volume bars, however, signal bearish exhaustion. BTC, therefore, could witness a falling wedge breakout, despite the bearish primary trend.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Announcing the partnership on Thursday, Bitfury said a series of mining centers will be set up in the South American country using its BlockBox AC bitcoin mining devices. Further, the mines will be powered by two major hydroelectric power plants, Itaipu and Yacyreta.  The collaboration is a part of Commons Foundation’s Golden Goose project, backed by the government of Paraguay, which aims to establish the area as world’s largest crypto mining center given the country’s ample supply of cheap and clean electricity.  Paraguay currently only utilizes roughly half of the electricity produced by the two plants, according to Bitfury.  Sandra Otazú Vera, a senior staff attorney in Paraguay and advisor to Commons Foundation, said that Paraguay is exploring ""creative ways to use emerging technologies, like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, to benefit their economy and their citizens.”  Commons Foundation is also planning to launch a cryptocurrency exchange in Paraguay later this year. The platform will integrate Bitfury’s compliance analytics platform Crystal, according to the announcement.  Bitfury, which specializes in manufacturing crypto mining infrastructure and also mines itself, is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) in Amsterdam, London or Hong Kong, possibly to be held early this year.

42402567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdQlpn,1549267239,The Crypto-Surveillance Capitalism Connection,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    Don’t look now, but there’s an elephant in the room. Scratch that. It’s an entire herd of elephants.  While Crypto Twitter bickers and fights, leaving competing coin projects and blockchain startups to defend each others’ counter-allegations of centralizing misdeeds, the real centralizing power-mongers of our digital economy have been pillaging our data and reshaping humanity into an instrument of their domination.  That’s the alarming, bold conclusion of “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power,” the recently released mega-tome by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff.  My prediction: this book, which eviscerates the “applied utopianism” and “technological inevitablism” of data-gobbling Silicon Valley titans such as Google and Facebook, will become a defining text of our age. Read it. It is of vital importance.  I especially think it’s critical reading for the crypto community, where people will feel both vindicated and challenged by Zuboff’s thesis.  If blockchain technology is to play an integral role in the evolution of the digital global economy and be a force for good, rather than a vehicle of computerized subjugation, its advocates will have to contend with the angry backlash against digital technologies that this book will help fuel.  How, truly, is blockchain any better than GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple)? How do we ensure that it doesn’t fall for the same pattern of what Zuboff calls “behavioral surplus extraction?"" A general public that's increasingly anxious about their invaded privacy and lost personal agency deserves such questions answered.  Not left, not right  It’s hard to pigeonhole this writer. Zuboff’s instincts are liberal, and she takes a very hard view of raw market power. But her defiant support of the right to individual free will – framed in her elegant phrasing as the right to “sanctuary” and to “the future tense” – dovetails nicely with the views of many pro-privacy advocates in the blockchain community.  The lines between left and right have been blurred for some time. While Zuboff’s no fan of unfettered market capitalism and doesn’t think much of Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist who’s a darling of many bitcoin fans, there’s much that lines up here with the crypto world’s cypherpunk vision of freedom.  To be sure, the solutions are different. A blockchain solution for breaking down surveillance capitalism would naturally be a technological one, embracing the power of math and cryptography to design a new digital topography of trust that disempowers the centralized middleman and creates human agency within a decentralized system.  Zuboff, by contrast, is suspicious of the absolutism of math-based solutions, and focuses instead on the levers of government. And, since she’s very concerned with the complicity of Western governments in encouraging the current model, she first insists on restoring real democracy to change the system from outside the digital realm.  Her most important contribution to our reckoning with this problem is to craft a language with which to describe what has happened to society in the past two decades. Zuboff's task is to get us beyond the pre-existing frames of reference that constrain our ability to define the unprecedented – as when people at the start of the last century described cars as ""horseless carriages.""  Introducing new words and concepts such as “surveillance capitalism,” “instrumentarianism,” “Big Other” and, my favorite, “surveillance-as-a-service,” or SvAAS, she gives people a taxonomy for describing the previously indescribable.  That, in itself, will have powerful ramifications, as it will enable the counterattack from citizens, businesses and governments feeling dislocated by the social dysfunction that shows up in our politics, economic divisions and crumbling bonds of trust.  “If democracy is to be replenished,” Zuboff writes, “it is up to us to rekindle the sense of outrage and loss over what has been taken from us.”  A topic we can't ignore  I personally found many of Zuboff's anti-technology positions too extreme. Whereas she sees the concept of ""hive minds"" as dehumanizing, reducing individuals to automatons, I think it's possible to envisage an information technology-enriched world in which truly autonomous, free-thinking humans more easily come together and collaboratively innovate. The open-source inventiveness of global blockchain development communities speaks directly to this.  But where people like Zuboff matter is that, right or wrong, their words stir discourse and debate. Like it or not, this is going to be a talking point for all of us.  So, if blockchain technology is to be relevant, if its advocates are to rise above the false but, sadly, prevailing mainstream view of them as scam artists and lambo-loving day traders, they will need to insert themselves into the debate.  Some will rightly see an opportunity here for pro-privacy developers. Those building zero-knowledge-proof systems and other privacy-protection layers can talk to a vision of decentralized protocols that both empower individuals to control their own data and prevent the public ledger from becoming a new behavior extraction tool. That's one potential answer to surveillance capitalism.  But it's also important that crypto-savvy businessmen, lawyers, policymakers, academics and journalists are part of this conversation.  How can we ensure that the right regulations, standards, and best-practice norms are installed such that the technology develops on a much healthier trajectory than that with which the current Internet economy has evolved?  Let’s keep our eyes on that ball.  Surveillance camera image via Shutterstock.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.
