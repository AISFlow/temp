42400451,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcEg,1505941547,Swiss Telecom Giant Launches New Blockchain Business,"A major state-owned telecommunications provider in Switzerland has created a new business entity centered around blockchain  Swisscom, according to new reports, has established ""Swisscom Blockchain AG"" to focus on a range of services around the tech. These include enterprise-facing solutions as well as support for companies looking to launch initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The move comes months after the telecom joined the Hyperledger blockchain project. Swisscom is also a member of a Switzerland-based blockchain consortium that also includes exchange operator SIX and Zürcher Kantonalbank, the country’s fourth-largest bank. In January, that group unveiled an ethereum-based trading tool for over-the-counter exchanges.  It's a notable development from an established firm that, from the outset of its formal entry into Hyperledger, has struck an optimistic tone on the tech.  ""We want to provide support as a catalyst with expertise, experience and implementation skills,"" Swisscom's Johannes Höhener said in December.  The firm is being led by Daniel Haudenschild who, according to LinkedIn was previously a partner at advisory firm EY Switzerland. A report from local publication Inside Channels indicates that other staffers from EY have joined the venture, and that Swisscom Blockchain is eyeing a team as a big as 20 people by the end of 2017.

Commissioner Brian Quintenz, the agency announced yesterday, will act as the sponsor for the body, which provides input on various regulatory matters. According to the CFTC, the committee hasn't met since February 2016 – during which time members discussed the impact of blockchain – and Quintenz said he hopes to change this state of affairs.  In both an initial statement and in follow-up remarks, as reported by news service GlobalCapital, Quintenz pointed to distributed ledger tech (DLT) as a key area on the CFTC's radar.  He said in a statement:  ""Crucial and fascinating questions need to be explored and answered in areas like automated trading, distributed ledger technology, data harmonization, and cybersecurity, and I hope that the [committee] will provide leadership on these matters.""  Blockchain, he said during an event on Monday, ""is on the verge of creating a sea change in contract design, reporting and settlement,"" according to GlobalCapital.  Among the CFTC's leadership, Quintenz is far from alone in his blockchain bullishness.  J Christopher Giancarlo, who currently serves as chairman of the CFTC, has said that he believes the US government needs to rethink its approach to blockchain.  ""For regulators, DLT may help transcend the fragmented regulatory structure by providing reference to a single, verified record of all financial transactions across regulated markets,"" he wrote in a CoinDesk op-ed last December. ""In order for this technology to flourish, however, regulators must come together and set uniform principles to encourage DLT investment and innovation.""

42400444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc1t,1505928649,"Banks Are 'Afraid' of Bitcoin, Says Wealth Advisor","Banks are likely ""afraid"" of bitcoin and blockchain, a wealth advisor said today.  Speaking with CNBC, Rainer Michael Preiss, executive director for Singapore-based Taurus Wealth Advisors, made his argument in the wake of comments from JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon, who declared bitcoin ""a fraud"" earlier this month and predicted that it would ""blow up"".  Preiss, according to the publication, said:  ""Of course, if you run a very large U.S. bank, most probably you are afraid of blockchain and bitcoin.""  As for why investors are interested in the cryptocurrency, Preiss suggested that it had to do with fears around the US Federal Reserve and concerns about the integrity of its balance sheet after years of supporting global markets.  ""The concerns are about the fractional reserve banking system, and the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve at $4.5 trillion, where the Fed officially refuses an audit,"" he told CNBC. ""On the other hand, on the bitcoin blockchain, you have an audit everyday because it's open-sourced.""  Press' supportive comments stand in sharp contrast with Dimon's, who predicted in 2015 that bitcoin would fail. Others, in recent days, have cast a critical eye on the overall cryptocurrency market, with Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund, remarking earlier this week that ""bitcoin is a bubble.""

42400442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc5p,1505925033,Japanese Billionaire: ICOs 'Democratize Venture Financing',"A Japanese billionaire and venture capitalist said this week that he believes initial coin offerings (ICOs) will become a significant source of funding for startups in the future.  Speaking with CNBC amidst the Singapore Week of Innovation & Technology, Taizo Son remarked that that ICOs – through which cryptographic tokens are sold in an effort to bootstrap a blockchain network – could be ""major methods"" for startups to access capital.  He told the publication:  ""[ICOs are] very good because they democratize venture financing for not only professionals like venture capitalists, but also individuals can participate in exciting projects from start-ups to support.""  Son is perhaps best known as the founder and current chairman of GungHo, a major Japanese gaming company that has released games like Puzzle & Dragons and Ragnarok Online. He also founded Mistletoe, a venture capital firm focused on early-stage startups.  His comments are notable given recent reports that Japanese officials are said to be moving closer toward new regulations around the funding model.  According to Nikkei, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is currently weighing how to go about overseeing ICOs in the country. The FSA has played a leading role in developing rules for cryptocurrencies in Japan, and the developments come after Japan officially classified bitcoin as a kind of payment instrument.

42400454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcHd,1505921709,"OmiseGo's ICO Token Is Tops in Market Cap, But Heavy On the Charts","Despite a mostly positive news flow, the outlook for the ICO token with the largest market capitalization is decidedly mixed.  The OmiseGo-US dollar (OMG/USD) exchange rate has witnessed wild swings this month as China's ICO crackdown and subsequent exchange ban rocked the cryptocurrency markets. OMG, however, was particularly affected by both moves, owing to its status as one of the more valuable cryptocurrency networks to have originated in an ICO and mainstream visibility.  Against this backdrop, the digital asset clocked a record high of $13.70 on September 12 and fell to a low of $6.50 on September 15. Overall, though, the 52.55% drop from the record highs has been short lived, as prices have recovered to $11.40 earlier this week as cryptocurrencies in general regained poise.  The recovery in OMG/USD exchange rate could also be attributed to the fact that the project successfully reassured investors about its potential to impact other global markets with its ethereum-based value exchange protocol.  ""China ban only affects decentralized currencies,"" said an update from OmiseGo in a statement that appears was at least in part responsible for a snap back to $11.40.  Elsewhere, it was reported this week that OmiseGo, along with ethereum-based gold tokenization platform Digix Global, will back Japan-based venture firm Global Brain's accelerator, GB Blockchain Labs. GBBL will fund blockchain startups and shall offer support for token offering-based crowdfunding efforts.  Still, as per CoinMarketCap, OmiseGo has lost 7% in the last 24 hours.

42400445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc6o,1505919944,Australia's Securities Watchdog Might Run Its Own Blockchain Nodes,"Australia's securities markets regulator is looking at the use of blockchain as part of broader data strategy.  Yesterday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) released its ""Data Strategy 2017-2020"", outlining how the agency plans to ""capture, share and use data"" in the years ahead. It forms part of a wider ""One ASIC"" initiative, which aims to achieve greater connectivity between the regulator's various functions.  One notable element included in the report is that ASIC is exploring whether to use so-called ""regulatory nodes"" that would allow it to observe and gather data through blockchain networks. While document doesn't outline a clear strategy in this area, it nonetheless reveals how ASIC envisions potentially interacting with such systems.  As the document explains:  ""We will...explore options for receiving and accessing data, including through the use of regulatory nodes using distributed ledger.""  Though not explicitly connected to blockchain as of yet, ASIC revealed in the document that it wants to create ""a repository of data assets and a register of current data.""  The goal of that specific effort, the agency said, is to build ""a consolidated view of entities we regulate"" – something to which a network of regulatory nodes could possibly contribute.  Australia's has been actively analyzing and addressing issues surrounding blockchain in recent months.

42400440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc0u,1505916012,China's IT Ministry Backs New Blockchain Research Lab,"Regardless of its recent crackdown on bitcoin exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), China's government still appears committed to the potential of blockchain in other areas.  According to a report by Caixin, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) – a research institution under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology – has launched a research facility called the Trusted Blockchain Open Lab in order to support the ongoing development of the technology in China.  The new lab will conduct research in the area of blockchain, as well as creating a platform for specialists to share their knowledge around the technology.  The news comes amid an evolving conversation about blockchain domestically.  As reported by the China Economic Review, Di Gang, vice director of the Digital Currency Research Institute within the People's Bank of China, warned at an event yesterday that technical blockchain specialists were lacking in comparison to those using the technology for economic reasons.  ""There have been many blockchain conferences where the number of business personnel exceeds technical personnel,"" the official said.  Following China's September 4 ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and later closure of several cryptocurrency exchanges, Reuters reports that Sun Guofeng, director general of the Digital Currency Research Institute, said that the ruling was ""necessary and timely"" to halt criminal activity in the sector.  However, he stated blockchain itself is a ""good technology,"" adding that ""an ICO is not the only way through which one can carry out research into it.""  He continued by promising the ban would not have a negative impact on the broader blockchain industry.  Various tech giants in China are also currently working with the technology, including Tencent, who announced a blockchain research partnership with multinational tech corporation Intel at a conference earlier this month. Additionally, payment giant China UnionPay recently filed a patent for blockchain based ATM network, while the Midea Group, an electrical appliances manufacturer, is seeking to patent a method for mining bitcoin with household items.

42400459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcIc,1505912401,Tokens for Climate Change? How We Can Rise Above ICO Mania,"Michael J Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  In this opinion piece, the first of a weekly series of columns, Casey outlines why he believes tokens, despite the excessive fervor and hype around ICOs, could hold the key to solving some of humanity's most pressing problems. The secret? It's all about incentives and collaboration.  A surefire way to be accused of over-hyping blockchain technology is to make some sweeping, breathless statement like, ""It can solve climate change!"" Even better: declare you have a token that can do that.  Well, bring it on.  The more I've thought about this technology, the more I've come to believe that saving the environment is exactly the kind of problem that energetic crypto minds should be focused on. It's why I recently hosted a #Hack4Climate workshop at MIT Media Lab, one of 17 worldwide promoting a ""climate change and blockchain"" hackathon at the United Nation's forthcoming COP 23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany.  Of course, a distributed ledger of transactions can't directly resolve the planet's climate problems. If our home survives this threat, it will be thanks to experts in energy, forestry, vehicle design and urban planning.  What blockchain technology and crypto tokens can help with, however, is the political problem – the core challenge of how to get mistrusting people and institutions to work together in pursuit of a common goal.  In short, it might finally enable us to unite and implement the steps those scientists have been urging us to take.  The problem of trust  What does this have to do with blockchains and digital assets, you might ask? Well, it comes down to how this technology tackles the root cause of humanity's inaction over this environmental crisis: mistrust.  The reason it took 27 years after the 1988 founding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the world to agree on a common set of targets and policies at the COP 21 in Paris, 2015, is not because scientists didn't know what to do. It's because people, companies and governments don't trust each other.  With no international authority ordering governments around, states that were otherwise willing to take growth-constraining action couldn't trust that others would follow suit, which made it hard for them to commit.  It was a classic misalignment of interests, consistent with what the ecologist Garrett Hardin called the ""Tragedy of the Commons"" – the idea that mistrust and self-interest prevent communities from properly protecting public resources even when not doing so goes against their long-term interest.  It's also a problem that's been with us through human history and that is closely related to another long-lasting economic dilemma: the failure to price ""externalities."" The departure of the world's largest economy from the Paris agreement reminds us that, when it comes to climate change, these problems will persist.  Yet, it's here where blockchains and tokens can help. The core, transformative feature of this technology is that it confronts the deep human challenge of how to intermediate trust and incentivize collective action.  To me, the most remarkable aspect of bitcoin is that it solves the Tragedy of the Commons, albeit in one specific use case.  We can think of the blockchain ledger as bitcoin's ""commons,"" a public resource that the entire community of users depends upon. And whereas traditional economic theory tells us that actors pursuing self-interest aren't incentivized to protect that resource, absent external government intervention, that's not the case with bitcoin.  Embedding rules into money  Bitcoin does have rules for protecting its commons – strict ones, in fact. It's just that the ""governance"" isn't external, it's baked into the system.  Compelled to follow the protocol's instructions, miners, seeking personal profit and nothing else, constantly maintain the public ledger, the bitcoin commons. It's hard to overstate how much of a breakthrough this coincidence of interests represents.  The question is whether this concept can be extended beyond value transfer to other types of ""commons."" I think the answer may lie in developing what's being described as the ""token economy"" – which, not coincidentally, is the name we've decided to give to this new weekly column.  This, and not the crazy dollars generated by initial coin offerings (ICOs), is what makes tokens interesting.  With cryptographic tokens, rules are embedded into the smart contracts that dictate their use. This opens the door to programmable money, in which the governance of a community's interests is contained within the medium of exchange itself.  It's a concept that's impossible with non-crypto fiat currencies, which are agnostic as to the community's interests – and, in places like Venezuela, can even be hostile to them. (It's worth remembering that money is merely a technology, a tool humans developed to enable wider exchange; it has changed its form many times through history and will continue to do so.)  A community of shared values  Under this new model, all who share the interests of a community should, in theory, be acting in those interests whenever they exchange tokens. And as more people do the same, the token's value should rise in line with its network effect.  The hope is that a positive feedback loop of rising value creation emerges, one that serves both the interests of the community and the token holders.  This, in essence, is what Filecoin is doing as it incentivizes people to collectively build the file-sharing commons of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). It explains Brave's bet that the Basic Asset Token (BAT) can improve the market for user attention – the hitherto poorly managed commons of the online ad industry. And it's why Augur and other blockchain-based prediction markets that feature reputation tokens can be thought of as encouraging the commons of honesty.  It's also the idea behind a ""Climate Coin"" proposed by a team from Coin Circle, UCLA and the World Economic Forum, which would rise in value as tokens are ""burned"" in response to proven environmental improvements.  This is all theory right now, of course. And it's not clear that the current reality of the token market is yet in line with it. Are all those excited ICO investors intending to use the token or just hoard it for profit? Does that deplete its ability to solve the commons' needs?  With a series of rapid-fire, nine-digit ICOs and $1.8 billion raised in total, not to mention talk of scams and ""vaporware,"" there's a wide gulf between the utopian vision I've laid out and the get-rich-quick mania of ICO-land in 2017.  Still, as the fallout continues and as regulators in China and the U.S. warn of risks to investors, we risk missing the forest for the trees. Of course, this industry needs to breed more confidence among investors, but whatever the policy or self-governance solution, it should not lose sight of the huge potential this technology poses for fixing the biggest problems in economics.  Whether it's the encouragement of cross-company collaboration, the efficient use of materials within a supply chain or the shared protection of vital natural resources, tokens point to a complete redesign for capitalism, one that could bring it in line with the digital, globalized, environmentally challenged economy of the 21st century.

Designed to power projects aiming to replace the likes of Google and Facebook, one problem facing ethereum is that growing to such scale would require putting an unimaginable amount of data on the blockchain, a shared ledger every node must download. Further, ethereum is already having enough trouble supporting the relatively small number of users it has today.  As such, Raiden Network has emerged as one piece of the scaling puzzle, aspiring to allow more and potentially cheaper ethereum transactions. Though Raiden Network has released a flurry of updates recently, the project is still a work in progress.  In the meantime, the developers have launched a testnet version of a new product, µRaiden (pronounced ""micro Raiden"") – a simpler version with fewer features that is almost complete.  In short, rather than route payments through a network of nodes, µRaiden allows users to make micropayments directly between each other. Further, the payments work in just one direction.  The project's introductory blog post argues that, while simpler, µRaiden offers a form of payment channels requested by some decentralized apps (dapps), such as for news and storage.  The post states:  ""Talking to dapp developers, we noticed that many of them just want to use the Raiden Network as a robust many-to-one payment channel system; one service provider offering services to many recurring customers. Such systems do not require a full-blown network but instead already benefit greatly from direct payment channels.""  Notably, the channels are ERC-20 standard compatible, meaning they work with a range of tokens that have launched recently on top of ethereum.  As for when the project will migrate to the live blockchain, developers also struck an optimistic tone, promising the change could happen ""very soon.""

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) announced on September 19 that it had shut down the Quid Pro Quo Association, Digital Trading AG and Marcelco Group AG in connection with the sales of a so-called ""E-Coin"" cryptocurrency. The companies had apparently been operating without the appropriate authorization, and were liquidated by FINMA as a result.  Notably, FINMA said that, unlike other cryptocurrencies, E-Coin didn't function in a decentralized manner, but was instead under the complete control of those selling them.  The agency explained:  ""Via this [E-Coin] platform, these three legal entities accepted funds amounting to at least four million Swiss francs [$4.2 million] from several hundred users and operated virtual accounts for them in both legal tender and E-Coins.

Notably, E-Coin isn't the only allegedly fraudulent crypto scheme on FINMA's radar.  In its release, FINMA said it had warned three other companies against offering fake cryptocurrencies, listing Suisse Finance GmbH in Liquidation, Euro Solution GmbH, and Animax United LP as the firms in question. The regulator is also investigating other groups for potentially unauthorized cryptocurrency sales, and warns that anyone interested in investing in cryptocurrencies ensure that they are protected.

42427789,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oLh,1505901611,Optimizing SegWit: How Bitcoin's New Software Is Giving Scaling a Boost,"SegWit may be live on bitcoin, but the work to realize its potential isn't over.  Even after the bitcoin blockchain upgraded to support Segregated Witness (SegWit) last month, ending perhaps the network's most heated debate on direction to date, the optimization has yet to leave much of a mark.  To date, only just over 3 percent of transactions are actually taking advantage of the upgrade.  But, though transactions are scarce so far, adoption is likely to grow as more wallets and bitcoin services move to support the change. At that point, SegWit will likely have more of an impact, increasing the block size to support more transactions and paving the way for more advanced scaling solutions like Lightning Network.  In an effort to work toward that goal, the developers behind Bitcoin Core, the most widely used version of the cryptocurrency's underlying software, have been mobilizing to help boost the effort.  At least, that's what it looks like from the latest version of Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, released last week. The release notes outline a range of improvements that focus on performance, which are at least partly geared towards laying the groundwork for wider use of SegWit.  A focus on performance  During a presentation in San Francisco a couple weeks back, Blockstream CTO and one of the most active Bitcoin Core developers Greg Maxwell seconded the notion that 0.15.0's focus had to do with preparing bitcoin for a SegWit-enabled capacity boost.  Maxwell explained:  ""With SegWit coming online, we knew the blockchain would grow at an even faster rate, so there was a desire to squeeze out all of the performance gains we could to make up for that.""  Several of the improvements are aimed at reducing the time it takes to create a bitcoin full node, which many predict will become even harder with SegWit activated, since the change increases the blockchain's block size (the amount of transaction data that can be stored in each block).  Full nodes are particularly important for the bitcoin community since running one is arguably the best way to use bitcoin without trusting a bank or another third party, and is what many see as the whole point behind the digital money.  So any effort to make that easier, and the network run more efficiently, is welcomed. Hence, ""performance"" (how long it takes to download and use the software) is a problem developers try to chip away at in nearly every Bitcoin Core release (roughly twice per year).  But SegWit just added more of a reason to focus on optimization and speed.  Maxwell said:  ""As always, but especially with 0.15.0, we had a big push on performance.""  Among the notable upgrades in this area is the way in which data on unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is now stored, creating less computational burden on users who want to download a bitcoin full node. According to the release notes, 0.15.0 downloads bitcoin's transaction history at a 30–40 percent faster rate and uses 10–20 percent less memory.  Other technical upgrades introduced to speed up the software include non-atomic flushing (which could pave the way for further performance gains) and script validation flushing (which makes grabbing certain transaction information faster).  This focus on performance shows a Core development team intent on making bitcoin more manageable ahead of SegWit, or before a significant number of people start using the transactions made possible by the upgrade.  Not yet witnessed  Today, most bitcoin wallets have yet to support SegWit, but that might not be the case for long.  In this way, it's not so surprising that, while 0.15.0 focused on performance upgrades to prepare for SegWit, the new software itself doesn't support SegWit transactions. Bitcoin Core developers argue it's safer to wait and see if SegWit works before rolling out transaction support within Core. However, the release notes say, more ""complete"" support for the change will be included in ""a next version"" of the bitcoin software.  When that time comes, users will be able to create SegWit transactions with the Core wallet, and get the benefit of SegWit's nearly half price transaction fees.  Other bitcoin wallets might have the same wait-and-see strategy. And, if and when they actually push it through, the optimizations in 0.15.0 might be more noticeable.

42427784,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3oBh,1505898016,Malaysia's Central Bank Is Close to Drafting New Cryptocurrency Rules,"Malaysia's central bank is reportedly planning to draft cryptocurrency regulations by the end of this year.  Muhammad bin Ibrahim, governor of Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), told reporters at a symposium on September 19 that the institution wants to develop rules for those trading and exchanging cryptocurrencies. That process would also involve the reinforcing of existing regulations on money laundering and terrorism financing, he said, according to regional news source Free Malaysia Today.  Bin Ibrahim was quoted as saying:  ""We hope that by year-end, [we] will be able to come out with some guidelines on cryptocurrency, particularly those related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. We want to ensure there are clear guidelines for those who want to participate in this particular sector.""  It's unclear at this time what shape those regulations will take, or whether other regulatory bodies will take part in the process. However, the move represents a shifting stance on the part of the central bank, which said in early 2014 that it ""does not regulate the operations of bitcoin.""  At the time, the BNM said that it does not consider bitcoin to be legal tender.  Further, the statements represent the latest regulatory development in Malaysia around the technology. Earlier this month, the Malaysian Securities Commission, which oversees financial markets in the country, warned investors against initial coin offerings (ICOs).

42427775,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3nth,1505894420,Bitcoin's Parimutuel Problem (Or Why Shorting Doesn't Pay Today),"When the price of bitcoin plunges — as it did last week — seasoned investors are caught in a market that doesn't exactly have the mechanisms they're used to.  Case in point, hedging long positions, is today a difficult prospect. Unlike most traditional stocks, where investors can open a margin account with their broker that allows them to short most shares, the tools in bitcoin are few and far between.  Yet, while some see betting big on bitcoin as a gamble in and of itself, a new casino-like exchange type is filling the gap for those seeking to bet – or otherwise prepare for – the cryptocurrency's drops.  Enter parimutuel betting pools.  Far from a familiar term, it's nonetheless an important one should traders want to know what they're buying into. In simple terms, parimutuel pools are a way of speculating on the future price of cryptocurrencies without actually owning the coins themselves.  Or as Lanre Sarumi, CEO of Level Trading Field, which last month launched parimutuel pool Bitcoin Market Predictor, told CoinDesk:  ""Parimutuel [betting] is a group of people essentially predicting something, and the person with the most accurate prediction wins.""  Yet, their structures can differ dramatically. One might look more like a cryptocurrency Powerball, while the other is an intense derivatives exchange touting triple-digit leverage.  While their use for short exposure is a bit underdeveloped, more investors are participating in these pools – knowingly or not – to fill the gap.  And if they're not aware of the limitations and risks involved, they could end up surprised – after all, parimutuel betting isn't the most sophisticated structure for providing short exposure.  A simple game  Lanre's Bitcoin Market Predictor, what he calls a ""game of skill,"" is the latest evidence that parimutuel pools could add some cushion to the cryptocurrency market's lack of shorting options.  But while theoretically it gives users the ability to bet on bitcoin's price dipping, the rules of the game are strict, allowing only groups of 10 to bet on the price of bitcoin only 60 minutes in the future. The three players with the most accurate predictions, whether the price is up or down, split the money from the group's betting pool, so at $50 per player per round, the most an investor can make off their prediction is $225.  Obviously, this presents problems for serious retail investors, since the price of bitcoin (which they might hold) could drop substantially, and all they've done is make $225 at most betting that it would.  And if three other players predict closer to the actual price, an investor loses even the money they put in the pot.  In this way, Level Trading Field's parimutuel pool is less a sophisticated way to short bitcoin, and more an enticing platform for those interested in gambling, and only gambling on bitcoin.  Still, the latter limitation could be especially important in today's cryptocurrency market, since in early August all bitcoin investors got equal parts of another cryptocurrency, when a group of enthusiasts split from bitcoin's blockchain creating bitcoin cash.  After all, if free money is being given out to bitcoin holders, it isn't exactly to the investors benefit to be caught in a limited short position.  Moral hazard  The bitcoin-only limitation carries over to the other end of the parimutuel betting pool spectrum with BitMEX's full-blown derivatives exchange.  The high-octane exchange is run by former Citigroup trader and ferocious bitcoin bull Arthur Hayes, who told CoinDesk its 100 times leverage was not only its differentiator, but its sex appeal. Traders come to BitMEX wanting to place high-powered bets with very little money down. But, clear that kind of colossal leverage isn't without risk.  Parimutuel betting means that one trader's gains are offset by another trader's losses — so every dollar you win is offset by a dollar someone else in the parimutuel pool has lost – which creates what Hayes calls ""moral hazard.""  And that hazard means if your trades are crushing it on BitMEX, there might not be enough equity in the system to pay out your winning bets.  In a way, it's like breaking the bank at a casino. If the market makes huge moves too fast, traders with losing positions have those bets closed and sold. And without enough equity in the system to payout on the other side, traders with winning positions will also be closed out early, in essence capping the returns they can get.  To Hayes's credit, he's incredibly upfront and transparent about it:  ""If you want 100x leverage – which obviously you do, because that's why you're here – you accept that we at BitMEX can't put our balance sheet on the line to settle these contracts.""  Yet, still, candid or not, this risk doesn't allow traders to get a foolproof short opportunity.  In this way, the market – however mature it's becoming – is still struggling to offer investors refined mechanisms as they prepare for another possible plunge.
