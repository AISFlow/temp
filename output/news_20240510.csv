27600882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607486,1715382033,EigenLayer’s Exclusive $15 Billion Token Launch: Who’s In And Who’s Out?,"The crypto world is currently abuzz with the launch of EigenLayer’s new token, EIGEN, which has quickly become one of the year’s most anticipated digital asset events. According to Bloomberg, the project has attracted significant attention for its approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and its “controversial” decision to exclude users from certain jurisdictions, including the US, China, and Canada, from participating in the token distribution. Related Reading: EigenLayer Makes A Big Splash With EIGEN Token Launch And Major Airdrop Plan, Get The Full Scoop! EigenLayer Challenges And Opportunities in Token Distribution EigenLayer, a DeFi protocol based in Seattle, has made waves in the industry by introducing a concept known as restaking. This method aims to increase rewards on the Ethereum blockchain by allowing users to deposit ETH to help operate the network. According to data from DeFiLlama, since its debut in 2023, EigenLayer has attracted over $15 billion in assets, demonstrating the significant interest and potential of this new approach. The launch of the EIGEN token is set to commence with an airdrop, a process where tokens are distributed to users based on certain criteria, including a points system that rewards early service adopters. Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari, noted that anticipating this airdrop was a “primary incentive” for users to place funds in EigenLayer’s service. However, the excitement has been tempered by the fact that many participants who accumulated points are now barred from claiming their tokens due to using virtual private networks or residing in excluded countries. Robert Drost, executive director at the Eigen Foundation, explained that the exclusions were a necessary step to adhere to regulatory guidelines, which are often unclear and challenging to navigate, noting: It’s not possible to operate in the space without following regulatory guidelines and being responsible, and the challenging part is that there is not a lot of clarity. This sentiment was echoed by Nick Cote, co-founder of Secondlane, who noted: Issuers not being upfront with jurisdictional restrictions leaves a sour taste in people’s mouth when it comes time to receiving your rewards, and then you find out you’re disqualified for X, Y, Z reason. Impact On The Broader DeFi Ecosystem EigenLayer’s restaking service is not just a new feature in the Ethereum ecosystem; it represents a shift in how applications can leverage the deep pool of transaction validators that underpin Ethereum. This service increases the yield from staking ETH – from a baseline of around 3% to higher rates, albeit with additional risks. As a result, EigenLayer has risen to become the “second most popular DeFi application,” as reported by Bloomberg, partly at the expense of liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool, which have seen significant outflows in recent months. Related Reading: This Week’s Crypto Watchlist: Top Coins Poised For Gains According to DeFiLlama, liquid staking protocols have experienced a more than 20% decline in total value locked since their notable high above $63 billion in March. Meanwhile, according to a recent report from IntoTheblock, nearly 4% of all ETH is now restaked using EigenLayer, showcasing the project’s growing popularity.

42418262,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1eH,1715375403,SEC Rebuts Coinbase's Attempt to Get Appeals Court to Answer Key Crypto Question,"U.S. regulators said an appeals court shouldn't heed Coinbase's request to review how – or if – conventional securities rules apply to cryptocurrencies.  Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, filed for permission to ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if the Howey Test, a longstanding Supreme Court assessment for securities, should apply to digital assets. Coinbase hopes it doesn't.  Coinbase hasn't successfully argued this is needed, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.  The question lurks at the center of the SEC's accusation that Coinbase operates as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearinghouse in the U.S. If some cryptocurrencies are securities – thus meeting the Howey Test – that means Coinbase needed to get the SEC's blessing before letting customers trade them, according to regulators.  In its filing, the SEC argued that Coinbase was trying to create a ""new legal test"" for how crypto might fit into existing securities precedent that a district court judge had already rejected.  ""Coinbase remains unable to advance a single, coherent version of this theory, which it now claims presents a controlling question,"" the filing said. ""This is unsurprising – in eighty years 'no court' has ever required post-sale 'contractual undertakings' or anything beyond the three factors expressly enumerated by the Supreme Court in Howey.""  The filing went on to argue that Coinbase hadn't successfully argued that there was a ""controlling question"" in its filing.  The SEC also argued that while Coinbase's appeal says it's focusing on a specific legal question about ""contractual obligations,"" its actual argument about the application of Howey to crypto is an entirely different question altogether.  ""Similarly, attempting to meet the 'precedential value for a number of cases' factor, Coinbase again pivots away from the 'contractual obligations' question, this time into '[h]ow Howey applies to secondary-market crypto transactions,'"" the filing said.  Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who's overseeing the SEC's case against Coinbase, will have to rule on the motion for interlocutory appeal. If she sides with Coinbase, the exchange will be able to send the motion to the actual appeals court.

The company's Q2 earnings showed significant improvement, with revenue up over 160% YoY. CleanSpark's balance sheet is strong, with a large BTC stack and ample liquidity for expansion and acquisitions. Over the last two years, CleanSpark ( CLSK ) has morphed from a middle of the pack mining company to one of the top dogs in the industry. Going back to 2022, CleanSpark was valued below names like HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) and Bitfarms ( BITF ). Data by YCharts Currently, CleanSpark's $3+ billion valuation now trails only Marathon Digital ( MARA ) as the industry's largest public miner. Given the company's quick production growth, this surge in valuation isn't all the surprising. As we’ll explore later, this growth has certainly come at the cost of shareholder dilution. But with CleanSpark's fiscal 2nd quarter now in the books, I think it's worth revisiting CLSK given the company's financial setup post-halving. FY Q2 Earnings & April Production CleanSpark's performance for the quarter-ended March marked a notable improvement over the prior year. Top-line revenue came in at $111.8 million, up over 160% year over year. This was substantially attributable to the increases in the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as cost of revenues grew by just 55% over the same time period. FY 2nd Quarter (CleanSpark 10-Q) The company reported income from operations in the quarter of $137.1 million, versus a quarterly loss of $17.5 million last year. As has been the case with other miners, these positive net income figures in the quarter ended March are hugely impacted by changes in the FASB fair value accounting rules. If not for the $119.7 million unrealized gain in fair value of the company's BTC, the income from operations in the quarter would have been closer to $17.4 million - which is admittedly still positive and a large improvement over the company's performance a year ago. Taking the company's $34.3 million COGS and adjusting quarterly opex to $58 million in combined SG&A and depreciation/amortization, we get an estimated breakeven price of roughly $45.5k in the quarter based on CleanSpark's 2,031 BTC mined between January and March. This was a noticeable improvement from previous quarters and the company's lowest quarterly breakeven since June 2023. Furthermore, the improvement in the price of Bitcoin has clearly also played a major part in CleanSpark's performance, as the company's Q2-24 average revenue per coin was $55k, up from roughly $23k in Q2-23. Machines deployed have also doubled from 68k last year to approximately 134k this year as CleanSpark has been aggressively scaling production capacity. Author's Chart (CleanSpark Disclosures) As of the end of April, CleanSpark's average exahash per second eclipsed 17 for the first time. The company now trails just Marathon Digital and Core Scientific ( CORZ ) for the largest public self-mining operation. CleanSpark's treasury management strategy to close 2023 has continued into 2024: Author's Chart (CleanSpark Disclosures) At 5,739 BTC in treasury as of April, CleanSpark's BTC HODL is the fourth largest of the public miners. Given how quickly the company has been able to scale up its Bitcoin stack, CleanSpark's HODL could conceivably challenge that of both Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Hut 8 ( HUT ) next year, even adjusting for post-halving production numbers. Basically, CleanSpark is the 2nd largest valued Bitcoin miner for a reason, and it's because the company has very little debt and keeps growing production while maintaining a sizeable BTC stack. Balance Sheet & Growth Strategy After raising more capital in the quarter, CleanSpark is well-positioned to take advantage of acquisitions following the block reward halving in April. Against total liabilities of just $74.4 million, CleanSpark had over $323 million in cash and equivalents plus $358 million in BTC at the end of March. Assets (CleanSpark 10-Q) This level of liquidity will allow further expansion of the company's production footprint through 2025, especially if CleanSpark's mining operation can actually be self-sustaining through higher coin prices even as higher cost companies struggle. CEO Zach Bradford reiterated guidance for 32 EH/s online by the end of the year and 50 EH/s in 2025. And subsequent to the quarter ended March, CleanSpark has already begun deploying capital after buying 75 MW through sites in Wyoming for $18.75 million. To this point, CleanSpark is looking for private acquisitions over mergers with other public companies, though management does forecast fewer public Bitcoin miners by the end of the calendar year. On the call, Bradford mentioned that acquisitions of other mining sites would likely be done with cash and equity, rather than through selling assets like BTC. He went on to explain why equity is possibly the better route going forward: Historically, almost all of our transactions where we've acquired companies, it's been in the form of cash, because the other parties needed cash to pay off debts or obligations, things like that, so they didn't have a choice. Some of these operations now, again, it's about joining the team. And so, I think that we could see an acquisition, even where equity is the sole use that we have where they become shareholders. This speaks to the difference between desperate sellers who need cash to service large debt loads and sellers who simply can't viably mine post-halving due to redundant overhead. Acquiring the latter is a much better reason for CleanSpark to dilute shareholders from where I sit because the company is simply addressing an efficiency issue rather than a financial one. Post-Halving Risks In my view, the company's balance sheet management into the halving has been strong. However, as I alluded in the introduction, this growth has largely come at the cost of shareholder dilution. The weighted average common shares outstanding grew by 160% year over year. Interestingly, this was nearly an identical rate of growth as top line revenue. Share Dilution (CleanSpark 10-Q) While it is certainly justifiable to point out the company's enormous level of shareholder dilution over the last 12 months, I'm of the view that CleanSpark's approach has actually proven viable so far. In the current macro environment, debt is more expensive compared to previous years, and not every company in this space is in the position to raise capital the way CleanSpark is. On the conference call, CFO Gary Vecchiarelli made a telling point on raising capital: We have raised approximately $1.4 billion since we entered the Bitcoin mining business in December 2020. Using this capital, we have grown this company to a market cap of almost $4 billion, which represents our ability to find accretive means to deploy capital. We continue to see opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions, which are accretive, and where we will be able to bring our operational expertise and strong balance sheet to grow our hashrate and efficiency even further. It's important to note that the entire reason why CleanSpark is positioned for acquisition opportunities in the market is because the economics of Bitcoin mining deteriorated dramatically in late April, when the block reward subsidy declined from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. I have mentioned repeatedly through various Seeking Alpha articles that this is a long-term headwind that is unlikely to be solved simply with higher BTC prices in perpetuity. Fees from network usage will ultimately have to become a larger portion of mining incentives, and so far, we've seen only flashes of high fees rather than sustained improvement in mining fundamentals. If we halving-adjust CleanSpark's fiscal Q2 breakeven price of $45k and assume transaction fee revenue doesn't meaningfully improve for the broader industry, CleanSpark's fiscal Q3 quarter is unlikely to repeat the positive net income figure that the company just reported for end of March. Summary When I last covered CLSK for Seeking Alpha, I noted the massive surge in share price between November and February and cautioned chasing the stock at what I estimated to be an already rich valuation. Taking some profit at that time has proven to be the correct strategic course, as CLSK is now nearly 30% cheaper today. While there are indeed some positive signs from CleanSpark’s fiscal 2nd quarter results, I think it still makes to be cautious with mining equities. Short of taking responsibly-sized speculative positions or swing trade positions, miners are still unproven as a long-term investments. Perhaps paradoxically, CleanSpark may want to see temporary weakness in the price of Bitcoin through the rest of the year so that mining acquisition targets will capitulate and sell infrastructure to CleanSpark. In such a setup, CleanSpark appears ready and willing to make deals.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692042-cleanspark-locked-and-loaded-for-post-halving-acquisitions?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27607624.jpeg

Scammers send transactions of no value, hoping the similarity between the addresses will fool the user under attack. If successful, victims copy the fraudulent address from the previous transactions and accidentally send their assets to the scammers instead. PeckShieldAlert reported that the phisher immediately swapped the stolen WBTC for 23,000 Ether (ETH) before transferring them to a different address. Throughout the following days, the scammer laundered the funds. Sending them to ten different addresses before distributing the tokens through over 100 other addresses. This development painted a looming picture for the crypto whale. At this point, the funds appeared to be unrecoverable. One user called the massive number of transfers a “crypto musical chairs” game. Others justified the scammer, claiming he had not stolen the funds, as “he just received them.” This stance disregards the transaction’s nature. The transfer occurs under the belief that funds are safely being transferred to the intended account and not a lookalike. Moreover, the lookalike address is in the victim’s transaction history, clearly intended to deceive the user into receiving funds not meant for them. Change Of Heart Or Scared Of The Crypto Community? In a shocking turn of events, the scammer sent 51 ETH, worth around $153,000, back to the victim on Thursday. Alongside the funds, the phisher sent a message asking to contact the whale, seemingly looking to negotiate. The reasons behind the sudden change of heart remain a mystery to the community. Many are jokingly theorizing why the scammer returned the funds. One X user playfully suggested that the phisher feared being investigated by crypto sleuth ZachXBT. Others claimed that “even the scammer doesn’t want ETH,” referencing the criticism the second-largest cryptocurrency has faced after its performance during this cycle. In the early hours of Friday, PeckShieldAlert revealed that 2,683.7 ETH, worth about $8 million, had already been transferred to the whale from nearly 50 different addresses. A couple of hours later, an update showcased that around 50% of the total funds had been returned, accounting for 11,446.87 ETH, or $34.7 million.

The House Rules Committee approved the legislation for a vote next month, potentially pushing it toward a high-water mark for crypto legislation in the U.S.  The most comprehensive U.S. cryptocurrency legislation to so far make it through a congressional committee will get even further, with the entire House of Representatives set to vote on whether to approve it soon, according to Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.  His panel last year had cleared the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, in a bipartisan vote that drew a handful of Democrat supporters in spite of opposition from their ranking member on the committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) That bill is on a path toward becoming the first significant digital assets regulatory legislation to clear one of the chambers of Congress now that it's been cleared for a vote next month by the House Rules Committee, according to McHenry.  The bill, which had also been approved by the House Agriculture Committee, is the ""culmination of years of bipartisan efforts to finally provide clarity,"" said the North Carolina lawmaker, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year and made crypto legislation one of his priorities on his way out.  ""With the floor vote announced today, Congress will take a historic step to provide a clear regulatory framework for digital asset markets,"" McHenry said in a statement. ""This legislation will cement American leadership of the global financial system for decades to come and bolster our role as an international hub for innovation.""  Though it's a mark of progress to get legislation that far in a highly partisan and combative Congress, the bill is unlikely to find parallel action in the Senate – which is needed for Congress to fully approve legislation and send it to the president to sign into law. That chamber hasn't yet done high-level work on a similar effort, though lawmakers there recently showed some willingness to find a path for another crypto effort: a bill to regulate the issuers of stablecoins.

42418252,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1Y5,1715372793,"Bitcoin Is in a 'Bore You to Death' Phase, but Bottom Could Be Close, Analysts Say","BTC has been sliding since reaching an all-time high in March.  Friday's quick tumble showed less interest from dip buyers, suggesting that a bottom might be near, Santiment said.  The lull could continue into early summer, setting up a very bullish second half of the year, Bitfinex analysts said.  Crypto markets are stuck in a lull with digital assets consolidating for the last few weeks, testing investors conviction whether the bull market will resume.  All attempts for a sustained rally over the past weeks have been sold off, the latest instance coming Friday with bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbling nearly 5% from $63,000 to just above $60,000 amid discouraging inflation expectations and hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers.  Blockchain activity also points to low participation, with transactions on the Bitcoin network falling off a cliff and second-largest ether {{ETH}} turning inflationary.  We have been here before.  The current period resembles the action from April through September of 2023 when bitcoin was stuck in the $25,000-$30,000 range for an excruciating six months. Eventually, cryptocurrencies were able to sustain a multi-month rally, with BTC ultimately hitting an all-time high in March of this year.  ""Bitcoin is in the 'bore you to death' phase,"" Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investment said in an X post Thursday.  This period of consolidation could last for anywhere between one to six months, he explained, during which BTC will be rangebound with low volatility until market participants lose their patience. The sentiment will be the most negative just before the consolidation ends, he added.  ""When you are sufficiently bored from sideways chop, common symptoms will include thinking the halving is priced in, the bull market is over and selling to buy stocks at the bottom,"" Edwards said. ""Your symptoms and shorts will peak just before the mega rally.""  Said bottom might be near, according to analytics firm Santiment.  ""Traders are showing weak 'buy the dip' interest in bitcoin's latest retrace,"" Santiment said Friday monitoring social media interactions. ""Generally, the crowd's lack of faith is a strong sign of prices being close to a bottom.""  Bitfinex analysts noted in a Friday report that bitcoin's recent weakness happened amid a surging U.S. dollar with interest rate cut expectations tempered, and said the lull could continue into early summer.  ""We expect the market to remain uncertain over the short-term in a low volatility environment till the actual tapering of QT [quantitative tightening] takes place in June."" The Federal Reserve announced plans to curb the pace of its balance sheet run-off starting next month, which would impact dollar liquidity positively benefitting risky assets such as cryptocurrencies that are sensitive to the global liquidity environment.  However, the greenback's tumble from a six-month peak last week following the Fed meeting and weak jobs report – coinciding with BTC to rebound from near $56,000 – was a turning point in the trend, and a weaker dollar could support the next leg in the crypto rally.  ""We believe sustained strength and a reclaim of range lows on BTC post-FOMC and job market data and the simultaneous weakness in the dollar is a sign of a new regime, which would set us up for a very bullish Q3-Q4 for bitcoin,"" the authors said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/10/bitcoin-is-in-a-bore-you-to-death-phase-but-bottom-could-be-close-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39d00322d307a52b8d5303ab9316cba48ed9a998-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418253,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1X3,1715371401,Was Sam Bankman-Fried Proven Right About FTX’s Solvency?,"Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has recovered billions of dollars more than it needs to make the victim’s of Sam Bankman-Fried’s theft whole, according to the latest bankruptcy plan announced on Tuesday. Customers will receive $1.18 for every dollar’s worth of crypto assets they held on the exchange at the time of collapse in November 2022, plus interest.  This result – rare in the world of bankruptcies, where creditors typically receive pennies on the dollar – has raised a poignant question for some: Was Sam Bankman-Fried right all along?  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  For instance, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine opened a recent edition of the (always excellent) “Money Stuff” newsletter getting straight to the point: “FTX was … illiquid but solvent?” That is, in a way, a very simple and direct way of stating what SBF, who was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for one of the largest financial heists ever, has been saying for years.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto?  To make it brief, in the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, SBF was frantically trying to shore up a gigantic hole in his company’s balance sheet by raising funds basically from anyone he could. This reportedly includes everyone from Silicon Valley VCs, Saudi money men and even SBF’s archrival ex-CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (who reneged on a handshake buyout deal after reviewing the state of FTX’s finances, only speeding up the ongoing run on the exchange).  He was trying to raise this money 1) because SBF and his inner circle had become painfully aware of a shortfall in capital needed to meet all customer withdrawals (a balance reportedly shown to prospective investors showed the exchange only had $900 million in liquid assets) and 2) because (and this is debatable) he believed – or said he believed – that there actually was enough capital, it was just illiquid. To wit:  ""FTX is fine. Assets are fine,” Bankman-Fried infamously tweeted out on Nov. 7 after being confronted by FTX co-founder Gary Wang about the exchange’s $8 billion hole as customer withdrawals began to pick up following Zhao’s announcement that he’d sell Binance’s FTT stack.  From the beginning of his ill-fated “media tour” to the end of his trial, SBF routinely characterized FTX’s implosion as due to an accounting error – in particular a ""confusing internal account” that made it seem to him that FTX was on more solid footing. Plus, as Michael Lewis noted in the hagiography “Going Infinite,” SBF privately estimated his personal worth at over $100 billion, though that was before the price of FTT, SOL and other “Sam Coins” cratered.  It was actually this insistence that he could have rescued FTX had he not declared bankruptcy, and unwillingness to take responsibility for his crime, that led to his lengthy sentence. “In 30 years, I’ve never seen a performance like that,” Judge Lewis Kaplan said during the sentencing hearing, describing SBF’s evasiveness and remorselessness.  But just because someone believes something doesn’t make it true, no matter how many Substack posts they write or spreadsheets they create. John J. Ray III, current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy, says over the past 17 months the firm was able to recover between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in assets that weren’t on the exchange at the time it collapsed.  While it will likely take access to documents that aren’t actually publicly available, including FTX’s (abysmal) financial statements before the collapse and for today to conclusively prove this; it’s likely this recovery is due mostly to the rising price of crypto assets. Although JJR’s well-paid legal team likely put in a lot of effort to recover funds from “dozens of private entities,” it likely doesn’t add up to billions and billions of dollars.  See also: The Downfall of FTX: The Crypto Industry Reacts  Anthropic, for instance, one of SBF’s lucky bets in AI, got the firm a return of $884 million – a windfall, but likely the biggest non-crypto sale FTX made. FTX also sold off 38 Bahamian properties for around $199 million, and was able to recover nearly $2.6 billion in cash.  In comparison, the estate sold off $1.9 billion worth of deeply discounted SOL recently, and apparently still holds $7.5 billion worth of locked-up tokens. Those tokens were worth less than $500 million at the time of FTX’s collapse. In total, FTX raised about $5 billion by selling tokens, and it expects to raise another $4.4 billion over the next few months.  This to me all seems like FTX wasn’t actually solvent at the time it collapsed and that it could repay the $8 billion in missing customer funds if only SBF had the ability to quickly sell off all of its property, equity investments and crypto (without tanking prices even further). But instead due to the subsequent bull run, FTX became solvent.  Customers are being made whole, not in crypto assets, of which there is still a shortfall (i.e. there is not enough BTC to go around to pay back all customer BTC claims), but in the dollar value of their accounts in November 2022 prices. It’s a lucky break that the market rebounded enough so that the fraction pays for the whole.  But SBF didn’t have the benefit of waiting several months to see if crypto would rise from the ashes. And his argument that FTX only had an illiquidity problem is patently absurd.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/10/was-sam-bankman-fried-proven-right-about-ftxs-solvency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/194b6d6191e88d91af5d5a7198af277d3319b20c-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27580535,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607363,1715369401,"Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1?","The XRP price, like the rest of the crypto industry, continues to struggle against the bearish winds that have taken over. This has seen its price consistently decline in spite of bulls’ best efforts to prop it up. However, it seems all hope is not lost for the altcoin as expectations are that it will recover soon enough. More specifically, crypto analyst WalterMoon is particularly bullish on the XRP price, noting that it is possible that it will break out of its current pennant. Analyzing The XRP Price Movement To try and pinpoint where the XRP price is headed, the crypto analyst first analyzed the movement of the altcoin over the last few weeks. This analysis showed a consistent breakout trend, albeit short-lived, that suggests that the altcoin could be getting ready to mount another one soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000? One of these breakout trends took place last month in May when the price had entered a failing channel. Eventually, the XRP price was able to muster enough momentum, even after breaking below its support line below $0.5 and then made a run for $0.52. Again, this is seen later in the month when the price once again fell into a falling channel. This decline saw it fall below support. But like the previous time, it was able to move upward inside this falling channel and eventually broke out of the channel. Source: Tradingview.com This trend was recorded a number of times in the month of May, showing XRP’s strength in the market right now. However, the altcoin has fallen inside another falling channel once again, but can it maintain its breakout trend from last month? Gathering Support Inside A Pennant Crypto analyst WalterMoon has identified the XRP price inside a falling channel and as it continues to decline inside this pennant, the price has taken hit after hit. But given the performance from the last month, Moon believes there is still upside to come for XRP. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Drop To $2,500, Here’s Why According to the analyst, there is a possibility that the altcoin can exit its current pennant by bouncing off the support at $0.533. In this case, it could send the price as high as $0.54, like it did the previous times. “Now, I think that Ripple can bounce up from support line to $0.5330, thereby exiting from pennant,” the analyst said. Despite the bullish outlook, WalterMoon’s target is still conservative for all intents and purposes. The target still remains above the $0.54 level, which, unfortunately, doesn’t show much expectation for the XRP price to cross $1.

As part of Binance’s plea deal with the DOJ earlier this year, the crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines and appoint an independent compliance monitor. The firm’s CEO and co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also agreed to step down as part of the agreement, and was sentenced to four months in prison.  According to the report, Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) was chosen to monitor Binance over the previous frontrunner, Sullivan & Cromwell, due to the white-shoe law firm’s controversial handling of the FTX bankruptcy.  A spokesperson for the DOJ declined to comment.  FTX investors filed suit against Sullivan & Cromwell in February, alleging that the firm – which did some limited work (valued at approximately $8.5 million) for FTX before its collapse – not only failed to detect the widespread fraud at the exchange but “actively participated” in it, before becoming the exchange’s bankruptcy counsel – a lucrative job that has netted Sullivan & Cromwell nearly $200 million in lawyers fees.  Sullivan & Cromwell has denied the allegations, saying that their pre-bankruptcy work with FTX was limited in scope and “largely transactional.” Current FTX management, including CEO John J. Ray III has defended Sullivan & Cromwell’s work.  Sullivan & Cromwell’s appointment as FTX’s bankruptcy counsel met with some resistance – including from creditors, the U.S. Trustee and four U.S. senators – but was ultimately allowed to move forward.  According to Bloomberg’s report, Sullivan & Cromwell is still expected to be appointed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to a different, five-year monitorship of Binance.

Related Reading: $20 On The Horizon For XRP? Unpacking A Potential 650x Surge And What It Means Social Media Frenzy Fuels XRP Discussions A recent tweet by Santiment, a crypto market intelligence platform, highlighted a surge in XRP-related discussions.

In fact, XRP’s value dipped slightly in the past 24 hours. Investors Accumulate Despite Price Stagnation Interestingly, despite the lackluster price action, data from Santiment suggests investors might be accumulating XRP. The platform’s “Exchange Outflow” metric remains high, indicating a movement of XRP away from exchanges, possibly towards private wallets. This suggests a potential long-term bullish sentiment among some investors. Ethereum's exchange outflow maintains steady uptrend. Source: Santiment Technical Indicators Cast A Shadow However, not all signs are positive. Popular crypto analyst Cryptoes noted on Twitter that XRP’s price is precariously perched right below its 21-day moving average, a technical indicator often interpreted as a bearish signal. XRP is now trading at $0.51. Chart: TradingView Support Levels And The Downward Spiral If the bearish signals hold true, XRP could plummet to its support level near $0.50. A break below this crucial point might trigger a further cascade, dragging the price down to $0.47. This potential decline aligns with another concerning trend – XRP’s Network Growth.

42418249,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1W1,1715361176,"EigenLayer Opens Claims for Airdrop of EIGEN Token, Though It's Non-Transferable","EigenLayer's EIGEN token is trading around $9 in side markets like Aevo where traders can bet on the eventual price.  EIGEN airdrop, which the team refers to as a ""stakedrop,"" has been controversial due to the team's decision to make the tokens non-transferable, at least initially, as well as to ""geoblock"" users in many countries from claiming them.  EigenLayer's restaking protocol is pitched as a major new frontier for decentralized-finance projects, by repurposing security borrowed from the Ethereum blockchain.  EigenLayer has finally kicked off its long-awaited EIGEN airdrop, but it will be a while before users can trade their new tokens – since the project has made them non-transferable.  The Eigen Foundation, a non-profit introduced last week by Eigen Labs, the team behind EigenLayer, opened up ""claims"" on EIGEN on Friday. Officials have said they would become transferable at a yet-to-be-defined later date. The Eigen Foundation said in a Telegram message that they are targeting September 30.  Speculators on decentralized exchanges like Aevo and Hyperliquid are currently valuing EIGEN at around $9. EIGEN's total supply at launch is 1,673,646,668.28466 tokens, which would give the token a fully diluted value of $15 billion.  Both markets allow users to trade perpetual futures, or ""perps,"" which are futures contracts that have no expiration date – crypto-native trading instruments that allow people to speculate on the future price of an asset without trading it outright.  ""You can probably view it as what people expect the spot price will trade at when it is transferable,"" Julian Koh, CEO of Aevo, explained in a Telegram message. ""People use it as a reference price like how people use prediction market odds as a reference for the actual event.""  EigenLayer, the restaking service on Ethereum, is one of the buzziest blockchain startups to ever launch a token, raising more than $100M from Andreessen Horowitz, and luring in some $16 billion worth of user deposits into its ""pooled security"" system before it even launched.  While EigenLayer has emerged as one of the most talked-about blockchain projects to date, its EIGEN token has generated significant controversy.  As most of EigenLayer's key features remain in progress, the main incentive for depositing into the platform thus far has been ""points,"" which are score-counts that crypto traders expected would be tied to a future airdrop.  Last week, Eigen Labs, the team behind EigenLayer, unveiled details behind EIGEN, which it called a ""Universal Intersubjective Work Token"" that would help power the EigenLayer platform under the hood.  EIGEN's distribution plan was immediately met with backlash from EigenLayer point-earners.  In addition to the lengthy non-transferability period, some took issue with the project's decision to bar users from some jurisdictions – like the U.S., Canada and China – from claiming tokens. The grumbles came partly because the project had placed no geographic restrictions on the deposits or points awards.  Others were disappointed that some points from third-party ""liquid restaking services"" would not be considered in the ""Season 1"" airdrop even though they accounted for a large portion of overall deposits.

27560236,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607362,1715360459,Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90%,"The stars may be finally aligning for Cardano (ADA) and its holders, as the crypto token recently experienced a significant reversal and a jump in its trading volume. Interestingly, this development coincides with an ultra-bullish prediction that a crypto analyst made for the crypto token. Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano To Rise To $9 Crypto analyst Altcoin Daily revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that $9 is their peak price target for Cardano in this bull run. The analyst joins other crypto analysts who have made ultra-bullish predictions for Cardano despite how low the crypto token is currently trading. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had predicted that Cardano could rise to as high as $11 in this bull run. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious? Meanwhile, crypto expert Jason Appleton predicted that Cardano will rise to as high as $32 in this bull run. Specifically, he mentioned that this will happen at the peak of this market cycle. Altcoin Daily’s prediction comes amidst Cardano’s 90% jump in trading volume. This suggests that more investors are accumulating the crypto token ahead of this parabolic rise. Cardano’s price already reacted positively to this development, with the crypto token seeing a reversal from its downtrend. Crypto analyst Trend Rider suggested that this reversal might begin an upward trend for Cardano as he noted that the crypto token was currently holding its support level very well. The analyst also revealed that the bears were currently trying to push the crypto token further down, but he claimed that they would get tired once Cardano could hold this support for 1 to 2 more weeks. Once that happens, Carano will bounce from its current price level, Trend Rider remarked. Making A Bull Case For ADA Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently made a bullish case for Cardano. He mentioned in an X post that the crypto token seems ready for a parabolic bull run. Martinez alluded to Cardano’s historical trend and explained why the 50% price drop the crypto token experienced this past month might be a good buying opportunity. Martinez claimed that Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel in 2019, signaling an end to the bear market. Following that “stagnant phase,” ADA is said to have broken out of the channel with a 75% surge and then experienced a 56% correction, setting the stage for its 4,095% price gain in that bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Lose Interest, Is This A Precursor For A Crash To $50,000? Martinez further noted that a similar situation looks to be playing out again as Cardano has consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. ADA then broke out of this channel with a 72% price surge following this period of stagnation. Now, Cardano has experienced a 50% price correction, just like in 2019, which Martinez remarked could be setting the stage for “an impressive bull run ahead.” ADA price is still below $0.5 | Source: ADAUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Watcher Guru, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/10-price-cardano-volume-90/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The vote, officially proposed May 3 passed with overwhelming support, with 65 addresses representing 14.6 million CELO tokens signaling approval for the measure, with two addresses representing 20,484 CELO abstaining.  Due to the magnitude of the decision, tantamount to an existential transformation, Celo community leaders have said that the change would not take place automatically (the usual practice) but only upon the ""completion of upgrades from our validators.""  Described as a ""temperature check,"" the vote follows an announcement last month that cLabs, the primary developer firm behind the Celo blockchain, and as such one of the most influential voices in the community, proposed choosing the OP Stack last month as the primary technology for its new home.  The developer had spent several months evaluating various customizable stacks from different layer-2 teams on why they may be the best fit for Celo, and the process had turned into an unusually public and closely-watched competition – almost like a blockchain edition of TV's The Bachelorette.  Celo originally announced plans to use OP Stack last July, when the decision was shared to become the broader Ethereum ecosystem as a layer-2 chain, morphing from its current state as a layer-1 chain.  But the transition became competitive when Arbitrum Orbit, zkSync’s ZK Stack and Polygon CDK threw themselves into the mix, offering to provide technology to Celo.  Ultimately, the Celo team ended up right where they began.  “The OP Stack largely provides what is needed to deploy an L2. Minimal changes are needed to support Celo's unique features,” the proposal reads. “It is battle-tested with multiple chains in production and compatible with other stacks, such as Polygon's Type 1 ZK Solution.”  Read more: Celo Chooses Optimism, Concluding Bake-Off Among Layer 2s  UPDATE (17:36 UTC): Adds that Celo's actual transformation into a layer 2 on top of Ethereum won't officially finalize until the completion of upgrades by the blockchain's validators.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/10/celo-community-ratifies-plan-to-use-optimisms-op-stack-for-new-layer-2-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fea119c4caec8900b62444c2b2415786be3c5e23-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His outlook aligns with that of other industry leaders, such as Cathie Wood, who predicted that bitcoin could go as high as $1.5 million by that time.  Former Twitter CEO and now founder and backer of several crypto projects, Jack Dorsey, believes that bitcoin {{BTC}} will go as high as $1 million by 2030.  When asked about a price prediction for bitcoin in an interview with Pirate Wires, Dorsey said, “I don’t know. Over… at least a million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond.”  While the price of the cryptocurrency is interesting, he said, it’s the ecosystem and movement that fascinates Dorsey.  “The most amazing thing about bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it, or gets paid in it, or buys it for themselves—everyone who puts any effort in to make it better—is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up,” he said.  While $1 million seems like a stretch from bitcoin’s current price of $60,886, other big names in the industry have voiced similar outlooks. Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood has even taken it a step further, predicting the token will reach $1.5 million by 2030.  Ever since stepping down as Twitter CEO in 2021, Dorsey has become an advocate for the industry, leading and endorsing several projects over the years. In 2019, he became a backer of social media startup BlueSky, which he recently stepped away from as his vision for a decentralized social media platform aligns more with a competitor Nostr.

42408286,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0rm,1715357509,U.S. CFTC Proposes Ban on Political Event Contracts,"The U.S. derivatives agency approved a proposal to ban popular prediction market trading, with three of the five commissioners approving the proposed rule.  The public will have 60 days to weigh in with comments on the potential rule.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) proposed a formal rejection of event contracts that bet on the outcome of political activity in a vote on Friday, beginning an effort to wall off U.S. customers from platforms that allow the trading of predictive contracts.  The agency has conducted a years-long legal fight with such firms, and the proposed rulemaking approved by the three Democratic appointees to the U.S. derivatives agency would declare trading on political outcomes as ""contrary to the public interest"" and legally equate them with illicit contracts on war, terrorism and assassination. Agency officials also noted that the CFTC is not a gambling regulator, and the agency wouldn't be capable of ensuring market integrity in this field.  Prediction platforms including PredictIt, Polymarket, Zeitgeist and Kalshi give users opportunities to buy contracts on the outcomes of actual events, including elections and policy developments, and they've been popular in crypto circles. Buyers make yes-or-no bets that pay off if they're right and cost them money if they're wrong. Contracts on political contests, awards contests and the outcome of games would be banned for U.S.-regulated companies under the proposal.  ""Contracts involving political events ultimately commoditize and degrade the integrity of the uniquely American experience of participating in the democratic electoral process,"" Chairman Rostin Behnam argued in the Friday meeting. ""To be blunt, such contracts would put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.""  Behnam had signaled in March that this proposal was coming, and the draft rule that moved forward today still needs to pass through a 60-day period of public comments and then a process to approve a final rule.  During the Friday meeting, Commissioner Caroline Pham – one of the opponents of the proposal – called it a ""stunning overreach."" She also criticized the agency's legal and enforcement track record and suggested a need for Government Accountability Office review of the regulator.  ""A third-party review can help us get back to the basics and on track,"" Pham said.  Commissioner Summer Mersinger also voted against the proposal.  Because the rule had such a significant enforcement aspect, Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero called it a ""dereliction of their duties"" that the agency's enforcement staff wasn't on hand for Friday's meeting.  Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner and current adviser to prediction markets company KalshiEx (which is suing the regulator for denying its own effort to launch election markets), said in an email to CoinDesk that this move represents ""bad government.""  ""Instead of regulating these new markets and letting them flourish responsibly, the Commission is simply going to ban a large swath of it. ""Financial regulation should be based on data and the law, not ignorant preconceptions. Further, the Commission is creating huge amounts of uncertainty and is already pushing individuals who need these risk management tools to offshore and unregulated venues, potentially exposing consumers to significant harm.""

42408280,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0Xw,1715356800,Crypto Custody Tech Firm Fireblocks Seeks New York-Regulated Trust Company,"Pending final regulatory approval from the NYDFS, the Fireblocks Trust Company will offer cold storage custody to U.S. clients.  Fireblocks' Global Custodian Partner Program will launch this quarter with an initial group of licensed firms based in the U.S., the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.  Cryptocurrency safekeeping specialist Fireblocks plans to establish a limited-purpose trust company under the purview of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Pending final regulatory approval, the Fireblocks Trust Company will offer cold-storage custody to U.S. clients, the firm said on Friday.  The New York-based company is also creating a network of licensed custodians, the Global Custodian Partner Program, which will launch this quarter with an initial group of companies based in the U.S., the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.  Crypto custody is evolving in a post-FTX world, where new key-sharing technologies like multiparty computation (MPC), which Fireblocks has championed, have been embraced by institutions looking for flexible ways to reduce counterparty risk. After the thousands of FTX customers found their assets were marooned when the crypto exchange collapsed, there's been a shift toward self-custody, including a greater reliance of risk-mitigating technologies like MPC.  Fireblocks, which has been purely a software vendor until now, has recognized some clients might need a custodian for regulatory or risk reasons. That said, Fireblocks SVP of partnerships Adam Levine stressed the firm remains committed to innovating with self-custody.  ""We continue to believe everything we've said about the importance of holding your own assets and at no point are we walking that back,"" Levine said in an interview. ""But what's becoming abundantly clear is that there's a lack of qualified custodians in the United States that are able to focus on digital assets.""  There is a political context to this. In February of last year, proposed changes to the custody rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would, in theory, dramatically narrow the types of institutions that registered investment advisers (RIAs) could put their customers' crypto into. Part of a divisive and yet to be finalized set of changes known as SAB 12, only firms such as registered broker-dealers and federally chartered banks would qualify, which is at odds with the current state licensing system.  ""Our position is not to poke at any regulator, any political party, or the government,"" Levine said. ""We're just applying the existing rules and existing framework. We know there's a business need based on clients, based on the market opportunity. We understand what the current regulatory framework is, and SAB 121, as it is, in the current view of federal regulators and state regulators. We believe that pursuing the trust license in becoming a qualified custodian was the right approach.""  In terms of the custodian partner program, this will include licensed custodians using Fireblocks' technology, and the firm is talking to at least two or more providers in each of the jurisdictions mentioned, said Levine. The trust company, which is expected to be live in the next few months, will be the initial U.S. qualified custodian in the partner program, but more are expected to follow, he said.  Fireblocks Trust Co.'s articles of organization were filed with NYDFS on May 3, according to a notice on the regulator's website.

42408283,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0lA,1715356496,Shouldn't All These Crypto Lawyers Start Learning About Crypto?,"Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Justin Wales is the head of legal for the Americas at Crypto.com. He is the author of ""The Crypto Legal Handbook: A Guide to the Laws of Crypto, Web3, and the Decentralized World"" (available at www.thecryptolegalhandbook.com).  The question seems almost rhetorical: Should lawyers deeply engaged in the cryptocurrency or digital asset industry understand the technologies they are paid to represent before regulators and courts?  Surprisingly, many legal professionals, including those actively tasked with navigating existential threats to the cryptocurrency industry or their crypto-wielding clients, treat cryptocurrency more as a novel curiosity than a transformative technology that requires intricate understanding and thoughtful consideration.  I've listened to presentations by highly sought-after attorneys with large “crypto practices” who charge thousands of dollars for an hour of their time and joke that they are ""not a crypto person"" when pressed on a question about the uses of the technology during formal proceedings. They treat the practicalities of using digital assets as an irrelevant afterthought that only complicates their other arguments.  This detachment between the industry and its advocates is not merely unhelpful – —it's harmful. The industry tasks its lawyers with representing its interests before courts and regulators, who often need to consider the complex interplay of crypto applications and existing regulations for the first time.  If these advocates are unwilling to engage seriously with what the industry is building, how can they effectively persuade a court or regulator that their legal interpretation aligns with the realities of the technology or convey the philosophical foundations upon which the broader cryptocurrency space is built?  Top law firms charge thousands of dollars per hour for their services, yet too often, the senior-most partners on a case treat engaging deeply with their client’s crypto business as beneath them. This attitude forces clients to rely on the hope that some crypto-native associate will step in to prevent egregious errors or inefficiencies caused by the lack of interest from those at the top. This dynamic is inefficient and can be financially and strategically costly for those navigating the complicated regulatory challenges inherent to most projects in the space.  Fortunately, as crypto-native associates become more senior, the dynamics within law firms are beginning to change. Truly adept ""crypto lawyers"" have emerged at many prestigious law firms, and there are lawyers at specialized boutiques who certainly know their stuff, but this phenomenon remains surprisingly rare. This shift is crucial, as lawyers who understand and can innovate within the framework of cryptocurrency law are critical for the industry's future.  A cynical response might equate demanding that a lawyer representing a crypto company have meaningful experience using cryptocurrencies to a tobacco company requiring that their lawyer smoke. But such glib comparisons reveal a misunderstanding of what cryptocurrency represents – —a potential paradigm shift in how we structure society and handle value, privacy, and trust that relies on first-of-its-kind technologies to further goals that were, until recently, confined to science fiction.  Lawyers are free to spend their time as they see fit, but those who believe they can coast on a superficial understanding of Bitcoin that hasn’t been expanded since 2017 and an attitude that ""everything old is new again"" will find their pool of clients diminishing as the industry progresses and demands more from them.  I’m not suggesting that a lawyer needs a computer science degree to be a successful advocate or that they must be a “degen” with their personal finances, but they should put in enough time learning about the industry and interacting with the different projects and protocols that make up the space so that they can speak authoritatively on what their clients do, how they do it, and why it matters.  Passion is a valuable asset for any professional, particularly in an industry that evolves as rapidly as cryptocurrency does. Lawyers wishing to stay up-to-speed with the continuous legal and technological changes that are characteristic of the cryptocurrency space must engage in continuous self-study – —a task that is incredibly difficult without a genuine interest in the subject matter.  This isn't just about maintaining relevance; it's about providing the best possible representation for clients who rely on their attorneys to understand not just the law but the essence of the technology they are dealing with to ensure their advocacy considers a comprehensive understanding of the facts, rules, and circumstances at play.  See also: Fatemeh Fannizadeh on Crypto Law, Switzerland and How KYC Is Failing  I get asked all the time by young lawyers or law students what they can do to start a career in crypto law. My advice is always to start using crypto and to see if they believe that technologies that permit people to interact without intermediaries are important and should be protected. If so, start reading about the industry’s history, and if you are still convinced this is a good thing for the world, develop expertise in the various areas of law and financial regulations that impact the field.  On the other side, I get asked by non-lawyer entrepreneurs or developers what they can do to ensure their relationship with their lawyers is successful. My answer is to make sure your lawyer understands what you’re trying to build and why and to learn enough about the rules regulating your business so that you can have critical conversations with your legal team about their understanding of the law and their strategy.  During conversations with young lawyers or entrepreneurs, I would be asked where they should start developing these informational skills, but I didn’t have a great answer. I put together a resource called “The Crypto Legal Handbook” to address this gap and serve as a primer on cryptocurrency's technological and historical aspects, as well as a comprehensive overview of the various laws that govern the field.  The text is designed to, on the one hand, spur lawyers to engage with the crypto world actively, enhancing their ability to serve as true advocates for technological advancement and, on the other hand, to provide entrepreneurs with the tools they need to understand the state of crypto regulations.  I believe that most of us working in the crypto industry understand that it is more than just a niche asset class within the financial sector. The proliferation of technologies that allow for a variety of peer-to-peer financial and non-financial communications is a pioneering movement capable of reshaping our understanding of money, privacy, and governance that could substantially impact how we govern our economy and society at large.

The news sent positive vibes through the crypto market, propelling TON’s price over 30% in the weekly timeframe, and reigniting investor enthusiasm for the project. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: $20 On The Horizon For XRP? Unpacking A Potential 650x Surge And What It Means Pantera Bets Big On TON’s Mass Adoption Potential Pantera Capital, a leader in blockchain investments, has made a significant move by placing a hefty bet on the Toncoin ecosystem. While the exact investment amount remains undisclosed, industry whispers suggest it could surpass the $250 million Pantera spent on discounted Solana (SOL) tokens last year. This strategic investment underscores Pantera’s belief in TON’s potential to become a mainstream cryptocurrency. Source: Pantera Capital “We’ve invested heavily in TON because it has the unique ability to introduce crypto to the masses,” declared Pantera Capital in a recent blog post. They point to TON’s seamless integration with Telegram, a messaging app boasting a staggering user base exceeding 800 million. Pantera envisions TON leveraging Telegram’s user-friendly interface and vast user pool to become a dominant force in the crypto landscape. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView TON Price Rallies On Positive Developments Pantera’s bullish stance on TON comes on the heels of a series of positive developments for the project. At the recent Token2049 conference in Dubai, Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov unveiled a roadmap for integrating TON functionalities directly within the Telegram app. This includes plans to allow users to log in to their Telegram accounts using crypto wallets, further blurring the lines between traditional messaging and the world of blockchain. TON seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko The news of Pantera’s investment, coupled with Telegram’s commitment to TON integration, fueled a buying frenzy in the TON market. The token price surged near the $7 mark, inching closer to its all-time high of $7.25. This price increase reflects renewed investor confidence in TON’s future prospects.

In 2019, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a restraining order against Telegram, effectively blocking the launch of its planned Gram token. The SEC alleged that the Gram ICO violated securities laws. However, the Telegram team persevered, and the TON ecosystem continued to evolve with TON coin emerging as its central currency. A New Chapter For Toncoin? Pantera Capital’s investment and Telegram’s continued commitment to TON integration mark a significant turning point for the project. With a robust messaging platform as its foundation and the backing of a prominent investment firm, TON is well-positioned to bridge the gap between mainstream users and the world of cryptocurrency.

27542283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607361,1715349642,"Bitcoin Short Term NUPL Value Turns Negative, What This Means For Price","Crypto analyst Onchained recently provided valuable insights into an important metric that can be used to gauge the future trajectory of Bitcoin. The analyst suggested there was no cause to worry at the moment but highlighted what to watch out for to know the right time to exit the market. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders NUPL Turns Negative In a blog post, the analyst noted that the NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) for Bitcoin’s short-term holders recently turned negative. The analyst added that this signals fear among this category of investors, which is very much likely given Bitcoin’s current price action. The last time this trend occurred was shortly after the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, with Bitcoin dropping from $49,000 to $38,000 following that occurrence. Related Reading: What Triggered The 6,350% Spike In XRP Long Liquidations Compared To Shorts? Source: CryptoQuant While the short-term holders’ NUPL turning red again suggests that a significant price decline may be on the horizon, the analyst remarked that this price level may simply represent a significant support line. The real cause for concern might be when the NUPL for mid-term holders also turns negative. “It could indicate widespread market fear and serve as a crucial risk management indicator for exiting the market,” the analyst claimed. It is worth noting that the short-term holder’s NUPL being negative means they are currently seeing an unrealized loss in their investments. This could trigger a wave of sell-offs among these investors, mainly because of fear that Bitcoin’s price could further dip. However, based on the analyst’s analysis, this might not significantly lower Bitcoin’s price. Instead, market speculators should be more worried about the PUNL of mid-term holders (those who have been holding Bitcoin for 3 to 6 months). The PUNL also turning negative will “suggest widespread pessimism or negative sentiment.” This could lead to massive selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price as this category of investors might also offload their holdings out of fear. The Worst May Already Be Over Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously shared a similar analysis to Onchained’s, noting that Bitcoin short-term holder’s (STH) realized price was at $59,800. The analyst warned back then that Bitcoin dropping below this level could trigger “notable Bitcoin price corrections.” Following his prediction, Bitcoin fell below $59,800, dropping to as low as $57,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Drop To $2,500, Here’s Why However, the flagship crypto has since then recovered nicely above $60,000. Although Bitcoin is still showing signs of a bearish outlook, its quick recovery above $60,000 suggests that the worst might be over, and all the crypto token needs right now is a catalyst to spark a continuation of its bull run. Arthur Hayes, BitMEX’s co-founder and former CEO, also confirmed this belief, noting that Bitcoin has already found its local bottom. However, he predicted that Bitcoin will likely have a “range-bound price action between $60,000 and $70,000 until August.” BTC bulls push price above $63,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Kiplinger, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-short-term-nupl-value/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Bitcoin and Nasdaq are strongly correlated, hence expect both asset classes to grind lower during the seasonal rather weaker summer months into the typical bottom in September or October. Technically, it seems that Bitcoin is consolidating within a large cup-and-handle. The bottom could be found somewhere around the 38.2%-retracement at USD 51,500ish. Fundamentally, the collapsing yen is paving the way ahead towards more money printing and more chaos, which makes alternative assets like Bitcoin worth striving for. Since nearly two months, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is facing a price decline and the whole cryptocurrency market has seen a significant drop in prices. Bitcoin, which had surged to new all-time highs above USD 73,000 in early March, has now fallen back to around USD 61,500. Review Despite the crypto community eagerly anticipating the Bitcoin halving, the event itself did not lead to the hoped-for massive price surge. Instead, starting from the new all-time high of USD 73,793, a gradual downturn of about -23.3% from March 14th onwards evolved. While Bitcoin and all those new Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , ARKW , BITX , BITQ , WGMI , BTCW , BTF , STCE and BETH as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) managed to hold more or less steadily above the USD 60,000 mark throughout most of April, the low was ultimately found at USD 56,500. Dumb money too optimistic Since then, Bitcoin, along with the stock markets, has experienced a rapid and significant recovery, reaching as high as USD 65,513. Whether the correction has indeed come to an end remains uncertain at present, though. While current prices around USD 62,000 have not managed to sustain the peak of the recovery, the short-term uptrend is slightly weakened but still intact. S&P500, Smart Money vs. Dumb Money, as of May 7th, 2024. (Sentimentrader) It remains noteworthy that the “smart money” in the US stock markets tends to utilize the high prices for selling, suggesting that the recovery there is likely purely technical. While “smart money” remains neutral overall, the “dumb money” has once again become very optimistic. Consequently, the upside potential seems to be quite limited in the coming months. Bitcoin and Nasdaq are strongly correlated Bitcoin vs. Nasdaq, correlation as of April 18th, 2024. (Bloomberg, Tavi Costa) Given Bitcoin’s close correlation with the Nasdaq NDAQ and the tech sector, similar conclusions can be drawn for the entire crypto sector! Bitcoin 24-hour trading volume, as of May 6th, 2024. (coinmarketcap) For instance, Bitcoin trading volume has significantly decreased following the ETF spike. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows, as of May 7, 2024. (The Block) Some Bitcoin ETFs like FBTC, GBTC and ARKB even experienced strong outflows in the last week. Without a liquidity event by central banks or a new narrative, both the stock markets and Bitcoin, and thus the entire crypto sector, are expected to face challenges in the seasonally weak summer phase. Overall, our recent skeptical stance has been confirmed by the downturn, and we continue to speculate that the end of the correction for Bitcoin will likely not occur before September or October. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin weekly chart – Sell signals are slowly increasing Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of May 8th, 2024. (TradingView) After a spectacular rise from USD 15,479 to USD 73,794 (+376.75%) within 15 months, Bitcoin has been undergoing a correction since March 14th. The classic 38.2% retracement at USD 51,518 has not been reached yet. However, the original support zone around USD 60,000 has already been weakened and is unlikely to withstand another bearish attack. Similarly, the weekly stochastic has activated a selling signal, while the monthly stochastic is strongly overbought and in need of cooling off. The two Bollinger Bands are currently widely diverged, indicating further consolidation and correction needs. If indeed a cup-and-handle formation is developing in the larger picture for Bitcoin, the completion of the handle is likely to require much more time and possibly deeper prices in the meantime. Overall, the weekly chart is slightly bearish, although there are no strong sell signals yet. However, the situation has somewhat dimmed, and at least a pullback within the upper half of the uptrend channel to around USD 55,000 should be expected during the weaker summer months. If a typical retracement occurs within the handle to the 38.2% retracement, prices around USD 51,500 can be anticipated. On the upside, a weekly closing price above USD 74,000 is needed to clearly and definitively end the correction. Bitcoin daily chart – Below the 50-day moving average Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of May 8th, 2024. (TradingView) On the daily chart, Bitcoin prices slipped below the 50-day moving average (USD 65,839) in mid-April and have since been unable to reclaim it. By now, this moving average has also turned downwards, hence a strong resistance awaits the recovery in the range of USD 65,500 to 66,000. If the recapture fails to be sustained, the market is likely to eventually seek the significantly lower running 200-day moving average (USD 50,512 USD). At the same time, the daily stochastic has triggered a buy signal, which should support Bitcoin in the coming days and perhaps one to three weeks. To conclude, the daily chart is currently slightly bullish. The ongoing recovery could potentially continue for a good while longer. However, the bulls will encounter strong resistance in the range between USD 65,500 and 67,300. Therefore, we anticipate the end of the recovery to occur no later than in this region. On the other hand, if the peak of the recovery has already been seen at 65,513 USD, the important support zone around USD 60,000 is likely to quickly become the focus of market participants. Sentiment Bitcoin – Optimism still too high Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of May 6th, 2024. (Lookintobitcoin) The “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” is currently at 71 out of 100 points, slightly below its high of 88 on March 14th. Despite the downturn, sentiment has not been completely reset. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of May 6th, 2024. (Coinmarketcap) The “CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index” from CoinMarketCap has significantly retreated in recent weeks and currently indicates a more neutral sentiment. However, we still have quite a way to go before reaching a contrarian buying opportunity, which typically arises only during a selling panic. Overall, sentiment remains overly optimistic. It will likely require either another significant wave of selling or an extended period of sideways movement, or a combination of both, before the upside potential becomes compelling again. Seasonality Bitcoin – Favorable seasonality until early June Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of May 3rd, 2024. (Seasonax) With the strong rise from late January to mid-March, Bitcoin somewhat stretched its seasonal pattern in the first quarter. Nevertheless, statistics still favor the bulls until early June. Subsequently, however, there is typically a clear downtrend, which concludes with a bottoming process between late September and mid-October. In summary, seasonality remains positive until early June. After that, the seasonal indicator shifts to dark red. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold, Bitcoin – Recovery attempt fails, summer doldrums loom Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of May 8th, 2024, 2024. (TradingView) With Bitcoin trading at around USD 62,000 and gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) at approximately USD 2,315, one currently needs about 27 ounces of gold to purchase a single Bitcoin. Conversely, this translates to roughly 0.037 Bitcoin per ounce of gold. Since mid-March, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio has declined significantly from levels around 34 to 25. While Bitcoin experienced a clear correction, gold, on the other hand, saw significant gains. Since the major correction in 2022, this is the first time that the ratio has shifted so markedly in favor of gold. In the grand scheme of things, however, Bitcoin remains the much faster horse. Having fallen back to 24, the ratio has nearly reached its rapidly rising 200-day moving average and the 38.2% retracement of the former rally. However, the sharp recovery in recent days does not appear to signal a completed correction but rather seems like a technical reaction. To truly correct the steep ascent of the last 15 months, a significantly deeper retracement into the range between 18 and 20 may be necessary. Overall, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio is undergoing the expected correction. This correction is likely to continue indirectly over the coming months to probably find its bottom in the range between 18 and 20. Macro Update – The collapsing yen is paving the way ahead Japanese Yen vs. US-Dollar, monthly chart as of May 8th, 2024. (TradingView) Over the past three and a half years, the Japanese yen has dramatically depreciated against the US dollar, recently reaching its lowest level since 1991. However, despite this, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) only raised the benchmark interest rate by a meager quarter point to 0 to 0.1% in March, even though the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has implemented significant interest rate hikes in recent years and has recently indicated that US interest rates may remain higher for longer. With one of the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratios of over 260%, Japan has been forced to keep interest rates at an extremely low level, near zero, for years. Even as inflationary pressures have increased, the BOJ has resisted aggressive interest rate hikes. The central bankers feared they would make the enormous debt burden even more uncontrollable. While Japanese banks have attempted to curb the yen’s weakness by selling dollar holdings, the diametrically opposed interest rate policies logically hinder success. The “yen carry trade” poses significant risks for the international financial casino Given the recent rapid depreciation, the collapsing yen now sends strong warning signals, particularly as the “yen carry trade” is one of the main supports for the international financial casino. For years, low-interest yen loans have been taken out to invest in higher-yielding assets abroad, especially in the US bond and US stock markets. However, a worsening yen weakness could lead to margin calls and potentially force the liquidation of positions, triggering significant volatility between different assets in the international financial system. A rate hike in Japan, on the other hand, would similarly put significant pressure on the “yen carry trade”. Due to the high debt burden, Japanese policymakers likely have no choice but to resort to debt monetization and thus significantly higher inflation. However, this environment creates the ideal breeding ground for alternative assets like Bitcoin, which has proven itself as one of the best stores of value outside the traditional fiat financial system over the past 14 years. In the current high-interest rate environment, Bitcoin has demonstrated impressive resilience While Bitcoin could have been considered a “low-interest phenomenon” in its first 12 years of existence, its recent resilience in a high-interest rate environment unmistakably confirms its nature as hard money and makes it one of the few instruments to counter the stealth devaluation of fiat currency. As formerly respected institutions and governments sink into dysfunction and inaction, Bitcoin, based on mathematical code, becomes a beacon of hope for those seeking truth and order amidst chaos. While there are many valid criticisms of Bitcoin, its monetary properties of immutable scarcity, decentralization, and transparency make it a significantly better alternative to the fiat world drowning in devaluation, obfuscation, and misallocated credit, alongside precious metals. Total global debt resumed its upward trend in the first quarter of 2024 Total global debt, as of May 7th, 2024. (IIF Global Debt Monitor, Holger Zschäpitz) The dramatic depreciation of the yen is likely just the beginning of renewed upheavals within the fiat system. Global debt recently rose by USD 1.3 trillion to a new all-time high of USD 315 trillion in Q1, 2024. Furthermore, global debt-to-GDP ratio resumed its upward trend in the first quarter of 2024 after three consecutive quarters of decline. At the same time, emerging market debt rose to over USD 105 trillion. The largest increases came from China, India, and Mexico. The profound and structural imbalances that have accumulated over decades of easy money and reckless government spending cannot be sustainably corrected. Instead, the inevitable end is merely delayed along the timeline with desperate political measures. Thus, the shift towards the antifragile and network-based liquidity of Bitcoin is gradually occurring. Albeit for most, this shift will only come through the pain of devaluation. Overall, the crack-up boom will continue, gradually pushing prices for Bitcoin and precious metals higher. Nonetheless, we expect at least a brief respite in the markets in the coming months. Hence, we prefer to observe the tepid summer doldrums with an increased liquidity ratio from the sun-bed. Conclusion: Bitcoin – Recovery attempt fails, summer doldrums loom With May already upon us, spring officially has just six more weeks before the calendar summer begins. However, in financial markets, the month of May is associated with the old adage “Sell in May and go away.” Statistically, it can undoubtedly be shown that markets tend to perform better on average between October and the following spring than between May and September. For Bitcoin, closely correlated with tech stocks, we also anticipate a rough patch until autumn. This doesn’t necessarily mean dramatic price declines. A sluggish and mostly sideways consolidation could be enough to cool down the still overly optimistic sentiment. Overall, a healthy pullback to the 38.2% retracement level around USD 51,500 within the “cup-and-handle” formation appears most likely at the moment, before the next major uptrend wave could potentially start in mid-September or October 2024.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4691811-bitcoin-recovery-attempt-fails-summer-doldrums-loom-btcusd-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27561069.jpeg

42408289,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0oT,1715347077,"Fatemeh Fannizadeh on Crypto Law, Switzerland and How KYC Is Failing","Fatemeh Fannizadeh, a Swiss lawyer specializing in the crypto industry since 2016, knows personally how the long arm of the U.S. financial laws can often sweep up innocent individuals. Born in Iran, raised in Switzerland, and now a resident of New York City, Fannizadeh said that in the past she had sometimes run into problems with banks and other financial institutions simply because of her name.  Consensus 2024 will take place in Austin, Texas from May 29 – May 31. Get your tickets here.  Apart from the inconvenience this causes to her personally, the topic of financial surveillance – often rolled out in the name of safety and to mitigate crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing – is something Fannizadeh questions. Tracking nearly all financial flows is simply “inefficient,” she said.  Not only that, the rich and powerful who need to find a way around the law are often sophisticated enough to do just that. And so modern finance is in a state where everyone’s personal privacy is sacrificed — and for what? “Privacy is a right. It’s unfortunate that we have to actually really fight for it nowadays, because technology is so overpowering,” she said.  “My hope is that DeFi, in conjunction with privacy technology, will come up with innovative solutions that would be more inclusive to good actors and more exclusive to bad actors than the current system,” Fannizadeh said.  CoinDesk caught up with Fannizadeh to talk about the state of crypto law (and why it’s now impossible to keep up with the regulatory changes), why Switzerland is losing its status as a crypto hub (and how it may bounce back) and what she’s most looking forward to at Consensus, now just a few weeks away.  Do you still think that Switzerland is a crypto hub?  It depends on how you define a crypto hub. I still think that there are good reasons to base a project out of Switzerland. But I would say that the Swiss authorities were previously more welcoming to crypto and that has changed since the ICO [initial coin offering] boom, when a lot of projects were established out of Crypto Valley. It's not as attractive as before, but then again a lot of places are not as attractive as they once were.  Why do you think that is?  In general, we are seeing more and more regulation in the space. Whether a jurisdiction is welcoming depends on many factors, whether we are talking about a token lunch, where the project fits within the blockchain ecosystem, if and how it is permissioned or fully decentralized, etc. ? Depending on the needs of the project, the regulatory landscape it has to navigate changes a lot. If it's a privacy project, or there's no privacy element in it, then again, it changes a lot.  See also: Crypto Hubs 2023  I remember when I started doing crypto law, it was way more straightforward. We would advise projects and we would know what to do. Today, I don't think it's even possible for a lawyer to be up to date on everything that's happening anywhere in the world of crypto regulation. And it's fragmented too.  Do you think one region in particular stands out? Or maybe a handful of regions that are maybe more inviting? I'm thinking of Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates or maybe the Bahamas.  Each region can be attractive depending on what one wants to do. So if someone is more involved within DeFi or just trading in general, the Emirates is now where a concentration of these projects are. If someone is launching a token nowadays we see that happening more in the islands, like Cayman or the British Virgin Islands.  Before it was easier to just launch a token out of Switzerland. With privacy projects, we know where to avoid, but it is a bit more of a complicated topic — there is no “shoe that fits all.” There are other things to maneuver, like budget restrictions or timeline restrictions where a project may need something done fast or they have a lot of time and budget to have a more sophisticated set up. These are things to consider before we can find a solution that meets the project’s needs and risk profile.  Do you think the tide will change in Switzerland to become more regulatory friendly to crypto or get worse?  That's a really good question. We see some evolution in Switzerland, especially within the tax realm that makes it more complicated than before to be a crypto project based there. But these are things that one can negotiate or structure around. Switzerland has always been a jurisdiction that had a very neutral and welcoming attitude to finance — particularly within its banking sector. Because it takes the position of being politically neutral,t carries trust from actors to establish there or open a bank account there.  This was historically largely supported by banking secrecy: the fact that banks have to keep their clientbase entirely confidential. Until the early 2000, Swiss banks would never disclose whether they have a relationship with you or how much money you have with them. Everything would remain confidential just as your relationship with your lawyer or doctor or priest is confidential. However, under U.S. pressure this policy of bank secrecy faded away. The U.S. tax administration, especially, wanted to know who had bank accounts there and was eventually not declaring their assets, to replenish their treasury after the 2008-2009 economic crisis. .  So Switzerland, after losing its banking confidentiality, became a less attractive sector for the banking sector. Blockchain naturally fits within this narrative of Switzerland being a financial hub, so Switzerland would pursue financial innovation and welcome that sector.  Ueli Maurer, Switzerland’s former finance minister and president, made few statements supporting blockchain innovation withinSwitzerland. Ethereum incorporated in Switzerland — a lot of other important projects went there. There is still this drive for Switzerland to be an attractive financial space that moves from the banking sector to the blockchain sector.  This has to tie in with the Bank Secrecy Act, which seems to me like a blessing and a curse, right? Because you want governments to have the power to go after wealthy individuals that dodge taxes, but the law is so overbroad that it ends up restrictive to businesses and individuals. That’s just my opinion.  I always find it amusing that banking secrecy in Switzerland means the opposite of the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S, which is about surveillance and KYC. Surveillance is a social and political issue. I'm usually against surveillance in general and I believe that privacy is a right. It’s unfortunate that we have to actually really fight for it nowadays, because technology is so overpowering and it is only getting worse the more powerful our information technology becomes. I can foresee a form of surveillance that ends in a dystopian future. We need to make sure that we still have and keep control over our data now.  I do understand the arguments that tax evasion is bad and we need to find solutions against it. Obviously I believe that money laundering, terrorism financing and criminal activities are bad. But then I'm wondering whether the current way of tackling these issues, for instance by KYCing everyone, is actually constructive or productive. Did KYC stop money laundering or even lowered it? If you look at the state of the world, I think that the current ways are a very inefficient way to tackle these issues.  See also: If You're in Crypto, You're a Criminal  What I usually say is that KYC, which is just gathering information and tracking where money comes from and what it may be used for, is not preventing bad actors. Within the financial sector there are many sophisticated setups that can obfuscate where the money comes from or make it seem like somebody else is in possession of the money so that nothing flags in the KYC. Unfortunately, there are many wealthy and sophisticated bad actors that can do whatever they need to do to launder their money and use it in nefarious ways.  While normal people, people who don't have this knowledge, they are the ones who are actually harmed by the system. For instance, sanctions regulation, which is the topic of my panel at Consensus, usually targets a whole population based on their nationality or their place of residence. These are just normal people without bad intentions. My hope is that DeFi, in conjunction with privacy technology, will come up with innovative solutions that would be more inclusive to good actors and more exclusive to bad actors than the current system.  That’s a great answer.  It’s my passion and a topic I've been thinking a lot about lately. I'm originally from Iran and I lived most of my life in Switzerland. The question of sanctions and their impact is something I grew up with. My name is Iranian, so I sometimes ran into issues with financial institutions because my name flags in their system for example.  That’s bleak. To change this up a little bit, I sometimes talk to lawyers who work in the crypto space who take issue with the term “crypto law” because it's overbroad. Do you think it's a term that makes sense?  Interesting. I'm currently writing a chapter for a crypto law book, and the chapter is titled “The Madness of Crypto Law.” The title hints to the fact that crypto law is mad, meaning that there isn’t a common rational understanding of what it means and what it encompasses. It is both a term that makes sense and doesn’t make much sense. As I said before, crypto regulation has become so complex, there’s crypto legal news coming out everyday, it's almost impossible to follow and map everything.  I also think that there's an underlying philosophical discussion to this question. What do we mean by crypto law? Are we referring to state regulations relating to or impacting blockchain projects? Or is it relating to the normative realm of blockchain technology, i.e. the law of the code itself?  Well, in the U.S., it has to be the former, right? Even if there aren’t any specific crypto laws, no regulator is willing to consider crypto on its own merits.  There is this meme: “code is law,” meaning there are rules that are hardcoded and will be executed should the necessary preconditions be met, within decentralized, permissionless products or projects.Governance within DAOs, for instance, have their own set of rules. In order to interact with a DAO, one needs to get the token and vote through a certain process. These are all norms and rules. A postulate I have is that the main reason why no country has managed yet to really capture blockchain technology and regulate it in a satisfying manner is because these normative systems of state laws and crypto laws are so different. As if they speak two different languages.  See also: Consensys' Bill Hughes Talks Crypto Law  One cannot understand crypto with the language of U.S. law or vice versa. Like two puzzles with very different pieces that cannot be put together without an absurd, nonsensical result. And this is actually a feature of blockchain. I cannot blame the regulatory ecosystems for trying to capture it, but I think instead of capturing it, they have to understand that they need to interface with it. It's a very different approach.  Right. I'm not optimistic about it, to be honest.  You're not. Why?  More or less everything that you’ve already said, right? They're not willing to meet the technology on the technology’s terms.  In the U.S.?  Yeah, sorry. I have a very U.S. focus.  I mean, I moved here – it’s great. But seriously, even if I didn't live here, there is no way to avoid the U.S. in crypto law. It impacts any project, even if the project has no U.S. connections – nobody from the project is from the U.S. or resides there and all U.S. persons are excluded from token purchases, etc.– still, one needs to consider U.S. regulations.  Something to be optimistic about is that even if the U.S. fails in tackling crypto regulations constructively, there are tons of other jurisdictions. These projects live on the internet, so at least for the technology itself, there is a future. Whether this future is US or not, this is a valuable question.  Okay, last question is an easy one. What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?  Many things! It’ll actually be my first time and I'm very excited. We're almost a month away and I’ve already heard of many interesting events lined up and have meetings organized – I can’t wait to just get together with the attendees, I heard the crowd is excellent. I usually go to very specific community centric or legal and policy conferences. But Consensus is so comprehensive, right? It seems like a platform where we can reach “consensus,” discuss things with very different actors all in one place.  And you tell me, you've been. Is there anything I need to keep in mind?  Actually, there's this programming track called Consensus @ Consensus, which sort of like small breakout groups that focus on very narrow but consequential questions. Those tend to be pretty interesting. I've only attended in person twice, and basically work like a dog, but Austin is a fun city in general.  Yeah, that usually happens at conferences.

Bitcoin Poised For A Possible Decline Michael Van De Poppe’s prognosis explores the factors that are driving the gloomy view of Bitcoin‘s price trajectory, in the midst of market turbulence and uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Keeps Pushing, Why BTC Could Turn Bearish Below $60K? Van De Poppe affirms that the largest crypto asset by market cap is currently at the range low. For Bitcoin to maintain the range and the upward momentum to persist, this is technically the region it should probably hold. Should the asset fail to sustain this position, Van De Poppe anticipates a potential movement on the downside in the future. Thus, he has placed his price targets at $55,000 or even further toward the $52,000 threshold. The post read: Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds. If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction. Van De Poppe previously pointed out that Bitcoin is gradually moving close to the lower bounds of the range, in order to test support around $62,250 level. Consequently, it appears likely that BTC will keep moving toward the upside, following the breakout of the support level. However, since the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event, boredom has set in, suggesting a possible price decline. Thus, should a correction on the downside eventually take place, $52,000 and $55,000 are the two levels Van De Poppe expects BTC to drop to. Despite the negative outlook for BTC, the crypto expert thus far has urged investors to acquire more of the coin. Opposite Sentiment On BTC’s Investment While Poppe solicits investors to invest more in BTC, crypto critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff, on the other hand, has urged investors not to do so. Instead, Schiff has highlighted a possible impending massive rally for assets like Gold, Silver, and mining stocks. Related Reading: Analysts Bullish On Bitcoin Despite Peter Schiff’s $20,000 Doom Scenario He claims that the charts and the fundamentals have never looked this promising. Due to this, Schiff implored investors to engage more with these assets, saying Bitcoin is dead money and holders should sell before it is buried. “Take advantage of what could be the biggest precious metals bull market in history,” Schiff added. As of today, Bitcoin’s price has shown resilience, fueling optimism of an upward movement. BTC has recovered the $63,000 price level once again after falling to nearly $60,700 on Thursday. The digital asset is trading at $63,077, indicating a 3% rise in the last 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that both the market cap and trading volume have also increased by 3.10% and 5.52%, respectively, in the past day.

While Bitcoin’s performance remains a focal point, the spotlight is also on new altcoin presales that are showing promising potential for massive gains. Among these, Dogeverse, Wiener AI, and Sealana are emerging as key players in the crypto market, each with unique selling points and exciting prospects. Bitcoin’s Trajectory Aiming for $70K Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, has been a rollercoaster of value fluctuations. Despite recent uncertainties, many analysts and investors are optimistic about its potential to surge to $70,000 in the near future. Factors such as market sentiment, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic conditions play crucial roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. It has been showing signs of a strong recovery, with some analysts suggesting that it could reach or even surpass $70,000 by the end of the year. This optimism is partly driven by the macroeconomic environment, including monetary policies and traditional finance (TradFi) investors increasingly allocating to Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has been a significant positive driver, suggesting a more mainstream adoption and institutional interest in cryptocurrency. Market analysts from Coinpedia and crypto.news have noted that Bitcoin has already brushed against the $70,000 mark and, supported by substantial investments from ‘whales’ (large-scale holders), could be poised for new highs. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now >>Buy Dogeverse now >>Buy Weiner AI now >>Buy Sealana now<<< Considerations for Investors As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are keenly watching the impact of global economic trends, regulatory developments, and technological breakthroughs.

RNDR cheers Apple's brief mention of Render-powered 3D design software Octane.  Alternative cryptocurrencies with positive news flows are shining bright as the bitcoin rebound spurs renewed risk-taking in the crypto market.  In the past 24 hours, TON, the native cryptocurrency of the layer project The Open Network, has risen 17.5% and decentralized GPU-based rendering solution Render Network's RNDR token has gained 13.2%, according to data source Coingecko. Both are among the best-performing coins of the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the market leader, has rallied 6% to $63,000.  TON's rally seems to be driven by reports that the highly-anticipated launch of the viral Telegram-based game Notcoin's native coin, NOT, will happen on May 16. The token will be minted on The Open Network.  Leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Bybit, OKX and Bitfinex have already decided to support NOT.  On Thursday, Binance announced a launchpool for NOT, offering 3 billion coins to users who stake their BNB or FDUSD stablecoin. OKX unveiled a ""jumpstart"" campaign, rewarding TON stakers with NOT tokens. The program will begin on May 16 at 06:00 UTC and run for three days.  Meanwhile, RNDR continued to cheer Nasdaq-listed tech giant Apple's brief mention of Render-powered 3D design software Octane Tuesday. Since then, the token has risen over 20%, taking the month-to-date gain to over 56%.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded either side of $63,000 during the European morning on Friday having retreated from its rebound to $64,400 late Thursday. BTC looks set to end the week in an upward trend having recovered from its collapse south of $57,000 last week. At the time of writing, bitcoin is priced just under $63,000, 3.1% higher in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), measuring the broader digital asset market, is up 3.6%. Solana led the gains among the CD20 constituents, climbing over 9% to $154, while DOGE is up just over 4.5% at $0.15, testament to the meme-coin season in crypto markets.  Comfortably the biggest gainer of the last week among the largest cryptocurrencies is toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network, which has risen from around $5.20 to just under $7. In the past 24 hours, it has jumped nearly 17% following news that viral Telegram-based game Notcoin will introduce its native NOT token on May 16. TON, which is the blockchain of choice for the messaging app's blockchain projects, has risen nearly 30% in the last week, extending its gains against other crypto majors. For context, the CD20 is up around 5.5% compared to its level of a week ago.  Binance and fellow crypto exchange KuCoin have won registration with India's Financial Intelligence Unit. They became the first offshore crypto-related entities to be approved by the anti-money laundering unit, months after being banned at the end of last year. KuCoin paid a $41,000 fine and resumed operations, while Binance is also expected to pay a penalty after a hearing with the FIU. “Binance is registered but the compliance proceedings are not completed because the amount of penalty has to be decided by me and that hearing is still going on,” said Vivek Aggarwal, who heads FIU-IND. Among the other sanctioned platforms, Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io have all begun negotiations with the regulator.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows cumulative notional open interest, or dollar value locked, in the active toncoin (TON) perpetual futures contracts listed on Binance, Bybit and OKX.  Open interest has risen to a one-month high of nearly $200 million in a sign of renewed inflow of money into the market.  TON has risen 28% in one week, outperforming the rest of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market value.

27526630,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4691787-marathon-digital-q1-24-slipstream-post-halving-indications-mara-stock-btcusd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1715342400,"Marathon Digital: Q1 2024, Slipstream, And Early Post-Halving Indications","Summary Marathon Digital released earnings for Q1-24 and reported a huge beat in earnings per share. The company's $337 million in quarterly net income was entirely attributable to a change in fair value accounting rules. While the company is being proactive in fee generation strategy, there are still long-term hurdles facing the business model. When I last covered Marathon Digital ( MARA ) for Seeking Alpha, I downgraded the stock from ""buy"" to ""hold"" and noted both weak stickiness in transaction fees and a stock valuation already implying a six-figure Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price. In the closing summary I said MARA would likely serve as a solid swing trading ticker and that has indeed been the case with the stock often moving up or down by 5% or more in a single day: Data by YCharts In this update, we'll look at the company's Q1-24 earnings report, April Production, MARA Pool data, and longer-term mining trends. Q1-24 Earnings & April Production For the period ended March 2024, Marathon Digital reported an eye-popping $1.26 EPS figure, more than a dollar better than estimates. The company grew quarterly revenue to $165.2 million from $51.1 million in Q1-23; a year-over-year increase of 223%. Q1-24 (MARA 10-Q) Somewhat surprisingly, Marathon's gross margin was actually negative by $3 million after cost of revenues surged to $168.2 million from $51.1 million in the prior year. Like many in the public mining space, Marathon Digital's numbers are benefiting from recent changes to FASB fair value accounting rules that allow the companies to show fair value of BTC holdings. Q1-24 (MARA 10-Q) This change in accounting is entirely responsible for the company's enormous $369.7 million operating income. If we take away the $488.8 million gain on digital assets in the quarter, Marathon Digital's operating income was negative by over $119 million in Q1. If we take out the unrealized capital gains on Bitcoins that were mined in previous quarters, total operating expenses were over $116 million. Adding that figure to the $168.2 million cost of revenue and then dividing the sum (roughly $285 million) by the 2,811 BTC that the company mined in a quarter gives us a back of the envelope breakeven BTC price of $101k - which is 60% premium to current Bitcoin prices. What's concerning about all this is the fact that Q1 data doesn't even include post-halving production yet. Looking at the company's monthly production trend, April doesn't actually look that bad, even though the month included 11 days of post-halving production: Author's Chart (Company filings) Part of MARA's 850 BTC mined during the month of April can be attributable to the massive spike in Bitcoin transaction fees on April 20th when the Runes protocol launched. Even though the block subsidy is down to just 3.125 BTC via new coin issuance, MARA Pool had two blocks on April 20th that combined for nearly 33 BTC. Since the start of May, MARA has mined just 1 block that has been larger than 3.7 BTC. The rest have been slightly above the block reward subsidy figure of 3.125. That said, the company is trying to extract as much from the fee market as it can muster. Slipstream & Block Fee Performance Back in February, the company announced the launch of its Slipstream service. This service essentially allows individual transactors the ability to go direct to Marathon Digital's MARA Pool for blockchain inclusion, rather than via the standard mempool where any mining pool can process the transaction. For this service, MARA Pool is able to charge a fee premium over the standard mining fee. The reason a user would opt for this type of service over taking the cheaper pool-agnostic approach to block inclusion would be for stronger assurance that a non-standard transaction will be included in the block space. According to Slipstream's FAQ: Typically, most nodes automatically reject complex transactions, even if they conform to Bitcoin Core's consensus rules... By facilitating the acceptance of complex transactions directly into Marathon's mempool for mining, Slipstream enables more types of creative transactions for Bitcoin users. So far, it seems that Slipstream is indeed seeing some early success since launch, judging by Mempool data: Rank Pool Blocks Avg Block Fees Empty Blocks 1 Foundry USA 1156 (27.24%) -1.51% 0 (0.00%) 2 AntPool 1025 (24.15%) -1.33% 2 (0.20%) 3 ViaBTC 548 (12.91%) -2.90% 0 (0.00%) 4 F2Pool 499 (11.76%) -1.86% 3 (0.60%) 5 Binance Pool 189 (4.45%) -0.96% 0 (0.00%) 6 MARA Pool 145 (3.42%) 11.06% 0 (0.00%) 7 Luxor 135 (3.18%) -3.13% 3 (2.22%) 8 SBI Crypto 104 (2.45%) -2.09% 0 (0.00%) 9 SpiderPool 87 (2.05%) -10.96% 7 (8.05%) 10 Braiins Pool 82 (1.93%) -1.05% 0 (0.00%) Source: Mempool.Space, 1 Month Pool Ranking In the table above, I'm showing the top ten pools by blocks over the last 30 days. While MARA Pool ranks 6th by blocks, MARA Pool's average block fees are more than 11% higher than what would be expected given the network footprint of the pool. MARA Pool (Mempool.space) That footprint has been generally increasing over the last several years as Marathon Digital scales exahash. For much of 2021 and 2022, MARA Pool dominance typically oscillated between 1-2%. Since the start of 2023 trough through the end of year, MARA Pool dominance was often between 3-5%. The point is, MARA Pool is growing in both network dominance and in average fee metrics. That's a good sign for MARA bulls. But there are still large hurdles. Long-Term Risks I've mentioned this many times in recent months, so I won't belabor the point; the Bitcoin network needs transaction fees to become a more important part of the total block reward to continue incentivizing mining as each four-year halving cycle further diminishes token issuance. Marathon Digital is clearly being proactive in this regard by launching a direct-to-user transaction service in the first quarter of the year that commands a fee premium. While this has apparently been successful so far, it's important to keep in mind the long-term growth in transaction fees is far from a sure thing: Bitcoin Total Fees (IntoTheBlock) Fees have historically spiked only temporarily during times of high network activity before returning to normal levels shortly after. We've seen three distinctly different fee booms over the last 18 months as a result of Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, and the recent launch of the Runes protocol at this latest halving block. These types of actions generally require the kinds of complex transactions that Slipstream is built for, but long-term growth in this area may be limited due to the fee premiums and scalability issues on Bitcoin's base layer. Network Rewards Trend (Mempool.space) The chart above is showing the full trend in block rewards denominated in both BTC (shown in yellow) and USD (shown in green). The USD trend is important because it offers context for the increase in price of BTC as an offset for lower coin issuance over time. On the surface, this seems to justify BTC mining over time, given the increase in USD-denominated rewards even as BTC-denominated rewards decline. Data by YCharts However, the missing detail is the surging competition for that increase in USD-denominated reward through the exponential growth in global hash rate. Mining Profitability (Bitinfocharts) When factoring global hash rate, it's perhaps not a surprise that mining profitability just made a new all-time low on May 3rd. Higher BTC prices can only make up for declining coin issuance for so long. Ultimately, fees from transactions are required and potentially even secondary and tertiary revenue streams from mining companies. Summary The good news for MARA bulls is that the company is being proactive in addressing some of these long-term issues through services like Slipstream and Anduro. The bad news is the company continues to dilute shareholders while operating at a loss quarter after quarter. The weighted average of diluted common stock grew from 169 million last year to just under 268 million this year - a staggering 58.5% year-over-year increase. I'm going to reiterate what I said about MARA last time I covered the company for SA. I think the stock is a hold at this point and is probably a better swing trade instrument than long-term investment. To be clear, I do still personally own some shares. As far as speculating in the public mining names goes, MARA is still the biggest producer, has the biggest stack, and is working on intriguing innovations for the industry. But there are clear issues with the company's current model and even though BTC has a limited supply, the same can't really be said for MARA shares.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4691787-marathon-digital-q1-24-slipstream-post-halving-indications-mara-stock-btcusd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27526630.jpeg

27528936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607367,1715340619,Crypto Expert Forecasts The ‘Age of Ethereum’: What This Means,"Ethereum has received a lot of criticism recently, and accordingly the ETH price has underperformed other altcoins. However, Ryan Berckmans, a prominent contributor of the Ethereum community and investor, boldly claims we are entering the “Age of Ethereum,” a period that could redefine the hierarchy of blockchain technologies. Berckmans shared his insights via X, sparking a mixture of enthusiasm and skepticism among the crypto community. Berckmans argues that Ethereum’s underlying fundamentals remain exceptionally strong despite facing several perceived challenges. He tackles common investor concerns directly, providing counterpoints to each that highlight Ethereum’s enduring strengths and potential. “ETH’s fundamentals look excellent,” states Berckmans. He addresses the concerns about competition from Bitcoin’s Layer 2 applications, regulatory hurdles from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the rise of other blockchains like Solana. According to him, these are misconceptions rather than true barriers: “The thing about all these headwinds is that none of them are real. In reality, Ethereum is on the cusp of becoming a global economic backbone and achieving permanent institutional legitimacy.” Why Ethereum Is Allegedly Superior To Its Competitors Berckmans critiques Bitcoin’s L2 ecosystem, suggesting that it falls short in practical aspects compared to Ethereum’s more mature and versatile platform. “Buy ETH because Bitcoin’s L2 app ecosystem is currently trash and will always be significantly worse in all practical ways to Ethereum,” he states, emphasizing the superiority of Ethereum for developers seeking robust, tested solutions. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Drop To $2,500, Here’s Why On the regulatory front, despite looming concerns that the SEC might classify ETH as a security, Berckmans remains optimistic about Ethereum’s position: “Buy ETH because the SEC probably won’t be successful in classifying ETH as a security. Even if it happens, the Executive Branch will ultimately be unsuccessful in curbing Ethereum’s growth because we’re very useful to America and to many powerful political blocs, such as Big Tech and tradfi asset managers.” Addressing competition from Solana, Berckmans points out that perceived advantages in scalability and application growth may not be as solid as they appear. He suggests that Ethereum does not face any genuine competition: “Buy ETH because Solana is not as scalable as it looks; is not as high growth as it seems; has more fast L2s as competitors than it may appear; has significantly less client diversity and more tech risk than is sold; and overall, is weaker and more threatened than most think.” Related Reading: Crypto Countdown: $2.4B In Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Set To Expire, Market Volatility Ahead? Moreover, Berckmans discusses the strategic movements of major financial players such as Visa, MasterCard, JP Morgan, and Citibank, which have built their own blockchains. He predicts these institutions will eventually gravitate towards Ethereum due to its extensive network and trustless, global operations. “Buy ETH because Visa, MasterCard, JP Morgan, and Citibank did build a shared chain and are using it instead of Ethereum, and soon, having tasted the future, they’ll migrate to Ethereum as the customers and the universe of potential partners are on Ethereum,” claims Berckmans. The crypto expert also clarifies the relationship between Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions, stressing a symbiotic dynamic where both layers accrue value, much like railways and the businesses that thrive upon them: “Buy ETH because value accrues to all of L2s and ETH and our apps. It’s a symbiosis.” Overall, the bold predictions of Ryan Berckmans offer a compelling vision of Ethereum’s potential to not only weather current challenges but also to emerge as a central pillar in the future of global finance. Whether this vision will fully materialize remains to be seen, but for now, the notion of an “Age of Ethereum” is sparking considerable debate and interest among investors and industry observers alike.

42408274,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0HP,1715336831,"Binance, KuCoin Win Registration From India Anti-Money Laundering Regulator as Crypto Credibility Improves","The two exchanges – among nine banned in December – have become the first offshore crypto related entities be registered.  The registrations will add ""little more credibility to the system,"" the regulator said.  Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and rival KuCoin became the first offshore crypto-related entities be approved by India's anti-money laundering unit, months after being banned for ""operating illegally.""  The two have been registered with the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), the most senior official of the unit, which falls under the nation's Finance Ministry, told CoinDesk. They were among more than 9 offshore entities banned – others included Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex – at the end of last year.  The approval marks a credibility shift for crypto in the nation, said Vivek Aggarwal, who heads FIU-IND, at a meeting with several financial journalists. The unit will set up a working group with the industry to review compliance guidelines on money laundering laws for virtual digital asset service providers, he said.  “It is parliament and government as a whole,” that need to give legitimacy to the industry, he said. The registrations act to “safeguard the Indian economy. If any business is ring-fenced from being abused for financial crime then automatically it has, if not legitimacy, at least little more credibility to the system,” Aggarwal said.  KuCoin paid a penalty of $41,000, the first crypto entity to do so, and has resumed operations. Binance has not resumed operations because it is expected to pay a penalty after a hearing with the FIU. The Economic Times, citing people familiar with the matter, said Binance would settle with a $2 million fine.  “Binance is registered but the compliance proceedings are not completed because the amount of penalty has to be decided by me and that hearing is still going on,” said Vivek Aggarwal, who heads FIU-IND.  Among the other sanctioned platforms, Kraken, Gemini, and Gate.io have begun negotiations with the regulator. Both OKX and Bitstamp have submitted plans to exit the country.  India now has as many as 48 crypto entities registered as reporting entities under the nation’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Aggarwal said. Friday's meeting marks the first time the FIU has officially spoken to the press about crypto and comes after Aggarwal and other FIU officials met representatives of all 48 entities, also a first.  Ambiguous position for crypto industry  Nationally, India’s position on crypto has remained slightly ambiguous.  The imposition of stiff crypto taxes in 2022, along with the crypto markets winter pushed Indian traders to switch to international exchanges, hurting the local crypto industry. Trading volumes shifted back to Indian exchanges after the ban on offshore entities.  India also made it its G20 presidential priority in 2023 to achieve global consensus in framing crypto policy and got all members to agree to global guidelines, though the country came under scrutiny for pushing global consensus without having its own legislation in place.  India has kept a crypto bill in cold storage since 2021 and has indicated it will decide its position in the coming months. Previously, a senior lawmaker told CoinDesk that no bill is likely before mid-2025.  Building blocks  The occasion also saw the unveiling of a report titled “Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers: Road to Effective Compliance under PMLA” by the crypto advocacy body, Bharat Web3 Association.  The forward for the report is written by Aggarwal: “This document also reflects our commitment to fostering a regulatory environment that not only keeps pace with innovation but also safeguards the financial system against risks associated with money laundering.""  Offshore entities wishing to register with the FIU do not need to have an office in India. but require a principal compliance officer to be registered along with their address and other details, Aggarwal said. Those that have not won registration with unit and were sent a show cause notice in December remain blocked even if they have initiated talks.  “The primary goal of AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism framework) is that I should have full visibility of those transactions whenever I want and also I should get reports of suspicious transactions,” Aggarwal said. “To that extent, we have the compliance in place.”  Read More: India's Local Crypto and Web3 Advocacy Body Asked for Action Against Offshore Entities: Source  UPDATE (May 10, 10:57 UTC): Adds details, background throughout.

42408291,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC11h,1715336100,"Stand With Crypto Sets Up Election War Chest, Backs Candidates Seeking Open Seats","Crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto is opening its own Political Action Committee ahead of this year's elections.  The group's own members will support the PAC, though they're limited to $5,000 contributions.  The fast-growing organization of cryptocurrency supporters, Stand With Crypto, is getting into campaign financing with the opening of its own political action committee (PAC) that will make direct donations to endorsed congressional candidates, said Chief Strategist Nick Carr. Its opening slate of endorsements will feature five candidates seeking open seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, though the money will have to wait. Stand With Crypto's effort is an ""associated PAC,"" meaning it's supported by the nonprofit group's own members, and each of them will be limited to $5,000 contributions. Once they start adding cash to the PAC coffers, then the committee can start making direct donations to candidates as they face the latter months of the primaries and the big contest of November's general election, the group announced Friday.  ""I think it's incredible to see the amount of growth in such a short time span of Stand With Crypto,"" Carr said in an interview with CoinDesk. His organization, started in August 2023, now reports more than 443,000 people signing on. Separately from the PAC, the organization says it's raised more than $86 million to conduct advocacy operations, which have included supporter events, town halls and a presidential candidate forum.  Though billed as a grassroots organization, some of its major donations have come from corporate names, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Coinbase launched the group last year.  What separates the new PAC from other prominent crypto campaign-finance efforts is the others have been dominated by a handful of major digital assets businesses, giving $10 million or more to Fairshake and affiliated PACs. Those organizations target candidates with unlimited indirect support that's deployed independent of their campaigns. Stand With Crypto's PAC, as a political arm of the ""social welfare"" organization that's classified as a 501(c)(4), will give donations directly to the candidates, Carr said, targeting ""individuals who have demonstrated an impressive knowledge and commitment to crypto and blockchain innovation in America."" The amounts will be limited by the constraints that come with direct donations. And unlike with financial support to the organization itself, giving to the PAC will require the donors to identify themselves publicly.  The group endorsed a city councilman in Oregon, Democrat Eddy Morales, who is heading into a congressional primary there in a couple of weeks and said on his campaign website that ""artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies are still emerging and allow people to build wealth, own their own data, and have a seat at the table in the economy of the future,"" adding that he'd ""focus on creating a regulatory framework that provides clarity to these industries."" It also highlights Troy Downing, a Montana Republican who is the state's securities watchdog and is running for a House seat there amid a crowded field facing a June primary.  The group additionally endorsed three candidates that other crypto PACs have previously favored: Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures; Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who just won his party's primary this week to pursue a Senate seat; and West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, seeking the Senate seat left open by a departing Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) The endorsements will continue with future selections, Carr said, and the organization already has a well of incumbent candidates to choose from, because it maintains a grading of the members of Congress based on crypto friendliness.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/10/stand-with-crypto-sets-up-election-war-chest-backs-candidates-seeking-open-seats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e640b8f71cb9c686fbd7850cefdf25e1a6c6a6-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27528935,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607360,1715335255,"Ethereum Foundation Moves 1,000 ETH – Is The Top In?","The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Ethereum ecosystem, recently transferred a significant amount of ETH. Given what this transaction could imply, it has drawn the crypto community’s attention, which is already speculating about whether the market top might be in. Ethereum Foundation Moves 1,000 ETH On-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Ethereum Foundation transferred 1,000 ETH ($3 million) to a middle multi-signature wallet (0xbc9) on May 8. This development is more concerning as SpotOnChain revealed that the Foundation has made other transactions since the start of 2024. Related Reading: What Triggered The 6,350% Spike In XRP Long Liquidations Compared To Shorts? According to the platform, the Ethereum Foundation has sold 1,766 ETH for 4.81 million DAI at an average price of $2,725 for each ETH. These transactions are said to have occurred in “several small batches via the same multi-signature wallet. Interestingly, SpotOnChain noted that these transactions often occur ahead of a price drop. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum Foundation already has a reputation for selling at the top, suggesting that their selling ahead of a drop might not be a coincidence. In 2022, NewsBTC reported that Ethereum dropped by 40% after the Foundation sold off 20,000 ETH. Meanwhile, in 2021, ETH experienced a downtrend for months after the organization sold off 35,000 ETH. ETH’s price action after the Ethereum Foundation sold 20,000 ETH in 2022 | Source: Tradingview.com Journalist Colin Wu also revealed back then that Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, had persuaded the foundation to “sell 70,000 ETH at the top of 2018 to support the work of developers.” Wu further claimed that the Foundation’s sell-off is a “normal operation, but it also means that the Foundation thought that bear market was coming.” Therefore, from Wu’s revelation, one can deduce that the Ethereum Foundation could have an idea of when the market top is, which prompts them to always make these sales before ETH makes a significant decline. An ETH Decline May Already Be On The Horizon A crypto analyst known as Shin Forex recently predicted that Ethereum could soon drop to as low as $2,500. The analyst explained that there has been a slowdown in liquidity flowing into the Ethereum ecosystem. This could affect ETH’s price since it suggests a lack of interest in the token among investors. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious? From a technical analysis perspective, Shin Forex also revealed that the ETH/BTC pair has now broken below its support of 0.05. Ethereum is said to have experienced a significant crash when this happened in the market cycles in 2016 and 2019. As such, the analyst does not doubt that ETH will likely spiral down again, with the crypto token dropping to as low as $2,500. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,000, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408292,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC150,1715329878,Dogecoin Appears Headed for a 'Golden Cross',"DOGE's weekly price averages appear on track to confirm a bullish golden cross.  The previous golden cross, seen in early January 2021, presaged an 8,000% price surge.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}}, the world's largest meme cryptocurrency by market value, seems headed toward a repeat of the bullish ""golden cross"" technical pattern that presaged the early 2021 surge.  DOGE, which has a market cap of about $22 billion, has demonstrated remarkable performance this year, with a price surge of over 70% and significantly outpacing the near 50% increase in bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinDesk data.  The 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of the meme token's spot price is now trending north and looks set to cross above the 200-week SMA in the upcoming weeks, confirming a golden cross. In other words, near-term price momentum could soon outperform long-term momentum, potentially evolving into a prolonged bullish trend.  Momentum traders frequently use moving-average crossovers as a part of a structured approach to identifying entry and exit points in the market.  The DOGE price topped its 200-week SMA in March, breaking out of a prolonged sideways consolidation, and has since established a foothold above the critical average.  The impending golden cross would be the first in over three years. The previous one, seen in early January 2021, presaged a four-month rally that saw prices surge over 8,000% to a record 76 cents on Binance.  That said, past data does not promise future results. And that's particularly true in the case of moving average crossovers, which tend to lag prices and have been known to trap traders on the wrong side in traditional markets.  Besides, meme coins like DOGE lack real-world use cases and are mainly driven by speculation, which makes them more sensitive to fiat liquidity conditions and global interest-rate expectations.  During DOGE's early 2021 run, interest rates were near or below zero worldwide, which catalyzed unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market. That's not the case any more, with rates in the U.S., the world's largest economy, at multiyear highs above 5%.  Read: Is It Late 2020 All Over Again for Dogecoin?

27503163,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607329,1715327118,Donald Trump Could Be Bitcoin’s Biggest Price Booster: Experts,"Former President Donald Trump recently voiced strong support for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, notably diverging from his previously skeptical stance. This significant pivot, prominently featured in a recent video circulating among crypto enthusiasts and investors, has spurred speculation about the potential implications for Bitcoin and other digital currencies as the US election approaches this November. How Trump Could Boost Bitcoin Price The comments made by Trump were discussed by analyst MacroScope on X. The analyst emphasized the importance of Trump’s statements: “By now, you’ve probably seen the video of Trump‘s strident and arguably stunning pro-crypto comments.” MacroScope suggested that the implications of Trump’s newfound support could be profound, particularly because a positive shift in policy from Washington, D.C., regarding cryptocurrencies has not been factored into current market prices. MacroScope further advised, “In terms of potential price impact on BTC, this should be watched very, very closely in coming months.” The statement reflects a broader sentiment within the financial community that political endorsements can lead to market movements, particularly when they suggest a shift in regulatory approaches. The analyst drew parallels to the market’s underestimation of the impact of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating that a similar scenario might unfold if Trump’s supportive comments translate into formal policy changes. By now, you've probably seen the video of Trump's strident and arguably stunning pro-crypto comments. In terms of potential price impact on BTC, this should be watched very, very closely in coming months. It should go without saying that a constructive policy shift in DC is not… https://t.co/KL0RNqawZg — MacroScope (@MacroScope17) May 9, 2024 Meanwhile, the credibility of Trump’s promises is a critical factor in assessing the potential outcomes of his pro-crypto statements. While Trump is known for making ambitious promises to rally support, MacroScope noted, “Yes, he will promise anything in front of a crowd to get applause. But from various insider accounts, we also know that once he makes a high-profile promise, he’s acutely aware of the attention and approval it got, and he feels obligated to at least show the appearance of following through in terms of policy.” Related Reading: Latest Bitcoin Top Is Different From 2021 Peak, Analyst Explains Why This behavioral pattern suggests that Trump may continue to champion pro-Bitcoin and crypto policies, at least in appearance, to maintain the favor he has garnered from these statements. Moreover, the political discourse surrounding cryptocurrencies is intertwined with speculations about future leadership at the Federal Reserve. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who is viewed as a potential successor to Jerome Powell, has previously expressed a nuanced understanding of Bitcoin’s value, particularly in light of a weakening dollar. In a statement made in 2021, Warsh remarked, “It does make some sense to me,” referring to Bitcoin’s resilience during times of dollar depreciation. The potential appointment of Warsh could herald a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, aligning with Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric. Analyzing Trump’s BTC Stance: Julian Fahrer’s Insights Julian Fahrer, co-founder and CEO of Apollo, also recently offered a nuanced analysis of Donald Trump’s relationship with Bitcoin and crypto, spanning from his presidency to his post-presidential activities. Fahrer’s perspective is crucial in dissecting Trump’s public statements against his administrative actions. During his presidency, Trump openly criticized Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, notably after Meta’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin in 2019. Trump famously stated, “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Gets A ‘Monster’ Whale Boost With $1.2 Billion ETF Purchase Despite these comments, Trump’s appointments suggest a more complex position towards crypto. He appointed Hester ‘Crypto Mom’ Pierce to the SEC, known for her dissenting opinions in favor of Bitcoin and crypto, and Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, who viewed cryptocurrencies as a national security threat. This dichotomy shows that Trump’s administration maintained a somewhat ambiguous stance on crypto regulation, characterized by tightened KYC/AML rules by the Financial Action Task Force, alongside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s approval of crypto futures products. Post-presidency, Trump’s attitude appears to have shifted significantly. His venture into Trump Digital Trading Cards and disclosure of owning $2.8 million in ETH in 2023 signal a newfound embrace of digital assets. This change could be attributed to strategic shifts or financial incentives. Furthermore, Trump’s recent interactions, including bringing pro-Bitcoin Vivek Ramaswamy into his circle and positive comments on Fox about Bitcoin, indicate a potential pivot towards a more crypto-friendly posture if he were to secure a second term. Fahrer aptly notes, “The bigger an enemy of Bitcoin and crypto the Democrats seem to be, the more Trump appears to be embracing it.” This analysis underscores the fluidity between Trump’s rhetoric and his policy actions regarding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with Fahrer concluding that Trump’s evolving stance could lead to a ‘full on Degen Don’ as the November election approaches. Notably, investment giant VanEck predicted at the beginning of the year that a Trump victory will propel the Bitcoin price to a new all-time high on November 9th and potentially reach $100,000 by December. At press time, BTC traded at $63,024.

42408273,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0E6,1715323982,Kraken Asks Court to Dismiss SEC Claims to Avoid 'Significant Reordering' of U.S. Financial Structure,"Kraken's lawyers have asked a court to dismiss SEC's claims against to avoid a ""significant reordering"" of the U.S. financial regulatory structure.  The matter appears to be boiling down to whether the SEC has jurisdiction over the cryptocurrencies Kraken listed.  Crypto exchange Kraken has asked a U.S. court to dismiss the claims brought against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to avoid a ""significant reordering"" of the U.S. financial regulatory structure, according to court filings submitted in the Northern District of California on Thursday.  The SEC initially sued Kraken last November, alleging it did not register as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange. This was months after settling charges over Kraken's former staking service.  In February 2024, the crypto company moved to kick out the SEC's lawsuit. It argued that cryptocurrencies – at least, those listed in the SEC's complaint – should be treated like commodities and not securities, CoinDesk reported earlier.  Last month, the SEC filed a 39-page opposition to Kraken's motion to dismiss in which it said ""it is simply not the case that this enforcement action exceeds the authority Congress granted the SEC.""  ""The SEC was created by Congress to enforce the Securities Act and Exchange Act, including the requirement that securities intermediaries register with the SEC,"" the filing from April said. ""In applying the Howey test in its determination that Kraken must register, the SEC is simply following its Congressional mandate.""  The SEC further argued that it is not ""assuming new powers"" and Congress does not need to ""enact bespoke laws to each new technology that emerges.""  Kraken's latest reply to the SEC's motion to dismiss hinges on the extent to which one can interpret the SEC's jurisdiction by using the Howey test which determines what is and is not a security. It does so by determining whether four criteria are met - an investment of capital, in a common enterprise, with the expectation of profit, driven by the efforts of others.  ""The SEC cannot satisfy Howey’s additional requirements that there be investments of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others,"" Kraken's lawyers wrote. ""This would gut Howey by significantly expanding the SEC’s jurisdiction to a host of investment activities that were never delegated to the agency. Such a significant reordering of the U.S.’s financial regulatory structure should be debated in Congress, not in the courts.""  Judge William H. Orrick is scheduled to hear the matter on June 12.

42408272,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaC0An,1715320800,Exiled Russian Opposition Leader Launches Blockchain-Based Referendum on Vladimir Putin’s Election Win,"Exiled Russian opposition leader Mark Feygin is launching an anonymous, blockchain-powered referendum on the legitimacy of Vladimir Putin’s victory in Russia’s election.  The vote will be conducted on an app called Russia2024, built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool.  Vladimir Putin just won his fifth term as Russian president, though the 87% landslide election victory has been labeled preordained, stage-managed and a farce.  Now, exiled opposition leader Mark Feygin is leading an effort to give Russians an anonymous, blockchain-powered way to register a ""protest vote"" against Putin.  The results of this effort would, of course, have no legal weight in Russia and would not end Putin's presidency per se, but the referendum could, in theory, give a public relations boost to efforts to oust him. And it gives Russians a way to voice criticism in a nation where the consequences of dissent can be high; opposition leader Alexei Navalny recently died while jailed in an Arctic penal colony.  The vote will be conducted on an app called Russia2024, built using Rarimo’s Freedom Tool, which will use the Arbitrum blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography, making voters' identities untraceable.  “Dissent in Russia is growing more risky and public opinion harder to track,” Feygin said in a statement. He was exiled from Russia years ago, termed a foreign agent in 2022 and remains a wanted person in Russia. He is a former lawyer for the founders of the protest collective Pussy Riot. “It is critical that we provide reliable, surveillance-proof avenues for protest and polling. Russia2024 and its underlying technology has enabled that,” he added.  Only holders of Russian passports will be able to cast their vote. Around 34.6 million Russians have a valid passport.  Users will need to download the Russia2024 app and prove their citizenship by scanning their passports with their phones. The passports have a biometric chip that the tool uses to confirm the voter's identity and facilitate an anonymous vote. If a person doesn’t own a smartphone, a single phone can be used as a shared voting machine.  Voting will be allowed for about two weeks, and the backers behind the tool are “sure” it is a secure way to vote and that voters don't need to fear repercussions.  “Even after Navalny’s death, people came out and protested so they will vote as a countermeasure to the result,” said Freedom Tool co-founder Lasha Antadze, who has previously collaborated with the Ukrainian government to digitize the privatization of state properties. “Decentralized voting and the Freedom Tool is designed such that there is no single entity to attack, block or get rid of. You can’t hack it just like you can’t hack bitcoin.”  In the shadow of the war with Ukraine  Antadze also holds passports from Ukraine and Georgia. Putin’s victory is expected to give him the means to continue his war against Ukraine.  “We are handing out the open-source technology to everyone. It’s not only Ukrainians or Georgians building,” Antadze said when asked about the possible perception that this is backed by Ukrainian interests. “We got a lot of contributions through anonymous letters from cryptography professors within Russia. It’s a kind of wartime defense technology.”  Antadze, who spoke to CoinDesk from London, said the Russia2024 app was removed from the Apple app store initially, but they expect it to be back online this Friday. The app is available on Google's app store.  Referendums have been used for different reasons across the world: for signaling dissent in Canada, to pass specific policy in Switzerland and to choose whether a region wants to stay united with a nation or not in the U.K.  The main global “real world use case” is that it “can guarantee that authenticity,” it can “cut the cost” of any election-related voting exercise by “10 times” and the technology can be used by other nations, too, Antadze said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/10/exiled-russian-opposition-leader-launches-blockchain-based-referendum-on-vladimir-putins-election-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49ce621880cb0a335ad0584fa0778776baa090c3-1130x635.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27476458,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607251,1715310058,"Latest Bitcoin Top Is Different From 2021 Peak, Analyst Explains Why","An analyst has explained why the recent high in Bitcoin has experienced different market conditions than those observed during the 2021 bull run peak. Bitcoin Liquidations Have Been Short-Dominated In Recent Market High In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate pointed out how the latest 2024 high achieved following the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows has a major difference when compared to the 2021 peak. Related Reading: Arbitrum Prints TD Buy Signal: Trend About To Flip? The difference lies in the trend registered on derivatives markets. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the dominance of long liquidations in the sector over the last few years. The distribution of liquidations on derivatives market over the last few years | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the act of forceful closure that any derivatives market contract undergoes on an exchange when it accumulates losses of a certain degree. The risk of a contract getting liquidated becomes higher, and the more volatile the asset price gets. During sharp rallies and crashes, huge amounts of liquidation can pile up in the market. From the chart, it’s visible that as the rally in the cryptocurrency had occurred this year, the short holders had been taking a beating. This was only natural as surges pile up losses for these investors betting on a decline, so price growth as rapid as the one witnessed would have pushed many of these contracts toward liquidation. Interestingly, the scale of the short dominance maintained throughout the run, implying that the investors didn’t quite believe the run would continue any further at every point of the rally, so they bet against it. This has also remained true in the recent stagnation following the top, as short liquidations have outweighed the long ones even though the price has decreased. As is apparent in the graph, the 2021 peaks saw a different trend. Longs were getting liquidated as Bitcoin topped out during both the first half of the 2021 peak and the second half. In those periods, the investors had become too greedy and were only betting on the rise to continue even when the asset had slowed down. This greed appears to haven’t overtaken the market in the bull run. While the current Bitcoin rally differs from the last one in this metric, analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post another indicator where the trend appears to be similar to that observed in previous peaks. Looks like the value of the metric has been plunging in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X This indicator is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which basically tells us about the scale of dormant coin movement that’s happening in the market right now. It would appear that this metric had attained very high levels recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Fundamentals Could Sustain $265,000 Price, CryptoQuant CEO Explains “Coin Days Destroyed has probably peaked,” says Maartunn. “Bitcoin’s price typically reaches its peak around the same time.” It should be noted that although this has been true for some of the tops, the 2021 peak took months to form after the metric peaked.

Michaël van de Poppe, a recognized figure in the crypto analysis sector, has recently expressed his concerns regarding Bitcoin’s current price trajectory. Bitcoin Risks Dropping to $52,000, Why? Taking to Elon Musk’s social media platform X, Van de Poppe pointed out that Bitcoin is at the lower end of its current range, a crucial area for maintaining upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bold Bet: Options Traders Eye $100K Surge By September Van de Poppe warned that if Bitcoin fails to hold this level, the market could see a downturn, with prices potentially falling as low as $52,000 to $55,000. This prediction comes as Bitcoin attempts to stabilize above the $61,000 mark. Despite efforts to sustain this level, recent market behavior suggests a bearish trend could be looming. Van de Poppe’s analysis indicates that failing to maintain the lower range could lead to significant corrections, affecting investor sentiment and market dynamics. #Bitcoin is at the range low. This is technically the area where you’d prefer to see it hold, so the upward momentum continues, and the range holds. If this doesn’t hold, then we might expect $52-55K as a potential low on this correction. pic.twitter.com/j4rWI0Ti7G — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 9, 2024 Meanwhile, recent data from the analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals a noticeable decline in BTC whale accumulation volumes over the past month. These large investors, holding over 1,000 BTC, have been a stabilizing force in the market, particularly during price dips. However, the trend of diminishing whale purchases, especially during recent market corrections, suggests a decrease in their market influence and potentially a broader loss of appetite for Bitcoin at current levels. This pattern could indicate a shift in whale strategy or a broader market sentiment change, possibly leading to less support for Bitcoin prices during downturns. BTC Surging Demand vs. Limited Supply Despite the potential price dip, other market activities suggest a robust demand for Bitcoin. Samson Mow, a well-known Bitcoin community figure and former Blockstream CSO, highlighted the continuous buying from American spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Mow, these US ETFs purchase 1,626 BTC daily. Additionally, MicroStrategy acquires 199 BTC daily, and Tether buys 70 BTC daily. This significant daily demand, especially in the context of the reduced supply following the latest Bitcoin halving in April, where only 450 BTC are created each day, suggests that demand might significantly exceed supply. Related Reading: Analyst Narrows Down Timeline For Bitcoin Peak This Bull Cycle Mow emphasized this imbalance, indicating that the aggregate demand could be outstripping the available supply by 5 to 10 times, hinting at a potential upward pressure on prices if this demand persists.

Grayscale Exceeds Expectations Despite Outflows According to a shareholder letter from its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the operator of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recorded $156 million in revenue, showing little change from the previous quarter. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Predicts Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed, Is $265,000 Too Ambitious? Since the GBTC trust’s conversion to an ETF in January, Grayscale has seen outflows of about $17.4 billion as investors appear to have shifted their assets to new, lower-cost funds offered by BlackRock and Fidelity, the leaders in the US ETF race in terms of inflows recorded since January. While GBTC charges a 1.5% management fee, many of its competitors charge less than 0.3%, leading to outflows. In response, Grayscale announced plans in March to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to spin off some of Grayscale’s assets into a new, lower-fee “Bitcoin Mini Trust.” Despite the outflows, the Q1 revenue attributable to GBTC exceeded Grayscale’s expectations. The firm had previously anticipated outflows due to increased competition under the ETF wrapper. Grayscale previously charged a 2% sponsorship fee before the trust was converted. The flat revenue was also attributed to higher average Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and a decrease in assets under management (AUM). In contrast to Grayscale’s performance, all US spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a total net inflow of over $11 billion thus far. However, demand for these ETFs has recently declined amidst tightening financial conditions in the US, where the Federal Reserve (Fed) faces the challenge of addressing persistent inflation. DCG Reports 11% Q1 Revenue Increase Digital Currency Group, founded by Barry Silbert and the parent company of Grayscale, reported an 11% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q1 revenue to $229 million, primarily due to higher asset prices. However, revenue growth lagged behind Bitcoin’s price appreciation, which rose more than 60% during the same period. In its letter, DCG attributed this disparity to lower GBTC sponsor fees, redemptions, and steady mining revenues at its Foundry subsidiary. Related Reading: What Triggered The 6,350% Spike In XRP Long Liquidations Compared To Shorts? Foundry, DCG’s mining subsidiary, experienced a sequential revenue increase of 35%, propelled by staking and equipment sales revenue. Meanwhile, Luno, the company’s crypto exchange subsidiary, witnessed a 46% quarter-over-quarter sales boost, driven by a significant surge in trading volume. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $62,100 and has recently encountered significant price volatility. These price swings have failed to establish a stable position above crucial price thresholds.

Arbitrum May Have Hit A Point Of Reversal According To TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed a TD Sequential signal that Arbitrum has observed in its weekly price recently. The “TD Sequential” is an indicator in technical analysis generally used for locating probable reversal points in any asset’s price. This indicator has two phases, the first of which is known as the “setup.” In this phase, candles of the same polarity are counted up to nine, and once these nine candles are in, the price may be assumed to have reached a possible turnaround.

Once the setup is complete, the “countdown” phase begins. The countdown works much like the setup, except that it lasts thirteen candles, not nine. The countdown’s finish leads to another likely top or bottom for the price. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that shows the TD Sequential signal that Arbitrum has just formed in its weekly price: The pattern that has recently been forming in the ARB price recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, Arbitrum has recently completed a TD Sequential setup on its weekly price with red candles. This naturally means that, according to the indicator, the asset should likely reverse towards the upside now. The analyst suggests that this buy signal “anticipates a one to four candlesticks rebound for ARB.” Given this pattern, how the coin’s price will develop in the coming days remains to be seen. In some other news, the Arbitrum network has recently observed its transaction activity go up, as market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out in an X post. The trend in the total number of transactions taking place on the network over the last few years | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The chart shows that the number of transactions on Arbitrum has been increasing in the last couple of months. Back in early March, the network’s average transfer count stood at around 1 million, but recently, it has crossed the 2 million mark.
