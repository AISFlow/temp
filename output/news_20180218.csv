42380343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCTr,1518952825,"No, Not All ICOs Are Securities","Paul Paray is an attorney in Allendale, New Jersey, focused on privacy and technology matters.      In his Feb. 8 opinion piece for CoinDesk, Santander’s Julio Faura suggests that ""utility tokens are a bad idea"" because it would be a ""lie to ourselves"" to suggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) were not actually selling securities.  Rather, in Faura's opinion ""we should collectively work on a framework to build a clearly defined scheme for ICOs, recognizing from the very beginning that they are securities."" And, this ""ICO process should be designed in collaboration with regulators to comply with securities law.""  Faura's opinion piece does not exist in a vacuum. In a report dated Feb. 5, Goldman Sachs' global head of investment research suggests that investors in ICOs could possibly lose their entire investments – which ties to Faura's underlying premise that ICOs should be regulated ""to protect investors.""  It is not clear how his proposed hybrid solution would ever get implemented, given it requires complete buy-in from capital markets and regulators, so it would be a non-starter from day one.  Why would existing financial institutions and regulators scuttle existing methods of raising capital or attempt to squeeze ICOs under traditional securities law, even if considered a sale of securities?  Answer: They would not. Ripple – a company partially funded by Santander InnoVentures – offers a glimpse of how traditional banks and financial markets will compete using blockchain technology and ""coins.""  Faura's opinion piece paints all ICOs with the same brush by claiming each one of them actually offers securities subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny. That is simply not the case.  Indeed, does Faura wonder why the SEC has not knocked on Ripple's XRP ""digital asset"" door? Even though there was no formal ICO to launch that arguably centralized token, it now trades on 18 exchanges where individuals can buy the XRP coin. Indeed, after raising nearly $94 million of venture capital, Ripple probably does not need an ICO.  One ICO left untouched by the SEC was ""gate-keeped"" by the law firm of Perkins Coie and involved the sale of a utility token that raised $35 million in under a minute's time. Brave's token creates a digital advertising ecosystem tied to consumer attention – which is why it is dubbed the Basic Attention Token. Such an ecosystem would certainly be an upgrade from the current digital advertising scheme wedded to the web ecosystem of 1995.  Reasonable regulation  All told, it seems that the SEC and other regulatory bodies have actually taken a very measured approach in this area – aggressively focusing on obvious fraudsters first in order to deter subsequent fraudsters, while letting the technology play out a bit in the wild.  Not surprisingly, the plaintiff's bar has been doing a good job picking up the slack in those instances when the SEC has not yet moved. See Davy v. Paragon Coin, Inc., et al., Case No. 18-cv-00671 (N.D. Cal. January 30, 2018) and Paige v. Bitconnect Intern. PLC, et al., Case No. 3:18-CV-58-JHM (W.D. Ky. January 29, 2018).  Recent indicators seem to back this interpretation of the SEC's ICO position.  On February 6, SEC chairman Jay Clayton acknowledged before the Senate Banking Committee that the potential derived from blockchain was ""very significant."" His co-witness, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman Christopher Giancarlo, went so far as to say there was ""enormous potential"" that ""seems extraordinary"" for blockchain-based businesses.  Yet, during his testimony, Chairman Clayton said the SEC would continue to ""crack down hard"" on fraud and manipulation involving ICOs offering an unregistered security. This is consistent with prior messaging given that Chairman Clayton requested on December 11 that the SEC’s Enforcement Division ""vigorously"" enforce and recommend action against ICOs that may be in violation of the federal securities laws.  Chairman Clayton said the SEC was ""working the beat hard"" to crack down on ICOs, but chose not to answer a question posed of him by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, namely whether the SEC will ""go back"" and scrutinize earlier ICOs.  In other words, there may be some ICOs, like the one for BAT, that the SEC will not attack, notwithstanding Clayton's comment in the hearing that ""every ICO I've seen is a security.""  The prospect that some 2017 ICOs raising hundreds of millions of dollars will not be addressed by the SEC provides a clear ""nudge wink"" that not all ICOs come under SEC regulatory control.  As with XRP and BAT, in the future, there will likely be many more tokens built on disruptive blockchain initiatives that escape SEC scrutiny given they are not perceived as securities.  The fact that the SEC has not yet moved on them – despite moving against Munchee, Inc. weeks after the Munchee MUN offering – signals the SEC will temper its enforcement activities when faced with a disruptive blockchain initiative that begets true intrinsic value.  In other words, utility tokens may be a good idea after all.

42380342,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NCWN,1518948005,Doge Is Helping Ethereum Solve Its Biggest Issue,"A cryptocurrency modeled after a dog meme is proving yet again it's not just a joke.  Created on a whim in 2013, dogecoin isn't simply still around, it's playing a crucial role in the ongoing testing of at least one ""serious"" technology. In fact, on February 5, it notably factored into an experiment that successfully showcased one of ethereum's more enterprising projects.  On that date, the much-anticipated technology truebit successfully sent dogecoin to ethereum's Rinkeby testnet, where it became a distinct asset on that blockchain. A historic first, the transaction marked the completion of a years-long project developers see as a stepping stone toward the interoperability of crypto assets more broadly.  Nicknamed the ""dogethereum bridge,"" the test also marks the first real release for truebit, which aims to solve one of ethereum's biggest problems: scalability.  In short, the smart contract platform can't support many users right now. Indeed, because of all the data ethereum needs to store in its globally distributed database, it requires more than three times as much data as bitcoin, and that's making it more difficult for users to run.  Though truebit is lesser-known than scaling solutions like raiden and sharding, the technology is perhaps more ambitious because it's designed to scale any type of ethereum computation, rather than just transactions. This is key, since ethereum bills itself as more than ""just"" a financial cryptocurrency.  In the long run, truebit wants to scale video, machine learning or just about any computation you can think of, and dogethereum is the first use case, so far.  Truebit co-founder Jason Teutsch:  ""We built a first version of that, which we're calling 'truebit lite.' It demonstrates that all the core pieces of truebit work. It's a big milestone for us.""  $1 million on the line  Backing up, the history of dogethereum is an interesting one.  In the heyday of dogecoin (back when its thriving community could pool together $30,000 in donations to fund a bobsled team), Ethereum Foundation UX designer Alex Van de Sande got together with other developers and set a bounty to incentivize someone to come up with a way to move coins from dogecoin to ethereum and back.  The group locked up the funds in a DAO, a kind of application that runs on ethereum, enabling money to be spent only once specific rules are met. In this instance, the funds were set to only be released if five of the DAO leaders vote to do so by signing approval with their ethereum private keys.  Since the price of ethereum ballooned over the years, the smart contract holds ether worth about $1.2 million today. But no one's received the bounty so far, primarily because running dogethereum in an efficient way has proven to be a much more difficult problem to solve than expected, as Van de Sande pointed out in a string of tweets describing the project's origins.  The heart of the issue is it's too computationally expensive to validate a coin going from one chain to another – and back again – costing millions of dollars in ether. In order to solve this problem, it needs to be less expensive to run computations on the ethereum blockchain.  ""This [bounty] kicked off a two- or three-year discussion about how best to implement it,"" said truebit developer Sina Habibian, adding:  ""Dogethereum is representative of a larger problem of how to run big computations.""  And dogethereum is how truebit was born – the seemingly silly bridge sparking Ethereum Foundation developer and truebit co-author Christian Reitwiessner's interest in designing a scalability layer on top of ethereum.  The big test  Truebit developers might be getting close to snatching the dogethereum bounty, though, since some successful tests on the Rinkeby copy of the ethereum blockchain have been executed.  The only other step is doing it live.  Truebit built a dogecoin light client, a smaller version of the blockchain that slashes most of the historical data, embedding it in the doge relay so it can securely move coins from chain to chain.  Yet, Truebit's developers stressed the challenging aspect of what they've accomplished, arguing that the dogethereum bridge is different than decentralized exchange via atomic swaps, an idea that's been gaining ground of late. Rather, it's more like sidechains, a long-stalled bitcoin technology.  ""We want to actually pull coins off of the dogecoin blockchain and put them onto ethereum in the form of ERC-20 tokens,"" Teutsch explained. ""And be able to move them back.""  ""You don't need a counterparty. You're doing this completely on your own,"" Habibian added.  To accomplish this, there has to be some way of locking coins on dogecoin so that they cannot be spent until they are sent back from ethereum. But that's not the most difficult part. What remains computationally expensive is proving that the owner of the dogecoin owns the ether coins on the other side.  They then executed a transaction on the Rinkeby testnet, sending the dogecoin to ethereum – and back again – using truebit under the hood, so the normally expensive proof is executed off-chain, in a much cheaper way.  No estimates  Despite the public debut for the scaling project, though, the team behind truebit still has their work cut out for them.  In this first version of the technology, the incentives are ""greatly simplified,"" Habibian said.  In the technology they have ready today, some of the participants are behaving ""altruistically."" That is, the system's verifiers are performing expensive computations just to be nice.  And while that probably wouldn't work in practice, truebit's goal is to one day create a marketplace where participants are paid for doing computational work on their computers and contributing correct results.  ""People will come out of their own self-interest to run these computations and make money in return,"" Habibian said.  So, when will all that be ready exactly? Habibian wouldn't give an estimate for how long it will take to launch for real on ethereum.  ""It's always hard to make estimates like that because one of the rules of software engineering is, 'However long you think something's going to take, it'll take three times as long,'"" he said.  Still, he revealed truebit plans to release new software programs iterating on this milestone in the coming months now that the startup has teamed up with decentralization startup Aragon and ethereum-based video service LivePeer.  That's how they think the technology will spread at first, beyond dogethereum, marking a big step for truebit – and potentially ethereum too.  As Habibian told CoinDesk:  ""When it's done and it's fully built, you'll be able to run any computation on ethereum.""
