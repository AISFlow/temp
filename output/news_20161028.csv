42378943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUNV,1477680291,Bitcoin and Zcash: How Do They Compare?,"Alex Sunnarborg is the founder of Lawnmower, a blockchain investing and market data platform founded in 2015.  In this opinion piece, Sunnarborg compares bitcoin's attributes with those of the newly launched cryptocurrency Zcash, providing an overview of how he considers the market potential of each .  With the launch of Zcash today (and the speculation surrounding it) you may be wondering how the decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency compares to bitcoin, the original digital currency.  While many structural similarities to Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin design are obvious, Zcash utilizes advanced new cryptographic techniques to offer optional improved privacy and transparency, as well as its own unique blockchain.  But, despite the differences, there is common ground.  Zcash's supply model is extremely similar to bitcoin's, with a fixed and known issuance model that is cut in half approximately every four years. As well, there is a maximum of 21m units of both Zcash (ZEC) and bitcoin (BTC) which will be mined over time.  Given these similarities, it's easy to see why the price and market caps of the two assets are often compared.  Cautious start  Nearly eight years after bitcoin's genesis block was formed, more than 15.75m BTC have already been mined (representing over 75% of the supply that will ever exist on its blockchain).  Zcash's developers are now standing by to launch a similar cryptocurrency, albeit with some key differences.  Small changes to the blockchain and issuance structures mean ZEC will have a 2.5-minute average block time and an initial block reward of 12.5 ZEC.  There will also be a ""slow-start"" period during the first 20,000 blocks (about 34 days) where the block reward linearly increases to 12.5 ZEC. This is designed to reduce the impact of a potential negative event like ""a major bug"" or ""security vulnerability"".  As a result, the first blocks will reward extremely small amounts of ZEC, meaning the overall supply in the ecosystem will be limited as the block reward ramps up.  Despite this, exchanges including Kraken and Poloniex have already announced they will be opening markets as soon as possible following the distribution of the first fractions of coins to miners and the network.  As you can imagine, early exchange order books will likely display many buy orders for large quantities. The only initial sell orders will be small, as those first reduced block rewards are issued.  Parity with bitcoin?  In the days before its launch, derivatives exchange BitMEX already has a form of Zcash market open for traders before the first ZEC has even touched its blockchain.  The futures contract it offers expires in about two months, on 30th December, and is based on the price of ZEC on that date as compared to bitcoin.  The BitMEX price is currently 1.5 BTC, representing the market’s expectation that 1 ZEC will be worth 1.5 BTC on the above date, by which time about 330,000 ZEC will have been mined.  At bitcoin's current price of $685, a ZEC price of 1.5 BTC would imply a market cap of about $350m, which would make it one of the top five digital assets.  Of course, the demand side of the market may be willing to pay a higher price per unit of BTC than ZEC on 30th December, but the psychological impact of the pair reaching parity is undoubtedly noteworthy.  Additional trading has already also occurred in a form entirely different than anything seen in bitcoin's anonymous and decentralized issuance structure.  Rewards structure  Zcash was created by a public team and company (Zcash Electric Coin Company) with a slew of additional high-profile employees, advisors and investors.  As additional incentives beyond equity in the company, many of these team members are also set to receive a portion of future ZEC block rewards in the mining process.  Ten percent (2.1 million) of the 21 million ZEC to ever exist are set to be allocated to groups outside of the miners who successfully place a new block on the ZEC blockchain.  Investors, employees, advisors, founders, the company (""as a ‘strategic reserve’ to fund new projects"") and the non-profit Zcash Foundation (created to ""maintain and improve the Zcash protocol in the interests of all users, present and future"") are all set to receive a specified portion of future block rewards over specified time periods.  The 2.1m ZEC will all be distributed over the first four years, and up until the point where 10.5m ZEC will have been mined, thus representing a distribution of 20% to parties other than miners.  After the first four years, the further 10.5m coins to be mined will be rewarded solely to miners.  Investment and fundraising  Zcash has also announced some additional details on its investors and previous fundraising structures.  Its latest funding round of $2m was raised for 6.25% of the company, implying a valuation of $32m, while its previous round of $1m was raised for 10.15% of the company, implying a valuation of about $10m.  Thus, the early investors paid about $1m for equity in the Zcash Electric Coin Company and 214,000 ZEC over the first year (about $4.66 per ZEC), while the most recent investors paid about $2m for equity and 132,000 ZEC (about $15.15 per ZEC).  Another important concept to keep in mind with Zcash is the thought of the technology also being applied to other projects or protocols.  There are even existing plans and talks around extending some of the functionality behind Zcash to ethereum, and possibly vice versa – bringing smart contract features to Zcash.  Thus, the value of ZEC will obviously be based a multitude of factors, and consideration should be given to comparable and even competitive platforms and assets like BTC, ETH and future projects that can also adopt and iterate on these groundbreaking and open-source developments.

42378917,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mTzb,1477678191,Father of Bitcoin Exchange Operator Pleads Guilty to Obstruction,"A Florida man pled guilty yesterday after being indicted in a case tied to the now-defunct Florida bitcoin exchange Coin.mx.  Michael Murgio, father of Coin.mx operator Anthony Murgio, allegedly took part in a plan to gain control of a New Jersey credit union. That plan, according to prosecutors, involved paying off senior officials at the Hope Federal Credit Union, which has since been shuttered.  The elder Murgio was arrested in April, and this week pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to obstruct an examination of a federal financial institution. He faces as many as five years in prison.  As reported by Reuters, Murgio admitted to writing a letter to credit union regulators in 2014 that contained false information.  Coin.mx was shuttered last summer after its operators were charged with unlawful money transmission and money laundering. Federal prosecutors have tied the Coin.mx exchange to a wider plot to hack financial institutions two years ago, including JPMorgan. Those running the exchange were accused of acting as a financial conduit for a global cybercrime network – an allegation the defendants have denied.  Michael Murgio previously served as a county school board member in Palm Beach, Florida, a position from which he resigned after he was indicted earlier this year, according to The Palm Beach Post.  Others tied to the alleged credit union capture continue to face trial.  Pastor Trevón Gross, who at the time as chairman of the credit union, was indicted in March for allegedly taking the bribes, though he has denied the charge. Another defendant, Yuri Lebedev, was accused of taking part in the alleged scheme but has also plead not guilty.  Anthony Murgio has denied the allegations against him, and is expected to face trial early next year. He plead not guilty last November.

42378936,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUJj,1477671888,The Zcash Blockchain is Now Live,"Zcash has officially gone live.  The first transaction block of the privacy-focused blockchain has been created, a development that follows months of enthusiasm as well as growing momentum from market speculators.  Since it was proposed in May 2014, developers and backers have pitched Zcash as a financial tool designed to prioritize transaction privacy, one that could also solve for issues like fungibility that still affect bitcoin. Yet the project has had its detractors, including those who question the startup's business model and how it derives funding, in part, from the network itself.  In a livestream that ended just minutes ago, Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox announced that the software was finally ready to download, declaring that he had successfully compiled his full node.  He told viewers:  ""If you load Zcash, we have the blog post and the place to download the software and everything, as of now. Go.""  Notably, the development team released two audits conducted by NCC Group and Coinspect, respectively, ahead of the launch.  The reports sought to identify potentially harmful bugs in the cryptocurrency's code prior to launch. (The audits can be found here and here).  ""Today we are publishing the final reports of each external security auditor we contracted this summer to review our code,"" the startup said in a blog post from yesterday. ""We've triaged the issues found and addressed any we considered severe.""  Amidst the launch, derivatives trading tied to Zcash saw prices soar above 1 BTC, recording a high of nearly 2 BTC according to data from BitMEXhttps://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/ZECZ16.  If any indication, the digital currency markets may be in for more movement and volatility ahead.

42378923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU4d,1477661844,US Bank Regulator Charts Path for Blockchain Startup Oversight,"A US banking regulator has unveiled a broad innovation policy aimed at regulating startups working with blockchain and other fintech.  On 26th October, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) released its “responsible innovation framework”, a policy outline that the agency has been working on since earlier this year. In March, the OCC released a white paper setting out its objectives.  The agency will establish an “Office of Innovation”, headquartered in Washington, DC, that will spearhead policy development and outreach as it relates to fintech.  The head of that office, who will be appointed as the chief innovation officer for the OCC, will report directly to Comptroller Thomas Curry. The OCC said it will also expand internal training programs to educate staff on technologies like blockchain.  In its report, the agency sought to highlight the rapidly evolving face of finance, noting:  “Today, fintechs engage in the traditional banking functions of consumer lending, payments, wealth management, and settlements. Fintechs also are leveraging new technologies and processes, such as cloud computing, application programming interfaces, distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics.”  The OCC has sought to present an active voice amidst the shifting regulatory landscape for the technology in the US, calling last year for a “balanced” approach to bitcoin regulation. At the same time, the OCC included the tech in a banking risk assessment released in July.  The framework launch, however, is only the start of what could be a more significant – and contentious – process.  Earlier this year, the OCC began looking at the question of whether to create a special kind of federal charter for fintechs. As of this week, that process is still ongoing.  “The OCC’s assessment of granting a special purpose national bank charter to nonbank financial technology companies, and under what conditions, continues,” the agency said. “The OCC has made no determination regarding chartering of these firms.”  Image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/28/us-bank-regulator-charts-path-for-blockchain-startup-oversight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8721c2572f84905adf6631bda12c867c69c2b51-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378931,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUCB,1477657591,"With Zcash Launch, Blockchain Enters the Age of Anonymity","A cryptocurrency with the promise to bring a new kind of anonymous digital transaction is expected to launch today.  With the mining of the first block of code, a new immutable ledger of transactions, known as a blockchain, will enter an already thriving market, one that boasts notable entries including bitcoin and ethereum.  But the Zcash blockchain differs from bitcoin, the first public blockchain, in two key ways. First, the transactions clear in a fraction of the time. Second, and arguably more important, Zcash is based on an internally developed cryptographic tool called a zk-SNARK that doesn't require that the parties involved in a transaction exchange information.  Though the Zcash team tends to shy away from describing the functionality as anonymous, for most purposes, that's exactly what the technology offers.  And while the Zcash cryptocurrency (ZEC) is mined by a community of users on a public blockchain (a common criticism against bitcoin), this increased control over who can see the transactions holds the potential to attract a whole new set of users and businesses that like the idea of fast, cheap transactions, but not the audit trail that any data miner can track down.  In spite of the obvious appeal such privacy would offer to those in dark markets, Zcash's co-founder and CEO, Zooko Wilcox, says that for the digital currency to really take off, the whole gamut of people and companies that that stand to benefit need to get involved.  Wilcox told CoinDesk:  ""I'm very greedy about where Zcash should go, into how many niches it should be pushed because the benefit is directly related to how many people use it. The diversity of users, and languages, and cultures not only makes it stronger and more resilient, it also makes it more and more valuable.""  It takes a village  With a proof-of-work algorithm that depends on how much RAM processing the miner owns, Zcash launched into beta earlier this year and quickly developed a small but passionate ecosystem of developers.  An open-source challenge hosted by the company resulted in multiple submissions for new ways to mine the currency. Then, earlier this month Genesis Mining announced its miners would integrate with the cryptocurrency.  At the time of launch, multiple exchanges and wallets are rumored to already be working on product integration. Digital currency wallet Jaxx told CoinDesk it will launch its own Zcash service ""a few days after the launch"", and digital currency exchange Shapeshift said it will support ZEC ""as soon as we have the liquidity available.""  While there is also a healthy futures market developing, Zooko said he would prefer Zcash be used in ""real financial exchange, not speculative applications.""  The bottom line  Though Zcash is a for-profit company, it does not currently have a sales team.  Instead, Zooko said he personally leads an informal outreach effort that relies heavily on the open-source community and the Zcash integration guide to help build products.  At least one firm is interested in selling ""professional services to extend the Zcash technology"", Wilcox told CoinDesk. Further, Zcash itself is currently in the early phases of exploring selling similar services to enterprises interested in transaction privacy for their customers, he said.  ""Clearly there’s a lot of value here,"" said Alan Fairless, an early investor in Zcash and the co-founder and CEO of Spideroak, a zero-knowledge security firm. ""But, I expect the market will have to experiment to find the ideal business use cases.""  Fairless said the reason he invested in Zcash is because he believes the cryptocurrency is part of a bigger-picture change that will find consumers and companies placing a premium on not having to hold expensive customer data.  Data breaches as a result of losing that information cost an average of $4m per hack according to an IBM report earlier this year.  ""For most businesses the most valuable things they hold is payment information,"" said Fairless. ""And this provides a workaround.""  Piggy-backing bitcoin  While Zcash's proof-of-work and privacy functionality is significantly different from bitcoin's, at its core, the cryptocurrency still has a lot of the same DNA.  This design choice was no accident either, according to Zcash technical advisor, Arthur Breitman, who is also the co-founder of distributed consensus platform, Tezos.  Breitman has been an advisor to Zcash from its early days and tells CoinDesk that the decision to build on a fork of bitcoin was about more than leveraging the blockchain's proven security.  ""Zcash was designed on purpose to be as similar as possible to bitcoin,"" he said, in statements that showcase the impact bitcoin continues to have on the wider blockchain industry.  Breitman added:  ""The reason is to make it easier if you have coding knowledge for bitcoin then you can easily use Zcash.""  The skeptic's ceremony  While changes to the code underwent multiple audits, Zcash is not without controversy. In fact, one of the cryptocurrency's most public detractors has been bitcoin core developer, Peter Todd.  In coversation with CoinDesk, Todd called into question everything from Zcash's business model (which puts a large chunk of the early mined coins in the hands of the developers) to the decision to introduce new code to the bitcoin codebase.  As part of a ""ceremony"" earlier this month, Zcash hired Todd and five others to help create the code that would eventually form the foundation of Genesis Block. Even more complex, the firm developed a special protocol that required multiple participants in separate geographic locations cooperatively construct the public key needed to launch the chain.  Though Todd says he would ""be surprised"" if anyone attacked the launch ceremony, he warns that possible future improvements to the blockchain requiring a hard fork would require another ceremony.  ""If you try to do this with a live system, you'll want to be very very careful,"" he said.  Glass half-full  Amid listing his other concerns about the strength of Zcash’s security, Todd conceded one use case he was interested in.  Todd places Zcash in a category with Monero, which he says is useful to purchase different currencies as a way to disguise one's transactions.  ""It’s only if you want to hold Zcash that any of this even matters,"" he said.  As for Zooko, he waxed poetic about what the official launch of the currency means to everyone — including skeptics — who helped make it a reality.  Zooko concluded:  ""The genesis block is kind of beautiful. It’s almost a collective simultaneous expression of a whole bunch of people uniting together and agreeing that they are are all going to use this as a common point of reference.""

42378928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUAv,1477654944,Swiss Railway Service to Sell Bitcoin,"UPDATE (28th October 17:55 BST): This article has been updated with comment from SBB      SBB quietly unveiled the service on its websitehttps://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/services/further-services/bitcoin.html, set to begin on 11th November. Customers, who need to have a QR-code enabled bitcoin wallet and a valid Swiss mobile phone number, will be able to buy between CHF 20 and CHF 500 (up to roughly $500).  Representatives for SBB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But according to Swiss business newspaper Der Bund, SBB representatives confirmed the service, saying that it is working with a local payments startup called Sweepay.  SBB later said in a statement:  ""Until now, there have only been limited opportunities to purchase bitcoin in Switzerland. With over 1,000 ticket machines, SBB has a dense distribution network that is available round the clock and is not only suitable for purchasing tickets, but also allows additional services to be obtained.""  The railway operator further said that it plans to test demand for bitcoin sales over a two-year period.  There will be limits to the service, according to the report. SBB won’t accept bitcoin payments for tickets, for example, and there will reportedly be a CHF 5000 annual cap on purchases, which isn’t listed on the website. SBB will also reportedly charge a 6% transaction fee at the time of purchase.  The SBB trial perhaps reflects the cultural experiment taking place in some parts of Switzerland. In May, the city of Zug, Switzerland announced that it would accept bitcoin payments for public services.  Financial firms in the country have also moved to test applications of blockchain, and last month, the chief of the Swiss central bank said that the system has been “turned on its head” by the technology.
