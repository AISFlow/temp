42410619,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftoE,1684969260,Bitpanda Partners With Coinbase to Help Europe’s Banks Offer Crypto to Customers,"Austrian-based crypto exchange and trading platform Bitpanda is teaming with Coinbase (COIN) to connect the U.S.-listed exchange giant with banks in Europe who are looking to offer digital assets to their customers.  The just-announced partnership allows Coinbase to use Bitpanda Technology Solutions – a business-to-business infrastructure layer provider – to connect directly into banks and fintechs.  Despite the bearish crypto winter and the damage done to the reputation of the asset class from last year’s blowups and failures, banks want to be able to offer crypto to customers, according to BitPanda COO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad. This is especially true in Europe now that the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework has been adopted, he added.  “Coinbase has a liquidity venue with their exchange and they have the custody setup,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad said in an interview with CoinDesk. “But they don’t have the whole infrastructure middle layer that a partner can integrate and offer crypto traded and bought on Coinbase exchange and stored on Coinbase Custody to their end customers.”  Bitpanda’s crypto connectivity is already in place with a number of banks, neo-banks and fintech platforms such as Austrian traditional lender Raiffeisenlandesbank, European mobile bank N26, French money app Lydia, U.K. fintech Plum and the Italian mobile bank Hype.  “Banks can see the data on their payment transactions and how much of their customers’ funds have been flowing out to crypto companies,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad said. “They understand how much business they are missing out on, and also how much more of their customer base would do that business, if they had enough trust in the process.”  ""[Coinbase is] delighted to partner with Bitpanda to jointly service institutions looking to bring the market and their customers compliant, robust crypto services,"" said Guillaume Chatain, Coinbase’s head of Institutional Sales for EMEA & APAC regions, in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/24/bitpanda-partners-with-coinbase-to-help-europes-banks-offer-customers-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d31087719ea61c734a8480fe0b22b81ce04e124-5617x3745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12899317,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534891,1684969229,"Bitcoin Just Got Invaded By A “Big, Unknown Miner,” What’s Happening?","Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency network whose coin, BTC, is the most valuable, seems to have been invaded by an unknown miner. And the community has the new guest on their radar. Unknown Miner Dominates In the last few hours, the entity has not only plugged into the network but has proceeded to mine several blocks, getting rewarded with the precious 6.25 BTC. What’s intriguing is that trackers cannot pick out the true identity of the miner who has usurped the established pools such as Binance Pool, AntPool, and even giant mining farms like Foundry USA. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH For the last day, the miner has verified over 10 Bitcoin blocks, earning over 65 BTC worth over $1.7 million at spot rates. While there is a chance that a “big” player is new to Bitcoin and has plugged in possibly thousands of mining rigs to stay competitive and verify blocks successfully, it is almost likely that the “unknown” entity is a mining pool. In proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, a group of miners, that is, retail individuals operating mining nodes, can join hands and merge their computing power called hash rate in “pools.” Whenever they do this, they stand a chance of verifying a block of BTC transactions. In return, the network automatically rewards them with not only the block rewards of 6.25 BTC but also fees associated with the block. Although rare, fees accumulated in a block may be over 50% of the block reward distributed from the protocol level. With the Bitcoin hash rate constantly rising and more miners pouring in, mining pools dominate. However, several pools are tailored to meet the needs of various miners. Applicable fees, reliability, and the size of their hash rate are some considerations that may also affect reputation. However, over the years, some of the biggest include AntPool and ViaBTC. Is This F2Pool? It is speculated that the “unknown” entity is F2Pool. The error is displayed on trackers because “Mempool’s attribution logic is just missing them.” Whether this will also turn out to be true or false will later be verified. This is because attribution “depends on who the miner says they are. It’d be easy to impersonate another pool and not guaranteed that that pool would notice and deny it was them”. Related Reading: Crypto Market Alert: Tether Market Cap Fuel Hopes For Major Rally F2Pool is one of the oldest and largest mining pools in the world. According to data from mempool.space, the pool controls 8.19% of the total Bitcoin hash rate. While it is popular, recent data shows there could have been a hitch in the attribution logic. Trackers show that the last time F2Pool mined was in late May 24.

42410620,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftrX,1684966001,"Stablecoin Market Shrinks for 14th Straight Month, Posing Potential Headwinds for Crypto Prices","The stablecoin market is on track to shrink for the 14th consecutive month, a sign of capital draining from the digital asset space, and a troubling trend for the recovery of cryptocurrency prices.  The total market capitalization of stablecoins dropped to $130 billion in May, falling to the lowest level since September 2021, digital asset data firm CCData noted Tuesday in a market report. The stablecoin market has been in a continuous decline since March 2022, per CCData.  Stablecoins are a subset of cryptocurrencies that peg their price to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. They are key plumbing for the digital asset universe, playing a vital role in facilitating cryptocurrency trading and bridging government-issued fiat currencies with blockchain-based markets.  Analysts argue that the contraction of the stablecoin market poses headwinds for cryptocurrency prices, as it signals deteriorating liquidity.  “Stablecoins are the liquidity of the crypto ecosystem. The more liquidity, the more ability for investment and speculation,” Tom Dunleavy, macro analyst said in a note to CoinDesk. “The continued reduction, despite the growing number of applications, says to me we are still not out of the woods for this secular bear market.”  Banking giant JPMorgan wrote last week in a report that cryptocurrency prices are unlikely to enjoy a sustained recovery until the stablecoin market stops shrinking. A report from global investment bank Goldman Sachs said earlier this year that the stablecoin shrinkage is equivalent to a sort of quantitative tightening for the crypto market, an indication of declining liquidity and leverage.  Trading with stablecoins also plummeted 40.6% this month to $460 billion in volume on centralized exchanges, according to the CCData report. This is the lowest monthly volume since December 2022.  “The drop in trading volume comes with major crypto assets staying range-bound and failing to break key support and resistance levels,” the report said.  TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin has defied the market-wide slump, with its trading volume increasing to $29 billion so far this month, per CCData. TUSD has overtaken USDC and BUSD, two struggling competitors, making it the second most traded stablecoin on centralized exchanges for the first time.  TUSD resurgence stems from Binance, the world’s dominant crypto exchange by trading volume, promoting the token’s use on the platform by waiving trading fees for buying and selling bitcoin (BTC) with it.",NEGATIVE,BTC | TUSD,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/stablecoin-market-shrinks-for-14th-straight-month-posing-potential-headwinds-for-crypto-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dc924d0f7f6ef0f6ddf97b95664779c9b0c0a19-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12898361,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534871,1684965651,"Ethereum Encounters Resistance At Critical Level, Vital Trading Levels to Monitor","Ethereum started the week with a promising performance, experiencing a gain of over 3%. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived as the altcoin failed to sustain its position above a key resistance level. Within the past 24 hours, ETH’s market value has declined by nearly 3%. Throughout the week, the ETH price has shown limited progress, with the bears dominating the price movement. The altcoin’s technical outlook indicates a decline in buying strength, accompanied by low demand and accumulation on the daily chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH To prevent further strengthening of the bears, it is crucial for Ethereum to surpass its immediate resistance in the upcoming trading sessions. Failure to do so may lead to additional pressure from sellers, potentially causing Ethereum to breach its immediate support level and experience a significant loss in value during future trading sessions. Additionally, the fall in the ETH market capitalization suggests an increase in selling strength, as observed on the daily chart. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the trading price of ETH was $1790. Despite attempting to trade within the $1800 price range, the altcoin encountered selling pressure, resulting in its depreciation. The current overhead resistance for Ethereum is $1810. If the altcoin surpasses this resistance level, it has the potential to trigger a rally in its price. On the other hand, if the present price level experiences a decline, Ethereum is likely to decline further to $1750 before eventually reaching the $1700 price mark. The recent session saw a decrease in the volume of Ethereum traded, indicated by the red colour, indicating a weak buying strength. Technical Analysis Throughout this month, Ethereum experienced a decline in demand, resulting in reduced buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below the midpoint line, suggesting a decrease in demand and an increase in selling pressure on the chart. Additionally, the price of Ethereum fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that sellers were dominating the market’s price momentum. Given that Bitcoin’s price movement remains uncertain, several altcoins, including Ethereum, have followed a similar price trajectory. However, if Ethereum gains broader market strength, there is a possibility that demand could return, causing ETH to surpass the 20-SMA line and potentially climb higher. Due to the absence of demand, ETH did not exhibit significant buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a tool used to indicate price momentum and potential trend reversals, showed small green histograms that do not provide conclusive buy signals at this point. The Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and potential fluctuations, have maintained a parallel shape. However, they displayed slight convergence, suggesting that ETH may trade within a relatively stable range without substantial price fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitfinex And Crypto Bank OrionX Forged Partnership To Broaden Presence In Latin America To reclaim the $1800 price level, it is crucial for buyers to re-enter the market at the current price level.

42410624,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfu4l,1684963696,Excavating the Truth Around the Bitcoin Mining Discourse,"Last year, a group of CoinDesk reporters traveled to Seneca Lake to examine the effect Greenidge Generation – a resurrected power plant that now mines bitcoin – had on the surrounding communities. Though we expected to hear locals say they disliked the plant and its continued operation, we found the opposite.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Misinformation snowball  The narrative  Bitcoin mining is proving increasingly controversial, partly due to the sheer energy needs and partly because the crypto community hasn’t yet convinced its critics that there is value to this whole thing.  Why it matters  Much of the debate around crypto mining lacks nuance or context.  These debates are having an impact on policy, and the lack of accurate information about these datacenters is directly affecting people who live near them. We’re seeing every facet of this debate get based on an alternative reality, what my colleague Cheyenne Ligon described as a “misinformation snowball.” Today’s article is an effort to tamp that down, at least as this issue pertains to Greenidge Generation, a facility operating on the shore of Seneca Lake, New York.  Breaking it down  Last summer, CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon, Doreen Wang and Nolen Hayes and I drove to Dresden, N.Y. to visit the controversial Greenidge Generation mining facility. My expectation was we’d find a power plant that infuriated its neighbors, sparked algal blooms in nearby Seneca Lake and adversely affected the broader community.  Greenidge, after all, was the source of many headlines, ranging from reports about how it was boiling the waterways to introducing fresh pollution to the delicate environments nearby.  What we found was something entirely different, refuting my prior expectations and demonstrating that the situation was far more complex and nuanced than expected – and possibly unique among the broader crypto mining conversation in the U.S.  CoinDesk’s report, which we published earlier today, can be found here. I wanted to also offer a first-person perspective on how we reported this story and what we learned.  One important disclaimer: This report solely focuses on the experiences of one community in a unique environment. Other mining facilities tap into existing energy grids or build their own warehouses, and those communities will have their own experiences. In other words, our report today focuses on Greenidge Generation and its surrounding communities. It cannot be compared to Riot Platforms in Rockdale, Texas or rogue mining operations in Chelan County, Washington or even Coinmint in nearby Plattsburgh, N.Y.  We make this same point in the article itself because it’s worth making. The article isn’t a defense of bitcoin mining or the philosophical question of whether bitcoin is worth the energy costs. Our goal is to show how a conversation that doesn’t include the people most directly impacted can lead to wonky outcomes.  One of the most stunning claims we uncovered in reporting this article was that no one – none of the critics or lawmakers passing legislation due to Greenidge, nor any of the bitcoiners defending the industry – had reached out to the towns near the facility. William Hall, the mayor of Dresden, N.Y., told us “nobody has ever come to talk to us about” Greenidge. We checked again prior to publication – we’re still the only ones to have visited.  Between this and the cascading series of failures and bankruptcies that shook the crypto market over the last few months, we weren’t able to approach this article with the attention it deserved.  Then, earlier this year, we saw Congressional hearings at the state and federal level addressing crypto mining – and at least one of the witnesses made claims that were clearly inaccurate.  That led to today’s article, spearheaded by Cheyenne. The debate around crypto mining is clearly driving policy, and so it’s worth continuing to shed light on the reality on the ground.  On a personal note, this report marks the last major pieces published by Cheyenne and Doreen, both of whom have been a pleasure to work with and who will be missed. I’ll just say I’d like to thank them for their contributions and wish them well on their future journeys.

12897758,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534875,1684963215,The Bitcoin Rollercoaster: Why Every Upward Move Is Followed By A Steep Drop?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to hold onto gains over the past few weeks, giving back nearly all price increases shortly after they are made. According to crypto analyst and trader Daan Foppen, this phenomenon can be attributed to the outsized influence of futures markets on Bitcoin’s price action. Foppen notes that Bitcoin’s spot market, where investors buy and sell actual BTC, has been mainly selling recently, as evidenced by the downtrend in spot market prices. In contrast, moves upward in Bitcoin’s price have been driven primarily by activity in futures markets, where traders speculate on the future price of BTC using leverage. Related Reading: Crypto Market Alert: Tether Market Cap Fuel Hopes For Major Rally Bitcoin’s Downward Spiral Continues “The moves that are made are mostly made with borrowed money, and these kinds of things are not sustainable for a market,” says Foppen. Whether stablecoin-margined or coin-margined, futures markets have been the driving force behind short-term price impulses in Bitcoin recently. However, the buying power used to move prices upward ultimately evaporates, leading to gains to be given back. When futures dominate trading, the underlying spot market struggles to keep up. Price gains outpace actual buy demand for Bitcoin, leaving the market susceptible to abrupt reversals once futures buying power subsidies. This concept has been displayed clearly on Bitcoin price charts over the past month, with initial price spikes evaporating quickly. Furthermore, according to Daan Foppen, recent volatility and price reversals in Bitcoin have been driven largely by leveraged trading and liquidations in futures markets. Foppen argues that the cryptocurrency’s price action over the past several weeks has been characterized by “impulsive moves” upward and downward that seem forceful but lack strength and sustainability. For example, Bitcoin’s move to $27,400 on May 23 was mainly fueled by short liquidations, as overleveraged short positions were wiped out, creating a “snowball effect” upward. The subsequent sharp drop was similarly driven by the liquidation of long positions that had opened during the consolidation period with the expectation of higher prices. BTC’s Increased Leveraged Positions Moreover, Foppen points out that interest in Bitcoin futures has risen, indicating increased leveraged trading activity. However, it is difficult to determine whether new positions are predominantly short or long. Funding rates, which indicate whether longs or shorts are paying interest to balance the market, have been slightly positive recently but remain around the baseline. Still, Foppen believes the ingredients are in place for “a deeper flush downwards” in Bitcoin’s price due to the likelihood that recently opened positions are mainly longs. “What you shouldn’t do now is blindly click the short button,” he warns. With highly leveraged and unstable dynamics currently driving Bitcoin’s price action, Foppen cautions that these are “very shaky conditions,” protecting one’s capital should be the top priority for traders. “What you should especially not do is let yourself get chopped up in this market,” he says.

42410614,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftXh,1684962851,"Bitcoin’s Doldrums Below $26.5K Endure as Investors Weigh Debt Ceiling Stalemate, Latest FOMC Minutes","After two weeks of flatlining, crypto markets finally endured a little change of pace as investors spooked by UK inflation and the latest Janet Yellen warning about the U.S. debt ceiling stalemate sent prices reeling on Wednesday.  The release of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes later in the day showing U.S. central bankers divided on a continuation of interest rate hikes did little to boost market confidence.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $26,440, off roughly 3% over the past 24 hours and near its lowest level since May 12 when the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped below $26,000. In this period, BTC has been slogging through low trading volume and volatility as markets wrestle with the prospect of a U.S. government unable to pay its debts and ongoing crypto regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainties. Until Wednesday, bitcoin had remained in a $26,500 to $27,500 range.  In an email to CoinDesk, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at fintech platform YouHodler, wrote that “increased tension in financial markets” had buffeted equities and digital assets.  “US stock indexes are under selling pressure by raised concerns about a possible default of the US: With just about 10 days left for authorities to reach some agreement, we have not yet seen any progress in these negotiations,” Lienkha wrote. “All this uncertainty forces financial institutions to restructure assets and prepare for a possible default, which puts additional pressure on participants in financial markets.”  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,808, off approximately 2.6% from Tuesday, same time. Most major cryptos spent Wednesday firmly in the red with LTC and SOL, the token of the Solana smart contracts platform tumbling more than 5.2% and 3.6%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, fell 2.8%. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator remained in downtrend territory, where it recently dropped – a reflection of the falling investor optimism. A number of analysts believe that bitcoin will remain stuck until a new catalyst emerges.  Major stock indexes struggled similarly on Wednesday, restoring at least temporarily the correlation between equity and crypto pricing with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all dropping the better part of a percentage point. The two asset classes have been traveling increasingly different paths in recent months but Yellen’s third caution this month that the U.S. could “run out of money” without a debt limit agreement seemed to sweep up all assets.  Earlier Wednesday, cryptos plunged after the U.K.’s latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 6.8% in April, above the expected 6.2% and its highest point since 1992. The disappointing CPI suggested that England’s central bank would have to continue its recent diet of interest rate hikes, which have generally discouraged crypto markets.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV Wednesday, Glen Goodman, author of “The Crypto Trader,” noted that bitcoin had recently maintained more of a connection to the price of gold, a traditional safe haven asset. But he added that BTC still lacked some consistent motivation to account for investor decisions about buying and selling.  “We still haven't found a reason why everybody needs to have a goal rather we have found a number of reasons,” Goodman said. “The only problem is people haven’t coalesced on one main narrative. We’re waiting for events, for some kind of disaster to befall the world economy, such as the dollar collapsing. And then, of course, everybody would coalesce around one narrative.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/bitcoins-doldrums-below-265k-endure-as-investors-weigh-debt-ceiling-latest-fomc-minutes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0befbe86950ae385315c967a3363b584900d5cb8-1698x1072.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the horizontal support line is clearly important, it’s nowhere near as critical as another line that BTCUSD absolutely must hold to remain bullish. Drawing Trend Lines In Bitcoin Technical Analysis In the practice of technical analysis, drawing trend lines is among the first basic steps anyone will take. Simply connect the line across various points on the chart to highlight support and resistancesupport and resistance. Another basic step involves turning on technical indicators to look for potential buy and sell signals. Some of these tools call out when an asset is overbought or oversold, such as the Relative Strength Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Double Fractal Points To “Extended” Parabolic Rally More advanced techniques include drawing trend lines on indicators like the RSI instead of price. Much like drawing these lines from point to point diagonally can plot uptrends or downtrends, horizontal lines can also act as support or resistance on the RSI. On the weekly timeframe Bitcoin price has pulled back to a reading of 53 on the RSI. This level must hold, according to past price history. Each time it has, the crypto market has erupted higher. Holding the line is imperative | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bulls Must Show “Strength” At Current Levels The above BTCUSD weekly chart shows the RSI pulling back to a reading of 53. The last time this happened, was in Q3 2020 right before an epic bull run. The short bullish rally in 2019 blasted right through it without a retest of the level. Prior to these instances, all other outcomes were shockingly bullish when Bitcoin held above the line. Rather than falling into a bearish phase, each time BTCUSD weekly RSI held at the line in 2016 and 2017, the crypto market simply marched higher. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Indicator Turned $5 Into $34,000 Other times, when BTCUSD failed to hold this line, a bear market ensued. A failed attempt to get back above the level typically led to the last leg of the bear market. However, getting back above it and then failing to hold could provide the crypto market with something more reminiscent of the COVID collapse and is something to watch closely for. Hold the line, and bulls will run again, possibly to new all-time highs. https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1661464701853745152 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

12896568,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534866,1684958699,Crypto Market Alert: Tether Market Cap Fuel Hopes For Major Rally,"Despite lackluster trade volume and price movements in the cryptocurrency market, Tether’s market cap is rising, nearing its all-time high of $82.9 billion. Tether, also known as USDT, is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, making its value more stable than other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon? USDT’s Explosive Growth The question remains: why is Tether’s market cap increasing despite the lack of strong movements in the cryptocurrency market? According to the research firm Kaiko, one theory is that the imminent end of BUSD, another stablecoin, and Circle’s USDC March de-pegging event caused traders to rotate into USDT. However, data does not show a significant increase in USDT market share relative to other stablecoins in recent months. Another possible reason for Tether’s market cap increase is Binance’s promotion of TUSD as an alternative to BUSD. This move may have caused traders to move away from BUSD and towards other stablecoins, including USDT. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs), USDT accounts for just 20% of non-stablecoin swap volume, an increase since the start of the year, but not enough to explain the more than $15 billion increase in market cap over the same period. While the March banking crisis saw a large rotation of capital into USDT, the actual usage of the stablecoin on both centralized and decentralized exchanges suggests that the increase in market cap is “inordinate”, according to Kaiko. Furthermore, one possible explanation for Tether’s climbing market cap could involve the Tron network. Most of all, USDT, or $46 billion worth, are issued on Tron, compared to just $36 billion on Ethereum. Despite Tron’s minimal decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and the lack of support from major exchanges like Coinbase, offshore exchanges such as Binance and OKX possess the largest USDT balances on Tron. This suggests that market makers and whales prefer Tron for its low transaction fees. In contrast to Tether’s market cap, USDC’s market cap correlates with trade volume. As USDC volume grows, the market cap increases similarly, and vice versa. USDT’s market cap, however, has little correlation with trade volume, which is questionable given that the primary use case for this stablecoin is trading. Large Tether Movements Raise Questions About Market Stability According to Whale Alert on Twitter, there have been several large movements of Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, in the cryptocurrency market in the past three hours. These movements suggest a significant transfer of funds, with implications for the broader market. First, an unknown wallet transferred 50 million USDT, or $50 million, to Bitfinex, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. This was followed by Kraken, another leading exchange, transferring 60 million USDT, or $60 million, to Bitfinex. Lastly, Tether Treasury, the issuer of USDT, transferred 60 million USDT to Bitfinex. Additionally, 50 million USDT was transferred from JustLendDAO to an unknown wallet. The movements of these large sums of money suggest that significant trading or investment activity may occur on Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. These transfers may be related to a large purchase of cryptocurrency or a significant investment by a hedge fund or institutional investor. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH Overall, the implications of these movements for the broader cryptocurrency market remain uncertain. However, given the size of the Tether transfers, it is possible that they could impact the market’s overall stability and could lead to a surge or decline in cryptocurrency prices.

42410608,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftDr,1684958002,Crypto Execs Give Washington Influence Another Go With FTX Anchor Around Necks,"When Washington, D.C., lawmakers tune into their favorite Sunday morning political shows this week, they’ll also get a dose of crypto messaging, thanks to a Coinbase (COIN) campaign that’s part of the next stage in the industry’s attempt to influence U.S. policy.  But the efforts from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and a push from Messari CEO Ryan Selkis to build a well-funded movement to steer future crypto rules will land in a U.S. capital still trying to swallow the disasters the fledgling industry provided in the last couple of years.  In 2022, the narrative crypto lobbyists hoped to present to U.S. lawmakers plunged into chaos. The sector’s rampant business failures, frauds, hacking and consumer harms were a big part of that. But the members of Congress who will be responsible for any new crypto laws were also showered with campaign donations – with one in three current members receiving FTX executives’ money – and many of them have had to answer embarrassing questions and struggled to return tainted cash from the company.  As crypto lobbyists rebuild congressional relationships and prepare for a presidential election year, they’ve got a stiff challenge: “Paint a bright picture of the future and try to downplay the negative news events of the last year without pretending that they didn’t happen,” said Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, which analyzes policy developments in Washington.  A spokesperson for Coinbase didn't answer when asked whether the company is considering the troubles of the recent past as it pushes its new campaign. “Coinbase is working closely with policymakers and regulators to get crypto regulation right – and ensure they understand the risks of getting it wrong,"" the spokesperson said instead.  Armstrong’s face will appear in black-and-white TV commercial spots in Washington-area broadcasts, advising viewers that “Crypto is the most important technology we have to update the financial system globally.” They’ll carry the campaign’s tagline, “It's time to update the system.”  Coinbase – linking this campaign with a previous initiative called Crypto435 to directly influence lawmakers in all 435 congressional districts – has also given a bespoke paint job to an armored truck. The vehicle – the kind used to shepherd hard currency to and from banks and businesses – will drive around Wall Street emblazoned with the words: “With Crypto, This Whole Thing Fits in Your Pocket."" And the company intends to otherwise paper the traditional New York center of finance with crypto messaging.  The ad campaign is reminiscent of previous efforts by crypto exchange Gemini, which plastered taxis and train stations with ""The Revolution Needs Rules"" banners, and Grayscale, which sought to encourage an approval of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust product to an exchange-traded fund.  Meanwhile, the well known crypto entrepreneur and investor Selkis is expected to throw open the doors to an organization called the Digital Freedom Alliance as soon as next month, according to a person familiar with the situation. Selkis first pitched the idea for a more decentralized group to support crypto policy last year, and had taken to Twitter to encourage an effort he suggested will come from individuals and small firms.  He tried to light a fuse with a letter to the top lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee that's been working on crypto legislation, urging them to act quickly. He also forwarded that same note to other crypto-relevant members of Congress.  ""Avoidance is no longer an option,"" Selkis wrote in the letter he’d also posted on Twitter, though the posts have since been removed from his page. ""Digital assets technology will not be uninvented. It has become too established, and offers too much economic promise.""  He called his letter “a first step, but there is much more to do in the upcoming battles.”  In recent crypto hearings on Capitol Hill, the industry that has long prided itself for standing apart from partisan politics was the subject of clear partisan divisions. Republican lawmakers have been much more likely to defend digital assets businesses, while many Democrats have been aligning themselves with crypto-skeptical chiefs of the U.S. financial agencies. That said, there is still some aisle-crossing on the current legislative efforts.  “Some lawmakers will continue to defend the industry, but a lot don’t trust it,” Katz said. “And the industry’s ability to influence policy has diminished, especially with current regulators and Democrats.”  Barron’s reported that Selkis is aiming to build a political-action committee to influence crypto legislation, hoping to raise tens of millions of dollars.  Flooding Congress with crypto contributions was also – generally – the playbook followed by Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced ex-CEO of FTX. But it’s tough to measure the success of that widespread campaign largesse, because FTX blew up before Congress started this year’s session. And now Bankman-Fried’s donations are the subject of federal criminal prosecution for allegedly violating campaign-finance laws. That’s the climate Selkis’ effort would be stepping into.  “Repairing whatever damage occurred over the past year is going to happen through the process of better engagement and establishing better understanding with lawmakers that are working on these issues,” said Brett Quick, head of government affairs at the Crypto Council for Innovation. “It’s a longer endeavor to try to repair any trust that was lost.”  She said there’s “broad recognition” in Washington that the FTX collapse was a classic fraud that wasn’t about the technology, and industry representatives are still walking across the broken glass to explain their agenda in the meantime. The crisis even further underlined the need for a “cop on the beat” that crypto businesses have been asking for, she said.  While that day-to-day lobbying work happens, though, millions of U.S. crypto users are eager to make sure Congress is hearing their view that “we want to keep it here and we want to have robust rules,” Quick said, which explains the efforts from business leaders to drum up grassroots campaigns. There’s room for both, she argued – the lobbyists’ usual interactions in Washington, plus whatever the industry leaders are hatching.  “They’re not mutually exclusive,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/24/crypto-execs-give-washington-influence-another-go-with-ftx-anchor-around-necks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/016e6b55408a47ae448a77f75cec3d42367db6f6-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410612,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftUO,1684956448,"Tensions Rise Between SushiSwap, Lido Over Return of Exploited Funds","Tensions between two popular decentralized financial (DeFi) projects have reached a breaking point as crypto exchange Sushiswap and Ethereum staking protocol Lido await the result of a contentious vote to return stolen crypto to Sushiswap.  It’s a situation involving a multi-million dollar hack, a crypto Twitter battle and weeks of decentralized governance theater. DeFi projects have long faced mainstream skepticism due to the prevalence of hacks and the shoddy decision-making of the decentralized organizations that operate them.  Both issues were on full display in recent weeks as Sushiswap began an effort to recover funds it lost in a $3.3 million hack, only to get thwarted by the tricky politics of Lido’s governing body, LidoDAO. A second attempt is ongoing, but looks to be headed toward defeat.  Read More: Sushi DEX Approval Contract Exploited for $3.3M  Sushi recovery effort  Due to the nature of Sushiswap’s April exploit, the majority of stolen funds were directed to a Lido vault contract that automatically distributed it to Lido stakers and node operators. No one’s trying to claw that money back, but the 40 ETH (~$72,000) that landed in Lido’s treasury appears to be the most easily recoverable. It’s this chunk Sushiswap wants returned.  As a show of support for Sushiswap’s recovery effort, LidoDAO put forth a governance proposal on May 4 to vote on whether or not to return the 40 ETH from the LidoDAO treasury to Sushiswap.  The vote saw the majority of Lido token holders cast votes in favor of returning the funds, but the vote fetched only 44 million votes, shy of the 50 million votes required to reach quorum.  On May 18, LidoDAO put forth a second governance proposal on whether or not to return the funds. The proposal’s voting period closes Thursday, May 25.  So far, the new vote has seen even less participation – and the majority of voters flipping to ‘no action’ – stoking tensions between the two projects as the prospect of the funds getting returned appear dimmer.  'Code is law' or theft?  After the failure of the first vote, Sushiswap’s Head Chef Jared Grey took to Twitter to call Lido’s actions “theft.”  “Unfortunately, as we've worked with the Lido team to find a way forward to return the stolen funds they've disbursed, several personalities have made the argument Lido has no duty or authority to return them, essentially greenlighting the distribution of stolen funds to multiple Lido DAO participants,” tweeted Grey.  Grey also accused Lido advisor and pseudonymous DeFi user Hasu of leveraging DAO procedures “to obfuscate and impede” the process of returning the funds.  However, the Lido camp says Grey is too quick to cast blame.  “Many of us feel we’ve done everything we can to help them in the face of legal threats to fellow contributors, under a situation where they’ve made a series of careless and sloppy mistakes,” said a Lido contributor who requested not to be named. “For them to take such a disingenuous and pointed stance on Twitter like this is really disappointing to see.”  The Lido contributor alleged that Sushiswap didn’t properly audit the smart contract that was subsequently exploited and that Grey used misleading language to imply that Lido’s treasury received considerably more ETH than it did. Grey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Another twist in the saga revealed that the hacked wallet in the Sushi exploit is Ethereum address sifuvision.eth, belonging to a fund run by pseudonymous crypto personality 0xSifu. 0xSifu was the treasurer of failed DeFi project Wonderland and was later revealed to be a former executive of the Canadian crypto exchange Quadriga, which collapsed in epic fashion in 2019.  Read More: How Did a Former Quadriga Exec End Up Running a DeFi Protocol? Wonderland Founder Explains  Both projects have faced regulatory woes this year, with Sushiswap revealing they were subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March.

Digital assets traded down sharply after Yellen said that the U.S. could “run out of money” as soon as June 1. Yellen echoed her remarks from three days prior, as well as on May 1.  Bitcoin and ether declined rapidly on higher-than-average volume during the 10 a.m. ET hour. BTC dropped below $26,200 at certain points, well below its range of the past two weeks. Ether tumbled under $1,790.  The decline extended beyond BTC and ETH, with other notable cryptocurrencies falling. Traditional financial markets were also affected, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and Nasdaq all fell during the identical time period.  Bitcoin's 3% intra-day decline led to the formation of a complex head and shoulder pattern on its daily chart.  A head and shoulders (H&S) pattern is a technical chart formation characterized by a series of three successive peaks, with the second/middle peak representing the formation head. The first and third peaks represent the left and right shoulders. The pattern is used to detect potential reversals from a bullish to a bearish phase, with the signal being a break below the pattern’s “neckline”  The pattern itself is subjective in identification, so investors should use and interpret it cautiously. Still, traders making use of technical formations may view the $26,800 range as the neckline for this particular H&S pattern.  A break below would likely be bearish. A reversal higher after touching the neckline would indicate that the intraday sell-off was overdone and that prices may be poised to recapture earlier levels.  With markets having declined across crypto as well as traditional assets, BTC’s decline was likely driven by broad systemic risk, rather than bearishness specific to the asset itself.  On-chain data indicates that bitcoin “HODLing” has reached all-time highs, a counter indicator to any bearish narrative.  With macroeconomic headlines like Yellen’s statement impacting crypto markets, other systemic risks will likely move prices as well. Earlier reports showed BTC and ETH slipping on sharp increases in UK inflation.

12894996,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534817,1684951404,"Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio has approached all-time lows recently, a sign that a big move could be coming for the coin. Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Has Observed A Plunge Recently As pointed out by the lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode in a Tweet, BTC sellers may have become exhausted recently. The “sell-side risk ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of all profits and losses being realized in the Bitcoin market and the realized cap. The “realized cap” here refers to the capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates a sort of “true” value for the cryptocurrency by assuming that each coin in the supply is not worth the same as the current spot price, but the price at which it was last moved. As the profits and losses being harvested in the market are nothing but a measure of the selling pressure in the market, this indicator tells us how the selling pressure (or the sell-side risk) looks like relative to the value of the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). When the value of this indicator is high, it means the investors are participating in a high amount of profit/loss realization right now. Such a market is usually high risk, as the price tends to be more volatile during periods with these values. On the other hand, low values imply the holders are reluctant to sell currently. These conditions generally occur when the market has calmed down and accumulation tends to take place in such periods. Related Reading: Litecoin’s MVRV Has Surged, Why This Is Bearish Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio over the history of the cryptocurrency: Looks like the value of the metric has observed a decline in recent days | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin sell-side risk ratio has seen a sharp plunge recently, a sign that there is little profit or loss realization going in the market right now. The indicator is now below the “low value realization” line that the analytics firm has defined (colored in red in the chart). Historically, whenever the metric has plunged into this zone, the market has built up towards a sizeable move in the price. Related Reading: Sharks & Whales Accumulate Stablecoins, Why This Could Be Bullish For Bitcoin Since such low values of the indicator imply the lack of sellers in the market, the common expectation may be that this can be a bullish sign. However, as is visible from the graph, this hasn’t necessarily been the case. Both bullish and bearish price action has occurred following the formation of this pattern. Just back in March of this year, the indicator had shown this trend, but the cryptocurrency had followed up with a sharp correction. Breaks into the high value realization zone (that is, the condition where there is a large amount of selling going on), though, have generally always been bearish for Bitcoin. As the indicator has once again dipped into the low value realization area, it’s possible that a large move in the price may follow soon. Although it’s uncertain which direction exactly this volatility might go. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,100, down 2% in the last week.

42410605,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdft3w,1684949255,Cathie Wood Thinks the U.S. Crypto Exodus Is Here. Is It?,"When he first took office as head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2021, Gary Gensler warned crypto projects that he would be skeptical of “decentralization theater.” That’s a category of misleading claims sometimes made by DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] or protocols to be effectively leaderless (and therefore maybe unprosecutable), when in fact they have an obvious core leadership team.  Now, the ongoing regulatory crackdown by Gensler and the broader Biden administration appears to be triggering a different kind of decentralization: major crypto firms leaving the United States.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Firms including exchanges Coinbase and Gemini, Bitcoin frontend Strike and asset management platform Bakkt have all gestured towards exiting the U.S. in recent weeks. Investor Cathie Wood, known for her huge long bets on both Tesla and Coinbase, argued this week that the U.S. is “losing the Bitcoin movement” as crypto shifts away from the U.S.  This sort of geographical shift really does happen, and can be very bad for over-regulated jurisdictions – for instance, drugmaker Bayer has recently said it will shift its business focus away from Europe for regulatory reasons.  But on deeper examination, some of the signaling by crypto companies seems less like a real shift than another kind of decentralization theater. And just like the protocol variety, it might not do much to sway regulators.  The other kind of leverage  There are two basic ways to view crypto companies’ gestures towards leaving the U.S. Some may be genuinely motivated to do so by regulatory uncertainty or an anticipated crackdown. But they may also be attempting to exert leverage on U.S. regulators by threatening to take jobs and revenue elsewhere.  For now, many of the news items painting the picture of a mass crypto exodus from the United States seem to fall in the second category: Maybe not pure theatrics, but pretty close.  Some of the headlines are the result of rhetoric getting overplayed by credulous media. A Bakkt executive said they liked Europe’s MiCA framework, and signaled expansion plans – but no intent to leave the U.S. Gemini’s expansion outside of the U.S. has been incorrectly described as an “exit.” Similarly, while Coinbase is signaling global expansion, there’s not much to show for it so far – their international exchange is so far a very limited offering.  See also: Coinbase (COIN) Is the Largest U.S. Crypto Exchange. Will It Move Overseas? | Opinion  Some gestures seem more substantive, but have unclear real consequences. At the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami last week, Strike CEO Jack Mallers gave an impassioned denouncement of U.S. regulators, then announced that Strike would be “headquartered” in El Salvador. But Strike has clarified to CoinDesk that this will be the “global headquarters,” while Strike will maintain a U.S. headquarters in Chicago. It seems reasonable to assume that Chicago, where Mallers lives, will remain the firm’s real center of gravity.  Mallers also mentioned Swan Bitcoin and wallet creator Fold in the context of companies with “headquarters in El Salvador.” But those companies appear to be expanding their presence in El Salvador, not moving their headquarters there. (Mallers was speaking rather extemporaneously, so this isn’t to say he was being deceptive, just imprecise).  You can’t get there from here  It’s now been about two months since the Biden administration’s Choke Point 2.0 anti-crypto agenda fully came into focus. That’s not long – but if these companies were serious about taking their toys and moving somewhere else, you might expect more substantive progress by now.  So, why aren’t crypto companies actually leaving the U.S. in droves, if the regulatory environment is so hostile?  See also: The Case for Regulating, Not Banning, Crypto | Opinion  There are innumerable possible answers, all with broad implications for the industry. For one, it’s unlikely that U.S.-based employees are universally excited to pick up stakes and move to El Salvador or Malta. And right now, the U.S. is still a huge center of crypto industry talent.  Despite the regulatory crackdown, the U.S. legal and equity systems still have many advantages for crypto companies. In turn, the U.S. has a pretty much unparalleled financial sector, including generous venture capital funding channels that continue to flow despite SEC hostility.  But perhaps the biggest reason crypto companies aren’t aggressively pulling up stakes is that they likely wouldn’t get much for their trouble. Most obviously, the last two years have made it clear that simply saying you’re not a U.S. firm won’t protect you from the SEC’s de facto global jurisdiction.  More subtly, it’s not obvious that anyone with real power would respond to an exodus by reversing course on the crypto crackdown.  While U.S. hiring dominates crypto, crypto jobs are extremely modest as a share of overall U.S. employment (though often high-paying). And if we’re being really frank here, the Biden administration cares vastly more about fighting inflation than about anything to do with crypto, so eliminating a few hundred jobs might look to them less like an intimidating threat than a tantalizing promise.  See also: Ledger's PR Struggle Reveals Uncomfortable Trade-Offs for Crypto Companies  Democrats, especially in the executive branch, seem completely immune to the idea that crypto is anything other than a scam from top to bottom. And while Republicans are making noises about jobs, they seem far too disorganized and ineffectual to do anything about it, even with their control of the House.  In other words, if your goal is to dissuade U.S. authorities from their crypto crackdown, leaving the United States may be just as effective in the threat as in the act.

But time and time again, major blockchain companies and projects come up short – with users surprised and angry to realize that they unknowingly placed their trust in shoddy code, centralized entities or security-challenged hardware.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The latest example comes from Ledger, the Paris-based crypto hardware wallet company, which, following a public-relations firestorm last week, announced Tuesday that it would delay plans to release a controversial new wallet-recovery feature called Ledger Recover.  When it revealed the proposed feature last week, Ledger inadvertently drew attention to the fact that the company could theoretically move wallet seed phrases off-device via user-approved firmware upgrades. Previously, the company left some users with the impression that its devices were engineered to avoid this specific scenario.  Once the potential “backdoor” was revealed, outrage flooded Crypto Twitter, with posters panning Ledger for being out of touch with its own customer base – ostensibly self-sovereign types who want nothing but to be entirely in control of their own crypto. Ledger vehemently denied allegations that its capabilities amounted to a “backdoor.” But the company’s initial response to the outrage – pointing out (in a now-deleted tweet) that users were always trusting Ledger not to extract user keys – only served to fuel the furor: One widely-circulated video appeared to show a user smashing a Ledger device with a hammer and then blow-torching it into flames.  In a letter posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier apologized to customers, promised to open-source “as much of the Ledger operating system as possible,” and said he’d delay the release of Ledger Recover.  Delay or no, Ledger’s theoretical ability to move user keys via future software upgrades remains intact – mainly as a by-product of technical constraints with how Ledger and similar wallets are engineered.  The fiasco served as a valuable crash course on the limitations of hardware wallets, generally considered the most secure way to hold crypto. It was also a reminder that the current state of crypto technology doesn’t always match up with the industry’s ideals – and a lesson on the importance of carefully managing expectations.  Ledger’s PR Meltdown  Ledger’s primary error in the leadup to last week may have been in its marketing, which frequently leaned into crypto’s “trustless” ethos. The messaging was appealing to hard-core crypto users, but it left an impression of Ledger’s technical capabilities which was out of pace with reality.  Ledger’s co-founder and former CEO, Éric Larchevêque, argued on Reddit that last week’s “meltdown” represented a “total PR failure, but absolutely not a technical one.”  Larchevêque, who is a Ledger shareholder but no longer works at the company, wrote that as the company’s user base grew, so did a misperception – fueled largely by Ledger itself – that Ledger’s wallets require zero trust on the part of their users.  “People started to think Ledger was a trustless solution, which is not the case,” he wrote. “Some amount of trust must be placed into Ledger to use their product.”  Developers might have understood the nuance, but users didn’t. Larchevêque linked to an explanation of what happened from Reddit user cmplieger: “Fundamentally nothing has changed with the lLedger hardware or software,” cmplieger wrote. “What has changed is that the lLedger developers have decided to add a feature and take advantage of the flexibility their little computer provides, and people finally started to understand the product they purchased and trust factor involved.”  The most-upvoted comment on that post came from Reddit user Florian995: “What I learned is that I know nothing about the wallet I am using.”  Hardware limitations  It’s reasonable to be angry when companies oversell their products, but goals like trustlessness and decentralization exist on a spectrum, and hard-core crypto acolytes who think they can abandon one company for a more ideologically pure alternative might be disappointed.  The case of Ledger highlights how the overall state of blockchain technology simply isn’t up to the task of some of the industry’s boldest promises.  Ledger boasts that its USB thumb drives are among the most secure ways to hold crypto because they store user keys in a “secure element” – a mini computer chip that is supposed to be impenetrable. Ledger’s “trustlessness” claims mainly center around the secure element, and the company explicitly reassured users that it’s unable to reach into the element to obtain user keys.  According to Christopher Allen, chief architect at Blockchain Commons, a crypto infrastructure not-for-profit, chip technology is not yet at the point where Ledger could make such a guarantee.  “Ledger got caught in a weakness that all wallets to a certain extent have today because of chip technology,” Allen told CoinDesk. Secure element chips can’t perform the kind of cryptography needed to completely encrypt user keys on-device. (Allen says his team at Blockchain Commons is working to change this, though the tech isn’t ready.)  “There’s really nothing wrong, necessarily, with Ledger,” argued Allen. “They inadvertently exposed an architectural weakness that is all over the place.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/24/ledger-recover-fiasco-exposes-gap-between-blockchain-ideals-and-technical-reality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27ad460e80403d150fc4ec30dd0bf95c3a198a3f-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410613,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdftKT,1684947718,Ledger's PR Struggle Reveals Uncomfortable Trade-Offs for Crypto Storage,"After a week of controversy around its new seed-recovery service, French wallet-maker Ledger has been on a PR offensive, including a Twitter Spaces event with Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier on Tuesday afternoon and appearance by the same executive on CoinDesk TV Wednesday morning.  The message? Ledger has listened to its critics and is prepared to make changes to its approach.  “Everybody is very sad at Ledger when you yell at us. But it's okay because we get better and we will always strive to be good servants of the community,” Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said during a Twitter Spaces session on Tuesday afternoon.  The yelling in question was the criticism Ledger faced after announcing its upcoming key recovery service. The service will allow users to keep an encrypted backup of their wallets with a set of three custodians, including Ledger itself. Many Ledger users and observers questioned the safety of the proposed service regarding potential hacks, user data leaks and abuse of trust by Ledger itself.  Read more: Is Ledger’s New Bitcoin Key Recovery Feature Safe? Experts Have Doubts  On Tuesday, Ledger published a letter saying that it heard its users’ concerns and decided to change course: it will open-source the Ledger Recover code before launching the service, Gauthier wrote.  In addition to that, Ledger will offer additional security feature to the Recover setup: while the encrypted backup will be stored by three custodians, users will have an option to also create a passphrase, so that even if the custodians collude and recover the private key, they still won’t be able to move funds without the passphrase.     Ultimately, nothing is 100% trust-less for an average user, Gauthier said in an interview with CoinDesk TV Wednesday morning.  “There is always a minimum of trust that you need to have in any hardware wallet that you're going to use. And we are trying to make the part of the operating system as the one that you have to trust as small as possible and open everything else,” he said.  To open-source or not to open-source  The decision to open-source the code came as a response to the critics pointing that it’s impossible to audit Ledger’s new feature because the code is not public. However, the open-sourcing pledge comes with a caveat: Ledger will not publish code for all of its firmware for security reasons, the company’s CTO Charles Guillemet said in a Twitter thread.  The smartcard chip in the Ledger wallet, which is where all the operations happen and users’ private keys are stored, have built-in protections against physical tampering, Guillemet wrote. “Because this know-how is the IP of manufacturers, they don’t want it leaked, preventing Ledger’s firmware from being fully open source,” he added.  Ledger will “gradually open-source” most of its operating system, starting with the controversial Ledger Recover feature, Guillemet wrote, but “the other parts will take a little more time since it needs to be refactored to abstract the chip-specific characteristics under NDA from our OS.”  Ledger does not believe that open-source is a “silver bullet for security,” the firm’s co-founder Eric Larcheveque said during the Twitter Spaces. “We chose closed source because we believed it brings a higher level of security,” he added  Guillemet also said that ultimately, even with the open sourced code, users have to trust the wallet manufacturer – Ledger or else – with the safety of their crypto. Otherwise, users would have to build their devices from scratch, including all the physical parts, the code and the compilers turning that code into working apps, Guillemet said, and that’s obviously not an option for the “millions of users” Ledger wants to onboard in the coming years.  “Security theater”  For the same reasons, Ledger did not choose to create a completely new product for the users interested in the key recovery functions, instead making it an opt-in upgrade for existing wallets. Some participants of the Twitter Spaces event said this could be a way to avoid the PR disaster Ledger went through over the new feature.  Read more: David Z Morris - Ledger’s Hard Lesson: Being Right Isn't Good Enough  But making a new product for the new feature would be “a security theater,” Ledger’s chief experience officer Ian Rogers said: “I can take a Ledger and put it in a different box with a different name, but it would still have exactly the same sort of potential threat vector.”  That existing wallets can be upgraded for the new feature was the most controversial part of Ledger Recover. Many observers noted that Ledger’s main selling point has been that private keys never leave the device. And now it turns out that the same devices that are not supposed to reveal the private key actually can broadcast the backup to the outside world.  To add insult to injury, Ledger’s Twitter account responded to this saying that “it is and always has been possible to write firmware that facilitates key extraction” in a Monday tweet that caused outrage and was later deleted.  This should not be a shocker, Guillemet explained during the Twitter Spaces, because that’s the way Ledger works: to interact with different blockchains and smart contracts, the wallet’s operating system must access the private key. And the operating system needs to be upgradeable because blockchains themselves also upgrade and implement new features from time to time.  This means that the programs running on Ledger always could have been changed in a way that concerns private key handling – that’s something a user needs to accept by default, and the fact that users did not realize that came as a surprise for Ledger itself, Guillemet said.  The ghost of the subpoena  Another controversial part of the Ledger Recover is that the service, which is offered as a paid subscription, requires users to go through know-your-customer (KYC) checks. A Twitter user nicknamed @Zk_shark asked whether Ledger will readily respond to any government subpoena requesting data of the Ledger Recover users.  He recalled the infamous case of 2018, when Coinbase complied with the IRS’ request to provide data of 13,000 users. Later, 10,000 Coinbase users received a letter from the tax agency suggesting that they might have failed to properly report their crypto-related taxes. The IRS did not disclose the source of the users’ data.  Gauthier’s response was: if you fear this scenario, don’t use Ledger Recover. However, receiving such subpoenas is not something that is bothering the company. “We don't think it's very easy to subpoena a service like Ledger Recover,” Gauthier said.  However, he added, “if you want to be absolutely censorship resistant, you should just not activate the function.”  Read also: Air Gap? Hardware Wallet? Multisig?

BTC’s 30-day price correlation with the tech-heavy NASDAQ index fell to 0.26, its lowest level since December 2021, according to K33 data. BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 index also plummeted last month to levels not seen since late 2021.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has lured investors over the years as an asset whose price moves independently from other investment classes, most prominently from equities, making it convenient as part of a diversified portfolio.  The narrative, however, changed last year, as the digital asset market nosedived from all-time highs in tandem with stock markets. Crypto’s correlation with traditional markets rose to new highs as central banks globally jacked up interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to combat rampant inflation. The monetary hawkishness knocked down the price of rate-sensitive, risky assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Read more: Big-Money Investors Who Boosted Bitcoin’s Price Might Now Crash It  “A perverse focus on growth and wide mania across the financial markets enabled the high correlations,” K33 wrote in the report. “Now conditions have calmed. Hence, BTC may again resume acting as a solid diversifier.”  BTC as portfolio diversifier  K33 found that a small allocation to BTC improves the performance of a traditional investment portfolio.  A portfolio with 3% weight in BTC, 58.5% in stocks and 38.5% in bonds has outperformed the classic 60% equities, 40% bonds investment over the years. Even when it’s measured from January 2018, near when cryptocurrency prices entered a two-year bear market, the portfolio that included BTC would have outperformed by 6.9%, according to K33.  “While the considerable price fluctuations may disincentivize investors, a time-tested strategy of active disciplined rebalancing and a minor allocation to BTC has proven to improve the overall risk profile of a traditional portfolio,” K33 wrote.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/bitcoins-declining-correlation-with-stocks-revives-its-appeal-for-investors-k33-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ed02917aeb654f40a157e939143fa68354513d6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12893640,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534840,1684945810,Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH,"The Ethereum (ETH) network has reached a significant milestone following the highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade, as staking activity soars to new heights. According to crypto analytics platform Cryptorank, the Ethereum deposit contract balance has exceeded $40 billion, with users depositing over 4.4 million ETH since April 12 (the date of the Shanghai upgrade launch). This surge in staking activity marks a pivotal moment for ETH and its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Staking Frenzy: A Post-Upgrade Milestone The recent data shared by CryptoRank reveals that the ETH deposit contract balance on May 23 stood at 22.6 million ETH, equivalent to $41.1 billion. This substantial increase in deposits can be attributed to the introduction of the latest feature allowing validators to withdraw their staked tokens. The Ethereum network has experienced a surge in interest, with users seizing the opportunity to participate in staking and earn rewards for supporting the network’s security and consensus mechanism. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Takes A Leap Forward: Here’s What’s On The Horizon Alongside the growth in deposit contract balance, Ethereum has offered attractive staking returns. As of today, the staking annualized rate of return for running an ETH validator stands at 8.66%, providing a meaningful incentive for users to engage in staking. This figure remains significant, further driving the interest in staking among Ethereum investors seeking to maximize their returns. Furthermore, according to recent data from Token Unlocks, since the implementation of unstaking on the Ethereum network, investors have deposited 4.68 million ETH into ETH 2.0 contracts. Simultaneously, approximately 2.83 million ETH has been withdrawn, indicating ongoing investor engagement and confidence in the staking process. The Future Of Ethereum Staking With the Ethereum network surpassing the $40 billion mark in deposit contract balance, the growth in staking activity signifies a strong commitment from the community toward the PoS consensus mechanism. This development also highlights Ethereum’s transition to Ethereum 2.0, where staking will play a vital role in securing the network and achieving scalability. As ETH continues to evolve, the surge in staking participation not only contributes to the network’s security but also offers an opportunity for ETH holders to earn passive income through staking rewards. By actively participating in staking, users can contribute to the growth and decentralization of ETH while reaping the benefits of staking returns. Meanwhile, as ETH staking continues to surge, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has warned of potentially overloading the network consensus. In a recently published blog post, Buterin noted “Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.” Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Ethereum (ETH) To Reach $457,000 – Here’s How The Ethereum founder further added that using Ethereum’s network consensus for other things could bring “high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted.” However, following the warning, ETH staking hasn’t seen any decline so far but only an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a plunge, down by 3.6%. The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has dropped from a high of trading slightly above $2,000 in recent weeks to trade below $1,800, at the time of writing.

42410664,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfxrW,1684944000,Crypto’s Quirky Automated Market Makers and How They Differ From TradFi Exchanges,"The conceptual simplicity of cryptocurrencies drives much of the excitement and adoption of the asset class. Cryptocurrencies are, by and large:  digital units of account …  that store value …  and that can be exchanged for other items of value.  Readers who can still recall their early principles of economics classes probably recognize that those three tenets are part of the definition of money itself.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Still, conceptual simplicity gives way rapidly to practical complexity when users look closer at crypto. That’s especially apparent with its use as a medium of exchange, point #3 above. And also often when it comes to transferring crypto from one party to another.  In crypto, unlike conventional finance, there are two very different kinds of exchanges. And helping you grasp them – just like any thorny topic in crypto – is a challenge I relish taking on.  There are two primary ways to transfer on crypto exchanges:  Order books  Automated market makers (AMMs)  Order books are most common, and they’re also the most recognizable for anyone coming from a traditional finance background. This is just like how the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other conventional marketplaces assemble buy and sell orders in a public place so new orders can get matched up with them.  In crypto, this is how Binance and other centralized exchanges work. Binance, with roughly half of crypto exchange volume, is the biggest one.  In the order book realm, traders called market makers help keep business churning by buying from any seller and selling to any buyer, collecting the spread between bid and ask prices as their reward – something that can be quite profitable if done over and over. (Last week, I talked about crypto high-frequency traders, firms that provide this service.)  One of the benefits of order books is they allow everyone to see market depth, i.e. the extent to which orders are concentrated around specific price points. Traders can gain insight into market direction by studying market depth and making subsequent decisions – a reason why order books are popular.  But crypto has its own unique way of transferring money from buyers to sellers, known as automated market makers. (The name sounds like the traders – market makers – mentioned earlier who prowl order books, but these are very different things.)  Where order books are prevalent across centralized exchanges (CEXs), AMMs are prevalent in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Uniswap is a notable DEX.  Where order books represent a peer-to-peer arrangement underpinned by the matching of buyers and sellers, AMMs represent a peer-to-contract relationship underpinned by pools of liquidity.  Liquidity pools are collections of tokens that have been supplied by liquidity providers. Liquidity providers are users who decide to deposit their own assets into a pool, incentivized to do so by the receipt of something of value.  Users deposit coins into a liquidity pool. Other users who wish to buy or sell interact with pools holding the asset they’re interested in, trading against the pool itself instead of another user. Depositors are rewarded for providing liquidity.  Oftentimes, that comes via the receipt of trading fees or governance tokens. A common term you’ll hear specific to AMMs is “yield farming,” where users deposit tokens into liquidity pools while searching for the greatest benefit.  The method of incentivizing users to deposit coins can have a network effect, whereby the pools of coins grow, increasing liquidity itself.  Prices of the tokens are determined algorithmically, and often tied to the available quantities of each asset. For example a particular pool may hold $1 million worth of ETH and $1 million of USDC – an ETH/USDC pool). Increased demand for ETH represented by increased buying leads to a higher price for ETH, determined by mathematical formula.  With DEXs, there’s a unique elegance borne out of that equation. In the case of Uniswap, the result is approximately $500 million in daily trading volume. For context, this pales in comparison to Binance trading volume, estimated to be as high as $4 billion daily.  Still DEXs provide a valuable offering, particularly as it relates to traditionally less liquid coins. And while CEXs and DEXs are underpinned by different things, the intersection of capital, efficiency and incentives underpins them all.  And our goal at CoinDesk is to provide as much clarity as we can in exploring how they evolve.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  BITCOIN’S NFT BOOM: The Ordinals protocol has significantly shaken up the pecking order in NFTs, turning good old Bitcoin – shockingly – into a major player. In just a few months, Bitcoin has gone from a tie for last place in NFTs to the number two blockchain for NFT sales. Ethereum remains in first, which makes sense given its use of smart contracts; this was an ecosystem built for this kind of thing. But inscribing NFTs into Bitcoin was not an obvious use case for the original blockchain. And yet, here we are.  A FRENCH WELCOME: It’s gotten hard to be a crypto company in the U.S. in 2023, with regulators taking tangible steps to increase scrutiny of the industry, and the looming threat of more action as politicians amp up anti-crypto rhetoric. Just this week amid the debt-ceiling showdown, President Joe Biden said he wouldn’t accept a deal that “protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders.” So, it should come as no surprise that other nations might try to lure American companies to their friendlier shores. Take France, for example. “If American players want to benefit, in the very short term, from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome,” Benoît de Juvigny, Secretary General of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), told reporters Tuesday.  CANADA, TOO: Coinbase, the large U.S.-based crypto exchange, recently hinted it might move overseas if the regulatory environment continues to be, from its perspective, less than ideal. In a subsequent interview with CoinDesk, a senior Coinbase executive said the company likes Canada’s approach, something he called “regulation by engagement,” as opposed to the “regulation by enforcement” scheme elsewhere. Makes you wonder if Coinbase might consider heading north.  A LONG READ: CoinDesk journalists did an in-depth analysis of a crypto mining facility called Greenidge Generation in upstate New York. They did excellent on-the-ground reporting – something no one else seems to have done – to debunk misinformation in the debate over whether mining should be permitted or not on environmental grounds.

This economic concept holds that the equilibrium price of an asset is established when the quantity demanded by buyers matches the quantity supplied by sellers.  Fundamental factors have long played a crucial role in assessing traditional equity markets, where investors analyze a company's financial health, industry position and overall economic climate to determine its intrinsic value. Key metrics such as earnings, revenue and debt-to-equity ratios provide a clear picture of a company's performance, enabling investors to make buy/sell decisions. However, such metrics are not available yet in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The absence of financial statements and difficulty of estimating the impact of emerging technologies makes it hard to value cryptocurrencies by traditional pricing methods. Moreover, the extreme price volatility further challenges the efficiency of fundamental analysis in the crypto space.  In the absence of traditional valuation methods, the price often seems to be determined by the sentiment around the overall crypto market and/or a particular token. The perception and emotional reactions of market participants often play a more prominent role in driving price fluctuations and shaping investment decisions.  For a rational trader, such irrationality presents an opportunity in the market – if only she could quickly and accurately capture the mood (aka sentiment) of the market. For many years, working with sentiment seemed like an insurmountable challenge. Day traders mostly relied on crypto news headlines, Discord insider chats and announcements. And systematic traders had to invest considerable effort into development of just average-quality sentiment analysis tools. The limitations of technology at the time made it difficult to efficiently process and understand the vast amounts of data generated by global media.  The revolution in transformers and LLMs, specifically, allowed traders to approach sentiment at scale, delivering an incredible improvement over traditional methods that relied on manual scoring and Word2Vec models.  The competitive landscape of software-based technology companies vying to create the best LLM is rapidly evolving now. The table below provides an impressive illustration of this ongoing race, showcasing some of the key players and their respective contributions to the field:  These LLMs continue to increase in size and improve performance, surprising even their creators. And while people debate about whether LLMs are the first signs of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or just mindless parrots, their use in different industries and finance in particular will only accelerate.  The potential revolution brought about by transformers and LLMs could significantly transform the crypto trading landscape. With the capability to assess market sentiment on a larger scale, traders might be able to capitalize more effectively on market irrationalities.

42410668,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfyOa,1684942529,Crypto Security Firm Unciphered Claims Ability to Physically Hack Trezor T Wallet,"A company of cybersecurity professionals who specialize in recovering lost or stolen cryptocurrency say they have found a way to hack into the popular Trezor T hardware wallet once it’s in their physical possession.  Unciphered told CoinDesk in an extensive series of conversations and over email it made use of an “unpatchable hardware vulnerability with the STM32 chip that allows us to dump the embedded flash and one-time programmable (OTP) data.”  That’s all pretty technical, but the team did perform a laboratory demonstration – and documented it in a video – that it was able to hack into a Trezor T wallet supplied by CoinDesk and successfully retrieve our seed phrase and pin. Unciphered has previously hacked the EthereumWallet and recovered locked up crypto, though they claim on their website that they “do support every wallet in the market.”  Trezor told CoinDesk that its team didn’t have enough details about the specific attack Unciphered performed to respond fully, but noted that it looked like an “RDP downgrade attack,” which was publicly flagged as a risk three years ago.  A press representative for the hardware wallet maker said they were unaware of any attempts by Unciphered to reach out directly, even though, ""as communicated on our blog in early 2020, RDP downgrade attacks require physical theft of a device and extremely sophisticated technological knowledge and advanced equipment.”  Trezor added that “even with the above, Trezors can be protected by a strong passphrase, which adds another layer of security that renders a RDP downgrade useless.”  Hardware wallets are suddenly in focus as a result of the recent public backlash against the rival maker Ledger over its proposed optional “recovery option,” which infuriated some users who had understood the device to be fully isolated. Many longtime crypto security experts have recommended hardware wallets as a safer place to store assets than keeping them on exchanges – especially after last year’s collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange – but the latest revelations show that the devices aren’t foolproof either.  Read more: Crypto Wallet Provider Ledger Delays Key-Recovery Service After Uproar  Unciphered said it wouldn’t confirm or deny whether its hack of the Trezor T would be considered an RDP downgrade, citing “current engagements and non-disclosure agreements” that restrict elaboration on “how this exploit chain works at this time.”  “Further, any technical disclosure would put Satoshilabs customers at potential risk till mitigations such as a new chip is utilized other than the STM32 in current use,” according to Unciphered.  Unciphered pointed out that, even though Trezor is aware that the Trezor T model has a vulnerability in its STM32 chip, the company has not done anything to fix that since the initial effort to publicize the risk.  “The fact remains that through this article they are trying to put the responsibility of securing their device on the customer rather than taking the responsibility of admitting that their device is fundamentally insecure,” Unciphered wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  According to Trezor: “Contrary to Unciphered’s claims, Trezor has already taken significant steps to resolve this with the development of the world’s first auditable and transparent secure element through sister company Tropic Square.”  Alternative options to hardware wallets  It bears emphasizing that Unciphered’s vector of attack only works with the device in the hacker’s physical possession.  “Security is that the threat can often be coming from inside the house,” said Nick Federoff, head of marketing at Unciphered. “We can be our own worst enemy. So this is a huge part of it.”  When a user sets up a hardware wallet, the wallet generates a random set of 12 or 24 words, known as a seed phrase, that allows access to the assets on the wallet.  As part of Unciphered’s effort to demonstrate its capability, company officials asked CoinDesk to acquire a new Trezor T wallet, set it up with our own seed phrase and write that down somewhere safe. We then sent it via a secure mailing option to Unciphered’s lab, where they then proceeded to hack into it (recording some of the steps on a video) and ultimately were able to retrieve our seed phrase and pin. The extra step of involving CoinDesk was suggested by the Unciphered team as a way of providing assurance that the procedure wasn’t faked or that the device wasn’t compromised by a previous owner.  The device retails for $219 on the company's website.  Unciphered acknowledged that it had not contacted Trezor to notify them about the vulnerability prior to attempting to publicize it via an article on CoinDesk; often, such “white hat” hackers will work more cooperatively. “Unciphered has not contacted Trezor whether through our responsible disclosure program or otherwise,” said a press representative at Trezor.  Unciphered told CoinDesk that they had not contacted Trezor because “our obligations are to consumers instead of vendors, who have vested interests in selling more products, regardless of how vulnerable those products make the customers who use them.”  Read more: Hot vs. Cold Crypto Wallets: What Are the Differences?",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | TRADING | WALLET,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/24/crypto-security-firm-unciphered-claims-ability-to-physically-hack-trezor-t-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4705099240f23c0c89a3fddd7c750391be793548-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Etherscan, a wallet controlled by the foundation removed nearly 450,000 of MULTI and 1,363 ether from a liquidity pool on decentralized exchange SushiSwap. On-chain researcher Lookonchain first flagged the movement. The Fantom Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The liquidity removal comes as users of Multichain report days of delays in withdrawing their crypto assets from the protocol, which helps them move assets between the Fantom and Ethereum ecosystems. Multichain developers notified the community of a “longer than expected” upgrade on May 21. Multichain representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  While Fantom Foundation is still holding onto its MULTI, Nansen reports that other top holders have been sending Multichain’s governance token to exchanges, including one whale with 494,200 tokens ($2.75 million) as well as digital asset firm Hashkey Capital, whose position was worth $221,000 at the time.

12892879,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534820,1684942233,Polkadot (DOT) Bulls Retreat As Bears Drag The Price Down,"Polkadot (DOT) is in the red today as the bears seek to regain control over its price. DOT traded at $4.37 on January 1, 2023, and increased to $5.13 on January 11. It remained within this range before moving to $6.23 on January 20. Also, DOT increased to the $7 price level on February 17 as the bulls seized control of its price. However, a gradual bearish turn between March and April forced it back to $5, where it currently trades today. Polkadot Price Prediction Today Are The Bears In Control? DOT is trading in a sideways trend forming a red candle on the daily chart. It is below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bearish sentiment in the short and long term. Related Reading: Santiment Explains How Bitcoin Investor Mentality Influenced Recent Price Action The SMA calculates an asset’s average price over a specified period and helps predict trend direction. If the bears persist, DOT’s 50-day SMA, which is about to drop below its 200-day SMA, will form a death cross. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 40.73 and in the neutral zone. The RSI is a trend-based indicator. DOT’s RSI is moving downwards, hinting at further price decline to the oversold region before a trend reversal. The cryptocurrency’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows convergence. Also, the MACD – a trend momentum indicator that displays the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) and an asset’s price, displays a negative value conforming to the bearish trend today. The green histogram bars are fading, indicating a changing trend direction. DOT’s technical indicators all hint at the possibility of further price decline for the asset. It is close to the $5.29 support level as the bears at the $5.42 resistance continue to act on its price, forcing a decline. DOT has remained in a sideways trend for the last few days and further price decline remains a possibility. However, if the bulls rally again, the $5.42 resistance level will be a realistic target before the $6 psychological resistance level. The altcoin will likely enter a downtrend if the bears maintain the pressure today. But one thing that offers the possibility of a bullish reversal is the upcoming ‘Polkadot Decoded 2023’ event in June. Polkadot Decoded 2023 Might Boost DOT’s Performance Polkadot is hosting a community event, ‘Polkadot Decoded 2023’, between June 28-29 in Copenhagen, Denmark. This event will assemble the Polkadot community in progressive talks anchored by over 100 quality speakers in the crypto community.

42410656,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfxeI,1684941783,Black Market for Worldcoin Credentials Pops Up in China,"Worldcoin, a crypto project by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has gained some traction in China, with users rushing to source know-your-customer (KYC) verifications on the black market.  Worldcoin’s crypto wallet, World App, is not available in mainland China, according to CoinDesk's observations. Beijing has severely restricted foreign social media apps and their collection of user data under draconian internet rules. Worldcoin didn't confirm to CoinDesk whether China app stores users can download the app prior to publication.  Searches for the Worldcoin hashtag grew from 0 to almost 20,000 on Weibo – China’s Twitter-like social media site – from earlier in May until a peak on May 21. On WeChat, another popular social media app, searches peaked on May 18, growing 225% from the previous day. Worldcoin and OpenAI founder Sam Altman testified before the U.S. Congress on May 16, which could have stirred up interest in his project.  Meanwhile, a black market emerged on Chinese social media and ecommerce sites. Sellers were offering KYC verifications for the World App, which offers wallet and ID services. The credentials often come from developing countries like Cambodia and Kenya, according to social media posts.  Worldcoin said that there have been a few hundred instances of such activity and no sensitive data was shared. “Through ongoing threat and awareness monitoring measures, the Worldcoin team identified suspicious and potentially fraudulent activity whereby individuals were incentivized to sign up for a verified World ID that was then delivered to a third party’s World App rather than their own,” the firm said.  Similar black markets for credentials for crypto exchanges and other apps exist in the Chinese internet ecosystem. Crypto trade has various restrictions in mainland China, but traders are accustomed to finding ways to get around barriers.  The black market seems to undermine one of Worldcoin's fundamental purposes: to create and spread globally a blockchain-based identification method that uses iris recognition. To sign up, users have to visit a local Worldcoin representative to have their irises scanned by a futuristic metal orb, which anonymizes their data and stores it locally.  This “privacy first, self custodial, decentralized” ID will one day form the basis of the internet, in World App’s vision, but for now is used for the startup’s wallet app.  Worldcoin is promising free tokens to users who sign up, and last week, announced it would be offering free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to signees as part of a partnership with decentralized email Dmail.  The black market was first reported by Chinese crypto site Blockbeats, which said that fake iris scans cost as little as $20.  On Taobao, China’s version of Amazon, listings for Worldcoin access have appeared. Some reviewed by CoinDesk offer different options, from a simple download of the app for RMB 9.9 ($1.41) to full KYC certification for RMB 499.  Worldcoin is built by a company called Tools for Humanity, co-founded and led by Sam Altman and Alex Blania.

Matcha rolled out a new transaction mode for users called “Matcha Auto” that makes transactions twice as likely to be included in the next immediate block whilst reducing the chances of a failed transaction trade.  Additionally, Matcha’s DEX liquidity sources jumped 47%, while the number of tokens indexed on the platform skyrocketed from 11,000 to 3.7 million tokens.  Each decentralized exchange has varying prices for crypto assets, as the price for ETH may differ between Uniswap and SushiSwap. A DEX aggregator compiles the prices of a crypto asset from multiple exchanges and lets users find the best price for their trading.  Matcha compares all the prices across different markets for users and “finds intelligent ways to chop your trade into pieces to route chunks of it to different markets to achieve the best price,” said co-founder Will Warren to CoinDesk.  According to 0x Protocol Explorer, Matcha in the past 30 days had roughly 16,900 users and 60,310 trades at press time. Total volume in the same time period currently stands at nearly $529 million, with an average trade size of $8,760.  “In a world where there are billions of tokens, there are dozens of different blockchain networks and there are hundreds of different decentralized exchanges scattered across them, figuring out where to go, in order to buy or sell a token and get the best price gets more and more complicated,” added Warren. Aggregation and providing a multichain product like Matcha is “going to become more and more valuable for users over time.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Sage D.

Related Reading: Here’s What The Metrics Say About Polygon’s (MATIC) Uptrend Bitfinex Grows In Latin America, What’s Behind Deal With OrionX? Based in Chile, OrionX was launched 2017 as a crypto trading platform. In the following years, the company has become a powerhouse in its home country, and it’s looking to expand into Peru, Colombia, and Mexico as it targets one million users by 2024. In that sense, the cooperation with Bitfinex will allow the crypto bank to use its partner’s expertise as a worldwide platform. OrionX might benefit from Bitfinex’s capabilities with multiple products, such as trading, staking, and crypto lending. Thus, the Latin American platform is seeking to increase its chances of succeeding in its expansion. In the meantime, Bitfinex seeks to increase its presence in the region. Cofounder of OrionX Joel Vainstein stated about the partnership: Having a strategic collaboration with a company like Bitfinex will play a vital role in advancing our project in LATAM. We firmly believe that their involvement will provide a substantial impetus to our capital raising activities. We are confident that their extensive experience and proven product portfolio will expedite our own product development and user base expansion, positioning us as the benchmark in the region. Since 2021, the crypto trading venue has doubled its efforts to work with Latin American projects. Per the release, the company partnered with several organizations to promote Bitcoin and decentralized technologies, such as “Mi Primer Bitcoin,” based in El Salvador. In addition, the crypto trading venue has been promoting financial and scientific education via its contribution to a Paraguay-based NGO called Penguin Academy. Bitfinex sponsored a three-week boot camp focused on teaching women coding skills. The cooperation with OrionX is taking these efforts to the next level. The partners recognize the region’s need for financial products and services and are preparing to offer an alternative to the legacy financial system. According to Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex: We’re excited to collaborate with Orionx as we look to expand our presence in Chile and across Latin America. This represents a major step forward in our efforts to harness the power of Bitcoin and decentralised technology to promote financial freedom and empower businesses that share our values. We look forward to working even more closely with the team at Orionx to support its growth and development going forward. Latin America is one of the fasting regions adopting cryptocurrencies and digital assets. This metric has been expanding by 40% year-on-year, per data from Chainalysis.

The AvaCloud product has four main components: an automated blockchain builder, managed validators, comprehensive data tools and chain interoperability.  The automated blockchain builder provides companies with access to a no-code blockchain portal that offers 24/7 technical support and a dedicated infrastructure team to help them manage a custom network. Each blockchain operated through AvaCloud uses precompiled smart contracts that are customizable and built into the blockchain protocol.  Managed validators provide automated installation and updates, while comprehensive data tools provide blockchain insights from across the entire Avalanche network and Ethereum blockchain.  Additionally, Ava Labs recently rolled out Avalanche Warp Messaging, which allows for native communications between all Avalanche subnets.  With these new tools, users can quickly create a free testnet, launch onto mainnet and continue to add on functionality as they expand over time.  Nicholas Mussallem, senior vice president of product at Ava Labs, said that AvaCloud allows companies to bring its Web3 products to market faster and with lower risk, without needing to hire blockchain-focused employees.  ""Historically, custom blockchains have required both intensive capital and human investment,"" he told CoinDesk. ""One study quotes end-to-end deployment for a custom blockchain to have an average time and cost exceeding 12 months and $1.5 million per year.""  He added that public blockchain networks are often unsuitable for business and government entities because they either ""fail to meet regulatory requirements or are too expensive and slow.""  ""As blockchain has matured, it’s become clear that one size does not fit all,"" he said. ""Because AvaCloud-powered blockchains are able to customize validator requirements like KYC and privacy, industries with strict regulations can benefit from blockchain tech. This opens the door for TradFi adoption, HIPAA compliance, government programs and much more.""  According to Ava Labs, the new tool will create greater revenue opportunities and ""sets the stage for mass adoption-ready cloud-based infrastructure in blockchain."" AAA game studio Shrapnel and Korean conglomerate SK are among its early users.  Ava Labs has been expanding its product offerings to cater to both Web2 and Web3 audiences, welcoming financial institutions like Deloitte, T. Rowe Price and WisdomTree into its ecosystem. In May, the cloud division of Chinese tech behemoth Alibaba built a launchpad for businesses to deploy metaverse spaces on the Avalanche blockchain.

The asset saw an increase of 10.89% taking its price to a high of $11.2. However, the bears regained control of the market on May 13 and sent the coin to its current price of $10.40, representing a decrease of 1.12%. From the beginning of May 2023 till date, ATOM has witnessed a price decline of 11.2%, based on its current price. Bears In Control of Comos (ATOM) Price The ATOM/USDT daily chart suggests that the market sentiment for Cosmos (ATOM) is predominantly bearish. It also shows a downward price movement dominating and hindering any potential bullish momentum. Related Reading: Data Suggests Small Holders Will Drive Next Cardano (ADA) Rally The price of ATOM was influenced negatively by the recent chaotic legal battle with its former growth and strategy chief, Grace Yu. The news raised negative sentiments among investors and market participants toward Cosmos (ATOM). The Validators even urged Cosmos founder Kwon Jae to close the case against Grace Yu. And this action indicates a level of concern within the Cosmos community. Negative sentiment towards an asset can influence investor behavior, decreasing demand for ATOM and potentially contributing to downward pressure on its price. An example of this is that ATOM has been trending down since April 17, suggesting a bearish sentiment. The trendline now serves as a reference for identifying potential resistance levels since the asset has tested it severally. Cosmos (ATOM) trades between $10.160 and $11.301 support and resistance levels. ATOM breaking through the $10.160 primary support level will confirm the bearish momentum. Afterward, the bears might target the next support level at $8.441. However, the bulls are trying hard to push the price to the primary resistance level of $11.301 but couldn’t due to the high bearish momentum. ATOM Technical Analysis ATOM is trading below its 200-Day and 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a bearish market sentiment. This level indicates that ATOMs’ recent and long-term price averages are declining, potentially indicating a negative trend and a higher likelihood of further downward price movement. Related Reading: Meme Coin Season May Be Over As PEPE, SHIB, DOGE, Continue Decline The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) confirms the bearish market sentiment as the asset trades the signal line. It suggests that the short-term moving average moves lower than the longer-term moving average, pointing toward downward momentum. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), with a reading of 43.29, suggests a neutral market sentiment. The indicator shows the price is neither overbought nor oversold. For now, the ATOM price outlook is bearish. But crypto assets are volatile and could deviate from predicted price trends without warnings.

Limited partners backing the fund included the venture capital arm of USDC issuer Circle, enterprise-focused crypto firm Ripple and Web3 infrastructure giant Alchemy’s investment arm.  The fund is opening for business during an extended crypto bear market that has slowed investments in the space, though infrastructure projects have proven to be the most resilient sector.  “We’re looking for teams that are bridging today’s infrastructure gaps and building new standards for decentralized tech layers,” Patrick Chang, founder and managing partner of Dispersion Capital, wrote in an announcement post. “Their work will make it possible to create and launch multi-chain, multi-currency, and multi-platform applications. We want to find and fund the fundamental tech layers that make this possible.”  Chang told TechCrunch that Dispersion Capital has already deployed about 10% of the fund, backing 20 companies, including on-chain security platform Chaos Labs and Mystiko Network, a Web3 privacy infrastructure layer.  In his post, Chang noted that venture capital money poured into the crypto industry in 2021, and the focus was on the so-called application layer of Web3, or decentralized applications (dapps) that helped onboard users into areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As the bull market gave way to the bear, crypto infrastructure was found wanting.  “Web3’s foundational layer wasn’t (and still isn’t) ready for billions of users,” wrote Chang.  Chang, an active angel investor, has worked in venture capital for 20 years, including stints at Bain Capital Ventures and Samsung Next. As an institutional investor, Chang has guided investments into a number of crypto companies, including Alchemy, Dapper Labs and Flow, he told CoinDesk in a message.

The partnerships are meant to integrate Tenet into the Asian blockchain community that is “often siloed from Western crypto projects,” read the announcement.  “One of the first markets we wanted to go after was the Chinese market because… they’ve been kind of out of the LSD process for most of what’s been happening so far,” said Gopman. “So we thought that was a really exciting market to start to invigorate.”  Conflux, which claims to be the only regulatory-compliant blockchain in China, has collaborated with international brands and government entities like the city of Shanghai, McDonald’s China and China Telecom.

42410654,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfxoD,1684933769,"Crypto, TradFi Broadly Welcome IOSCO’s Proposed Norms for Digital Asset Markets","Industry stakeholders have largely welcomed new norms for the crypto sector proposed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on Wednesday – but are uncertain how the rules will look in effect.  The regulator's 18 policy recommendations for the global crypto industry cover a range of issues including market abuse, conflict of interest and consumer protection – and are designed to contribute to a larger effort by international bodies to supervise what regulators see as an unstable financial market.  Regulators around the world have so far taken diverging approaches to addressing the sector, ranging from outright bans in countries like China and legal crackdowns in the U.S., to setting up licensing regimes like the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union.  For crypto stakeholders, universal standards for the sector are a welcome signal.  “The new blueprint from IOSCO is a shot in the arm for regulators worldwide to move towards a more harmonized system,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto trading platform Nexo said in a statement.  Regulators around the world “should be able to examine” compliance of crypto transactions or holdings at any time, said Haydn Jones, global lead of blockchain and crypto solutions at financial advisor Kroll.  “Putting in place the frameworks to do so is a vital step in order to protect against criminal activity, but also to allow for everyone to benefit from the underlying technology that cryptocurrencies rely on,” Jones said in a statement.  The recommendations also push forward the creation of “a baseline for cross-border standards that can be built upon,"" said Chris Woolard, a regulations expert at professional services giant EY, in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  In practice  Cross-jurisdictional crypto regulation is indeed overdue, but how effective it will be in practice remains to be seen, according to Woolard.  Those in traditional finance, who have seemingly taken a step back from entering crypto markets following the dramatic market collapse last year, may also need some convincing.  “Although the objective of these proposed recommendations is to safely integrate the crypto sector into mainstream finance, the exact consequences and execution are yet to be determined,” Rajeev Bamra, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a statement.  “Yet they hold the potential to shape the regulation and oversight of the crypto industry in significant ways,” Bamra added.  DeFi  Bamra also noted how IOSCO’s recommendations, spearheaded by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as part of the global body’s fintech task force, did not address decentralized finance (DeFi), which is set to be separately looked at by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  While Bamra said DeFi norms, once released, “could help increase investor confidence, decrease exposure to risks, and encourage more consistent regulation"" across jurisdictions, Chris Perkins, president and managing partner at investment firm CoinFund, commended IOSCO for not “commingling” DeFi in its policy paper covering crypto asset service providers.  “There is always going to be a tension in the crypto market between the nature of crypto – a decentralized technology, sitting above the traditional jurisdictional borders, taking risks, pushing technological boundaries – and a desire from governments to implement regulations to protect consumers,” said Will Charlesworth, crypto assets partner at U.K.-based Keystone Law.  IOSCO will accept public feedback on its proposed recommendations until July 31.

The escalation began on May 10, 2023, when Binance tweeted to say it will move some assets, including the WRX token, into the ""Innovation Zone.""  Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao then re-tweeted that tweet with an explanation: ""As some of you suggested, instead of direct delistings, we will move ""no-progress projects"" to innovation zone first. If they still don't improve, we may delist. One more intermediate step.""  They are 17 other tokens besides WRX that Binance has shifted to its innovation zone.  ""The Innovation Zone was introduced to give Binance users a place to trade innovative projects with higher volatility and risk compared to other listed tokens,"" a Binance blog said.  Six days later, on May 16, a WazirX blog claimed they had no control over the WRX tokens and gave a breakdown of ""the list of wallet addresses where Binance is currently holding a total of 580.78 Million locked and unlocked WRX tokens.""  ""We hope this clarification addresses any confusion surrounding the management of WRX,"" the WazirX blog said.  The WRX token has seen a sharp price decline since May 10, falling from $0.1459 to 0.1243 on May 24, and trading volumes have dipped from $622,128 to $518,980, according to data on CoinMaketCap.  ""Users are blaming WazirX but WazirX can't do anything about it because control is with Binance,"" an industry source who did not wish to be named told CoinDesk. ""When Binance, the biggest exchange in the world, says it will delist a token it affects the token badly, both in terms of price and volatility.""  The public spat between Binance and WazirX has been ongoing since August 2022 and is focused on the true ownership of the Indian exchange.  In this latest episode, WazirX also alleges that Binance is responsible for conducting the quarterly burn of WRX tokens and has not conducted them for the past five quarters or since Jan 2022 onwards.  Burns refer to the permanent deletion of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an inaccessible address. This may sometimes lead to an increase in the prices of such tokens as supply decreases.  ""Binance is upping the stakes, turning the screws. They are doing all it takes to throttle the token or actually kill it,"" the source said.  Binance didn't immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. WazirX declined to comment.

42410675,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfyYV,1684933200,Crypto’s Fentanyl Trade Worth Tens of Millions: Security Researchers,"Law enforcement around the world has long pointed to China as being a source of deadly fentanyl as well as the precursors used to manufacture it. New research from both Chainalysis and Elliptic have put a number on how much of this trade is done in crypto.  Elliptic, which published its report on the topic Tuesday, says cryptocurrency wallets attached to darknet merchants which sell fentanyl as well as precursors have received $27 million in payments (though over exactly what time frame is unclear), while Chainalysis pegged the number at $37.8 million since 2018.  $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of roughly $54 billion, Elliptic said in its report.  The majority of these transactions, according to the reports, use USDT or bitcoin – as opposed to privacy coins – making them relatively easy to track on-chain.  Over 90 China-based companies were identified by Elliptic researchers as willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and 90% of them accepted cryptocurrency payments.  Darknet markets ban the outright sale of fentanyl and it's been illegal to sell in China since 2019, but merchants get around this by using coded language.

42410667,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfyRt,1684933200,TradFi Hedge Fund Hunting Hill Starts Crypto Arm,"Hunting Hill Global Capital, a New York-based traditional finance hedge fund with $364 million in assets under management as of a March filing, announced on Wednesday that it will starts its digital asset affiliate, Hunting Hill Digital (HHD), which is backed by an undisclosed investment from early-stage venture capital firm BaseLayer Ventures.  Hunting Hill Digital’s first product will come later this year with the launch of the Crypto 25 Fund with an initial $20 million to $25 million in assets under management, according to a source familiar with the matter.  HDD is partnering with anchor investor TIFF on the fund, which will provide institutional investors with exposure to an actively managed strategy focused on the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap, liquidity and performance, the source said.  The new digital asset unit comes during a particularly turbulent and ongoing bear market that has widely slowed investments in the space. Hunting Hill cites the interest of institutional investors for the move, and the future potential of moves made during a downward cycle  “We are contrarian traders by nature and we look for these types of distressed dislocations and believe that there is opportunity when those occur,” Adam Guren, co-founder of HHD and chief investment officer of Hunting Hill, said during an interview with CoinDesk. “These are the times that we want to be putting seeds in the ground to watch them in the future.”  HDD will eventually manage all of Hunting Hill’s digital asset products once that transition is completed, including the Hunting Hill Crypto Opportunities Fund. The affiliate plans to explore tokenization and non-fungible token (NFT) asset management, and will be managed by Guren and co-founder Sonny Dozier.  Established in 2012 as an asset manager targeting institutional investors, Hunting Hill moved into digital assets in 2016. By 2021, the firm had about $3.5 billion of its balance sheet dedicated to trading of digital assets and their derivatives. Hunting Hill started to reduce that exposure due to red flags about counterparty risks in the industry, said Guren, which meant the firm didn’t have exposure to the bankruptcies and insolvencies that rocked the industries.  The existence of Hunting Hill Digital was first reported by Blockworks last December. The new affiliate experienced some early controversy when CNBC reported that three former executives of Genesis – the crypto lender and CoinDesk sister company that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year – were claiming to be HDD co-founders and touted a Bessemer Ventures investment, which the investor denied.  Hunting Hill later told The Daily Beast that the firm had discussions with two of the ex-Genesis employees, but they had never started employment. The third, Martin Garcia, was HDD’s chief investment officer before his departure on May 1, a source told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/24/tradfi-hedge-fund-hunting-hill-starts-crypto-arm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83a680d87001bca41c37887062545e93c9de7b33-4844x2939.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sharks & Whales Have Been Loading Up On Stablecoins Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the sharks and whales have recently improved their share of the total supply of stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC), Dai (DAI), and Binance USD (BUSD). The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us what percentage of a cryptocurrency’s total circulating supply is being held by which wallet group in the market. Addresses are divided into these “wallet groups” based on the total number of tokens that they are holding at the moment. In the context of the current discussion, the 100,000 to 10 million coins cohort is of interest. This group naturally includes the wallets of all the investors who are carrying a balance of at least 100,000 and at most 10 million tokens. As the assets in question here are USD-pegged stablecoins (meaning that their value is fixed at $1), the bounds of this range convert to $100,000 and $10 million, respectively. As these amounts are massive, only the largest of the investors in the market would be sitting on these addresses. The sharks and whales are two such cohorts that are large enough to cover these wallets. These groups can be quite influential in the market, as they have the power to move a notable amount of coins at once. Obviously, the whales would be the more important group of the two, as they are the larger cohort. Related Reading: Santiment Explains How Bitcoin Investor Mentality Influenced Recent Price Action Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of these sharks and whales for three of the most popular stablecoins in the sector: All three of these supplies seem to have gone up in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the supplies of these three stablecoins hit a low back in March, but have since then observed an increase. This means that sharks and whales of the respective tokens have been accumulating during this period. Generally, investors use stables whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with other assets like Bitcoin. So, sharks and whales picking up these coins can be a sign that they have been exiting the other assets recently. Eventually, however, such investors who have taken safe haven in stablecoins may exchange these tokens back for the volatile coins, once they feel that prices are right to jump in. Whenever these holders swap their stables, the prices of the assets that they are shifting into can naturally observe a buying pressure. This implies that the currently piled-up stablecoin supplies of the sharks and whales can be looked at as the potential dry powder that may be deployed into assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Litecoin’s MVRV Has Surged, Why This Is Bearish In the last couple of weeks, the USDC, DAI, and BUSD supplies of these humongous holders have flatlined, meaning that they may have slowed down their exit from the volatile coins. If the trend now reverses and they start scooping up the other cryptocurrencies with their stables, BTC could possibly feel a bullish effect.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid under the $27,000 level early Wednesday, leading a broad decline in major cryptocurrencies as markets reacted to poor U.K. inflation figures. The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the U.K. came in at 6.8% in April. That was the fastest pace of core inflation since 1992, and sizably ahead of March’s 6.2% pace as well as the 6.2% consensus forecast. It’s the third consecutive month that U.K. inflation has come in hotter than expected and the news is likely to add to pressure on the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates in the coming months.  Binance is firing back at a Reuters special report from Tuesday that said the crypto exchange commingled customer funds with company revenue. The report, citing unnamed ""former insiders,"" said the funds in question ""ran into billions of dollars"" and that ""commingling happened almost daily"" in accounts the exchange had at collapsed U.S. lender Silvergate Bank. Reuters noted that it did not find evidence that clients' funds were lost or taken. Binance took major exception with the Reuters story, with the exchange's Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann calling it ""weak"" and full of ""conspiracy theories."" Though not outright denying the allegations in the report, Hillman said the Reuters journalist was ""desperate ... to publish a negative story.""  Japan is set to implement stricter anti-money laundering measures, including the so-called ""travel rule"" of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) from June 1, according to local news outlet Kyodo News. The decision was made by Japan's cabinet on Tuesday after the nation's anti-money laundering steps were deemed insufficient by global financial crimes watchdog FATF, the report said. In 2019, the FATF recommended the travel rule to combat money laundering and terrorist financing using crypto. By June 2022, the FATF was urging member nations to introduce travel rule legislation ""as soon as possible.""

Argo Blockchain (ARBK), Cowa, DMG Blockchain (DMG) and Gryphon Digital Mining and Hive Blockchain (HIVE) were certified at launch.  Miners have been increasingly scrutinized for their environmental impact due to their high energy consumption. Most recently, the Biden administration said that its looking to impose a punitive tax on the miners based on their energy consumption.  GP4BTC will score bitcoin miners on two metrics that take into account the mix of energy they use: their purchases of renewable energy credits (RECs) and their participation in demand response programs. RECs represent ownership of the sustainability of electricity produced. Demand response programs allow firms to power off at times of peak energy demand.  The registry is free for the time being. Energy Web might introduce a fee for miners looking to get certified or for users looking to access the data, Westervelt said.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?

Usually, when Musk talks about DOGE, the price tends to go up as investors rush to capitalize on the publicity. However, it is not the case this time around because despite Musk mentioning the meme coin, its price has gone in the opposite direction. Elon Musk Says Don’t Bet On Crypto Or Dogecoin Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit held in London and among other topics, he touched on the crypto industry and Dogecoin in particular. Musk once again professed his support for Dogecoin, saying he likes the meme coin because of its humor and the fact that it incorporated dogs. Related Reading: Data Suggests Small Holders Will Drive Next Cardano (ADA) Rally However, he further went on to state that he would not advise anyone to bet their life savings on either crypto or Dogecoin. “I’m not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on, you know, Dogecoin or anything like that,” the billionaire said when asked if he was still a fan of crypto. Musk has a long history of supporting the meme coin and it was this support that sent the cryptocurrency rallying to new all-time highs back in 2021. At different points since then, Musk’s posts have also moved the price positively. But his stance this time around has deviated from what is normally expected and the price of DOGE has suffered for it. DOGE Price Retraces Despite Musk Mention In one of the rare cases, the price of Dogecoin has actually retraced after Musk mentioned the meme coin during his interview. The price is down over 3% in the last 24 hours alone and is now trading dangerously close to the $0.07 support level. DOGE falls to $0.071 | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com As a result of this, DOGE has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a move that puts it on a bearish path over the short to mid-term. Also, with Bitcoin seeing losses, it has taken the market down with it, so there is not much room for recovery for DOGE at this time. Related Reading: Meme Coin Season May Be Over As PEPE, SHIB, DOGE, Continue Decline However, many in the community continue to hold out hope that Elon Musk will eventually announce a DOGE integration on Twitter as a payment method. Such a move would no doubt lead to an at least 50% upside for the meme coin, and it could be a catalyst for its next rally. At the time of writing, DOGE is changing hands at a price of $0.07113.

Pertsev was arrested and detained on the orders of Dutch financial crime enforcers FIOD in August of last year, just days after the privacy protocol was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  OFAC has said Tornado Cash was used by North Korean hackers to process and obscure the source of funds for the regime, but Pertsev’s case has drawn protest from online rights activists who see it as a threat to open-source coding and online privacy.  Pertsev’s lawyer Keith Cheng told CoinDesk outside the courtroom that he was “happy” the court had allowed him to directly ask Chainalysis in writing about its methods.  “You're not going to have a hamburger analyzed at the laboratory… I say let's go to the meat factory,” Cheng said. “Just ask them what the ingredients are.”  FIOD explanations had proved technically unsatisfactory, such as its citing of the existence of “user agents” that don’t exist on the Ethereum blockchain, Cheng said.  Pertsev, who in April was freed to await trial from his home near Amsterdam, has denied charges of money laundering. But, with a further hearing set for September, his case now looks set to drag on into 2024.  On Saturday, Tornado Cash was the subject of an apparently malicious attack that allowed a hacker or group of hackers to seize control of the protocol, causing its TORN token to plunge.

The decision was made by Japan's cabinet on Tuesday after the nation's anti-money laundering steps were deemed insufficient by global financial crimes watchdog FATF, the report said.  In 2019, the FATF recommended the travel rule to combat money laundering and terrorist financing using crypto. By June 2022, the FATF was urging member nations to introduce travel rule legislation ""as soon as possible.""  Earlier this month, the Group of Seven (G-7) intergovernmental political forum signaled its support for the FATF's efforts to accelerate global implementation of its travel rule, which mandates the sharing of information on crypto fund transfers between financial institutions. Japan had not implemented the travel rule at the time.  Japan's move to implement the rule is seen as a bid to align with global standards supported by the G-7, of which Japan currently holds presidency.  Japan's crypto industry has been grappling with the travel rule since 2021 when Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) requested virtual asset services providers to implement it. In April 2022, Japan's Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) introduced self-regulatory rules accordingly. In October last year, Japan's government approved a cabinet decision to amend existing laws to curb money laundering using crypto, in line with FATF guidelines.

The stolen amount in the first three months this year is less than any quarter in 2022, showcasing better security measures and suggesting an overall drop in easy exploits.  The average hack size also took a hit in Q1 2023 – to $10.5 million from nearly $30 million in the same quarter of 2022, even as the number of incidents was similar (around 40), TRM Labs said in its report.  “To date, hacking victims have recovered over half of all stolen funds in Q1 2023,” the firm added. “For example, in March 2023, a hacker exploited a bug in Tender.fi’s code that allowed the attacker to steal over USD 1.5 million. The hacker later contacted Tender.fi and agreed to return the funds in exchange for a bug bounty of 62.15 ether, worth $850,000.”  The cryptocurrency ecosystem has long been a target for hackers due to its inherent vulnerabilities. However, the significant reduction in crypto hacks during the first quarter of 2023 suggests that the industry has been actively addressing these challenges and implementing proactive security measures.  Last year saw over $3.7 billion lost to various attacks, hacks and scams – making 2022 the worst year in the market’s history so far. Attackers gained over $3.2 billion in 2021. But 2022 was off to an even rockier start with a $325 million exploit of popular cross-chain service Wormhole, which was followed by a $625 million attack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge, and then a $200 million exploit of the Nomad bridge.  As per TRM Labs, this year's decline in crypto hacks could be attributed to various factors, including improved cybersecurity practices, stricter regulatory frameworks and increased collaboration among industry participants.  However, reasons for concern remain.  “Unfortunately, this slowdown is most likely a temporary reprieve rather than a long-term trend,” TRM Labs said, adding that a few large-scale attacks account for most of the amount stolen from crypto platforms and users, which can cause the total amount stolen to fluctuate dramatically month-to-month.  “The ten largest hacks in 2022 accounted for approximately 75% of the total amount stolen in 2022,” it concluded.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/24/attackers-left-empty-handed-as-crypto-hacks-drop-70-in-q1-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10a17f9ee8cafcb8de431c8eca60c18cd342814c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On May 17, one local news outlet reported that the country's Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Aisha Ghaus Pasha had said the FATF set a condition that cryptocurrency cannot be legalized in Pakistan to keep the nation off its ""grey list"" of nations under increased monitoring. Another report said Pakistan's anti-crypto stance is because it goes against the conditions set by the FATF.  Pasha told the country's Senate Standing Committee on Finance that cryptocurrencies will “never be legalized in Pakistan,"" local media reported on Wednesday.  The FATF's ""grey list"" is seen as a reprimand to address strategic deficiencies in regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  The statement by Pakistan's Pasha was seen as a fresh ban on crypto by Pakistan's government, even as the nation's economy is reeling, partly due to a volatile political situation. Pasha also reportedly told authorities to initiate work on banning cryptocurrencies.  In January 2022, the nation's central bank declared it planned to ban crypto, its first clear position on the new financial technology, CoinDesk reported.  The FATF said it requires countries to understand money laundering and terrorist financing risks the crypto sector faces, and issue licenses or register exchanges to supervise the sector in the same way it supervises other financial institutions.  The FATF requires virtual asset service providers to implement the same preventive measures as financial institutions, including customer due diligence, record keeping and reporting of suspicious transactions, and adhere to its travel rule – which requires crypto service providers to collect and share information on transactions above a certain threshold.  The FATF declined to directly respond to statements made by Pasha, but said that ""countries are permitted, but not required, to prohibit virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.""

To date, digital asset adoption has been mostly the domain of native Web3 innovators. To continue along this curve, more early adopters need to come onboard. In many of these cases, customers don’t even know they’re interacting with blockchain technology. Web2 companies have effectively abstracted the blockchain away. Digital assets have had a wild ride over the last year. Several centralized crypto companies, from the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to the crypto exchange FTX, have failed, while the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and other US agencies have initiated a regulatory onslaught against crypto-related businesses. Further, amid high inflation, a banking crisis, and a potential recession, all risk assets face an uncertain macro future. But we can’t forget the long-term asymmetric opportunity that digital assets may offer. Fundamental investors are searching for the digital projects that stand the best chance for mass adoption despite the negative overhang. With that in mind, five important themes have emerged in digital asset markets that could lead to wider blockchain adoption in the medium to long term. 1. The Big Players Are Here: Web2 Partnerships and the Next Wave of Web3 Users To date, digital asset adoption has been mostly the domain of native Web3 innovators. To continue along this curve, more early adopters need to come onboard. Several companies with pre-crypto origins made significant progress in 2021 and 2022 through initiatives that helped expand Web3’s user base beyond crypto natives. Four projects in particular have leveraged Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), an Ethereum ( ETH-USD )-based scaling solution, to facilitate these efforts. Polygon + Projects Starbucks ( SBUX ) Polygon will power Starbucks Odyssey , an extension ofStarbucks’ loyalty program, through which users willbe able to earn and purchase digital collectible stamps. Reddit ( REDDIT ) Reddit users minted 40,000 non-fungible token (NFT) avatars on Polygon’s blockchain , purchasing them allfor around $10 to $100 apiece, to serve as their Redditprofile avatar. The initiative led to the creation of millionsof new crypto wallets. Nike ( NKE ) Through its new .Swoosh platform , Nike will sell virtualapparel — sneakers, shirts, etc. — represented as Polygon-minted NFTs that users can put on their Web3 and meta-verse avatars. Salesforce ( CRM ) Through Salesforce’s partnership with Polygon , thecustomer-relationship management ((CRM)) platform’sclients can create and manage NFT-based loyaltyprograms on the blockchain. In many of these cases, customers don’t even know they’re interacting with blockchain technology. Web2 companies have effectively abstracted the blockchain away. To date, Web3 onboarding has been fairly technical; by making it less so, brands can help encourage mass adoption. Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) have also seen the value of partnering with blockchains for node operation. Amazon Web Services has paired up with Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) and Google with Solana ( SOL-USD ). Why are all these brands implementing Web3 plans? To improve their user experience and customer relationships, attract Gen-Z digital natives, and unlock alternative sources of revenue, among other reasons. Amid continued positive momentum in 2023, we expect more big brands to follow their lead and develop their own blockchain initiatives. 2. Ethereum Dominates, But Must Scale to Service Mass Adoption With 60% of decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) and 85% of NFT transaction volume, Ethereum is the clear leader among smart contract platforms. However, should millions of people stampede to Web3, the Ethereum network could be overwhelmed and the price to transact on its blockchain could become prohibitively expensive. So, how can blockchains scale up? We see three possible approaches. Three Blockchain Types Monolithic blockchains like Solana offer execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability all in one. Apps are built directly on top of the blockchain. But this can create scalability issues — the so-called blockchain trilemma — if the blockchain is both decentralized and highly secure. Modular blockchains like Ethereum 2.0 separate the execution, settlement and consensus, and data availability layers. “Layer 2s,” in the form of sidechains and rollups, help the original “Layer 1” blockchain scale without sacrificing decentralization or security. Applications are built on top of both Layer 1s and Layer 2s. Universes of interconnected blockchains like Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) are ecosystems with relatively secure inter-blockchain communication protocols, so different blockchains can exchange data and value between them. Due to the Lindy effect and the current dominance of Ethereum and its Layer 2s in new project launches, we anticipate modular blockchains to prevail. Though smaller positions in the other blockchain-scaling models, especially those with solid tokenomics and attractive relative valuations, may be a good hedge. 3. Tokenization Will Bring Various Exogenous Assets On-Chain Tokenization creates digital representations of various assets, from securities and funds to artwork and other collectibles, and is among the most important current Web3 narratives. The benefits of tokenizing assets explain why this theme is gaining such traction. The Benefits of Tokenization TokenizedSecurities TokenizedFunds Tokenized RealEstate, Art, andOther Collectibles BetterAccessibility Opens upsecurities marketsto a global poolof investors Makes institutionalprivate market strategiesmore accessible toindividual investorswith lower investmentminimums, improvedonboarding, andpotentially better liquidity Allows forfractionalization BetterEfficiency Increased liquidity,faster settlement,and lower costs Transforms relativelyliquid resourcesinto easily tradable goods The opportunity is massive. According to HSBC estimates , tokenized market volume will reach $24 trillion by 2027. How is this theme expressed in liquid token portfolios or non-fungible assets (NFAs)? Through smart contract platforms that provide the public blockchain and settlement infrastructure for these tokenized assets. KKR ( KKR ) tokenized its health care fund and Hamilton Lane its $2.1B flagship fund through Avalanche and Polygon, respectively. Decentralized applications (DApps) — Maker ( MKR-USD ), Centrifuge, Maple Finance, and Ondo Finance, for example — help users bridge real world assets (RWAs) to DeFi. 4. RWAs Can Help Counter DeFi’s Circularity DeFi’s “ self-reference ” has been a perceived shortcoming of the sector. For example, a DeFi user may take out a loan on lending protocol Aave ( AAVE-USD ) for leveraged trading of assets on the Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) decentralized exchange. We are bullish on opportunities that break this circularity problem by integrating outside information and “real world” use cases onto closed blockchain networks. There are many recent examples of non crypto-native businesses turning to DeFi. Through the lending protocol Maker, users can borrow their DAI stablecoins by locking collateral in Maker’s smart contracts. Built on Ethereum, Maker determines which collateral they accept as well as the collateralization ratios for each collateral type. Most collateral on Maker today is in the form of stablecoins, like USD Coins (USDCs) pegged to the US dollar, but RWAs are a fast-growing segment. At the beginning of Q4 2022, RWAs made up only 2% of the collateral on Maker, but that has grown to 13%, and RWA income currently accounts for over half of Maker’s revenue . Indeed, RWA collateral now includes US Treasury bonds through MIP65, loans from Huntingdon Valley Bank in Pennsylvania , and investment grade asset-backed securities through BlockTower Capital . RWA Activity Built on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, Maple Finance is another lending protocol that provides infrastructure for credit experts to run on-chain lending businesses. Earlier this year, it announced a $100 million receivables financing pool , enabling Intero Capital Solutions to borrow USDC against receivables and investors to lend their USDC for a 10% targeted yield . 5. NFTs: The Underappreciated Upside NFT activity boomed in 2021 with sales volume and unique buyers growing 41,784% and 6,959%, respectively, according to CryptoSlam . In 2023, NFT activity is on the upswing again thanks to two important events: the disruptive launch of Blur , an Ethereum NFT marketplace, and the explosive popularity of bitcoin ordinals , through which users can inscribe text, images, and other data on satoshis, or smaller bitcoin units. NFT Activity The 2021 boom recalls that of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017 and serves as a DeFI proof of concept. “Profile picture” NFTs of cartoon apes and pixelated punks notwithstanding, we believe a much larger digital collectible market spans the following industries: Gaming : Through NFTs, gamers can more fully own their in-game land, avatars, and other assets they have earned and invested in. Gaming NFTs could be sold, exchanged, and moved among different metaverses so that users can transport their digital assets from Game A to Game B rather than starting from scratch. Music : Fans could invest in and support their favorite musical artists through NFTs. For example, they could purchase a share of an artist’s song that entitles them to royalty rights whenever that song is played on streaming services. NFTs could also unlock real-world experiences for fans, such as early access to new track releases or meet-and-greets with the artist. Ticketing : NFTs also have applications in the live events industry. Through Ticketmaster’s partnership with the blockchain Flow (FLOW-USD), event organizers can now issue NFTs around live shows. Similar to music NFTs, these applications could enhance fans’ experiences and serve as digital collectibles. Ticketmaster’s website now features a wallet and NFT marketplace so that collectors can share and trade. Social Media : The centralized Web2 social media giants profit from content that they do not create. Because of social media’s current ad-driven business model, actual content creators go underpaid or are not paid at all. By storing their social media on a public blockchain through NFTs that represent profiles, likes, comments, and other activity, content creators can, through social tipping, secondary marketplaces for profiles, and other concepts, better capture value for their work. Domain Names in Web3, such as runa.eth, resemble their Web2 counterparts like runa.com: They can serve as websites and email addresses. These domain names are technically represented as NFTs on blockchains and offer additional use cases — for data storage, for example, so users can then give applications permission to access certain information. In this way, users can carry their data around the web via NFTs and have fuller possession of their online identity. To be sure, the digital asset space is still early in its development. While no longer in its infancy, it is far from a mature market. As such, it remains both highly speculative and ripe with potential. That is why it is worth keeping an eye on — and approaching with caution.

42420360,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVM5,1684910637,'Chinese Ethereum’ Conflux Draws Spotlight as Hong Kong Welcomes Retail Traders,"Tokens of Conflux Network (CFX) – an Asia-focused blockchain that some have dubbed the “Chinese Ethereum” – saw a spike in prices earlier amid increased attention from traders after Hong Kong decided to let retail investors trade crypto, which some say could fuel an influx of capital from Chinese investors.  The price of the CFX token initially soared after the announcement was made Tuesday, though that rally mostly faded. CFX rose to as high as 33 cents from the weekend’s 29 cents mark, before early buyers likely took profits and pushed prices down to 30 cents as of Wednesday morning.  Conflux is a speedy and cheap blockchain that claims to be the only regulatory-compliant public blockchain in China. In the region, Conflux has collaborated with global brands and government entities on blockchain and metaverse initiatives, including the city of Shanghai, McDonald's China and Oreos.  Conflux previously said it will build blockchain-based SIM cards in partnership with China Telecom, the second-largest wireless carrier in China with an estimated 390 million subscribers.  Despite the price surge, and numerous announcements regarding industry cooperation, on-chain data shows that transaction counts still haven't passed highs set last fall, suggesting that the protocol hasn't built out a sizeable userbase quite yet.  Conflux Network CTO Ming Wu told CoinDesk in March that the protocol aimed to “take the leading role to help Hong Kong and mainland China to carry out their expansions in the Web3 area.”  The first BSIM pilot program in Hong Kong is expected later this year, with plans for similar pilots in key mainland China locations such as Shanghai.  Such a backdrop has led prominent Crypto Twitter community members to start assigning Conflux the “Chinese Ethereum” label, leading to a brisk rise in valuation in the past several months.  Since the start of this year, Conflux’s market capitalization has risen from $46 million to nearly $650 million now – making CFX one of the best-performing tokens.  Some Asia-focused investors suggest Conflux’s indirect links to the Chinese market could position CFX as a proxy bet on the broader Asian market.  “Conflux Network’s partnership with state-backed telecom provider China Telecom is a clear bullish signal on the network retaining highly productive ties with influential organizations,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of Taiwan-based crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Plus, today we heard good news from Hong Kong’s SFC that retail crypto trading will be permitted under regulatory supervision. While those rules are restricted to BTC and ETH for now, this series of bullish news for the Greater China region work highly in Conflux’s favor,” Mei added.",POSITIVE,ETH | CFX,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | CFX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/chinese-ethereum-conflux-draws-spotlight-as-hong-kong-welcomes-retail-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd8110acc4339d92f2fb33792b5b6de9070a4723-1439x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420352,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUpVDp,1684889542,First Mover Asia: Crypto’s Narrative of This Season Is No Narrative at All,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto's narrative this year has varied so widely that one dominant thread is difficult to pin down. BTC was hovering comfortably above $27K.  Insights: Crypto in Hong Kong won't resemble what it looked like in previously, if the government passes proposed crypto exchange rules.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,204.65 +14.6 ▲ 1.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,139 +235.9 ▲ 0.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,849 +27.9 ▲ 1.5% S&P 500 daily close  4,145.58 −47.0 ▼ 1.1% Gold  $1,978 +3.4 ▲ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.7% ▼ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Rises Slightly and Waits  Good morning,  Bitcoin is starting the trading day in East Asia up 0.9% to $27,139, while ether is up 1.5% to $1,849.  Are we in a meme coin season? A hedge against risk season? Or a risk asset season?  Tough to tell these days.  One day it seems like bitcoin and ether are making a slow and steady push upwards, then the next memecoin comes along and shoots into the stratosphere. On other days it seems like there’s a flight to quality. Consider the data point of staked ether hitting an all-time high.  Since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade on April 12, the amount of staked ether has surged, CoinDesk recently reported, with 4.4 million more coins deposited for staking.  All this is despite over a month's wait to become a network validator, driven by large ether holders seeking passive income, and anticipated deflationary forces that may increase ether's price, making the 4-5% annual yield an attractive proposition.  “With Ethereum’s Shanghai over and investors nursing memecoin hangovers, the crypto market is ‘sans narrative,’ Charmyn Ho, head of crypto insights at Bybit, wrote in a note to CoinDesk.  Ho writes that the imminent Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, which boosts transaction throughput via a process called proto-danksharding, could favor Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and promising new entrants like Mantle, possibly ushering an ""L2 season,"" while the altcoin market drifts towards Bitcoin amid a fluctuating yield curve.  But right now, the narrative is tricky to pin down.  “With most coins struggling to break their 20-week moving averages, it seems premature to talk of an incoming ‘altseason’ or ‘memeseason’,” Ho said. “Indeed, we are still seeing capital move the opposite way – from altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, most altcoins are falling on their BTC pairs.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +1.5% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH +1.4% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA +1.4% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Decentraland MANA −0.9% Entertainment Chainlink LINK −0.8% Computing Dogecoin DOGE −0.7% Currency  Insights  New Hong Kong Rules Value TradFi Chops  A few months ago, crypto Twitterati thought that Hong Kong’s upcoming virtual asset rules would unlock a geyser of degen capital and jumpstart the China crypto narrative.  After all, Hong Kong was, at one time, the home of crypto’s growth story in its early days. Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Justin Sun, and many other crypto stakeholders as well as Initial Coin Offering (ICO) teams once called Hong Kong home as the city’s fast-paced and free-flowing markets on overdrive were a natural match for crypto.  It was hoped that all this would make Hong Kong’s crypto scene great again – bringing back the fast times of the past.  But the Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) latest draft of the guidelines that came out Tuesday afternoon Hong Kong time discouraged the idea.  Currently, most of the virtual asset trading platforms accessible to the public are not regulated by the SFC, and the SFC hasn’t announced a list of license applicants.  Taking a glimpse at this draft, which plays a part of the consultation process, the SFC is beating down the idea that crypto in 2023’s Hong Kong is going to be like anything of the past.  Retail Can Trade – After Onboarding  Yes, retail investors will be able to trade crypto in Hong Kong. But not every retail investor will be able to trade crypto in Hong Kong.  The exact criteria of what constitutes an onboarding process hasn’t been precisely defined, but the SFC says that the automatic trading nature of virtual assets “necessitates strict requirements”.  Platform operators must ensure the suitability of retail clients through comprehensive onboarding processes, the SFC says, including risk tolerance assessment and a holistic evaluation of an investor's understanding of virtual assets based on their education, work, and prior trading experience.  Platforms will be required to establish limits on the size of positions, and the SFC says that exact exposure limit will be determined based on a know-your-client process the exchange conducts.  TradFi Licenses Prioritized  On top of these exchanges, just like any other traditional financial institution in Hong Kong, will be two key positions: the Responsible Officer and the Licensed Representative.  These individuals will generally have to fit within the criteria the SFC uses for these roles in the TradFi space. They must have a combination of relevant degrees (though does such a thing exist for crypto?), management experience and local equivalents to FINRA licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute.  It’s understood that many exchanges intending to apply for licenses in Hong Kong, such as Binance, have begun to heavily hire ex-TradFi types who hold these licenses – crypto knowledge be damned.  Exchanges Must Provide Financial Disclosures  The new regulations mandate crypto exchanges to maintain a minimum of HKD 5,000,000 ($640,000) in capital at all times and submit monthly financial reports to the SFC, which include a summary of both assets (in particular where and when they are deposited) as well as liabilities such as bank loans or other credit facilities.  Post-FTX, many exchanges are publishing Proof of Reserves, a form of on-chain audit to build confidence in their liquidity. However, these have been criticized for lacking one key metric – liabilities. It looks like this requirement from the SFC will address this.  Not Every Token Can Be Listed; Retail Won’t Have Stablecoins  Part of the SFC’s proposed rules is what effectively amounts to a 12-month cooling-off period between the launch of a token and when it's able to be listed on regulated exchanges.  “While a 12-month requirement may not have prevented the recent collapses of some tokens, this requirement aims to reduce the risk of reasonably hard-to-detect fraud as well as the possible impact on the price of a token of the marketing efforts leading up to its initial offering,” the SFC writes.  Listed tokens must also have a smart contract audit completed by an independent assessor. As well, tokens must be large-cap virtual assets included in at least two acceptable indices issued by two independent index providers.  However, the SFC said that it doesn’t feel it would be “appropriate” to publish a list of virtual assets eligible for retail trading.  Perhaps the most controversial part of this would be the ban on stablecoins for retail traders, as the SFC finds them unsuitable for retail traders due to the propensity for runs and the lack of regulation.  Retail traders will only get access to stablecoins once local regulations for the asset class are in place.  Custodians Excluded  FTX customers in Japan live in something of a parallel universe to their peers elsewhere.  Because rules in Japan – implemented post-Mt. Gox – require exchanges that operate in the company to use third-party custodians that segregate funds, Japanese customers have been able to withdraw crypto and fiat from FTX Japan since early February.  But this won’t be the case in Hong Kong.  The SFC says that since there is no regulatory regime for custodians of virtual assets, allowing that would hinder their supervision and enforcement.  This could be considered counterintuitive, since many crypto custodians already exist in Hong Kong, like Hex Trust. Alessio Quaglini, the CEO of Hex Trust, has long called for specific custodian rules for digital assets, but it looks like that request has met deafening silence.
