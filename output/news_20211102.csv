42394385,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckCN,1635878111,Carbon Offsets Are a Distraction for Crypto,"BitMEX, the Seychelles-based derivatives exchange, is looking to mitigate its environmental footprint by purchasing $100,000 worth of carbon credits. Those credits represent 7,110 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, the amount BitMEX figures it’s on the line for through its bitcoin-based business.  It’s a fine effort especially because, to my knowledge, no one is criticizing BitMEX for its energy draw. The move, which would offset BitMEX’s share of bitcoin transactions and its corporate servers, would make it one of the first “carbon neutral” crypto exchanges, it said in a blog post. (Rival derivatives platform FTX has made a similar pledge.)  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There is a hitch: Carbon credits don’t work as advertised, being frequently fraudulent and ineffective. While BitMEX’s “net zero” pledge is laudable, it’s following a familiar corporate playbook of shuffling deckchairs on a sinking ship.  As I write, more than 130 heads of state and thousands of attendees are gathered in Glasgow, Scotland, for a two-week-long conference dedicated to averting dangerous climate change.  As of February 2020, nearly a quarter of all Fortune 500 companies had signed pledges to go carbon neutral by 2030. And carbon offsets are a large part of this trend to go “green.” A generic term for a wide range of assets and activities, offsets are essentially promises to reduce environmental degradation in one area to compensate for environmental degradation elsewhere. A company can make a green-sounding pledge to go “carbon neutral” by buying credits from some other company that has polluted less that year.  In short: Offsets allow normal economic activity to continue apace. They operate on the understanding that X amount of emissions will be released no matter what, and that heavy polluters can be made better if other companies pollute less. A new survey from Ecosystem Marketplace found that the voluntary carbon offset market is on track to cross $1 billion for the first time, as all-time market value hits $6.7 billion. Guilt is distributed.  “Offsetting essentially means for every ton we remove, we emit a ton somewhere else,” Kate Dooley, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne who studies the impact of carbon accounting, said in a recent interview. “We have no space now for continued carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions need to go to zero within a few decades, and we need removals on top of that to reduce atmospheric concentrations.”  Offsetting is financialization at its worst: reducing activism to arbitrary economic activity. While carbon credits can and do help fund renewable efforts – typically reforestation, but also solar fields and the like – those efforts may be less than advertised. Greenpeace notes that carbon sinks have a short shelf life: Once a forest burns, or is logged, or dies naturally the carbon it traps is re-released.  The only solution, real-hardcore climate activists admit, is to reduce consumption and the amount of carbon released into the environment.  It’s funny, because BitMEX researchers would likely agree with all this. In their report, they note the limited applicability of carbon offsets. The crypto industry should confront its problems and avoid “hollow promises and vague ESG pledges,” the BitMEX researchers said.  Crypto solutions  Crypto has a target on its back precisely because of its energy use. Bitcoin has no choice but to burn vast amounts of energy to secure its network. It transforms a shared commodity – electricity – into a scarce digital asset, a money backed by its supporters, not a state, through “proof-of-work.” You can argue (and I would disagree) that this is literally wasted energy, but you can’t really stop it because that’s the point of being decentralized.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining After the China Ban: US Dominance Is Set to Continue  There’s also controversy around how to measure Bitcoin’s energy footprint. Although the network is publicly audible, no one can guarantee what is powering it. It’s arguable that bitcoin is a greener money than others, because miners are incentivized to find cheap power sources (renewables are often subsidized or naturally cheaper) or make use of “stranded” energy (like from gas flares).  BitMEX took a somewhat heterodox approach to measuring bitcoin’s carbon footprint, deciding to put a kilowatt figure on transaction volume. (Many industry activists have said you cannot compare Bitcoin, a base layer monetary network, to Visa, a payments rail, when it comes to transactions and energy use; Visa, by transaction count, has a far less intensive energy draw.)  BitMEX estimated that every $1 spent on BTC transaction fees can incentivize up to 0.001 tons of carbon emissions. So “assuming a $50 per ton cost of carbon, for every $1 spent on transaction fees, [an exchange] would need to spend 5 cents offsetting the carbon costs, 5%,” BitMEX wrote. That money is better spent elsewhere.  BitMEX notes its consumption model is “imperfect” and “controversial.” I’d argue it’s hardly a solution. But there is still hope. Bitcoin, and crypto generally, can incentivize investments in renewable energy. We’ve already built network scaling solutions like SegWit, transaction batching and the Lightning Network that reduce Bitcoin’s footprint.  There are also crypto-based systems for tracking or trading carbon credits, with the idea that blockchain could make these markets less opaque and more liquid. These are notable efforts but are not true solutions. If crypto companies want to make a difference, they ought to put their outsized profits in building actual infrastructure: propagating scaling layers, building out solar and wind farms, funding carbon trapping research. Real solarpunk stuff, not more financialization.  Crypto can work quietly on solutions to fix the climate crisis. We’re not responsible for the worst of what’s to come. But this is an industry that’s unafraid to experiment and built from the ground up. It’s totally conceivable Bitcoin goes carbon neutral in the not-too-distant future (social pressure is good for that).  But for that to happen, we have to admit that carbon credits are little more than a distraction.

This is particularly the case among cryptocurrency traders, who are moving away from Ethereum en-masse to platforms like Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain. This is owed to their dramatically lower fees and improved speed over Ethereum, as well as the rapid development of their token ecosystems — and the opportunities this brings. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have emerged as the simplest way to gain exposure to these new ecosystems, allowing traders to access the most promising tokens at an early stage without waiting for centralized exchange listings. Here, we take a look at three of the most promising cross-chain ecosystems, and the DEXs that act as their primary entry points.

42396662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4bnW,1635874202,ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share Valuation,"A group of former employees and shareholders of Ethereum development firm ConsenSys are alleging ConsenSys AG, led by billionaire Joseph Lubin, improperly valued key assets in its portfolio prior to an asset transfer involving banking giant JPMorgan.  According to documents seen by CoinDesk, the group intends to request that a Swiss court review an asset transfer between ConsenSys AG and ConsenSys Inc., with a particular focus on Web 3 wallet MetaMask and blockchain infrastructure product Infura, two of the most foundational pillars of the present-day Ethereum ecosystem.  A debt burden – a $39 million personal loan founder Joseph Lubin made to ConsenSys AG (also known as Mesh) – was also reportedly swapped with the assets.  “We are aware of a small single-digit percentage of shareholders who are disgruntled with ConsenSys Mesh with respect to the ConsenSys Software Inc. transaction,” a ConsenSys spokesperson said in a statement to CoinDesk. “We believe that these shareholders are confused on a number of key factual points, and we have been working to share information with them that we think will further clarify the record and give them a greater understanding of matters they do not yet accurately understand.”  The incipient legal action comes as ConsenSys looks to re-enter “growth mode,” having formed partnerships with major banking entities such as JPMorgan and Mastercard in recent months.  Read more: Ethereum Hub ConsenSys Raises $65M From JPMorgan, Mastercard, UBS, Others  As ether, the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, surges to new highs, ConsenSys has renewed its push for “Enterprise Ethereum” integrations with major corporations, albeit with a decentralized finance (DeFi) twist different from similar efforts in 2018.  Arthur Falls, a former employee pushing for the court review of asset valuations, told CoinDesk that in addition to the shareholder value differences at stake, there’s a matter of clashing ideologies between Ethereum’s peer-to-peer ethos and its key infrastructure now partially controlled by Wall Street middlemen, including JPMorgan, which, as part of the transaction at play, now owns 10% of ConsenSys Software Inc.  “ConsenSys AG developed the portal through which most people interact with Ethereum, which is MetaMask, and the way most software interacts with Ethereum, which is Infura,” Falls said in an interview. “Now that it’s in the hands of JPMorgan, UBS and Mastercard, how are those custodians going to feel about decentralization?”  Changing entities  At the core of the desired court review is the exchange of assets between two legal entities: Swiss company ConsenSys AG and American company ConsenSys Software Inc.  According to documents viewed by CoinDesk, a valuation by accounting firm PwC dated July 16, 2020, priced ConsenSys AG assets including Infura, MetaMask, Truffle, PegaSys, CoDeFi, as well as ConsenSys subsidiaries in France, the U.K., Ireland, Australia and Hong Kong, at a total valuation of $46.6 million.  The entirety of ConsenSys AG was valued at $332.3 million by a separate firm in June 2019, per documents viewed by CoinDesk.  At issue is which valuation was then used in a transfer of the listed assets from ConsenSys AG to ConsenSys Software Inc. in exchange for 10% of ConsenSys Software’s shares, as well as the transfer of a $39 million loan Lubin had previously made to ConsenSys AG to ConsenSys Software Inc.  As part of the asset transfer, JPMorgan also acquired 10% of ConsenSys Software Inc. in exchange for its Quorum blockchain business, documents show.  “Mesh has a long history of spinning out projects successfully to maximize value for our shareholders, with contemporaneous benefit to our broader Web 3.0 vision and strategy. The ConsenSys Software Inc. transaction is no different,” a spokesperson said of the asset exchange.  Read more: ConsenSys Acquires JPMorgan’s Quorum Blockchain  ConsenSys Software Inc. is now looking to raise $250 million at a $3 billion valuation, sources told CoinDesk in October. The figure is derived in large part from the success of MetaMask’s Swaps feature, which has driven over $9 billion in trade volume and was launched just three months after PwC’s valuation put a mere $4.4 million price tag on the wallet interface.  “It is undeniable that the business fundamentals and operating environment are entirely different today than at the time of transaction,” the ConsenSys spokesperson said of the valuation. “We are grateful that after many years of hard work the company and the ecosystem are now doing very well and crossing the chasm into mainstream adoption.”  Valuation battles  Falls says he intends to request that a Swiss court evaluate whether ConsenSys AG’s assets were properly valued at the time of the sale.  According to Falls, the legal action has been six months in the works. Other shareholders in the group seeking judicial review have asked to inspect certain documents, including the ConsenSys AG board resolution to sell the assets, and have been asking Consensys AG for a full list of its board members. Falls said both asks have been pushed back.  “It’s just been delay after delay after delay, and so we said, ‘To hell with it, we’re going to court,’” Falls said.  A spokesperson for ConsenSys noted that a meeting is scheduled for November, when the company will explain the transaction in greater detail.  A lawyer familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified noted that PwC conducted its valuation using the Swiss Practitioner Method, which uses a weighted combination of discounted cash flow and asset recreation cost to arrive at a valuation.  Read more: ConsenSys Holds Funding Round Talks With $3B Valuation  “The problem is that a startup like ConsenSys often has intangible assets, and they don’t generate cashflows or profits, so it results in an incredibly low valuation,” the lawyer said, querying whether such valuation is appropriate when used for valuations seen in mergers and acquisition deals, such as the type ConsenSys Software Inc. engaged in with JPMorgan and Quorum.  Per Falls, ConsenSys AG minority shareholders have repeatedly requested to have an independent special audit, but the requests were reportedly voted down.  The former employees and shareholders say they expect to make their initial filings in court in December.  High stakes  Lubin was recently crowned Ethereum’s “Wall Street whisperer,” and is increasingly seen as having significant influence over how major enterprises get involved with blockchain technology.  A funding round for ConsenSys in April included major entities like UBS, Mastercard, JPMorgan – a sign that ConsenSys AG’s former products could be used for major banking applications.  “These were chosen partners that tell us the future of these products,” says Falls.  Read more: MetaMask Hit 10M Monthly User Mark in July With Asia Leading Growth  Falls says he believes both MetaMask and Infura – what he calls “the crown jewels” of ConsenSys – could have been decentralized and tokenized, and that their projected use is “completely anathema” to the peer-to-peer principles of the space.  Meanwhile, a number of teams are looking to bring “institutional DeFi” – with its known counterparties and compliant custody arrangements – to the marketplace.  “Forget about the shareholders for a minute,” Falls said. “Think about the consequences of the change in the influence over these infrastructure pieces.”  Update (Nov. 2, 21:14 UTC): Adds “AG” to headline for clarity.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bda74a2d0308d919504f32b219ab488ddda918b-3556x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shares of MSTR gain 12.6% intra-day, reaching April levels as bitcoin (BTC-USD) bounces 4% to $64.1K. Saylor sees bitcoin (BTC-USD) as the strongest digital asset, but most cryptos will fail; he likens BTC to a primary reserve asset.

Thiel expressed that the price of bitcoin hitting $60,000 is an indicator of this crisis. Mainly, Thiel says, this has been due to the staggering inflation rates that the country has been experiencing following the pandemic. The Fed had been accused of printing money recklessly during this time without measures in place to affect the inflation it triggered and as such, has pushed investors to more unconventional investment options to hedge for this inflation. Related Reading | Goldman Sachs Analysts Shoot For Ethereum At $8,000 With Expected 80% Rally This lines up with general sentiment towards the financial markets.

Shares of crypto miners, which have the highest correlation to the bitcoin price, started November on a bullish tone, tracking gains in the price of the largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin climbed above $64,000 on Nov. 2, after exiting October near $60,000 levels. Ether, the native token of Ethereum, also rallied to an all-time-high above $4,500.  Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate, a measure of mining activity, dropped to about 153 exahashes per second (EH/s) from as high as 185 EH/s in October, according to data analytics firm Glassnode. Generally, if the network hashrate declines while prices are rallying, miners make more profit from mining bitcoin.  With bitcoin’s price climb since the start of the month and the hashrate declining about 18% over the last seven days, bitcoin economics remain “near highs,” Lucas Pipes, an analyst at B Riley, wrote in a research note.  To put the crypto miners’ profitability into context, DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler estimated in a recent research note that for miners such as Marathon Digital, the gross margin, or profit after operating costs, will be about 89.6% in 2021 and 90.8% in 2022.  Bitfarms’s stock climbed 12% on Tuesday, after achieving record high bitcoin mining power in October. Shares of Marathon Digital rose 11%, as did Hive Mining.

Apart from enabling the users to earn staking rewards, Trusted Node ensures that they are not starved of liquidity by issuing synthetic tokens representing their stake. With the value of these synthetic tokens pegged to that of the actual asset staked by the user, they can conveniently use it to participate in liquidity pools and invest in yield generating opportunities.

If you want the really brief version, the report essentially says:  Stablecoins pose a number of potential risks to consumers, the crypto market and financial stability in the “real economy.”  Stablecoins also have the potential to become a key tool for payments.  Congress should pass a law requiring stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions.  If Congress doesn’t take action, federal regulators might seek to leverage existing authorities to oversee stablecoin issuers instead.  Rather than give the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission specific oversight over stablecoins, the regulators working on the report recommended that Congress take action. If Congress doesn’t take action, the report suggested that federal regulators might just do their own thing.  Still, there’s a few questions about the actual implementation of these recommendations. Chief among them is whether Congress will actually act. But the group’s warning that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) or federal regulators might have to take action in the wake of congressional inaction may be a nudge to Congress that lawmakers should do something sooner rather than later.  Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told CoinDesk that “there have been discussions” with members of Congress about how to regulate digital assets.  “Both sides of Congress have been soliciting views about what’s the appropriate framework for regulating digital assets and stablecoins. And the administration is leading some work on digital assets and other crypto assets,” she said. “They’ve been open to discussions.”  Assuming Congress does pass such a bill, we’d have to see how exactly federal agencies would implement the new requirements. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is evaluating how to provide deposit insurance for stablecoins but it does not appear that we’ll see anything in the immediate term. If the legislation doesn’t force the FDIC to finalize its stablecoin insurance plan, we might see a scenario where stablecoin issuers are bound to secure insurance cover that doesn’t exist.  While the report restricted itself to stablecoins and did not address decentralized finance (DeFi was mentioned, but regulations for DeFi weren’t discussed), other types of cryptocurrencies or businesses that aren’t stablecoin issuers or custodial wallet providers, any regulations would naturally still affect the broader crypto sector.  Regulating stablecoin issuers would restrict which stablecoins users can transact with, which could have a major impact on the broader trading atmosphere.  Regulatory responses  My inbox pretty much blew up with unsolicited responses to the report. Here’s what the regulators are officially saying.  In a statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said stablecoins could support payment options.  “Treasury and the agencies involved in this report look forward to working with Members of Congress from both parties on this issue,” she said. “While Congress considers action, regulators will continue to operate within their mandates to address the risks of these assets.”  Michael Hsu, the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, said stablecoins need supervision “to grow and evolve safely.”  Hsu pointed to the recent growth of the stablecoin market in his statement.  “The interagency paper identifies the risk of stablecoin runs as the top concern. For the OCC, this hits close to home. The agency was created 158 years ago in response to the instability of the financial system, which was prone to frequent bank runs,” Hsu said.  “There are some interesting similarities between the bank notes of that time and the stablecoins of today. Just as the creation of the OCC helped address the risk of bank runs then, we stand ready to work with our interagency partners to ensure the safe and sound integration of stablecoins into the financial system and mitigate the risk of stablecoin runs today and into the future.”  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said the report pointed out the risks inherent in stablecoins.  “We must work to ensure that any new financial technologies are subject to all of the laws and regulations that protect investors, consumers and markets, and that they compete on a level playing field with traditional financial institutions. I look forward to working with Secretary Yellen and financial regulators to foster responsible innovation in the financial system,” he said in a statement.  His Republican counterpart, Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), emphasized that Congress should be responsible for defining regulatory authority over stablecoins.  “While Congress works on thoughtful legislation, I hope the administration will resist the urge to stretch existing laws in an effort to expand its regulatory authority. Digital assets have the potential to be as revolutionary as the internet. It’s important lawmakers and regulators alike work to continue America’s longstanding tradition of fostering technological innovation, not stifling it,” he said.  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), also on the Banking Committee, expressed concerns about the depository institution requirement proposed in the report. Only allowing these types of institutions to issue stablecoins might benefit established firms like banks, she said.  “There are other, safer ways of achieving the same objectives. For example, we could require 100% of stablecoin reserves to be maintained off-balance sheet, or require stablecoin reserves to be maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank, which is, by definition, risk-free. We already have a case study in this – Wyoming’s special purpose depository institutions are already doing this,” she said.  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra weighed in, noting that while his agency wasn’t part of the group that issued the report, it will continue evaluating stablecoins as part of its push to examine tech company forays into finance.  Stablecoins used in payments may fall into the CFPB’s remit as well.  “Given the rapid growth in stablecoins, we will closely engage with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to determine whether to initiate designation proceedings and ascertain whether certain nonbank stablecoin-related activities or entities are systemically important,” he said.  John Ryan, the president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, stressed the role of state regulators in overseeing crypto entities in a statement. The group was not involved in the development of the report.  “As we work with our federal counterparts on solutions, state regulators remain committed to ensuring sound financial regulation that protects consumers and supports an innovative and diverse financial services ecosystem,” the statement said.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam said his agency is ready to become the chief regulator for cryptocurrencies, should Congress choose to expand its authority, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee.

The move comes at a time when the crypto industry is facing heightened scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and around the world.  Wetjen will be responsible for FTX US’s communications with U.S. regulatory and legislative bodies, such as the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various House and Senate Committees. He will also be advising FTX US on its compliance standards and reporting operations.  Prior to joining FTX US, Wetjen served as a commissioner of the CFTC from 2011 to 2015 and was its acting chairman from January to June of 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. Most recently, Wetjen was the CEO of crypto exchange MIAX Futures, a position he held since the beginning of 2020.  Wetjen also served as a member of the board of directors of LedgerX, a regulated futures exchange that was recently acquired by FTX US and rebranded as FTX US Derivatives. The deal means the exchange can move to offer crypto futures, swaps and options to U.S. retail traders.  Wetjen will continue to serve on the board of directors of FTX US Derivatives, according to the company.  “I look forward to helping FTX US continue expanding its product offerings in that same manner, while also advancing the regulatory conversation of the crypto landscape on behalf of FTX US,” Wetjen said in a statement.

42411150,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7klb,1635850800,Europe’s MiCA Crypto Rules Are Coming Soon. Here’s Why They Matter,"It’s often said that financial regulators are always fighting the last war. The European Union’s soon-to-be-ratified package of cryptocurrency regulations offers a telling example.  The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework devotes a full 26 of its 168 pages to a subcategory it calls “asset-referenced tokens.” These are a type of stablecoin, or cryptocurrency designed to hold its value, but unlike dollar-pegged stablecoins such as USD coin (USDC) or tether (USDT), asset-referenced tokens are backed by a basket of different fiat currencies, commodities or crypto assets. The most famous example has not been issued, and likely won’t be anytime soon.  That coin, of course, is the original vision of libra, Facebook’s proposed digital currency that provoked a global government backlash after its unveiling in 2019. The project was later renamed diem, and the consortium behind it watered down the design to a simple dollar-backed stablecoin.  “It’s quite obvious and apparent that the whole proposal was drafted with the libra project in mind,” said Patrick Hansen, a contributor for RegTrax, Stanford University’s working database on fintech policy.  Meanwhile, MiCA is mum about the torrid decentralized finance (DeFi) market, where global investment has swelled 360% since September 2020 (the month the European Commission introduced the proposed framework) to $96 billion as of Oct. 18 of this year.  Despite being dated on arrival, the proposed framework would dramatically simplify expansion for crypto businesses throughout the 27-nation EU. Once a crypto firm is licensed in one EU member state, under MiCA, that license would become “passportable,” meaning the firm could set up in another EU nation without having to obtain approval or additional licenses from the local government.  For many market participants, that’s good enough.  “If there would be an overarching regulation from the EU, that would help a lot. Because then you would have one license to rule them all,” said Eric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, a Vienna-based cryptocurrency startup which was recently valued at $4.1 billion.  Introduced in September 2020 by the European Commission, the EU executive branch responsible for proposing and enforcing laws, the MiCA framework is one part of a larger Digital Finance strategy that aims to adapt Europe for the digital age.  And it’s notably different from the regulatory efforts undertaken by other jurisdictions.  For instance, the U.S. has introduced numerous bills in the last few years that directly affect the crypto space, from tax requirements to securities law, while different states may have their own regulatory requirements. However, the country has no real comprehensive equivalent to the EU’s MiCA. Its most comprehensive bill on crypto regulation was proposed in August. Meanwhile, China banned crypto trading and mining outright earlier this year, while working on its own government-issued digital currency.  Eva Kaili, a member of the European Parliament since 2014, and a proponent for innovation-friendly regulation of blockchain applications, said that the EU is trying something different with MiCA during an interview with CoinDesk.  “The nature of the European Union is different. We have 27 different member states with different legal and tax systems that are not harmonized. So we are trying to adopt a unique approach to policy making with this file,” she said.  MiCA encompasses cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether broadly, along with stablecoins. But as it is, the proposed framework would not apply to digital currencies issued by central banks (CBDCs) nor crypto assets such as security tokens that might qualify as financial instruments like securities, deposits, treasury bills or derivatives.  Even though the promise of a passportable license for crypto asset service providers sounds exciting for established crypto firms looking to set up in the region, industry players are also concerned about how MiCA will influence the digital asset market in the EU in other ways.  For instance, Martin Erhold, regulatory specialist at Bitpanda, said that even though legal certainty will likely attract institutional investment, overregulation could crowd out innovation and entrepreneurs. In addition to strict rules for crypto issuers, under MiCA, firms will have to register in the EU and bear the compliance costs or be banned, he said.  “Successful service providers will reap benefits of the larger EU single market and the market consolidation is expected. However, too high barriers to EU market entry may deter third-country service providers and issuers from entering the EU, risking decoupling EU from other innovative markets,” Erhold said in an email.  Then, there is the disproportionately heavy emphasis placed on stablecoin regulation in the proposal.  “Almost a third of the whole proposal is basically covering stablecoins and e-money tokens,” said Hansen, former head of blockchain at German technology trade association Bitkom and current lead of strategy and growth at Unstoppable Finance.  Hansen explained that the MiCA rules for stablecoin issuers might be particularly harsh, and that he is optimistic that the framework will be modified to make these rules less strict.  “Maybe regulators are probably more open to less stricter rules in the stablecoin market, but it remains to be seen,” Hansen said.  The MiCA proposal is slowly making its way through the bloc’s complex legislative process. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Economic and Social Committee have already published their opinions on the proposal. Currently, the European Council Working Party on Financial Services is reviewing the document.  Kaili said lawmakers expect EU parliament and council deliberations to wrap by early 2022, without any major changes to the current version of the file. She added that from that point onwards, the EU typically gives countries two years to implement new regulations.  The status quo  At the moment, EU countries have to issue their own regulatory requirements for crypto assets in accordance with some overarching guidelines.  According to Yana Afanasieva, head of regulatory affairs at bitFlyer Europe, the local arm of the Japanese crypto exchange, there were two forces of regulatory initiatives that compelled European countries in the last few years to implement regulations at the local level. One was the guidance for virtual asset service providers (VASP) published by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2019. The second was AMLD5, an anti-money laundering directive issued by the European Union which required VASPs to register with their local government. AMLD5 came into effect in 2020, and as with all EU directives, it laid out a goal that EU countries had to achieve, but left it up to individual countries to create and implement their own laws.  Given the freedom to go their own way, different countries took different approaches to regulating crypto. While Gibraltar and Malta created regimes for licensing or registration for VASPs, and turned it into an opportunity to attract new businesses, other countries did the bare minimum, Afanasieva said.  “So there is a range right now, and it creates, at this point of time, a lot of confusion for operators. They have to ask themselves, does this mean, if I want to operate in the EU, that I need to go and apply for 30 different registrations or can I still benefit from the EU treaty that introduced the free movement of goods and services?” Afanasieva said.  According to Erhold, despite having a substantial market size compared to the U.S. and East Asia, VASPs have to operate at a local level.  “And when this is fragmented to the extent that it is fragmented right now, it just does not help scale, and we’re a digital market, which is inherently cross-border,” Erhold said.  Bitpanda, which operates in 37 countries worldwide, has had to obtain some kind of government approval or licenses at the national level within the EU, including in Italy and France.  According to Dr. Simon Grieser, partner at the law firm of Reed Smith LLP, the main objective of MiCA is to level the playing field for crypto service providers so it’s clear who needs to be registered or licensed, and all market participants have to comply with the same framework.  “The other reason, of course, is that cryptocurrencies are a growing and very important econometric topic. And so, my understanding from discussions with regulators and other market participants is there is a need to protect customers, and make sure investments in such kinds of assets are protected under the supervision of competent authorities,” Grieser said.  What’s in MiCA?  MiCA broadly applies to crypto-assets which are defined as “digital representations of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology.”  The framework also defines three subcategories of crypto assets, starting with the asset-referenced token. An example of this is libra, the stablecoin proposed by Facebook in 2019: Libra was designed to be backed by a basket of currencies and facilitate global payments (though it has since been renamed diem and will be a dollar-backed stablecoin only.)  The second type of crypto-asset covered is the “e-money token,” which is a stablecoin pegged to the value of a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Examples of these include dollar-backed USDC and USDT. The third, is the “utility token,” which is intended to provide digital access to a good or service, and is only accepted by the issuer of that token, like the basic attention token (BAT) issued by privacy-focused web browser Brave.  “Issuers of these crypto-asset categories in the EU must, in the future, publish a white paper (if no exception applies) and send it in advance (20 days prior to the emission) for notification to their respective national financial supervisory authority, such as the BaFin in Germany. The supervisory authority can then prohibit the issuance of those tokens,” Hansen wrote in RegTrax.  Meanwhile, firms that provide any service related to the defined crypto assets, including and not limited to custody services, trading and currency exchange (between crypto-assets and to fiat currencies), must obtain approval from regulatory authorities in an EU country. Once local authorities have approved the firms according to EU regulations, they would then be able to extend operations to other EU countries without having to obtain additional licenses.  “The national bespoke regimes on crypto assets would no longer be applicable,” the MiCA document said.  According to Hansen, MiCA indicates nations that already have a robust licensing regime for VASPs will have an easier time meeting the new EU-wide requirements.  But compliance won’t be cheap.  An impact assessment by the EU Commission on MiCA estimated it would cost issuers between $4,500 to $87,000 per white paper depending on the “complexity of the regime” and how much legal advice is required. In crypto, a white paper is an investment prospectus and a roadmap, published well before a project releases any code. Usually it costs around $4,500 or more just to hire a writer to ink the white paper.  “The compliance costs on crypto-asset service providers is expected to be higher and will crucially depend on the type of services for which authorization is sought respectively,” the impact assessment said.  The application of the envisaged regime is estimated to give rise to one-off compliance costs between $3.2 million and $19 million, while ongoing compliance costs might cost up to $28 million, according to the assessment.  Hansen said there is a chance that high compliance costs for token issuers and entrepreneurs might force businesses looking to set up in Europe to consider going elsewhere.  “I guess not all the projects and teams out there want to bear those regulatory costs … So I could imagine a future where even projects and teams that are based in the EU, when it comes to the official launch, they might like to do that out of another jurisdiction,” Hansen said.  Although Afanasieva agrees that the costs might create some friction, consume time and resources, there is a greater concern.  “So the biggest fear for companies is not so much cost, but fear of losing customers because most crypto companies, they really want to grow… And when you have this environment where somebody will publish an article saying ‘everybody should leave Germany unless you have German custody’ or ‘everybody should do X, Y, Z,’ the biggest fear is that customers will get scared,” Afanasieva said.  But MiCA compliance rules are particularly harsh on stablecoin issuers.  Emphasis on stablecoins  The MiCA document explicitly states that it intends to govern stablecoin issuance in the EU, as confirmed by the fact that not one but two categories of crypto assets covered by the framework are different types of stablecoins.  In June 2019, social media giant Facebook revealed it was building its own multi-platform stablecoin libra. U.S. lawmakers swiftly ordered a stop to the project so they could examine the implications of the initiative. The Group of Seven (G7) nations also announced it was investigating the project. By July, Facebook admitted libra as envisioned may not become a reality and the plan was watered down. Last year, the project was rebranded as the Diem Association.  As proposed, MiCA lays out some standard requirements for both prospective and established stablecoin issuers. For instance, all stablecoin issuers are required to own and maintain capital funds equivalent to either €350,000 (around $400,000) or 2% of their total reserve assets – whichever is the larger sum.  But not all stablecoin issuers are created equal. The framework also lays out additional requirements for what it categorizes as ‘significant’ issuers: any issuer that passes a number of thresholds, including a market capitalization of at least €1 billion, and records at least 500,000 transactions per day, will be considered significant.  Significant stablecoin issuers, which include major global stablecoins like USDC and USDT, have a number of additional requirements to fulfill under MiCA, including maintaining capital funds equivalent to 3% of their reserve assets.  “Tether, for example, with currently approximately 25 billion US dollars backing its stablecoins, would have to hold at least 750 million(!) of [its] own funds,” Hansen wrote in RegTrax back in January. As of Oct. 18, the total supply of USDT is almost $72 billion, and it claims around 75% of its reserve assets are cash and cash equivalents.  Hansen says the requirements for significant stablecoin issuers seem harsh. MiCA kind of agrees. The framework says that a restriction on stablecoin issuance could potentially be justified given the risks to financial stability, monetary policy and sovereignty, but cautions against this option as it “would not be consistent with the objectives set at EU level to promote innovation in the financial sector.”  With the current developments in the stablecoin space, it is unlikely that the framework will change much in its approach to regulating these currencies. Earlier this year, USDT issuer Tether came under heavy scrutiny from regulators in the U.S. and the EU after it revealed that around half of its reserves were made up of unspecified commercial paper. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoenaed USDC issuer Circle as part of an ongoing investigation.  Hansen pointed out that 26 out of the 30 trading pairs with the highest trading volumes on leading crypto exchange Binance include a stablecoin, and the heavy restrictions MiCA might place on these assets could cripple EU competitiveness. But for Erhold, the benefit of clear rules of the road would trump immediate concerns over stablecoins.  “I mean, there’s a big ticket item that they’re discussing about the whole treatment of stablecoins and whatnot. But from our perspective, as intermediaries, as part of the already existing system, irrespective of any bigger stablecoins coming out, the most important thing is legal certainty,” Erhold said.  Demuth pointed out that MiCA will probably not come into effect before the end of 2023.  “So until then, everybody will make their own law. And that time period of two years, is not a long time for politics and laws. But for the fintech space, it is a decade. Until then, we have to keep the same system and talk to every regulator and get licenses individually everywhere,” Demuth said.",POSITIVE,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/02/unpacking-europes-looming-mica-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/513353da49668567708766e4af8f71aca5c797b7-5403x3499.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The credits will match the environmental footprint from both its bitcoin transactions and the servers powering the exchange, making it one of the first crypto exchanges to become fully carbon neutral, BitMEX said in the post.  BitMEX published the reasoning behind the conclusion in a separate post. The best way to approach carbon emissions for crypto exchanges is to figure out “how much electricity usage is incentivized per U.S. dollar spent on transaction fees,” and then calculate the carbon emissions based on that, it said.  The exchange then used what it called an “imperfect method” to compare the average electricity cost in kilowatt hours for bitcoin mining with the global average cost per kWh of electricity.  Based on global prices, it found that every $1 spent on transaction fees could “incentivize” up to 7.4 kWh of “typical electricity usage,” which translates to 1 kilogram of CO2 emissions.  This method should amend one proposed by FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in a May tweet, BitMEX said. Bankman-Fried estimated that $0.0026 is needed to offset $1 spent on bitcoin transaction fees.  FTX has also committed to being carbon neutral and said it will donate $1 million by the end of the year to “some of the world’s most effective carbon-offsetting organizations.”  Using BitMEX’s methodology, exchanges could spend 5 cents per U.S. dollar of bitcoin transaction fees to offset emissions, which the trading platform says is a “small drop in the ocean.” The actual cost would depend on the price of offsetting carbon.  For its carbon offsets BitMEX is working with Pachama, a company that remotely verifies reforestation projects through satellite imagery and artificial intelligence and then posts the offsets on a curated marketplace for enterprises. The exchange has picked reforestation projects in India, Peru, Brazil, Nicaragua and Colombia.  The crypto industry should confront its problems and avoid “hollow promises and vague ESG pledges,” BitMEX said.

42396666,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4bpU,1635847604,"This Diwali Season, Indians FOMO Over Shiba Inu","Diwali, the five-day Indian festival of lights, has arrived, with the most important occasion of “Lakshmi Pujan” – worship of the goddess of wealth and prosperity – falling on Nov. 4. The auspicious day is considered the best time to invest in financial assets and has scores of people purchasing gold and stocks each year.  This time, Indians also appear to be flocking to meme cryptocurrency shiba inu (SHIB), whose current market capitalization of $39.13 billion is bigger than the market value of Indian fast-moving consumer goods giant ITC, auto sector heavyweight Maruti Suzuki and one of the country’s top lenders, Axis Bank. According to local observers, the lure of making big money on a relatively small investment is drawing investors from all walks of life to SHIB.  “The SHIB FOMO [fear of missing out] is absolutely real,” said Keshav Aggarwal, a crypto investor and founder of Bitcoin Investors Group, a premium WhatsApp group for crypto traders, exchanges, and crypto project founders. “SHIB is the cheapest and the most hyped (marketed) coin available on Indian exchanges.”     At press time, SHIB was changing hands at rupee (₹) 0.005624 (US$0.00007026) on Binance-owned, Mumbai-based WazirX exchange. Meanwhile, its rival dogecoin was trading at ₹21 ($0.28) and bitcoin was priced at ₹4,871,529 ($65205).  According to International Monetary Fund estimates, India’s per capita income or the amount of money earned per person in inflation-adjusted terms during 2020-21 is ₹86,659,($1160), or 1.77% of bitcoin’s going price. So, it’s no surprise that SHIB, with its much cheaper valuation, is drawing strong demand in the festive season.  “The motivation to buy SHIB is to earn good profit in a short time,” Dharmesh Barot, a SHIB investor and a real estate professional, told Coindesk. “Yes, it’s cheap money too, easy to bet on.”  SHIB, an ERC-20 token created by an unknown person named Ryoshi in August 2020, has chalked up a near tenfold rally in the past four weeks, outperforming bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies by a big margin. Last week, the cryptocurrency briefly replaced its rival dogecoin as the ninth-largest digital asset. The team behind SHIB has also launched decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, which allows users to stake coins.  According to Defi Llama, the total value locked in ShibaSwap has doubled to over $500 million in the past four weeks.  The sentiment is quite bullish in the retail crowd, as evidenced by the recent comments in Aggarwal’s WhatsApp group. “DOGE, SHIB ki behen, chacha, fufa koi nikla hai to batao, pura khaandan kharid lenge [let us know if SHIB, DOGE’s sister, uncle, have been launched, we will buy entire family],” one member jokingly said in Hindi, revealing his/her bullish bias on meme coins.  Members of a Telegram-based Shiba Inu India (Official) group have planned a community buying effort at 6:30 PM UTC on Nov. 3 – a day before Lakshmi Pujan. “We can all do this,” said a group member.  “The major motivation is always the money for people,” Rajat Lalwani, community administrator and moderator, Growth Breed at SHIB India, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “The price is relatively cheap than a lot of coins, and people feel if the zeros keep getting eaten, then they can make 10x, 100x or even 1,000x on their investment long term.”  Peak retail interest  Google Trends currently shows a value of 100 for the India search query “SHIB” over the past 12 months – a sign of peak retail interest mostly seen at market tops.  “Cheap price has been the biggest factor, and to see $100 becoming $1,000 in no time is driving madness,” Siddharth Menon, co-founder of WazirX, said. “We had seen this with DOGE in 2017, where memes became life-changing for some. I missed out on that hype back then too.” The exchange published a blog post on Nov. 1 explaining how to buy SHIB in India.  Some investors have been drawn to SHIB by dogecoin’s meteoric 15-fold rise to ₹58 in April-May. “The motivation to buy SHIB came when DOGE coin made an immense amount of money and SHIB was coming into the limelight and was being referred to as the DOGE killer. It was then I thought of investing into it,” said Gurpeet Singh, an audio engineer from the Indian state of Punjab.  There is more to it than low price  According to Lalwani, demand for SHIB stems from the community’s active approach in dealing with the excess supply situation.  “In May, Ethereum [co-founder] Vitalik Buterin burned 45% of SHIB’s supply to a dead wallet. That started a cult-like revolution of burning tokens to increase the price by decreasing supply,” Lalwani said. “Buterin burned a total of 405 trillion, and the community has burnt close to 6 trillion already.”  Buterin had been given half of SHIB’s total supply in May in a supposed marketing stunt. Coin burn refers to the process of removing tokens from circulation and is the crypto market’s equivalent of a stock buyback.  “I am holding a good quantity of SHIB, more than 200 million, and I am looking to add more in Diwali while the price is ranging,” said Jiren Singh, a 36-year-old accounts professional and a member of Shina Inu India (Official) Telegram group said. “Cheap price is indeed a reason, but my primary motivation is its strong community base and token burns.”  A petition at Change.Org urging Shiba Inu to develop a policy to burn a significant amount of the token supply is gaining traction, garnering over 13,000 votes in less than 24 hours.  “The Shiba Inu pricing is aiming for the $1, but when it will reach that threshold exactly is anybody’s guess,” the petition says. “Developing a policy that could burn some Shib’s circulating supply will let Shiba Reduce for example this ten year period to five years.”  Currently, there are 549 trillion SHIB in existence, according to data provided by CoinGecko. That number is significantly higher than bitcoin’s circulating supply of 18.85 million. Assuming the petition is approved, there would still be plenty SHIB in the market relative to other cryptocurrencies, limiting its price prospects. However, Indian investors think otherwise.  “Circulating Supply of SHIB is very less for 1.30 billion Indian SHIB army,” one SHIB fan tweeted.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/02/this-diwali-season-indians-fomo-over-shiba-inu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c3c04242af369bb489ca69a4a98768e4aa2fc63-5200x3467.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4bib,1635815996,Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami,"MIAMI — The civil trial Ira Kleiman vs. Craig Wright kicked off here Monday and it may provide insight into some of Craig Wright’s claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.  Wright, an Australian computer scientist and early cryptocurrency pioneer, has been claiming to be the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin since 2016. This lawsuit posits that Wright did not act alone. According to Ira Kleiman, his late brother David – a fellow computer expert and longtime friend of Wright’s – was the co-creator of Bitcoin and is entitled to a share of a trove of bitcoin currently valued at $66 billion.  The suit alleges that David Kleiman and Wright formed a partnership and established an entity called W&K Info Defense Research, LLC, that they used to mine bitcoin and organize their intellectual property, including the Bitcoin source code.  According to emails shown to the jury on Monday, Ira Kleiman alleges that his brother was solely responsible for mining the entire stash of bitcoins in question, and has accused Wright of swindling them from David’s estate through a combination of forgery and deceit.  Wright denies the allegations and says that while David Kleiman was a friend and confidante, the two were never partners and that he alone is Satoshi Nakamoto.  A panel of 10 jurors selected Monday will have three weeks to hear the evidence and decide the fate of what Wright’s team is calling “Satoshi’s bitcoins.”  ‘Partnership’ paper trail  In his opening statement on Monday, Kyle Roche, an attorney for the Kleiman estate, established a timeline for the jury that aimed to demonstrate Wright’s conflicting statements about the nature of his relationship with David Kleiman.  In those emails shown to the court, Wright repeatedly referred to David Kleiman as his “partner” and his “business partner” until after the latter’s death in April 2013.  Roche told the jury that after David Kleiman’s death, Wright’s story began to change: he continued to call David his partner but started to distance himself, and claimed that David had transferred their shared intellectual property into Wright’s possession.  According to Roche, Wright’s relationship with Kleiman’s surviving family members began to sour sometime in 2015, when Ira was informed by Australian tax authorities that he fraudulently claimed to pay David Kleiman approximately $40 million for materials belonging to their shared company, W&K Info Defense Research, LLC.  Roche told the jury that after 2018, when Ira Kleiman filed suit against him, Craig Wright began to deny that he and David Kleiman had ever been partnered – or that he’d ever had a partner at all, aside from his wife Ramona Watts.  In deposition footage dated April 4, 2019, Wright said, “He was never my partner. … I hate the whole concept of partnership.”  Inside the defense  Wright’s defense seems to largely hinge on two factors: his diagnosis with Autism Spectrum Disorder and the lack of a written agreement between him and David Kleiman.  In her opening statement, Amanda McGovern, counsel for Wright, claimed that Wright’s autism made him difficult to communicate with, overly literal and combative. Rather than pushing back against the veracity of the plaintiff’s timeline, McGovern instead attempted to convince the jury that Wright and Ira Kleiman simply have a different understanding of the word “partner.”  McGovern painted a picture of Wright’s lifetime of social difficulties, claiming that he came from “a very difficult home,” had “very few friends in his childhood” and “he was considered strange … even by his sister.”  “At 13, he wore a ninja outfit to a playground and all the other kids called him a freak,” McGovern said.  For Wright, math and cryptography became a refuge away from bullying at home and at school.  According to Roche, however, Wright’s diagnosis with autism is a recent development: He was diagnosed sometime after 2018 by Dr. Ami Klin, director of the Marcus Center for Autism – and an expert witness for the defense. Roche told the jury that Wright was diagnosed over the phone by Klin who had, at the time of diagnosis, never met Wright in person.  Will the real Satoshi please stand up?  While both the plaintiffs and the defense posit that Craig Wright – either alone or alongside David Kleiman – invented Bitcoin, reality is murkier.  Despite Wright’s claims (as well as his history of lawsuits against his detractors) he has not been able to definitively prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  After announcing in May 2016 that he would move Satoshi’s bitcoin – proving that he had access to Satoshi’s private keys and was therefore Satoshi – Wright failed to do so, writing, “I do not have the courage. I cannot,” in a now-deleted blog post.  The cryptographic proof he provided instead has been accused of several high profile cryptography experts as being fraudulent.  Past accusations of document forgery and other fraud repeatedly came up during the first day of trial, as the plaintiffs’ attorneys showed the jury examples of “doctored” emails from Wright, where they allege that Wright added and deleted sentences from David Kleiman, changed dates and more.  Follow the money  If the jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs and Ira Kleiman is awarded his brother’s share of “Satoshi’s bitcoins,” the question remains whether the court has any way of retrieving them.  The still-unsolved mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity, and Wright’s seeming inability to retrieve the coins in his wallet, mean that recovering the coins may not be possible. If Wright is not Satoshi – or, if he is and has somehow lost access to the wallet – it is unclear how Ira Kleiman will get his hands on half of the stash.  Furthermore, there are some in the crypto community who question whether the 1.1 million bitcoins at the heart of this case even exist. In a blog post from 2018, Tokyo-based software developer and self-proclaimed “Bitcoin archaeologist” Kim Nilsson traced wallet addresses supposedly held by Wright, tying many of them back to the 2014 Mt. Gox hack.  UPDATE (Nov. 2, 13:48 UTC): Modifies subheading and several passages to clarify the nature of the case against Craig Wright and potential ownership of coins the defense refers to as belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto.
