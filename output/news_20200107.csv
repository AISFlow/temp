42431359,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN22xh,1578433503,Sony’s Car Points to a Future of Machine-to-Machine Crypto Payments,"Sony announced a car – a real, physical vehicle with wheels and seats – at CES 2020 and everyone is losing their minds. Obviously, this car, called the Vision-S, is a prototype and you probably won't be going down to Best Buy to pick up some USB-C cables and a new Sony whip. But the simple fact remains that an electronics and software company is moving into real-world mobility.      This is good for crypto.      ""This prototype embodies our contribution to the future of mobility and contains a variety of Sony's technologies,"" said Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. In other words, Sony wants a seat at the mobility table. In fact, since it launched this vehicle first it could be a major player. But the fact that it released this model at CES and in 2020 before anyone else will set a trend that will force other players to reveal their work.    Why should we car(e)?    There is a school of thought that believes the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain happens when robots begin paying robots. These robots might be cleaning our houses, taking care of our elders or driving us around. Cryptocurrency becomes the value transfer medium in this scenario and all of the sensors, computers and systems associated with washing our floors or getting us around connect to the worldwide internet of value and, in the end, supplant most payment methods.      Car manufacturers probably won't play ball. Car sales and car manufacturers depend on a few things, the primary one being that a human will buy an expensive hunk of steel and spend quite a while behind the wheel. Sony and Apple and Intel and countless mobility startups aren't harnessed to that antiquated notion. To them, cars are computers. The Sony car is packed with sensors – lidar, radar and cameras – and 360-degree audio with a huge, wraparound screen to entertain the driver. It is, in short, the beginning of a car-creation model that pulls the industry out of the 1900s and into the 2000s.      The electric vehicle is built on Sony's own platform, which it plans to use in multiple body configurations. It has a reported zero-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Car and Driver, and a max speed of 149 mph. It's a real car with real power.      We know very little about Sony's future car plans and the concept model is far from ready for the market. But eventually, this car and many like it will be communicating with each other wirelessly and negotiating traffic automatically. Your wallet will take a hit if you want to get somewhere faster — your car will pay another car to get ahead of them — and you'll spend or even earn if you can spare a few more minutes on the road. Roads themselves will request tolls for maintenance and, as we sit in relative comfort, we'll be making requests for applications, educational materials and entertainment. And, if Facebook, Apple and Amazon have their way, we won't be swiping a credit card.      All of this assumes Sony and Apple and Google and Amazon are all thinking the same thing. Thus far, it seems they are. They are computing companies. Computing is built on open standards, and anything traditional car manufacturers do to prevent that openness will earn them a spot outside of the network. The new driverless, self-negotiating cars will also face driver resistance. Maybe we'll have a future where petulant car lovers boast they are both ""rolling coal"" and ""rolling meat"" by driving their antiquated vehicles manufactured before, say, 2025. But anything that stands in front of the onslaught of driverless, constantly negotiating vehicles will be run over.      In the end, maybe this Sony car is a random pop on the future's horizon. Or maybe it's something else: the beginning of a firework show that will truly take this extremely nascent technology mainstream. All we can say right now is people are excited about what's to come.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/07/sonys-car-points-to-a-future-of-machine-to-machine-crypto-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cddd0ca28bc15f0368047912d211a239d7c9bd7-708x472.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Fh,1578432934,Libra Association Exec: World Needs Us Because Bitcoin Is 'Not a Means of Payment',"LAS VEGAS — ""Bitcoin as an asset class has proven that mathematical scarcity can support an incredibly exciting asset,"" Dante Disparte, vice chairman of the Libra Association, said Tuesday. ""It's not a means of payment. It just isn't.""      Disparte spoke at the Digital Money Forum at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, making his argument to gadget fans and technology's early adopters.      ""The bottom rung of the ladder of economic mobility is payment access,"" Disparte said. And so far, he said, crypto just isn't cutting it on payments. Disparte said that's why he became interested in what Facebook was building with Libra.      The Libra Association is a consortium of large companies that aims to eventually launch the Libra stablecoin, a federated cryptocurrency designed by Facebook for the millions of people who don't have access to banking services. Each company involved would run a node, but only those approved by existing members can join. Though it is more decentralized than existing finance, it is not permissionless, like bitcoin or ethereum.      Libra is trying to solve a complex problem. ""How do you drive mass adoption?"" Disparte said. ""How do you remove insidious levels of friction that basically make it cost-prohibitive to give people access to payments?""    Pushback    ""I'm not convinced that a council of self-interested companies can do money better than a decentralized system,"" Akin Sawyerr, a strategy lead on the Decred project, said on the Tuesday panel. ""The only way to really get there is to empower the individuals to have some base-level sovereignty.""      By sovereignty, Sawyerr meant a level on which a person has uncensorable control of their money. In bitcoin terms, as long as a person controls their keys, no one can take away their bitcoin. He expressed doubt that a permissioned system run by dozens of large organizations would be very censorship-resistant. Notably, the payments companies initially involved in the Libra Association – including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others – departed en masse in October.      But Disparte countered that until permissionless crypto projects deliver a payments system that people in the developing world actually use and that shows it can scale, it's not fair to subject Libra to what he called, ""a crypto purity test.""      ""It's not one or the other. The world is not zero sum,"" Disparte said.

Levine: On today’s episode, Bitcoin’s Continued Climb, More Government Indicators and The 2019 bull market for law enforcement inquiries?      Adam B. Levine: It’s JANUARY 7, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Adam: First, we turn to the daily bitcoin market briefing and important news affecting the crypto industry.      Brad Keoun: Bitcoin up for the fifth straight day, with the price increasing to $7864, the highest in six weeks, in a pretty dramatic start to 2020.      CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes that the rally appears to be running out of steam for now, hitting resistance at the 100-day moving average of $7,945.      Technical indicators, though, are currently suggesting that prices are more likely to go higher than lower.      Adam: Turning to the news, the International Monetary Fund’s Chief Economist predicts that digital currencies are not about to challenge the U.S. dollar’s pivotal role in global trade.      In an op-ed for the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gita Gopinath wrote that although cryptocurrencies present ""intriguing possibilities,"" they lack the infrastructure and global acceptance needed to supplant the dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency.      ""The dollar’s status is bolstered by the institutions, rule of law, and credible investor protection that the U.S. is seen as providing.""      Brad: The messaging-app company Telegram says in a new web post that it won’t integrate a crypto wallet into its system until it gets the green light to do so from U.S. regulators, in a reversal from the company’s stated plan as recently as October.      The announcement is notable partly because it signals a more contrite or at least compliant stance as the company fights a court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its $1.7 billion capital raise in 2018, which the U.S. regulator has characterized as an unauthorized securities offering.      Notably, Telegram emphasizes in the post that its proposed Gram tokens are NOT investment products; the company capitalized the word NOT.      Telegram’s CEO, Pavel Durov, is reportedly set to be deposed in the case today in Dubai.      Adam: And in China, the search engine company Baidu on Monday launched a blockchain-based service for developers to build decentralized applications, known as dapps.      The new service aims to make it cheaper for customers to develop applications since they won’t have to build their own blockchain platforms.      The move comes just months after Chinese President (She) Xi Jinping announced that the country plans to prioritize blockchain as a core technology and encourage its use by small businesses throughout the country.      Brad: And IBM, the computer maker, is launching a new app that uses blockchain to allow consumers interested in sustainability to trace the coffee they buy along the supply chain.      The new ""Thank My Farmer"" app will allow consumers to track their morning joe from the store where they buy it back to the farm where it was grown.      Consumers scan QR codes on the side of the coffee jar to look at the origins of their purchase, linking back to information stored on the blockchain, and they can even choose to make additional payments to the farmers who grew the beans.      Instead of tipping the barista, Adam, it’s like an extra little something for the person who cultivated your beans.      Adam: Turning to today’s featured story, this morning we’re tracking several threads from around the world which seem to indicate a growing drumbeat of national interest in blockchains, including some places you might not expect.      First, we turn to the southwestern coast of India, in the state of Kerala (KERR-uh-luh), where the Economic Times of India reports on comments from the State Electronics and IT Secretary:      “We are looking for intelligent use of blockchain in specific domains in the next five years so that its applications can be sustained. Companies that produce solutions based on the technology can sell it as products or services,” The secretary, told the Economic Times. He foresees the state as a talent hub for blockchain experts through the government initiative of Kerala Blockchain Academy, which was started in 2017. The idea is to train 20,000 people in blockchain development over the next two years. “Around 2,000 of them have gone for the next level in the blockchain developer programme and 800 have graduated,” he said.      “The state’s strength in blockchain will be an incentive to attract the right companies that will trigger the ecosystem.” The state government is also trying to implement pilot schemes like using blockchain in land records, managing workforce, organic food traceability and immunization programs.      Meanwhile, in South Korea, CoinDesk’s Daniel Palmer recently reported on a proposed embrace of blockchain, at least so it can be locally regulated, by the Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution.      QUOTE      Financial institutions should be allowed to offer cryptocurrency products such as derivatives, according to a government advisory body in South Korea.      To support such a move, the nation's fintech sector should develop custody solutions for cryptocurrency to avoid a reliance on foreign custodians, said the committee.      The committee said the government could follow the lead of U.S. regulators and sanction products such as futures contracts tied to bitcoin. Institutions would also be allowed to offer other cryptocurrency services such as trading.      With cryptocurrency trading surging worldwide, ""it is no longer possible to stop crypto-asset trade,"" said the committee, according to a report from Business Korea on Monday.      Other suggestions from the PCFIR included, notably, that bitcoin might be directly listed on Korea Exchange, the nation's stock market.      Finally, we return to U.S. shores where the Virginia state legislature is tomorrow set to offer House Joint Resolution 23.      Quoting from the Virginia Legislature’s website, this resolution “Requests the Department of Elections to conduct a study to (i) determine the kinds of blockchain technology that could be used to secure voter records and election results, (ii) determine the costs and benefits of using such technology as compared to traditional registration and election security measures, and (iii) make recommendations on whether and how to implement blockchain technology in practices affecting the security of voter records and election results.""      If passed by the legislative body, we’d expect to see the first report by Nov. 30, 2020, and potentially a second, more in-depth report a year after that.      Now, is voting on the blockchain a good idea? Personally, I have some doubts. But it’s another example of the cycle of adoption repeating, and while those of us who have been paying attention since the beginning of crypto might want things to hurry up, this is in fact the natural way that people learn about new and unfamiliar technologies.      Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at one cryptocurrency exchange’s costs of running a marketplace - in a fast-growing business that’s been known since its earliest days as a place where it’s not uncommon to see the movement of funds with dubious origins.      Brad: That’s right Adam, today we’re highlighting an annual report published by the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken.      It’s the 2019 Transparency Report, detailing the exchange’s efforts to comply, or in some cases not comply, with requests from law enforcement agencies for information related to allegedly suspicious activity.      A couple of the takeaways here are, one, just how quickly the number of requests are increasing, perhaps an indication of how quickly the crypto markets, and in particular Kraken’s business, is growing.      But also, this just highlights the very real costs of responding to and complying with all these requests from law enforcement agencies that might be following up on tips or other leads in their efforts to solve crimes or stop money-laundering.      According to the report, there was a roughly 49 percent increase last year in global law enforcement requests from 2018 levels.      Total requests rose to 710, from 475 in 2018 and 160 in 2017      Included some 406 subpoenas,      62 percent of requests resulted in data provided      28 percent of requests were non-valid, meaning the request did not meet local legal requirements and/or the company’s internal law enforcement production policy      Geographic distribution - some 432 from the U.S., 86 from Great Britain, with most of the remainder coming from other European countries      Majority of U.S. requests came from FBI, followed by the DEA and Homeland Security/Immigrations Customs Enforcement      CEO Jesse Powell tweeted that the cost to service the requests was more than $1 million, “substantially beyond the work of one paralegal.”      Powell said that several things contribute to the cost, including that Kraken is an older business with eight-plus years of data, millions of accounts, and high security around accessibility of personal data.      Another issue is that requests are handled in high wage markets rather than exported/outsourced to low wage markets. It could probably be 1/10 the price if we eliminated all concern for security/privacy.      It’s important to note here that as this industry evolves, that some of these exchanges are choosing to publicly promote their efforts to comply with law enforcement, potentially calculating that the lion’s share of institutional investors who want to enter the crypto markets will want to deal with exchanges that aim to be squeaky clean and in full compliance with domestic and international authorities.

Awarded Dec. 31, R3 claims its protocol could facilitate more complex payments that require parties to confirm identities or meet certain legal requirements.      It isn't clear whether the new record-sharing system would be an independent protocol or integrated with R3's existing Corda blockchain. In December the company completed a trial, the largest of its kind, that tested Corda's trade finance applications together with more than 70 companies from around the world.      Typically, companies keep their own records of agreements and positions struck with other entities. While this duplication provides them with a secure store of data, R3 claims in its patent filing the current system can create slight disparities that cause miscommunications, unfulfilled promises and legal disputes.      R3's patented system, which is built on a private blockchain, could replicate ""every transaction to ensure all parties with access to the ledger, but not necessarily involved in any one transaction, have current and immutable information"". According to the patent, which was originally filed in August 2016, that could address some of the inefficiencies and operational risks associated with legacy record systems.      The patent also details how the new system could be used to share a ratified agreement, made accessible to both signatories, that can automatically update records with amendments or include new records for appropriate parties. It can be used to record relevant workflow without a third party who is trusted to ensure all parties receive the exact same information at the right time, R3 says.      The filing lists R3 technologists Richard Gendal Brown, Mike Hearn and James Carlyle as the system's inventors.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/07/blockchain-vendor-r3-scores-its-second-patent-in-a-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7af061a9f7e74fd8c3086339e4db0e063c7f0b90-1481x1027.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Japanese corporate giants will be renting mining capacity at the facility in Rockdale, Texas, recently put into construction by Whinstone Inc., according to Bloomberg sources. The firms are to begin mining ""within coming months,"" the report says, adding that the firms involved would not comment when asked.      As CoinDesk reported in November, when the facility gets up and running it will likely be the biggest bitcoin mine in the world, starting at 300 megawatts and expanding to 1 gigawatt by the end of 2020.      That puts the rival mine being built by Bitmain – also in Rockdale and touted as the biggest in the world – in the shade. That's planned to start at a capacity of 25-50 MW and possibly expand to 300 MW.      Internet giant GMO was also said to have been involved in setting up the Rockdale facility, as per CoinDesk's earlier report. In November, Whinstone estimated the data center will cost $150 million to build and fit out. The initial 300 MW of power was expected to come online in the first quarter, with 1 GW planned to be achieved late in the year.      Soon after Whinstone broke ground on its Texas project the company was acquired by Germany-based Northern Bitcoin, which already runs a bitcoin mine in Norway that harnesses renewable power.

42431365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Bh,1578406520,DAO Platform Aragon Begins Recruiting Jurors for Tokenized ‘Court’,"Aragon has started the process for recruiting human jurors as the governance protocol prepares to launch its decentralized court system.      As of 16:00 UTC Tuesday, community members will be able to exchange the project's ANT tokens for newly minted Aragon Network Juror (ANJ) tokens that will be used for staking on its dispute resolution platform. The pre-activation window, open until the launch of Aragon Court on Feb. 10, will select the first class of jurors to adjudicate on cases brought before the court.      Aragon provides the framework and tools needed to create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) ranging from multi-faceted structures intended for thousands of users, to simple ones for just one or two people. Its court system will handle ""subjective disputes that require the judgment of human jurors,"" according to the official website.      Becoming a juror is open to anyone who possesses a minimum of 10,000 staked and activated ANJ tokens. Each case is assigned three jurors who are selected randomly, with the chance of selection increasing with the size of an ANJ holding. Jurors then deliberate and rule on the dispute, earning a token reward for doing so.      Jurors make their rulings independently, revealing their decision to the other jurors and those involved in the case.      A juror who votes against the other two also loses his or her staked ANJ tokens, which are then redistributed to the two winning jurors. This is aimed at ensuring jurors' incentives are aligned with coming to the correct resolution, minimizing the chance of them being swayed to vote one way or another.      Once the Aragon Court launches on Feb. 10, there will no longer be a fixed conversion rate for ANT to ANJ. It will become a rate that will change dynamically depending on how many ANJ tokens are activated. Should the number of activated ANJ tokens fall too low, so too will the conversion rate.      The ANT price has spiked ahead of the opening of deposits later Tuesday. Tokens are currently trading at just under $0.47, according to CoinMarketCap, meaning a hopeful juror would currently need to exchange approximately $47 worth of tokens in order to be considered.      Aragon launched on ethereum in 2016. Last April, core developers submitted a proposal to begin funding a new version on the polkadot protocol. Token holders vetoed the idea concerned the move would lend support to a possible ethereum rival.      Correction (Jan. 7, 2020, 15:09 UTC): This article previously said the ANJ staking amount would be worth $4,700 at the current spot value. In fact, jurors must stake $47.

42431372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Lh,1578402000,Digital Currencies Won't Replace US Dollar Anytime Soon: IMF Chief Economist,"The chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said digital currencies are not about to challenge the U.S. dollar's pivotal role in global trade.      In an op-ed for the Financial Times on Tuesday, Gita Gopinath, who took over as the IMF's chief economist in January 2019, wrote that although cryptocurrencies represented ""intriguing possibilities,"" they lack the infrastructure and global acceptance needed to supplant the dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency.      ""Advances in payment technologies do not address fundamental issues of what it takes to be a global reserve currency,"" Gopinath wrote. ""The dollar’s status is bolstered by the institutions, rule of law and credible investor protection that the U.S. is seen as providing.""      The idea that digital currencies could directly challenge the greenback's dominance has been advocated by some leading economic figures. The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, previously suggested a central bank digital currency (CBDC) backed by a basket of reserve currencies – a ""synthetic hegemonic currency"" (SHC) – could benefit national economies as the process of globalization continues.      But although SHCs could better rebalance global trade, they would have to be accepted globally, according to Gopinath. With many emerging markets, which are gradually making up more and more of global GDP, switching to the greenback, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon, she said.      According to the IMF, the dollar made up more than 60 percent of global foreign exchange reserves in Q3 2019, having increased by more than $100 billion in the past year. The next largest, the euro, comprised only 20 percent of exchange reserves in the same period.      In the past year, central banks have begun publicly talking about launching their own digital currencies. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) revealed in the summer it was ""close"" to launching its long-in-development digital yuan as an alternative to private initiatives like Libra, as well as raise the renminbi's status overseas.      Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in November the U.S. central bank was exploring whether a digital dollar would even benefit the U.S. economy. The new chief of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, also recently said her institution should be “ahead of the curve” when it comes to CBDCs, though it needs to be clear on the objectives of a potential digital euro.      The IMF has previously advocated research into digital currencies. When she was its head in 2016, Christine Lagarde said central bankers should ""seriously"" consider issuing CBDCs to encourage financial inclusion and improve the privacy of payments.      But the IMF has also advised against premature adoption. In September 2018, it asked officials from the Marshall Islands to reconsider launching a digital currency that would work alongside the U.S. dollar. Unless the country introduced strict anti-money laundering checks, an IMF report said, it could face losing crucial correspondent banking relationships with U.S. banks, losing access to the dollar and effectively cutting the nation out of the global financial system.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/07/digital-currencies-wont-replace-us-dollar-anytime-soon-imf-chief-economist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c9a5ed227a6c7a6a2e43f03e35a26573ee746c7-1500x1036.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a tweet on Tuesday, the firm posted an infographic teasing its new 2019 Transparency Report, indicating it had received 710 information requests in total – 49 percent more than in 2018. Last year, the exchange received 475 requests and just 160 were dealt with in 2017.      The country issuing most requests in 2019 was the U.S. with 432 (almost 61 percent of the total).

42431378,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN23Rh,1578394800,Bitcoin Probes Major Resistance After 15 Percent Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin has tested the historically strong 100-day average resistance for the first time in over two months.  An inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart along with bullish short-term indicators suggest scope for a convincing move above the 100-day hurdle at $7,945.  A break higher would strengthen the case for a rally to $8,700.  The long-run outlook remains neutral with bitcoin still trapped in a falling channel on the weekly chart.    A long-term bitcoin price resistance has come into play for the first time in two months.      The widely-tracked 100-day moving average (MA), currently located at $7,945, was breached in the early Asian trading hours, according to Bitstamp data. The move, however, ran out of steam at $8,000 and prices soon fell back below the major hurdle.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,870 on Bitstamp, representing a 14.8 percent gain from Friday's low of $6,853. The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, currently stands at $7,860 – up 4.6 percent on a 24-hour basis.      The 100-day MA last came into play at the end of October. Back then, a UTC close above the average line had remained elusive for three straight days, starting from Oct. 26 to Oct. 28, as seen below.      The sharp rise from Oct. 26 lows near $7,400, which many linked to China's President Xi's encouraging comments on blockchain technology, ended with rejection above the 100-day average (marked by a circle).      Essentially, bitcoin charted a bearish lower high with the failure at the average hurdle and ended up falling to lows below $6,500 in December.      Hence, the 100-day MA at $7,945 is the level to watch out for in the next 24 hours. A UTC close higher will likely invite stronger buying.      Technical charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a convincing move above the crucial average resistance.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped 5.52 percent on Monday, confirming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart.      The bullish reversal pattern has opened the doors for a rise to $8,735 (target as per the measured move method).      The breakout is backed by ascending (bullish) 5- and 10-day averages. Further, the 14-day relative strength index is hovering at 63.51, the highest level since Oct. 27, indicating strengthening bullish bias.      The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline, currently at $7,586, although looks unlikely at press time.    Weekly chart    The head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart has confirmed the seller exhaustion signaled by a hammer candle created in the seven days to Dec. 22 and last week's doji candle.      A bullish breakout on the weekly chart would be confirmed only if and when the six-month falling channel is breached to the higher side. Currently, the channel resistance is located at $8,000.

42431362,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN231h,1578391200,Store of Value Remains Crypto’s Best Use Case,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ryan Zurrer is founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm focused on on-chain opportunities. Previously, he led investments at Polychain Capital and served as chief commercial officer at the Web3 Foundation.      Store of value was the most viable and desirable use case across crypto in 2019 and offers a basis to increase users in the second decade of crypto.      Collateral-backed crypto assets and alternative stores of value (SoVs) found their niche in 2019. Seeing crypto-natives begin to stake and save as part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution was one of the most exciting trends in the space. We’re also seeing the re-emergence of community-directed capital pools known as DAOs, which are arguably a SoV in their own right.      The bitcoin community seemed to find common ground on its primary niche as a store of value rather than a payment mechanism. The SoV use case has become so compelling that the ethereum community sought to refocus around “programmable money” use cases: “ETH is money” dominated the discourse.      DeFi projects grew quickly. Synthetix grew its collateral-backed synthetic derivatives market by more than 680 percent in the second half of the year. However, DeFi has always been dominated by MakerDAO, which offers loans in the Dai (now Sai) stablecoin backed by a basket of other ethereum-based assets. Dai/Sai may look like very capital-inefficient mechanisms with an interest rate that reached as high as 20.5 percent p.a. in 2019, while collateral deposits sit in excess of 320 percent on average.      But it’s early days.      These rates price in all of the risks inherent in crypto, from the security perspective to the protocol layer. DeFi interest rates should look more like emerging market rates (i.e. 20 percent+) than, say, LIBOR+1 percent.      Moving into the second decade of crypto, I would not be surprised if we see some calamitous black swan event in DeFi, followed by a period of repricing risk appropriately. It is important we maintain perspective here and recognize many DeFi crypto-economic models remain highly experimental and there are important lessons to be learned.    DAO revival    DAOs generated renewed excitement this year. Aragon passed 1,000 DAOs launched, which is a remarkable achievement. MolochDAO spawned dozens of topical offspring and considerable research is being undertaken to make DAOs sustainable and profitable, legally compliant, and more attractive to a wider audience. While DAO experiments flourished, especially noble mission-driven DAOs, most of these organizations were capital pools that store a certain amount of value, funded and coordinated by relatively small groups of known participants.      Detractors argue that DAOs have significant regulatory risk and are currently not truly decentralized, autonomous nor particularly well-organized. But DAOs are evolving quickly, as are the coordination tools to allow disparate participants to efficiently self-organize. There is considerable discussion about how the use of reputation-weighted peer-review combined with the right social tools can dramatically improve DAO coordination.      As we see DAOs professionalize in 2020, we will see premiums offered to enter the most compelling DAO communities while the vast majority of DAOs will trade at a discount to their assets under management (i.e. the store of liquid value that they hold). In cases where the management of a DAO diverges substantially from the original mandate for whatever reason, DAOs will unwind and return value to token-holders in a manner that is quicker and cleaner than what we’ve seen in the past.    The next decade in SoVs    SoVs will continue to reign supreme as the primary use case across crypto in 2020. However, we must tackle a few issues to allow SoVs to form the base for a variety of financial applications.      Primarily, we could make for more capital-efficient DeFi mechanisms. One option is to introduce non-transferrable reputation as part of a user’s collateral options. If a debtor is to suffer public reputational risk, they are far less likely to default on a loan. This would enable lower implied interest rates. We could also increase capital efficiency by allowing the underlying capital in DeFi pools to be staked, when a given PoS protocol permits, thereby reducing the interest rate by leveraging the protocol staking returns.      Second, we need to figure out how to appropriately represent off-chain assets on-chain without being confined to walled gardens known as security-token exchanges or excessive use of centralized proxies. Intelligent DAO capital pools should probably have some exposure to gold and other compelling non-correlated assets in order to lower asset-correlation and portfolio volatility. I would personally be more interested in a portfolio that had diverse asset based while still ensuring decentralization.      Thirdly, considerable evangelism needs to be dedicated to markets where crypto has the best chance for advancement – areas that have a combination of:    Large population bases,  Mistrust in authorities driven from ineffective fiscal and monetary policies and  Strong technical education programs churning out talent.    Cities like Beijing, Hangzhou, Mumbai, Bangalore, Taipei, São Paulo and Buenos Aires are good examples of where SoV use-cases could gain substantial traction.      Finally, we will need to figure out how to deal in multiple currencies across multiple chains as a new generation of technically sophisticated crypto-networks come online and begin to interact. Ethereum and the space generally will benefit greatly by interaction with other Layer 1 protocols and I’m optimistic that we will begin to see these initial cross-chain synergies in 2020 as other projects such as Filecoin, NEAR, Cosmos, Polkadot and others come online and gain traction.      The adage that if you give someone a lever and an incentive, she can move the world seems especially poignant for our industry at this juncture. Using crypto still implies significant friction for most. Thus, new users to our space will tend to hurdle these considerable obstacles only when there is an extremely compelling financial incentive to do so. This may be avoidance of their country’s monetary misfortunes, the search for higher yield opportunities in an economic downturn and/or otherwise seeking better financing conditions. Nevertheless, a decade since the birth of bitcoin, we can safely say that crypto has found a compelling use case as the store of value reigns supreme.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Ryan Zurrer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/07/store-of-value-remains-cryptos-best-use-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb302b0f8201a596f8c8cd04979113d75409202-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN239h,1578387600,Gemini's Head of Risk on How Crypto Beats Traditional Finance,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.      Blockchain is disrupting traditional finance, but will never overtake it without the same legal protections as its outdated predecessor. That’s Yusuf Hussain’s wager.      As president of the Virtual Commodities Association (VCA), Hussain is attempting to map tried and true financial governance structures to crypto. Namely, he’s leading the Winklevoss-backed VCA’s efforts to become a self-regulatory organization (SRO). If successful, an SRO will allow industry participants to manage their own affairs – including setting standards for ethics, conflicts and judgments – akin to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for brokers (the intermediaries for trades involving equities, corporate bonds, securities futures, and options).      Comprised of four cryptocurrency exchanges – Gemini (where Hussain works as head of risk), bitFlyer, Bittrex, and Bitstamp – and a litany of commercial consultants, law firms, and compliance experts, the non-profit VCA aims to develop ""well-formed, sensible regulation.""      In an interview in November, Hussain said the industry is already moving in this direction. ""We're seeing less resistance from exchanges claiming regulation is antithetical to crypto,"" he said.      Also discussed was how maturation will become a competitive advantage, and how traditional finance maps onto crypto.      You have feet in both the world of risk and regulation as head of risk for Gemini. Could you explain the overlap between your two roles?      The biggest connection between the two roles is that both the organization and the industry share the same risks: regulatory uncertainty. At any risk management practice, they identify the main remedial activities to close the gap. I’m looking to address this uncertainty at the VCA. Gemini has a number of employees with backgrounds in traditional finance or tech. Our prior lives inform what we think crypto’s rules and regulations should look like.      Could you describe the process of applying for SRO status?      The VCA is one of a handful of associations out there looking to obtain the SRO designation. There are a number of different ways to get the designation. At the bare minimum, an existing regulatory body would have to sponsor the association and present it to Congress, where a bill would be passed designating it as SRO. The VCA recognizes that there is a specific path through legislation, similar to how the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] designated SRO responsibility over broker dealers and futures contracts markets.      If you distill it, an SRO has two components: enforcement and cross-market surveillance. At the VCA, there are six committees; two focus on enforcement and cross market surveillance. So we’re building to that vision, and we have relationships with both the SEC and CFTC.      How does the existing regulatory framework map onto the crypto industry?      In the U.S. you have roughly 13 exchanges where you can buy or sell commodities or securities. Retail investors can’t buy those assets directly but have to go through a broker-dealer or register with the NFA [National Futures Association] as a futures contracts merchant. Broker-dealers are registered with an SRO to place orders on a market. Once a broker places a trade on an exchange on your behalf, there’s action behind the scenes to make sure you have the money and the counterparty has possession of the stock you want to buy.      That’s referred to as clearing and settlement, which usually takes two to three days, a number of counterparties and also a depository and trusted intermediaries. With crypto, a retail consumer can directly interact with an exchange or choose to interact with a broker-dealer. Blockchain lets consumers buy and sell directly because the clearing happens instantaneously on an exchange. An exchange can play multiple roles because blockchain affords efficiencies and consolidations.      When Gemini builds out products, we ask where it plays out in traditional industry and which agencies' remit does it fall under. A single exchange can offer a plethora of products from futures to ETFs to spots for commodities, stablecoin for foreign exchange and securities when that framework is finalized.      What’s the deal with the bitcoin ETF delay?      Speaking on behalf of VCA, the SEC has rejected ETF proposals since 2018. It recently sent a 100-page rejection letter, which maintained consistency with [its] previous rejections, citing market manipulation concerns. The VCA wants to enable the sharing of data to enable cross market surveillance, which is a vested interest for the industry. Speaking behind closed doors with the SEC and CFTC, they say cross-market surveillance is necessary for maturation.      What were the most important developments this year?      The amount of attention from federal and state regulators. But the discussion has increased globally. There are other jurisdictions looking to pave the way for crypto adoption. There’s a risk the U.S. will fall behind.      There’s also been a slight change in narrative. Where crypto exchanges and custodians once said, ""we don’t need the AML [anti-money laundering] or other regulations... it’s the antithesis of crypto,"" they’re coming around in learning you can’t challenge the most heavily regulated industry in the world without the appropriate sensible regulation.      Do you think the regulators directed their attention in response to Libra?      Not only. There have been a number of bills. When I started the Token Taxonomy Act was being floated. Now the register has a number of bills around crypto, some of which may have been incited by Libra, but broadly speaking the conversation is ongoing. We have a lot of educating to do on what crypto brings, so the bills are appropriately worded. To be honest, I prefer not to comment on Libra. The Gemini founders have already publicly commented.      Any that you expect to pass?      The things I hope to happen are the designation of SRO status to a crypto association. We’ve established the right relationships.      Can you share the VCA’s view on the security/commodity transition?      Each member organization has its own listed framework on what it means to be a security or commodity. Gemini is very particular to ensure only digital assets considered commodities are listed. The conversations happening are how to build a framework that explains how crypto fits into the Howey Guidance.      When applying traditional financial rules, you always see a knee-jerk reaction from crypto. The key is sensibly applying the rules and regulations.      Do you think there is an internal conflict in exchanges between privacy and transparency?      A lot of exchanges think their implementation of custodial infrastructure is the secret sauce. There's a way to provide transparency without giving over the details of your competitive advantage in your SOC reports. Institutions that have trade secrets but continue to provide transparency through attestations is proof that there’s an appropriate way to disclose. After the exit scams and hacks over the years, it’s harder to claim you’re secure and have customers trust you versus having a trusted, reputable audit by one of the “big four” [accounting firms].      Gemini has a head start in minimal compliance burden. We’re not after short-term profits but playing the long game, by building a sustainable product. When regulation does come, we’ll be ready. It’s a competitive advantage and it’s how one day regulation will drive revenue.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/07/geminis-head-of-risk-on-how-crypto-beats-traditional-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e809e1f05dd0178e780352cdbec2c9fc40e8537-1276x842.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
