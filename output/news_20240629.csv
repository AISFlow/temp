30157571,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627050,1719702049,Avalanche Gains Momentum As AVAX Sets Sights On $30.34 Resistance,"Avalanche (AVAX) has recently shown a strong correctional upswing, sparking renewed interest among investors and traders. This upward momentum comes after a rejection at $23.49 and indicates a potential challenge to the $30.34 resistance level. As AVAX approaches this critical threshold, market participants are closely watching to see if the cryptocurrency can maintain its bullish trajectory and break through the resistance. The $30.34 level is now a focal point, determining whether Avalanche can sustain its rally and continue to climb higher. This article focuses on the use of technical indicators to examine AVAX’s current price movement to predict potential Scenarios if the price reaches the $30.34 resistance level. Analyzing Avalanche’s Current Upswing Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of AVAX is actively trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Although the price tends to be moving in a consolidating manner, there are possibilities that it could extend its upswing. Also, while the signal line of the 1-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals that the price of Avalanche may go bearish, this is just a short-term movement, which at some point, the price may begin to rise again. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, despite still trading below the 100-day SMA, Avalanche is actively bullish as it is attempting a correctional upward movement toward the $30.34 resistance level with consistent momentum. The formation of the 1-day RSI indicator also confirms this current price bullishness as the signal line of the indicator seems to have moved out of the oversold zone towards the 50% level. Thus, it can be considered that AVAX’s price may undergo a brief pullback before challenging the $30.34 resistance level Breaking Through Or Facing Rejection At $30.34? Exploring the possible outcomes of Avalanche, it was discovered that if AVAX’s price reaches the $30.34 resistance level and breaks above, it may continue to rise higher to test the $36.15 resistance level and potentially move on to challenge other higher levels if it breaches this $36.15 level. However, if the crypto asset faces rejection at the $30.34 resistance, it will begin to decline toward the $23.49 support level. If this level is breached, it may continue to decline to test the $18.81 support level and may move on to test other lower levels following a break below the $18.81 level. AVAX’s price was trading at around $28.23 and was up by 1.01% with a market capitalization of over $11 billion and a trading volume of over $336 million as of the time of writing. There has been a 24-hour increase of 1.01% in AVAX’s market capitalization and a 3.07% decrease in its trading volume.

The analyst has expressed bullish sentiment on its dominance and future outlook following its possible integration into financial banking systems. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip! Ethereum 15% Price Slump Could Spark Epic Comeback — Analyst Here’s Why Investors Should Not Miss Out On XRP In a June 27 X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst and avid XRP supporter, King Karan boldly demonstrated his confidence in the crypto’s long-term price prospects. According to Karan, missing out on XRP’s integration into the financial banking system could become one of the most profound mistakes for investors. The analyst has implied that its complete integration into the financial banking system could lead to substantial gains, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency’s price to new all-time highs. He has expressed complete confidence in XRP’s bullish prospects, asserting he would be satisfied with his investment timeline whether a price surge occurs tomorrow or in the next two years. Karan’s bullish sentiment for XRP likely stems from Ripple’s plans to expand its digital asset operations to various trillion-dollar markets and the altcoin’s goal to replace the SWIFT network, a vast messaging network used by global banks and financial institutions. This potential integration could significantly expose XRP to new markets, fueling widespread adoption and potentially triggering a price surge for the cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, reports disclosed a major achievement for the Ripple ecosystem, underscoring the potential for the coin to become adopted for international payments. Additionally, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty also predicted last year that XRP could once again be utilized for cross-border payments in the United States (US). Kang’s deep-rooted belief in the digital asset’s eventual success in the market is heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency becoming adopted by financial institutions. Currently, XRP provides a more affordable and incredibly fast cross-border payment method than leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With XRP, cross-border transactions are completed in just three to five seconds, making it one of the fastest methods for international money transfers. Kang has further disclosed that he will continue being bullish on XRP. He revealed his investments in a diverse array of altcoins, emphasizing his strategy of diversification to secure profits despite XRP’s current underperformance. Other Key Developments That Could Prove Bullish For XRP Beyond its adoption prospects within the financial banking sector, the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the potential launch of an XRP ETF could trigger a significant bullish rally for the altcoin. Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Brad Garlinghouse and President, Monica Long have also shared their support for an XRP ETF. Garlinghouse believes that the launch of an Ethereum Spot ETF would eventually open doors for the introduction of other crypto ETFs, highlighting that an XRP ETF was inevitable. On the other hand, Long noted that introducing an ETF would be a highly sensible decision. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip!

30150113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=627035,1719689408,SEC Serves Fresh Lawsuit To Metamask Developer Consensys – What’s The Problem This Time?,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has instituted a lawsuit against Metamask developer, Consensys. The Commission alleges that the crypto firm violated securities laws by acting as an unregistered securities broker. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) To Hit New Highs? Analysts Predict $25 Target SEC Accuses Consensys Of Violating Securities Laws Using Metamask According to the court document, the SEC claims that Consensys has acted “as an unregistered broker of crypto asset securities through its MetaMask Swaps service” since October 2020. The Commission also accused the crypto firm of engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through crypto staking programs. The SEC stated that Consensys has brokered over 36 million crypto transactions since 2020 through its MetaMask Swaps, at least 5 million involving crypto asset securities. Metamask is known as one of the most widely used crypto wallets. In addition to storing their crypto assets on the application, users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies by swapping one crypto asset for the other. This ‘Swap’ service forms the focal point of the SEC’s enforcement action. The SEC claims that some of these crypto assets are securities, and by enabling users to swap these securities, Consensys acted as an unregistered securities broker, thereby violating securities laws in the process. The SEC went further to list Polygon (MATIC), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), The Sandbox (SAND), and Luna (LUNA) as the crypto securities that were made available for trading on Metamask’s swap platform. Additionally, the SEC accused Consensys of performing a “traditional function of the securities market” by offering and selling securities for Lido and Rocket Pool. The Commission claimed that the staking programs offered by Lido and Rocket Poo are investment contracts and that Consensys was in the wrong by offering these securities through unregistered transactions on its ‘MetaMask Staking’ platform. The Genesis Of The Legal Battle Between SEC And Consensys Interestingly, the SEC’s lawsuit against Consensys comes just months after the crypto firm filed a lawsuit against the Commission, accusing the SEC of an “unlawful seizure of authority.” Consensys sought Judicial relief against a potential action from the SEC. They also asked the court to declare that Ethereum wasn’t a security and that the SEC had no jurisdiction over crypto-related matters. The crypto firm looked to have won that battle, considering that the SEC dropped its investigation into Ethereum’s status as a security. However, in the letters informing Consensys about the Commission’s decision to drop its investigation into Ethereum, the SEC had warned the crypto firm that they could bring enforcement actions against them relating to other issues, which they have now done. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip! Ethereum 15% Price Slump Could Spark Epic Comeback — Analyst Reacting to the SEC’s lawsuit, Consensys stated that it would “vigorously pursue” the lawsuit it had initially filed against the SEC. The crypto firm also remarked that they had fully expected” the SEC to follow through with its threat of claiming that MetaMask had to be registered as a securities broker.

However, amidst the chaos, XRP, the native token of Ripple, has stood out as a beacon of stability. While not immune to the overall market dip, XRP has remained relatively range-bound, minimizing losses and sparking renewed optimism among analysts and investors alike. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal? Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout Stability Breeds Bullish Sentiment While Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken significant hits this year, XRP has displayed remarkable resilience. This stability is attributed to several factors, including its utility-driven nature. The altcoin is designed to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, a function that remains valuable regardless of market sentiment. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions continue to provide a level of stability for the token. The coin’s recent performance is a testament to its underlying strength. The token’s ability to hold its ground during a bearish market suggests it has a strong foundation and could be well-positioned for future growth. Analyst Predicts 240% Surge Against Bitcoin Adding fuel to the bullish fire, prominent crypto analyst Javon Marks has made a bold prediction for XRP. Marks, known for his accurate forecasts, believes the crypto is on the cusp of a major breakout against Bitcoin. $XRP / #BTC has, on a Logarithmic Scale, broken out of a notable, near year long resisting trend and this can be a sign of a major bullish reversal to come in.

The token has broken a year-long resistance trend on the logarithmic scale, indicating a potential major uptrend in the making. If this momentum continues, XRP could experience a staggering 243% surge against Bitcoin. This prediction echoes a similar price rise XRP experienced in mid-2023. During that period, the token saw a remarkable 100% increase, while the XRP/BTC pair gained a respectable 63%. If Marks’ prediction holds true, the potential gains for XRP could significantly surpass those seen last year. A New Dawn For XRP? The analyst community is closely monitoring these developments with growing excitement. XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin is seen as a harbinger of a renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market. With market dynamics shifting and investor confidence potentially returning, XRP could be poised to redefine its position within the cryptocurrency landscape. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip!

30141769,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626995,1719675049,Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Competitor Fantom (FTM) Could Jump To $1.2,"Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa has provided a bullish narrative for Fantom (FTM), suggesting that the crypto token could soon make a significant rally to the upside. The analyst also hinted at how Fantom could rise when this happens. Fantom Could Rise To As High As $1.2 Based on the chart Altcoin Sherpa shared, Fantom could rise to as high as $1.2 on its next leg up. In the meantime, the analyst noted that the crypto token is consolidating at a key level. He added that he expects Fantom to form a chop range between $0.50 and $0.70 for a bit, so that range could serve as support as it moves to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Breakdown Below Key Psychological Level, Says $40,000 Is Possible Altcoin Sherpa sounded optimistic about Fantom’s trajectory, stating that he believes FTM will still be a “decent project” going forward, especially with the move to Sonic. In May, the Fantom Foundation announced plans to build Sonic, a layer-1 blockchain with a layer-2 network that connects to Ethereum. Crypto analyst Bitcoin Ape also shared a sentiment similar to Altcoin Sherpa, predicting that Fantom could rise to $1.2. The analyst stated that FT’M’s rally could happen once there is a market recovery, with Bitcoin leading the way. Specifically, Bitcoin Ape highlighted a falling wedge pattern formed on Fantom’s chart, which showed that a price rally was imminent. Like Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin Ape also alluded to Fantom’s pivot to Sonic as a bullish fundamental for the crypto token. The analyst noted that Fantom has been on a “massive revamp lately” with several updates, including the launch of Sonic Labs. He also mentioned the over $100 million in $S (Sonic’s native token) airdrop, which could attract developers and users to Fantom’s ecosystem. In the meantime, Bitcoin Ape predicts that Fantom could experience more volatility in the coming days because it is currently oversold. However, once the crypto token leaves its oversold condition, the crypto analyst expects that breakout to happen. FTM Could Drop To As Low As $0.45 Before Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Ijaz Awan recently predicted that Fantom could drop to as low as 0.45 before its next move up. He noted that Bitcoin’s weakness is dragging altcoins like FTM down, which is why Fantom struggles to gain momentum. As such, he predicts that the crypto token could experience a period of consolidation between $0.45 and $0.55 before its next leg up. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Crypto Expert Predicts Bullish Price Reversal However, the analyst warned that Fantom cannot afford to lose that range of support. He suggested that a drop below that price level would invalidate his structure and could lead to further price declines for the crypto token. At the time of writing, Fantom is trading at around $0.54, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

On the bright side, the long-awaited Shibarium, the project’s layer-2 blockchain, is gaining traction with a significant transfer of tokens and a surge in transaction volume. However, the price of SHIB itself remains stubbornly stagnant, leaving some “Shiba Millionaires” out in the cold. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip! Ethereum 15% Price Slump Could Spark Epic Comeback — Analyst Shibarium Blazes A Trail, But Can It Spark A Price Rally? The movement of 35 billion SHIB tokens to Shibarium signifies a crucial step for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This dedicated network promises faster transactions, lower fees, and a more robust infrastructure for developers and users. This development could be a game-changer, attracting new projects and fostering innovation within the Shiba Inu universe. 35,000,000,000 #SHIB on @ShibariumNet ! Home sweet home where Shiba Inu belongs. Woof pic.twitter.com/OuahXQokv1 — The Bus (@TheBus37643251) June 27, 2024 We’re witnessing the community put its faith in Shibarium. The hope is that a strong Shibarium ecosystem will eventually translate to increased demand for SHIB, driving the price up. However, the path to price recovery may not be straightforward. SHIB has been stuck in a rut lately, hovering around the $0.000017 mark. This stagnant price, coupled with a recent market downturn, has caused a significant drop in the number of Shiba Inu millionaires. Data shows a decrease of over 300 addresses holding over a million SHIB tokens, suggesting some investors may be losing confidence. Shiba Eternity To The Rescue? New Products On The Horizon Shiba Inu isn’t sitting idly by. The upcoming release of Shiba Eternity, a collectible card game featuring the adorable Shiba dog mascot, has injected a dose of optimism into the community. The game’s potential to attract new users and generate revenue could provide a much-needed boost for SHIB. Shiba Eternity is a great way to engage the community and potentially attract new investors, some analysts say. The success of the game could be a tipping point for SHIB. Beyond Shiba Eternity, the Shiba Inu team has a busy roadmap planned. The launch of ShibaHub, a social media platform, and Shibaswap, a decentralized exchange, are just around the corner. Additionally, the development of a layer-3 testnet paves the way for further expansion and innovation within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Epic Reversal?

30132334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626994,1719658847,Analyst Identifies Bitcoin Liquidity Pools You Should Be Aware Of Going Into July,"Crypto analyst Zen has released a critical assessment of different scenarios to expect for the Bitcoin price in July. Bitcoin’s price performance in June has undoubtedly left many investors disappointed. This is because the cryptocurrency virtually traded on a decline throughout the month, even falling below $60,000 at some point. While the unfavorable price continues to play out, crypto analyst Zen has flagged some major liquidity pools that could determine Bitcoin’s outcome in July and the next few months in autumn. Analyst Highlights Potential Bitcoin Liquidity Pools As mentioned earlier, the recent price decline saw Bitcoin break below $60,000 earlier in the week. Notably, Zen observed that this breakdown represented cleared liquidity under $60,630, which goes along with a former price analysis. Although Bitcoin has since recovered and returned above $60,600, Zen noted that the liquidity clearance suggests there’s still a further risk of Bitcoin falling back to $60,150 in the short term. Related Reading: Crypto Trader Says He’s ‘Extremely Long’ On Ethereum, Undeterred By Crash Below $3,400 In addition, the analyst pointed out a number of other liquidity price points that may be used to evaluate momentum in July. It’s interesting to note that these liquidity points ultimately serve as both support and resistance areas. In the case of a continued decline, Zen’s analysis points to liquidity pools at $60,260, $59,440, $58,990, and $56,850. Huge transactions by major holders at these points could cause significant price movements. Clearing such pools could spell trouble for investor sentiment, which in turn could eventually cause Bitcoin to dip to $53,000. “Will it dip to ~53k at some point? That move make sense on Month timeframe, but doesn’t have to happen,” Zen said. On the upside, Zen noted liquidity pools at $61,540, $62,540, $63,260, and $64,920. 📉 #Bitcoin Daily 📈 Bitcoin cleared liquidity above second liquidity pool at 62440 ✅ Got rejected from developing quarter VWAP VAL.

Situation remains the same and requires… pic.twitter.com/LFiiiN9fDH — Zen (@WiseAnalyze) June 26, 2024 Furthermore, Zen pointed out that Bitcoin is currently portraying contrasting scenarios across different timeframes. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is clearly in a downtrend. Each bounce is getting sold into, indicating that the bears have control of the short-term momentum. On the other hand, the weekly candle timeframe highlights how Bitcoin is effectively stuck in a choppy sideways range right now. Each rally gets faded, but each dip also attracts buying interest and accumulation. Lastly, despite the recent price decline, Zen’s analysis indicates that the uptrend remains intact in the monthly candle timeframe. What To Expect From BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,765. According to Zen, a week close above $60,622 will increase the chances of a Bitcoin price upswing in July. On the other hand, a closure below $59,600 will maintain bearish momentum.

30129164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626980,1719653427,Analyst John Bollinger Foresees More Consolidation For Bitcoin,"In the last week, the price of Bitcoin took a significant nosedive, recording a 7% loss to trade as low as $59,478. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin attempted a rebound following this dip but has since been stuck in consolidation between $60,100 – $62,300. Commenting on this development, John Bollinger, inventor of the Bollinger Bands, a popular technical momentum indicator, has provided potential insights into Bitcoin’s next movement as investors continue to await the much-expected crypto bull run. Related Reading: Market Tremors: $10 Billion in Bitcoin Dumped in May Alone, What Does This Signal? Bitcoin To Remain In Consolidation, Bollinger Says In an X post on June 28, Bollinger predicted the price of Bitcoin will maintain its current range-bound movement. The prominent analyst made this projection based on the absence of a price bound following a two-bar reversal at the lower Bollinger Band. For context, the Bollinger Bands consist of three lines (bands) namely a Middle Band which is typically a 20-day moving average of the asset’s price, and an upper and lower band which represent the SMA plus and minus two standard deviations of the price respectively. The Bollinger Bands are primarily used for trend identification and for indicating potential breakouts and breakdowns. Notably in trading, a two-bar reversal is a candlestick pattern showing a potential change in price direction. When this pattern occurs at the lower Bollinger Band, it often suggests that the asset might experience a bounce or a reversal to the upside due to being oversold. However, in the current case of Bitcoin in which there is no price gain following this development, it can indicate continued weakness or price indecision which may cause BTC to remain in consolidation. Generally, such sideways price movements are driven by bearish or uncertain sentiments leading to a lack of buying pressure from investors even at lower prices. In addition, this absence of price bounce also indicates that the current lower Bollinger Band represents a weak support level increasing the risk of a price breakdown. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Crypto Expert Predicts Bullish Price Reversal BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin continues to trade at $60,629 with a 1.31% decline in the last day. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 15.95% and is currently valued at $24.8 billion. Notably, Bitcoin lost 11.69% of its value in June as its price dipped below $60,000. However, despite this decline, investors remain resilient in their expectations of a price rally to kick-start the crypto bull season. Notably, a crypto whale recently bought 20,200 BTC at $1.23 billion, showing much confidence in the token’s ability to stage a price rebound and embark on a bullish run.

30124077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626979,1719644459,Is The Bitcoin Price Correction Over? Here’s The Support Level To Watch,"The Bitcoin price suffered significant bearish pressure over the past week, dragging down alongside it a large portion of the general crypto market. The premier cryptocurrency tumbled as low as $59,500 at some point in the week — its lowest in nearly two months. While investors will be hoping that the worst is over, it is difficult to determine whether BTC is ready to resume its bullish run. In any case, a prominent crypto intelligence firm has identified a price level critical to the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price. $56,000 The Ultimate Support Level For Bitcoin: CryptoQuant In a recent report, the blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant put forward an interesting prognosis for the price of Bitcoin over the coming days. According to the firm, the $56,000 price level is an important level to the future performance of the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Breakout Moment: Is a $7,500 Target Achievable? Experts Weigh In The relevant indicator here is Metcalfe price valuation bands, which pinpointed resistance levels and tops in the previous cycle. However, as shown in the chart below, these bands (the red line) acted as a critical support area in May. For context, the Metcalfe Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. Basically, this law suggests that the value of the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) is intrinsically linked to the size and activity of its network. The Metcalfe price valuation bands are derived from this principle, providing a valuation framework associated with the network effect. These bands create a range of price levels that evaluate where Bitcoin should theoretically trade based on the network fundamentals. Historically, these bands have acted as both reliable resistance and support levels in different market cycles. In recent months, the $56,000 level has been a pivot point for the indicator, providing a strong support for the Bitcoin price in May. According to CryptoQuant’s report, the price level might prove to be vital should the premier cryptocurrency face additional downward pressure. However, if the Bitcoin price dips below this level, the market leader could experience a major correction. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Bitcoin price has returned to around the $60,700 mark, reflecting a 2% decline in the last 24 hours. The coin’s performance on the weekly timeframe is deeper in the red. According to data from CoinGecko, BTC is down by more than 6% in the past week. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency ranks as the largest asset in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $1.18 trillion.

However, the clicking phenomenon has sparked a debate among crypto community members about the state of crypto and web3 gaming. Related Reading: Master Of Scams: Metallica’s Hacked X Account Promotes Solana Token Peeling Steam’s Clicker Game Sensation Banana is an indie game on Steam that consists of clicking the image of a banana to obtain rewards. Although not the first of its kind, its players are rewarded with digital bananas every few hours. Rewards can go from common bananas worth pennies to rare bananas, which can be sold for up to $1,300. The free-to-play game hit the news after it surpassed some of the most popular titles on the platform. Banana flipped Elder Ring and Baldur’s Gate 3 in the most-played games list. The clicker game only came second to Counter-Strike 2. As of this writing, the game remains the fourth most played game on Steam, with over 344,000 current players and a 578,000 peak in the last 24 hours. Moreover, it reached an all-time peak of 917,000 players earlier this month. However, the simplicity of the game raised some alarms among gamers. Many believed the clicker game contained malware that turns devices into crypto miners. While others wondered if the game was a scam of sorts. One of Banana’s developers, Hery, denied the accusations. Hery told news media outlet Polygon that it “is pretty much a stupid game” with bananas, not a scam. Many users also speculated if the game was related to NFTs and cryptocurrencies, as it had an NFT-like feeling but without the blockchain technology. A Banana team member clarified that “Banana wants nothing to do with crypto.” They explained that the game had no intention of integrating crypto as it doesn’t “mix well” with Steam. Additionally, they emphasized that it started as “a goofy game to collect some bananas on your Steam profile.” Are Crypto And Web3 Gaming Going Banana? Although Banana doesn’t plan on integrating with the crypto industry, the game sparked several conversations among the community. Several members took the opportunity to discuss its implications for web3 gaming. A user highlighted the game’s popularity despite its simple mechanics, proposing the industry doesn’t need ‘AAA games’ to break out. Several community members agreed and suggested there’s a misconception about the type of games needed in web3. Although complex and super action games are believed to be the only option, “dudes just wanna have fun and make points,” said an X user. Seemingly, the sentiment among many was that the industry is “making it more complicated than it is.” Some users believe that Banana and similar games could help with web3 gaming. The meme quality of the game was pointed out as a potential catalyst for broader adoption. Similarly, this week, Avalanche Gaming discussed Banana’s implications on its Gamified Show. According to Paul Bettner, game developer and co-founder of Playful Studios, Banana could be a getaway to the larger world of crypto gaming. To Bettner, “the behavior that we all love and participate in web3 as degens and web3 and crypto native users is, in fact, universal.” While watching the phenomenon of Steam’s clicker sensation evolve, the game developer noticed that users were “a bunch of degens that don’t know they’re degens yet.” Related Reading: Is Ethereum About To Take Off?

30115698,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626949,1719630032,"Market Tremors: $10 Billion in Bitcoin Dumped in May Alone, What Does This Signal?","May 2024 emerges as a pivotal month for Bitcoin, witnessing a notable amount of liquidation by long-term holders. Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock highlighted a sell-off totaling roughly $10 billion, equivalent to approximately 160,000 BTC. This trend marked a significant departure from the usual holding patterns seen among long-term investors, who typically help stabilize Bitcoin prices by holding through volatility. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Continue Dumping? This Analyst Thinks So, Here’s Why Bitcoin Stability at Risk? Notably, these long-term Bitcoin holders, also known as the stalwarts of the Bitcoin community, have traditionally served as a bulwark against market turbulence, with their investment decisions often reflecting a steadfast belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value. The change in their behavior in May signals a broader sentiment shift within the market. The scale of this sell-off not only underscores a potential loss of faith or a strategic financial recalibration but also poses serious implications for market liquidity and price stability. IntoTheBlock’s analysis further reveals a slowdown in June, with “only” 40,000 BTC sold, suggesting that while the fevered pace of May’s sell-offs has cooled, the liquidation trend persists. Such continued selling activity contributes to ongoing price pressures, challenging the resilience of Bitcoin’s market value. The repercussions of these large-scale disposals extend beyond simple transactional impacts. Bitcoin’s price has struggled to find firm footing above the $61,000 mark, with frequent fluctuations testing the resolve of both traders and analysts. Despite brief spikes in trading activity—such as a surge to $62,314 earlier today—Bitcoin’s price has retracted to around $60,843, reflecting a 1.3% decrease over the past day. Adjusting to New Realities Adding to the complexity is the significant reduction in Bitcoin mining activity. After the Halving event in April, which reduced mining rewards by half, there has been a marked decrease in mining output. Data from CryptoQuant indicates a near 90% drop in miner withdrawals, suggesting a drastic cut in selling pressure from this quarter. The reduced mining activity is largely due to decreased profitability, prompting miners to scale back operations and sell fewer coins. This adjustment might normally suggest a tightening of supply and potential upward pressure on prices, yet the overarching market sentiment remains bearish. CryptoQuant analysis points to a state of “capitulation” among miners, a condition supported by the Hash Ribbons metric indicating that the short-term mining hash rate has fallen below its longer-term trend. Typically, traders consider such signals bullish, indicating potential buying opportunities. However, the current market digestion of the recent heavy sell-offs by long-term holders and the reduction in mining output paints a more nuanced picture. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit New Heights?

42417858,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa51R,1719628643,"U.S. Judge Lets Most of SEC Case Against Binance Proceed, Dismisses Secondary Sales Charge","A federal judge dismissed part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, but allowed other charges, including charges against the holding company for Binance.US, to proceed.  In a late Friday order, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled that the SEC's charges against Binance for the initial coin offering and ongoing sales for BNB, BNB Vault, staking services, failure to register and fraud charges can proceed. She granted Binance and Zhao's motion to dismiss charges tied to secondary BNB sales and Simple Earn.  The SEC sued Binance, Binance.US and Zhao last summer, alleging the exchanges were offering unregistered broker, trading and clearing services in the U.S. for unregistered digital asset securities. The regulator has brought similar charges against Coinbase, Kraken and – as of Friday morning – Consensys and MetaMask.  The SEC had brought a plausible claim under most of the charges it filed, Judge Jackson wrote in her order Friday.  ""The Court notes that several of the district courts presented with SEC enforcement actions involving cryptocurrencies have taken pains to differentiate the alleged investment contracts from the tokens themselves,"" she wrote. ""... The Court finds these observations to be clarifying and persuasive, as the differentiation is consistent with the Supreme Court’s earliest pronouncements concerning the meaning of the term 'investment contract' buried within the lengthy list that comprises the definition of a 'security.'""  Zhao is currently serving a 4-month sentence tied to a sanctions violation charge brought by the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department. The SEC's case against him is separate from this criminal charge.  The judge cited Judge Analisa Torres' 2023 ruling in the SEC's case against Ripple Labs in granting Binance's motion to dismiss the secondary BNB sales claim, saying the economic reality of the tokens' transactions mattered to the application of securities law.  Like other judges, Judge Jackson rejected arguments that the SEC can't bring enforcement actions against crypto entities under the ""major questions doctrine,"" a Supreme Court precedent that said Congress must direct federal agencies' authorities when it comes to significant industries.  ""The Court has not been given grounds to find that the industry, while important, has the broad reach that has motivated courts to apply the doctrine to other industries,"" the judge wrote Friday.

30113621,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626911,1719626412,Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Crypto Expert Predicts Bullish Price Reversal,"A crypto expert has predicted a bullish price reversal for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The analyst suggested that Bitcoin’s price may have bottomed in, potentially signaling the start of market stabilization after a prolonged downturn. Bitcoin Price Reversal On The Horizon Crypto expert and Bitcoin analyst, Willy Woo has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to shed light on Bitcoin’s current price performance and its future outlook as market conditions stabilize. The analyst disclosed that there may be a good chance that “Bitcoin has cleared all price lows” for this market cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% The crypto expert disclosed that miner capitulation was one of the most reliable indicators for a subsequent price reversal in a cryptocurrency, typically ending periods of sideways or bearishness. Sharing a price chart of Bitcoin’s performance, the analyst has stated that short-term technicals point to a possible price reversal for the pioneer cryptocurrency. He disclosed that the market was approaching a TD9 reversal signal on the daily candles, which is expected to occur in two hours. A TD9 reversal is a technical indicator that usually signals a possible change in a cryptocurrency’s market trend. The crypto expert has revealed that if this scenario plays out, Bitcoin could start correcting upwards, compensating for the recent price declines triggered by excessive selling from miners and significant liquidations driven by speculators. However, Woo has cautioned that Bitcoin’s path to recovery remains uncertain, as substantial speculative activity still needs to be flushed out of the market. The analyst has revealed that Bitcoin can only recover when weak miners die and hash rates recover. He also disclosed that liquidations were necessary for a major price pump in Bitcoin. Is BTC’s Bottom In? Woo suggested in his post that Bitcoin may have reached its bottom price. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $61,481, reflecting a 3.86% decline over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. In an earlier post, the crypto expert disclosed a price target for Bitcoin at $62,000, highlighting that an increase in liquidations has triggered substantial downward momentum for Bitcoin. He revealed that the $62,000 threshold was the most optimal price point to flush out excessive leverage in Bitcoin. However, as speculators continued to open new long positions, it inadvertently led to more liquidations as Bitcoin’s price fell. The long squeeze triggered additional downward pressure for the cryptocurrency, pushing Woo’s initial price target down towards $58,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says ‘XRP Is In Trouble,’ Here’s Why Adding to the market pressure, Woo disclosed that a post-halving miner’s capitalization was ongoing. He disclosed that after Bitcoin’s halving event on April 20, numerous miners sold off their Bitcoin holdings, exacerbating the cryptocurrency’s downward spiral as selling pressures increased. Woo revealed that $54,000 may be the next layer of liquidations for Bitcoin, predicting that if the cryptocurrency reaches these lows, it could potentially tip it into a bearish phase.

Experts Weigh In","Despite Ethereum’s recent lackluster performance, Glassnode Co-founders, under the name ‘Negentrophic’ on Elon Musk’s X social platform, assert that ETH’s potential has yet to be fully realized. Analyzing historical data and market patterns similar to those in early 2021, Negentrophic predicts that Ethereum could reach a high of $7,500, a forecast based on current market structures and technical indicators such as the 161.8 Fibonacci extension level. Related Reading: Is Ethereum About To Take Off? Analysts Weigh In Amid ETF Approval Date Rumors Diving Into The $7,500 Prediction Assessing the prediction from these experts, a Fibonacci extension level seen in 2021, which signaled a major rise for Ethereum, seems to have now emerged on the ETH chart, suggesting that history might indeed repeat itself. The technical analysis shows a developing bull flag pattern on Ethereum’s chart, which typically indicates the continuation of a bullish trend. Ethereum could be primed for a substantial price increase if this pattern holds, especially considering the increased market interest and forthcoming ETH spot ETF trading. For Ethereum to achieve the anticipated $7,500 price target, it must first overcome several significant resistance levels. The initial major hurdle is the $4,000 mark, aligned with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the previous cycle. Surpassing this level would confirm the bullish market structure and pave the way for reaching higher price targets. Negentrophic particularly noted on X: We believe Market moves in structures. And this structure gives us a target at ~7500 as a Final High for ETH. That is the 161.8% Fib-extensions from the structure, we currently see developing. That would mirror the Fib-extension we saw back in 2021. And it would also imply a strong rally in ETH to set in …. soon! Ethereum Signs of Recovery Meanwhile, In the current market environment, ETH has shown signs of recovery, rising from lows below $3,300 to around $3,483. However, the road to recovery is still fraught with challenges, as indicated by a slight downtrend in its weekly performance. Market experts like Quinn Thompson of Lekker Capital have echoed similar bullish sentiments for Ethereum, suggesting a potential rise to $7,000 by the upcoming US election in November.
