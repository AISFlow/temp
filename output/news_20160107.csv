42398847,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Za,1452199352,Bitcoin Exchange BTC-e Back Online After Reported DDoS,"European bitcoin exchange BTC-e was offline for several hours today after the site said that it was the target of a distributed denial-of service (DDoS) attack.  The site  is intermittently available at press time, though according to data produced on the exchange’s front page, trades are being executed amid the user connectivity problems.  Posts on social media suggest that the downtime lasted as many as four hours. The exchange previously reported that it was being attacked, and the downtime sparked concerns that the exchange had been compromised.  The exchange, believed to be located somewhere in Eastern Europe, has been hit with DDoS attacks in the past.  The downtime comes during an increase in average bitcoin prices in USD and CNY markets. BTC-e reported 10,019 BTC in 24-hour volume.  A representative for BTC-e did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398874,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0gT,1452192160,What Are People Building With 21 Inc’s Bitcoin Computer?,"Over the course of 2015, 21 Inc went from a mystery startup with no public business plan to one of the industry's most exciting and often debated companies.  With $116m raised from investors, it's safe to say that 21 Inc had high expectations for its first product, the 21 Bitcoin Computer, which it released in September 2015 to wildly varying reviews.  Some developers were dismayed that a Linux-based device based on a Raspberry Pi could be priced so high when it would never mine enough bitcoin to pay for itself. Others argued that the 21 Bitcoin Computer wasn't a conventional bitcoin mining product, but rather a platform that would unlock new use cases for the technology.  In a world rapidly moving towards an Internet of Things, 21's big idea is to one day embed more refined versions of its chips into everyday consumer devices.  Writing in a blog post, CEO Balaji Srinivasan spoke about how 21's technology could one day be used for device authentication, to enable micropayments or even subsidise the distribution of consumer smartphones to the developing world.  He further revealed that 21's vision was not to ""build a chip"", but create a ""full technology stack around the chip"" that would include reference devices, data sheets, a cloud backend and software protocols.  The 21 Bitcoin Computer itself features a command line interface and Python 3 library, a 128 GB SD card and a suite of pre-configured software designed to work with the bitcoin blockchain. But, using these building blocks, the company is encouraging users to dream up cool and new things.  And people are doing just that.  While it's very early days, there are a number of intriguing projects in development – more as proofs-of-concept than attempts at creating a working business model.  Here are some of the best.  1. Analysing and selling your genes  Joe Pickrell  , junior group leader at the New York Genome Center and an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University, is testing the 21 Bitcoin Computer (21BC) for different novel use cases involving human genomes.  One project aims to predict phenotypes (which can include your physical characteristics and health, among other things) and/or probabilities of contracting a certain disease from a specific type of text file (VCF) containing a gene sequence.  Pickrell explains on his GitHub page that the tool requires a genome sequence in a VCF file and allows users to predict phenotypes of the person to whom the genome belongs. Specifically, this command line tool pulls a phenotype prediction model from an external server in exchange for bitcoin and then returns the prediction.  Currently, he points out, the server only provides a model for predicting Alzheimer's disease risk and there are ""lots of caveats"" to risk prediction, hence this project is rather a ""toy model"".  Intriguingly, Pickrell has another 21BC project that would allow people to sell API calls to their genotypes and phenotypes.  2. Managing work with a 'Mechanical Turk'  Mechanical Turk is a term used for machines that appear to automatically carry out a task when in reality it is being carried out by humans hidden in the background.  Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik recently previewed untested code based on that concept using 21's device to automate the delivery and inspection of work by multiple individuals, as well as award payment for a job well done.  This example uses image analysis but it could be applied to a wide number of operations.  On his GitHub page for the project, Garzik breaks down the process as follow:  Supervisor submits an image, and a list of questions about an image. A minimum number of workers, and a bitcoin reward, is specified.  Workers download the image, answer the question(s), submit results.  API collects work. When X workers have submitted answers, they are compared for matches. The most matches - most accurate - workers receive the reward.  Garzik has a number of 21BC projects on the go, including Causeway, a server storage service that stores and returns data for a certain amount of time, and accept updates if they are signed by a user's payment address.  Or how about a fortune cookie API that lets people receive a ""pithy saying"" for 10 satoshis?  3. Monetising social media  What if you could earn money just by reposting from your social media account?  That's the idea behind a project by self-described entrepreneur and tech fan Justin Guy, which harnesses the 21BC to sell retweets on Twitter.    Additionally, a developer going by the username '21JD21' has created a Reddit-like link-sharing site built with the 21BC that charges users to post links, comment and up-vote or down-vote.      BitLink, as the project is called, pays out to whoever posted the link or comment being voted on, thus giving greater rewards to the most active posts.      Other projects have previously sought to monetise social media, for example, with a Bitly alternative that rewards users in bitcoin. Called Cred, the application encourages readers to share content through specialised links that generate rewards – effectively, the application inserts its own advertisements into the user experience.    4. Selling your Wi-Fi  Noted bitcoin advocate, author and entrepreneur Andreas M Antonopoulos also has a GitHub page listing a 21BC project. His is an experimental Wi-Fi captive portal that accepts bitcoin payments for Wi-Fi minutes.  The bitcoin world has previously made attempts to share Wi-Fi with bitcoin payments and CoinDesk wrote about back it in August. While one firm we looked at set up as a bitcoin payment option alongside traditional payments at public hotspots, the other took a different approach and employed networks of Wi-Fi providers incentivised with bitcoin.  21 Inc's device allows a different method again – potentially allowing anyone to sell their Wi-Fi by putting a 21BC in place.  5. Selling creations and assets  Steven McKie is working on making a 21BC endpoint to allow payments for a SoundCloud 3-D audio visualiser coded by developer Alex Smith.  Another project called Download21 allows people to get paid for offline caching of files from streaming music sites.  It can be run as both server and client, and so allows users to run their own server providing file downloads as a service, or to extract files from someone else's server and pay in satoshis.  6. Internet of Things  While it's too early for any projects to have been announced, electronics and engineering giant Bosch recently revealed it had bought a 21BC for its PhD students to play with – the goal being to develop the firm's IoT concepts.  The Bosch Lab said it sees ""the young but heavily funded startup 21 Inc ... as a key player in approaching this vision"".  What are your favorite 21BC creations?

42398839,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Ol,1452185552,SEC Files New Motion Against Alleged Ponzi Scheme GAW Miners,"UPDATE (8th January 05:55 BST): This article has been updated with additional information.      The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a motion for entry of default in its ongoing case against the now-defunct cryptocurrency startup GAW Miners.  The filing alleges GAW Miners and ZenMiner, two firms mentioned in the SEC’s suit filed last month, have failed to respond to an official complaint.  Notably, the filing does not mention CEO Josh Garza, who was charged with securities fraud tied to the issuance of the firm's Hashlet mining contracts and the operation of a Ponzi scheme after a months-long investigation ended in December.  The SEC's case against GAW came months after the firm collapsed amid growing scrutiny and suspicion that it was operating fraudulently.  According to the 6th January filing, a response to the SEC’s complaint by GAW Miners and ZenMiner was due by 28th December.  The SEC said in its filing that next steps may include a request for an entry of default judgment and court time to determine damages against the companies, writing:  ""Accordingly, following entry of default by the Clerk, the Commission will file a Motion for Entry of Default Judgment with supporting memorandum and exhibits, and may also seek a further hearing to determine the amount of damages against both GAW Miners and ZenMiner pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2).""  SEC attorney Kathleen Shields wrote in an attached declaration that ""neither GAW Miners nor ZenMiner has filed an answer or otherwise responded to the complaint as of today"".  GAW Miners has been the subject of default entries in the past. A case filed by a Mississippi-based utility firm ended with default judgment of roughly $346,000 after the firm failed to respond to the suit.  Garza's defense attorney, Marjorie Peerce, declined to comment when reached.

42378496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTlh,1452183017,Blockchain Startup Joins Accenture Innovation Lab,"A financial innovation lab operated by management consulting firm Accenture has added a blockchain startup to its latest class.  Accenture's 2016 FinTech Innovation Lab London, the company announced yesterday, will include 15 startups. Crowdaura, which uses blockchain technology as a mechanism for issuing securities via crowdfunding, is the sole blockchain startup to be included in the class.  The selected startups will spend 12 weeks working with Accenture staff and executives from a variety of major financial institutions including Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Société Générale.  Richard Lumb, head of Accenture's financial services unit, said that the firm is ""incredibly excited"" to welcome the new class of startups to the accelerator.  ""They offer some exciting innovations and have demonstrated exceptional creativity in what has been a record breaking year for applications from more than 30 countries, confirming that London is very much the centre of Europe’s thriving FinTech community,"" he said in a statement.  Crowdaura is the second blockchain-oriented startup to work within an Accenture-run startup accelerator.

42378505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iTx1,1452172176,Will Provenance Be the Blockchain's Break Out Use Case in 2016?,"2015 may have been the year that financial institutions embraced blockchain technology, but as we move past the hype and the inevitable slump, it's best to focus on what today's blockchains can actually accomplish.  One of the main appeals of blockchains among enterprises is the notion of a value network, where parties can transfer custody of valued assets in an auditable manner without relying on intermediaries.  The recognition that these assets don’t necessarily have to be currencies, but that they can be any kind of financial instrument, has opened up new possibilities for innovation.  Yet, the technology as it stands today has limitations that are yet to be resolved. Privacy on blockchains is probably the largest hurdle for adoption, because by default every transaction on a blockchain is visible to every user of that chain.  Other problems relating to regulation and legal definitions will also need to be resolved, so it will take time for the full breadth of use cases to develop.  Common denominator  In 2015, most of the use cases we've seen with concrete proofs-of-concept focused on post-trade settlement, trade finance, payments and remittance. The common denominator is that these business processes harness blockchains as a provenance protocol.  Much has been said about the blockchain as an ownership layer. But what exactly does that mean?  It means that blockchains represent ownership of an asset in terms of control over the data relating to that asset. In other words, only the current owner can authenticate a transaction that would cause that asset to be transferred to another owner.  This is provenance expressed in protocol form. The word ""provenance"" is derived from the French ""provenir"" which means ""to come from"", and is used to describe the custodial chronology of an object.  Provenance is one of the backbones of economies, whether it relates to artifacts or real estate. There has always been a need to authenticate that a party actually owns an asset prior to any business dealing involving that asset, to ensure that the asset is ""true"" rather than stolen or faked.  In the past, trusted third-parties have traditionally played this role.  However, blockchains can streamline this function by serving as the infrastructure for registering and authenticating asset ownership between untrusting parties with common interests.  But that’s not to say that blockchains can make all the intermediaries in the financial system go away. For example, even in an all-blockchain world, some may find themselves issuing tokens representing the assets to be transacted, offering anonymization services or acting as chain administrators.  Time will tell if and how existing financial players can adapt to these roles.  Tracking ownership  Regardless of how this plays out in the traditional financial sector, the past year has made it clear that tracking of ownership on a blockchain has been one of the most immediately feasible applications.  Even on the bitcoin blockchain, we've seen startups that focus solely on provenance, such as Everledger, Colu, Ascribe and Monegraph, gain significant attention.  The tokens that blockchains track can also be used as digitized representations of the documents that accompany financial transactions.  If we were to deconstruct the business processes of trade finance, we'd see that many relate to the ordering and processing of shared documents between a group of untrusting parties.  The same can be said for post-trade settlement and collateral management. And where 'smart contracts' have been used, they often act as computations that initiate and control these same changes in state.  If we were to look beyond finance, a blockchain can also be used to manage data in a more general sense, providing a full audit trail of that data's origin in both time and place. Thus, a blockchain can act as a provenance protocol for data across disparate semi-trusting organizations.  Coming advancements  In the past year, we’ve even seen interest in using blockchains within a single enterprise, because they act as highly robust and resilient distributed databases, with the added bonus of an incontrovertible internal audit trail.  As blockchain technology matures, more properties relating to provenance can be introduced.  Today, we already have permissioned blockchains in which there is an explicit assignment from one party to another of the ability to connect, issue, send and receive assets, confirm transactions and administrate the blockchain.  One can consider this as another type of provenance, in which the 'good' changing hands is a permission relating to the blockchain itself.  In the future, assets on a blockchain will have more properties to authenticate and track, not only regarding their origins, but also how particular entities are permitted to hold and interact with them. Again, these properties will be assigned by particular sources.  It might well be that, as a distributed ledger, blockchain tech's 'killer application' is as a provenance protocol that can accommodate different types of entities as they’re created, shared and used by multiple participants.
