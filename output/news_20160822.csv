42427007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyajh,1471901733,Florida Files Appeal After Charges Against Bitcoin Seller Dismissed,"The state of Florida has appealed a recent court decision that saw a judge dismiss charges against a local bitcoin seller.  The news marks the latest twist in Florida v Michell Espinoza, a case filed in 2014 in which a Florida-based bitcoin seller was brought up on charges for unlicensed money transmission and money laundering.  The case is best known for a decision by Judge Teresa Mary Pooler in which she sided with Espinoza's attorneys when they argued that bitcoin doesn't qualify as money. She wrote in her decision at the time that she believes it remains difficult to ""accurately define or describe bitcoin"", while expressing hesitation about ruling against a defendant using statutes she described as ""vaguely written"".  Though the appeal won't deal with this issue, the move by the state to appeal the decision, some say, isn't terribly shocking.  Attorney Andrew Hinkes, who has written about the Espinoza ruling in the past, said he wasn't surprised by the news.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The standard of review on appeal is de novo meaning that the appellate court will review the evidentiary record made before the trial court and rule on evidence and matters of law without regard to the trial court’s rulings. Thus, the appeal to the Third District Court of Appeal is basically a 'second bite at the apple' for the State.""  Hinkes went on to argue that the situation illustrates the potential pitfalls of a state-by-state approach to regulating the technology, whereby each state could develop conflicting rules for industry firms.  ""This appeal may provide needed clarity as to Florida’s laws, or simplify issues for the legislature,"" he added.  No details about case filings have been made available to date, according to court records. A request for comment to the Florida Attorney General’s Office was not immediately returned.

42427001,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyabh,1471897560,Unknown Bidder Buys $1.6 Million in Bitcoin at US Government Auction,"A winning bidder claimed 2,700 BTC (worth $1.58m) at an auction held by the US Marshals Service (USMS) today.  USMS  representatives confirmed to CoinDesk that four bids were received in the auction, which took place between 13:00 and 19:00 UTC.  The event, by far the smallest held to date by the USMS, saw bitcoins confiscated in cases involving convicted Silk Road ringleader Ross Ulbricht and former federal agent Carl Force IV made available for sale.  In total, only five registered bidders sought to claim the 2,700 BTC block, the agency said.  The turnout was lower than observed in the most recent USMS auction, which took place last November. In that event, 44,000 BTC (worth $14.6m) was auctioned to 11 bidders.  As in previous auctions, USMS representatives said the winning bidder now has the ability to make themselves known, should they so chose.  Previous winners include bitcoin exchange itBit, investor Tim Draper and over-the-counter trading firm Cumberland Mining.

42427023,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJybBh,1471891267,"One Month After Ethereum Fork, Millions in DAO Funds Unclaimed","It's now been one month since a hard fork of the ethereum blockchain resulted in 11.6m ether being moved to an account with one function: withdraw.  At the time, that was about $145m worth of the digital currency just waiting for former investors, and within hours of its creation, nearly half of those funds had been claimed.  Today, however, the rate of withdrawal has come to a near standstill.  Over the last week, the withdrawal account's balance has dropped from 2.39m ETH to just 2.29m ETH today. At today's rate, that leaves more than $25.9m worth of ether still unclaimed.  var embedDeltas={""100"":610,""200"":488,""300"":444,""400"":427,""500"":400,""600"":400,""700"":383,""800"":383,""900"":383,""1000"":383},chart=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-TVwNa""),chartWidth=chart.offsetWidth,applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math.min(1000, Math.max(100*(Math.floor(chartWidth/100)), 100))]||0,newHeight=applyDelta;chart.style.height=newHeight+""px"";  // ]]>  Who owns this unclaimed ether? And why do they seem perfectly content leaving it untouched?  While this may never be fully known due to the pseudonymity offered by the ethereum blockchain, multiple data analysts have begun to search for, and collect, answers.  According to one set of recently published data, 31% of all addresses capable of withdrawing ether have done so.  Matthew Tan, founder of ethereum block explorer Etherscan, has been tracking the account totals since The DAO first launched in May, and he believes the remaining total in the new DAO contract isn't likely to change.  Tan told CoinDesk:  ""Those who knew how to do it or wanted to withdraw [have] already done so.""  Breaking down the numbers  Currently, all the accounts formally associated with The DAO are empty, according to Tan’s Etherscan account. This includes other accounts connected to the DAO's demise, including the Dark DAO balance that was removed by a hacker and the White Hat balance that was created by a vigilante effort.  The new contract comprising the total meant to be returned to customers, however, has not yet hit zero.  Within hours of the creation of The DAO withdrawal account, 41% of the funds had been withdrawn, and just two days later that number had increased to 60% withdrawn. Today, 80% of the original ether has been claimed, but the rate of withdrawal has slowed to ~0.4% a day.  Now, researchers are seeking to find out more about the account in a quest for an answer as to why funds remain.  For example, data analyst Thomas Rush has been using his EthSlurp tool since The DAO launched in May to extract transactions associated with The DAO and help others research the data. Rush even wrote a script to analyze The DAO withdrawal data.  According to Rush’s findings (current as of last Tuesday), 13,701 accounts still contained value, but most was concentrated in the top 25% of account holders. By his calculations, three addresses account for 27.09% of all the value.  He emphasizes the numbers are approximations.    Data analyst Bokky Poobah of New Zealand-based Bok Consulting also crunched similar numbers and came to a comparable conclusions, though he divided his findings differently. According to Poobah's calculations, there are about 22,000 accounts that have yet to withdraw.  As of 18th August, Poobah said that 8,632 accounts have a balance of less than 1 ETH compared to five accounts that hold $10.1m at today's rate.  ""I feel that these numbers are 'close' but probably not 100% accurate,"" Thomas told CoinDesk, adding:  ""At the very least, they may give you a sense of what’s going on.""  Ignorance, crime and fear  In conversations with analysts, three theories emerged to explain why all this money remains even as the rate of withdrawal has all but stopped: ignorance, crime, and fear.  Tan argued that the withdrawal process itself may be the ultimate barrier preventing many people entitled to funds from withdrawing them.  Based on inquiries received by Etherscan, Tan said that many people are still uncertain which of the multiple possible processes they need to follow and how to interact with what he describes as a ""multi-stage contract"".  But according to cybercrime investigator and founder of the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory at the Defense Cyber Crime Center, Ken Zatyko, illegal behavior may also account for some of the unclaimed money.  Zatyko is a senior manager at Deloitte and founder of blockchain security firm Buffalo Blockchain. Zatyko said that the publicity caused by the DAO hacker may have made some token-owners concerned that an investigation similar to that which resulted in the arrest of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht might currently be underway.  Zatyko told CoinDesk:  ""If account holders used ether-related gambling sites, or were concerned about capital gains from crowd source related ether coins, they may want to await any further actions to ensure they are not being investigated by the Feds in related cases.""  According to Rush, fear may prove the ultimate obstacle to withdrawal.  Specifically, he mentioned unintended consequences such as the replay attacks common last month, an incident which found transactions being logged on both blockchains as an example of possible negative results for which users were unprepared.  Regardless of why the withdrawal rate continues to slow, one thing is certain. Without a back door to that account, either that money will stay there forever, or more extreme measures to recoup the funds will need to be discussed.

42427015,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyb3h,1471886077,Sberbank Considers Russian Blockchain Consortium,"One of Russia's largest financial institutions is in discussions to join a domestic bank consortium that would study blockchain technology.  Announced in April, the consortium effort is being led by Russian payments firm Qiwi and international consulting firm Accenture. Banks said to be participating in the initiative, according to government news source TASS, include B&N Bank, MDM Bank, Bank of Khanty-Mansiysk and Tinkoff Bank.  President of Sberbank German Gref remarked late last week that talks about the consortium remain in early stages.  Gref said:  ""We are now discussing this with the Central Bank. If the Central Bank [and] all participants agree, then we are definitely going to participate, but we are in active negotiations.""  The news comes at a time when Russia-based financial firms are becoming more ambitious in their plans for blockchain technology.  Qiwi, for example, recently said it could transition to a blockchain settlement system within five years. Elsewhere, the National Settlement Depository, the country’s sole central securities depository, is testing applications for the tech in its operations.

42427009,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyarh,1471883470,Japanese Firms Test Blockchain for E-Check Management,"The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and tech giant Hitachi are now working on a blockchain proof-of-concept aimed at e-check management.  The prototype system, according to the two companies, seeks to create a digital platform for ""issuing, transferring and collecting electronic checks"". Nikkei reports that further trials are expected to take place in the coming days, and that a full-scale version could see wider release in 2018.  Hitachi said in a statement:  ""Using the system, BTMU issues and settles checks and some of Hitachi Group companies in Singapore receive the electronic check and deposit the funds. Through the PoC testing, Hitachi and BTMU will be able to identify issues from various perspectives such as technology, security, operation and legal perspectives and aim to realize new FinTech services including digitalization of checks.""  The project's disclosure comes months after Hitachi announced the formation of a R&D laboratory focused on FinTech, including blockchain. At the time, the firm had only recently become a member of the Hyperledger project, the Linux Foundation-led initiative focused on commercial blockchain applications.  The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ has invested notable resources already in the blockchain industry, investing in Coinbase and taking part in a series of trials based on the technology.  Thus far, the bank has explored use cases such as promissory note trading and digital currency.

42427018,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyb5h,1471874412,Bitfinex to Offer Company Equity to Reimburse Customer Losses,"Bitfinex customers may soon have a way to convert the digital assets they were issued following the exchange's decision to socialize losses into equity in the company.  Weeks after a debilitating hack, Bitfinex has signed a letter of intent with investment platform BnkToTheFuture that finds the two firms collaborating to enable the redemption of BFX tokens for equity in iFinex Inc, its British Virgin Islands-based parent company.  Introduced when the exchange came back online on 11th August, BFX tokens are meant to make up for the 36% customer losses imposed after the incident. Issued to customers at a $1 value, the value of the blockchain-based token was $0.38 at press time.  In statements, Bitfinex CEO Jean Louis van der Velde stated that the firm is committed to releasing further updates on the hack and providing more clarity on the company’s financials before enabling the conversion of BFX tokens into equity.  While the announcement moves Bitfinex's plan forward, it remains a controversial one given that its legality is largely unknown.  Proponents of the system have argued the issuance is a more advantageous deal for exchange users when compared to a formal bankruptcy. For example, customers of now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox are still largely waiting to be reimbursed for losses more than two years after the exchange shuttered.  Critics suggest that the issuance could lead to regulatory intervention, cautioning that lawsuits also remain a possibility should aggrieved customers seek more formal action.  As for how the partnership will move forward from the letter of intent, the exchange was less definitive.  Bitfinex community director Zane Tackett told CoinDesk:  ""The next steps are to continue our discussions with BnkToTheFuture and work towards putting this plan in action.""

42427019,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyb9h,1471871793,UK Blockchain Projects Near Regulatory Approval,"UK regulators are reportedly moving forward with efforts that would find blockchain firms exiting a sandbox program aimed at encouraging innovation.  According to a report by The Financial Times, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently considering whether to approve several blockchain-based products for use by domestic consumers and businesses.  Sources told the news source a ""small but significant number"" of projects are being reviewed, and that details would be made available in the coming months.  News that the FCA is developing an approval process for blockchain projects comes months after bitcoin payments firm Circle Internet Financial became the first to receive an e-money license in April, a move that enabled it to formally extend services to the UK.  FCA directory of strategy and competition Chris Woolard told the media outlet that the FCA is looking at startups in areas where the regulator may be keen to encourage innovation, and that compliance may be one such sector.  Woolard was quoted as saying:  ""We do think [blockchain] has got some potentially interesting applications and we are talking to firms thinking about how to apply that to financial services and how it could benefit consumers or indeed make the business of compliance easier.""  The comments come months after the agency indicated its openness toward a light-touch regulatory approach to blockchain startups in the UK. At the time, Woolard said it was ""crucial"" that regulators give innovators room to create products and services.
