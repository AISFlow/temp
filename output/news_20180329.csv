42428754,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrRh,1522359097,Ether Drops Below $400 to Hit Lowest Price Since November,"The price of ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, fell below $400 on Thursday for the first time since November.  Ether hit a low of $387.85, according to CoinDesk data, and as of press time is trading at roughly $394. On GDAX, the cryptocurrency exchange operated by startup Coinbase, ETH is currently trading at around $392.  The cryptocurrency's price hasn't been below the $400 level since November 23, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time, the price had nearly reached an all-time high and would go on to surpass $1,200 as the broader cryptocurrency market shot to its peak.  As previously reported, ether is one of several major cryptocurrencies to take a hit during Thursday's trading session. Others in the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including bitcoin cash and Ripple's XRP token, also hit lows for 2018.  Ether isn't the only cryptocurrency to see significant moves in today's session. In the last hour, bitcoin's price dropped to a low of $7,016.53, according to the Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), only to leap back to $7,165.26 as of press time.

42428741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdr1h,1522357530,Intel Wants to Patent a Bitcoin Mining Hardware 'Accelerator',"Tech giant Intel is seeking to patent a hardware ""accelerator"" for bitcoin mining chips, a newly-published filing reveals.  The application  for a ""Bitcoin Mining Hardware Accelerator With Optimized Message Digest and Message Scheduler Datapath"" was published on Thursday, though it was originally submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in September 2016. In the filing, Intel outlines a method by which it could augment the existing bitcoin mining process, consuming less electricity – thereby spending less money – in the process.  As Intel writes in the filing:  ""Because the software and hardware utilized in Bitcoin mining uses brute force to repeatedly and endlessly perform SHA-256 functions, the process of Bitcoin mining can be very power-intensive and utilize large amounts of hardware space. The embodiments described herein optimize Bitcoin mining operations by reducing the space utilized and power consumed by Bitcoin mining hardware.""  Intel's application goes on to note that its ""accelerator"" approach could reduce power use by as much as 35 percent, compared to general-purpose processors.  It's a notable filing from a firm once connected to the mining operation of Silicon Valley startup 21 Inc., which soon offered its eponymous bitcoin computer and later pivoted to a social network offering called Earn.com. As CoinDesk reported in 2015, Intel built chips for 21 at its foundry, though a hinted plan to integrate the chips into other Intel products never materialized.  Notably, Intel suggested that the concept isn't limited to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), but ""processors, [systems on chip], and [field-programmable gate array] platforms"" as well. Put more simply, the ""accelerator"" could be applied to an array of mining set-ups.  Though not explicitly focused on cryptocurrency mining, a previous patent application from Intel published in December suggested that the tech giant sees a role for the energy-intensive process in genetic sequencing.

Email distribution company MailChimp will bar marketing campaigns for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings starting next month.  In an email sent to a MailChimp customer and obtained by CoinDesk, the company said that it will no longer allow its service to be used for crypto campaigns because they are ""too frequently associated with scams, fraud, phishing, and potentially misleading business practices.""  The policy change will take effect on April 30, according to the email.  ""We made this decision to update our Acceptable Use Policy in order to protect the millions of businesses that use MailChimp for their marketing,"" the email added. The company also made a point to note that ""we recognize blockchain technology is in its infancy and has tremendous potential.""  The prohibition is reflected in the firm's acceptable use policy, which was updated on Thursday and states:  ""...we cannot allow businesses involved in any aspect of the sale, transaction, exchange, storage, marketing or production of cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an Initial Coin Offering, to use MailChimp to facilitate or support any of those activities.""  The firm – which allows customers to automate email campaigns and is frequently used for marketing purposes – is the latest to put in place a ban on cryptocurrency-related ads.

42428745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrBh,1522348203,Game Giant Unity to Work With Kik's ICO Token,"The Kin Foundation wants game developers to help take the kin cryptocurrency mainstream – and it has just scored the assistance of industry giant Unity Technologies.  Unity is the maker of a popular game engine that can be used by other developers. Notable games built with Unity's engine include Cuphead, Pokémon Go and Kerbal Space Program, among numerous others.  The company is the first participant in kin's ""decentralized ecosystem for digital services and applications."" Created by messaging app firm Kik, the initial coin offering of the kin token garnered $98 million last year.  The foundation will work with Unity to develop a gaming-specific software development kit (SDK) that will allow millions of Unity developers to integrate kin – hosted on both the ethereum and stellar blockchains – into their designs, it announced on Thursday.  ""The SDK will allow all game developers to design with kin and blockchain technology at the core,"" Dany Fishel, EVP of Partnerships at Kin, told CoinDesk in an interview.  In practical terms, this means that the team will introduce a wallet and a marketplace for developers, Fishel explained. After emerging from its beta stage, the SDK will be open sourced and available in the Unity Asset store, as well as shared on GitHub.  The foundation intends for the kit to ""bring monetization tools to developers,"" and will facilitate three particular use cases – the first of which is peer-to-peer value exchange in mobile games. For example, Fishel said, players could ""reward one another for the knowledge they can share"" about unlocking game levels or other features.  Gamer push  The SDK is also intended to enable developers to reward users for ""being good citizens of the apps"" by reporting bugs or providing feedback.  Likewise, the kit would provide another means of monetization by allowing brands to interact with players by rewarding them for completing surveys.  Fishel also spoke to why the foundation sees the gaming industry as an ideal foundational participant for the kin ecosystem.  ""Gamers in general already have a strong understanding of digital currency to being with,"" he explained. ""Game developers are the first ones to adopt technologies, they are the first ones to adopt innovation. So we see them specifically as a very natural audience to endorse a cryptocurrency.""  Fishel added that that the integration of kin into the gaming world is just the beginning of the creation of a larger ecosystem. While developers will provide the cryptocurrency within the context of a game, users will eventually be able to spend it outside the game as more partners come onboard.  Although Fishel was unable to reveal who the next partners will be, he told CoinDesk to anticipate collaborations with ""community-driven apps that will provide great ways to earn and spend for users,"" to be announced within the coming weeks.

42428751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrNh,1522346408,"Scammers Are Posing As Crypto Exchange Support Staff, Says FBI","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said Wednesday that consumers should watch out for would-be scammers posing as cryptocurrency exchange support staffers.  The agency's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) sounded the alarm about tech support scams in the March 28 notice, stating that it constitutes ""a problematic and widespread scam."" In its statement, the center said that consumers submitted roughly 11,000 complaints and claimed losses in excess of $11 million connected to tech support fraud in 2017.  According to the FBI warning, cryptocurrency investors are becoming an increasingly more common target for fraudsters, ""with individual victim losses often in the thousands of dollars.""  The scam plays out like this: fake support numbers are posted online, which are then found by victims who are looking for information. During the course of conversation, the scammer directs the victim to send their cryptocurrency to a ""temporary"" wallet while the issues are addressed. But in these instances, the funds are never returned.  ""The fraudulent support asks for access to the victim’s virtual currency wallet and transfers the victim’s virtual currency to another wallet for temporary holding during maintenance,"" IC3 explained. ""The virtual currency is never returned to the victim, and the criminal ceases all communication.""  The warning highlights the lengths to which scammers seeking to defraud cryptocurrency users will go to find targets. But this isn't a new phenomenon: a number of popular online platforms, from Google to Facebook to Twitter, have been used as a conduit for fraud, prompting the companies behind them to cut off advertising for crypto-services and token sales in particular.  Other frauds masquerading as real entities include a recent wave of fake websites pretending to sell tokens for message app Telegram's ongoing token sale.

42428752,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrPh,1522342807,'Colored Coins' Startup Coinprism Is Shutting Down,"Coinprism, an online wallet service for ""colored coins"" founded in 2014, is closing its doors this weekend.  The startup said in a message on its website that it would shut down on Saturday and advised users to ""withdraw your funds and export your private keys before this date.""  Coinprism was arguably ahead of its time. By using the bitcoin blockchain to create tokens representing other assets, its colored coins presaged the rise of ethereum and other networks built explicitly for such use cases.  But as founder and chief executive Flavien Charlon pointed out in an email to CoinDesk, much has changed since 2014, both on the tech and regulatory fronts.  ""While we have been one of the first in the area of blockchain tokens, long before ethereum was even released, the ecosystem has since shifted towards ERC-20, which is more flexible and more powerful than bitcoin-based systems,"" he wrote, adding:  ""The unpredictability of transactions fees and confirmation times in the past couple of years have also made it hard to argue bitcoin is a good platform for this.""  Stepping back, Coinprism is one of a number of companies that sought to focus on colored coins, or bitcoins bearing extra pieces of data that give them a greater degree of uniqueness by way of the protocol's scripting language.  Colored coins can serve as digitized stand-ins for real-world assets, for example, or represent things like loyalty points.  Yet as Charlon pointed out, work in this area has largely shifted to ethereum and other platforms. Many such tokens in circulation today are based on ethereum's ERC20 standard.  Charlon also said the long-term business model of Coinprism was problematic, given the growing regulatory scrutiny of the ecosystem and around crypto assets in particular that have been sold through initial coin offerings (ICOs).  He told CoinDesk:  ""We didn't see a business model that would have been viable long term. Regulators are starting to pay attention to the space, and activities around blockchain assets (tokens exchanges, ICO tools and services, etc.) are likely to become heavily regulated in the next 5 years. That means some of these services will have to shut down or restrict their activities, some might go to prison, and only a small number of well capitalized companies will successfully adapt to the regulator's demands.""  Reality check  Past that, Charlon said another reason Coinprism was calling it quits is because the limitations of blockchain were becoming apparent.  As he put it:  ""In 99% of use cases we're seeing, blockchain is unfortunately a sub-optimal choice as a technology. Blockchains have many disadvantages in terms of speed, scalability, costs and user experience. Unless censorship resistance is a critical requirement (which it rarely is, especially in the enterprise blockchain space where participants all know each other), blockchain is rarely the right technological choice.""  The blockchain's vaunted transparency, privacy and cryptographic security can all be achieved ""quite easily"" with a traditional system, Charlon went on to argue.  ""In the end it was about intellectual honesty. I didn't like having to support projects that were trying to use blockchain for the sake of using blockchain, when I knew a centralized, more boring architecture would actually do a better job,"" he concluded.

42428759,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdrZh,1522335648,Major Cryptocurrencies Are Hitting 2018 Lows Today,"Bitcoin's drop to an 11-day low of $7,438 is hogging the limelight, as usual, but other cryptocurrencies are struggling, too.  Today, ether (ETH), Ripple's XRP and bitcoin cash (BCH) all dropped to fresh lows for the year so far. Thursday's market developments highlight the continued crunch in the crypto markets, which has solidified in the months since many crypto-assets soared to all-time highs.  Indeed, during the first week of January, the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market exceeded $800 billion – as of today, that figure has dropped to roughly $275 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Ether  Ethereum's ether token, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to take a beating, and as of press time threatens to drop below the $400 mark. ETH has depreciated by 10 percent in the last 24 hours and is down 47 percent on a year-to-date basis.  It's worth noting that the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) shows that the cryptocurrency is at its most oversold level since December 2016 and, hence, could see a sharp rally if the broader markets regain poise.  XRP  XRP fell to $0.53 soon before press time – the lowest level since Dec. 14, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency's value has depreciated by 8.8 percent in the last 24 hours and, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, it is down 76 percent.  The world's third-largest cryptocurrency hit a record high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, and since then has been steadily losing altitude in line with the broader market. However, as seen in the chart below, the sell-off looks overdone.  XRP daily chart  Bitcoin cash  Meanwhile, bitcoin cash dropped to $757 today, the lowest level since Nov. 10, and was last seen trading at $785. Cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay announced yesterday that it has added support for bitcoin cash – however, the news has failed to put a floor under prices.  The fourth-largest cryptocurrency is down 12 percent on a 24-hour basis, while on a year-to-date basis, it has depreciated by 70 percent.  BCH daily chart  The above chart (with data drawn from Bitfinex) shows that bitcoin cash witnessed a death cross (bearish 50-day MA and 200-day MA crossover) on March 20 and fell to $750 today.  The RSI was bearish and well above the oversold territory on March 20, so the death cross seems to have had an effect – contrary to evidence that it tends to be a lagging indicator arising before an upturn.  A close (as per UTC) below $758 (Feb. 6 low) could yield a deeper sell-off to $719 (September 2017 high). Further losses are unlikely, as the RSI would show oversold condition by then.

42428723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmFh,1522332040,Report: Korean Insurer Denies Claim from Bankrupt Crypto Exchange,"South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit has reportedly had its insurance claim denied months after it closed following a debilitating hack.  In December, Youbit declared bankruptcy after suffering twin hacks over the course of 2017, including one that officials suspected at the time could be traced to North Korea. The second attack, which Youbit said resulted in the loss of ""about 17 percent of total assets,"" led to the exchange's closure.  According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, the exchange filed a claim through a policy it is said to have obtained weeks before the second hack. However, DB Insurance Co., one of South Korea's major property-and-casualty insurers, denied the claim, a spokesperson confirmed to the news source.  While the insurance firm didn't provide a reason for the rejection, Yapian, the operator of the exchange, claimed ""DB Insurance had accused it of trying to rush getting its insurance and failing to disclose important information while negotiating the policy."" the Journal writes. Yapian reportedly hit back, saying DB Insurance is using the allegations as a pretence not to pay out on the claim.  Amid the exchange's post-closure difficulties, investigators reportedly continue to probe the circumstances behind last year's attacks, with a focus on North Korea or actors that may be backed by the reclusive regime.  In a separate report Thursday, the Journal, citing unnamed sources, said the investigation is in its ""infancy"" and that a review of the malicious software employed during the incident is still underway.  Earlier this year, as per a report from Kyodo News, intelligence officials in South Korea briefed lawmakers on North Korea's suspected role in a series of hits on exchanges, including one on Japan's Coincheck exchange that saw over $530 million-worth of cryptocurrency stolen.

In a statement Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority took aim at a firm called Olsson Capital, which, according to the regulator, is based in Sofia, Bulgaria.  ""This firm is not authorized by us and is targeting people in the U.K. Based upon information we hold, we believe it is carrying on regulated activities which require authorization,"" the agency said.  While the firm’s website is currently not accessible, information from Scambroker, a website that scrutinizes securities brokers and dealers, shows that the firm has been handling cryptocurrency trading services and is not registered with the FCA as a licensed broker.  The website further indicates that services available on Olsson Capital include contract for difference (CFD) trading on a variety of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, XRP, dash, ethereum, monero and litecoin. Further, investors need to deposit at least around $250 in order to open an account on the platform, ScamBroker states.  While Olsson Capital has not responded to email enquires from CoinDesk, comments on Scambroker from several investors have claimed that requests for withdrawals have not been proceeded even days after requests.  The notice comes as a continuation of the FCA's efforts to caution the public regarding trading in cryptocurrency-related derivatives, as such activities fall under the jurisdiction of the agency.  As reported by CoinDesk, the regulator issued a warning to the public in November 2017, specifically regarding the risk associated with cryptocurrency CFDs.

To that effort, Fan said, the agency will reinforce its regulatory measures both internally and with external parties to ""rectify different kinds of cryptocurrencies.""  While the remarks didn't disclose much about its plans for cryptocurrencies going forward, they come as part of a widened effort taken by the agency in scrutinizing related projects that may undermine financial health in China.  Fan's comments also echo a previous note in early March from the bank's former governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who struck a critical tone towards cryptocurrency speculation and the perceived risks it poses to the country's financial stability.  Additionally, a notice from China's Ministry of Public Security in January in which the agency, which manages the country's police force, said it will take aim at cryptocurrency-related pyramid schemes.  Earlier this month, reports also suggested that the Public Information Network Security Supervision agency under the Ministry of Public Security has been expanding the scope of its internet monitoring to overseas cryptocurrency exchanges that are servicing domestic investors.

42428729,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmRh,1522321258,"Bitcoin's Lightning Network Is Live, But Can It Keep from Going Corporate?","Not yet out of beta, hundreds of developers around the world are already experimenting with bitcoin's newest technology – the Lightning Network – donating time and resources to help lay the groundwork for a more scalable version of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency yet created.  So great has been the effort that there are now more than 1,000 lightning nodes estimated to be running the software on live computers, largely at a loss, but motivated by the greater gain of making the bitcoin network more accessible and affordable. Still, with the network entering its bootstrapping phase, some are beginning to question when the economics of scale may begin to bring new pressures.  As the bitcoin community saw with the rise of cryptocurrency mining, in which at-home mining via PCs was quickly outpaced by industrial operations, profits attract corporate interests. And experts admit, it's entirely possible that companies could make money by offering easy access to quick cryptocurrency payments.  ""If an entity is going to put a lot of value into payment channels and operate the node for generating profit,"" former BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp said. ""Then it's probably going to be similar to mining.""  Lopp's argument is that all networks, no matter how grassroots at the start, eventually give way to specialists who are simply better at offering a more reliable services at a more affordable cost. In the case of Lightning, almost anyone with the technical skills and a little cryptocurrency can run Lightning channels, but offering a service in the future might be different.  For example, users of the network might not always be able to rely on the availability of others they're sending money to, meaning intermediaries could emerge that offer services with better liquidity and payment routing.  ""The [Lightning Network] will effectively centralize bitcoin with 'channels' and 'hubs' on the sidechains. These hubs will essentially function as banks,"" a Twitter user going under the handle @marcotweetss said.  In many critics' minds, institutions might offer so many of the biggest payment channels that they would essentially coalesce into ""hubs."" That's what Forbes and CoinDesk contributor Frances Coppola pointed out when she tweeted: ""Lightning nodes are full-reserve banks, and the network is essentially a correspondent banking scheme.”  Beyond rogue volunteers, there's also the involvement of companies such as Blockstream, ACINQ, and Lightning Labs, which have done a lot of the heavy-lifting related to the open-source Lightning Network software, and who, in the minds of critics, might be apt to play these roles.  These companies currently offer their services for free, even though they are venture-backed – Lightning Labs recently secured $2.5 million and Blockstream has raised $80 million so far – and as such, it's believed they'll eventually need to find a way to generate profits.  This business opportunity worries some cryptocurrency enthusiasts. After all, Silicon Valley startups from Facebook to Twitter have long perfected the model of getting users hooked on a free service, only to later embrace practices at scale that may not have the best interests of users in mind.  Yet, there are several reasons that, for the time being, there's little need to worry.  Cooperative implementations  For one, cheap access is emerging as a crucial difference between bitcoin's blockchain and the Lightning Network.  In this way, MIT researcher Thaddeus Dryja, co-author of the original Lightning Network white paper and the former CTO of Lightning Labs, believes the network will avoid corporate centralization overall because of its design, which doesn't require expensive or specialized hardware.  According to Dryja, users will be able to freely abandon institutional players that try to exert too much influence over individuals.  ""Let’s say everyone is using Amazon, for example, and Amazon says we’ll also route payments between users,"" Dryja said. ""If that node starts doing things people don’t like, it’s very cheap to close it. They never have your money.”  Along those lines, Lightning app developer Elaine Ou, argues that the barrier to entry for providing the default software is low, meaning should one company embrace poor practices, alternatives could quickly arise.  “There are two other Lightning implementations in use already, so I'm not too worried about centralization. The specs are open and updated through an open process,"" she said.  None of this is to say the Lightning Network is infallibly egalitarian. The system still favors players with technical and financial resources, since channels need to have money in order to facilitate transactions. Parties with a large amount of capital could offer network nodes with more liquidity.  Dryja told CoinDesk that institutional players will probably factor into this growing network, saying:  “Having more large nodes is more efficient. I think it will be exchanges becoming the dominant players, at least in the first few years, and that’s not great. It would be great if people were running nodes off of Raspberry Pis in their houses.""  That's why Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk that her team strives to make the technology collaborative yet distinct from any company, including her namesake startup, adding: ""The Lightning Network specification is open and anyone can build a compatible implementation.""  Lightning developer Jack Mallers, who created the free Zap Lightning wallet on top of Lightning Labs' lnd software, will soon release consumer applications for both mobile and desktop. Those interfaces will make it even easier for average people to use Lightning without relying on corporate channels.  Low barrier to entry  It's entirely possible that inherent fees could make Lightning too expensive for average users to constantly open and close channels. But so far, this isn't the case.  Unlike bitcoin mining, which requires a great deal of expensive electricity, it usually costs just a few cents to open a Lightning channel. A channel hosting over 100,000 transactions still costs less than $20 to operate.  “Competition is really high on the network and the barrier to entry is low,"" Mallers said, pointing to the fact he's already gotten 19 volunteer developers to help him build Zap.  He added:  ""Similar to the way people have bitcoin wallets on their phone today, eventually what you’ll be able to do is you’ll have a Lightning node on an iPhone or desktop, and it will be contacting other full nodes on the network, totally separate from your machine, pinging it for information.""  In fact, the upcoming Zap interface is just one of several Lightning projects allowing users to run a Lightning node without piggybacking on more complex bitcoin or litecoin nodes. Amazon might someday be able to offer the most efficient nodes, but any tech-savvy person with a laptop or mobile device will be able to tap into its stream.  Thanks to something called a light client, those independent Lightning nodes can talk to other nodes to stay up to date on what is happening in the broader bitcoin network. There are already roughly 500 people participating in Zap group chats through platforms like Slack.  There are certainly tradeoffs. People with light clients won't have all the blockchain data at their fingertips.  Regardless, this beginner-friendly option makes the lightning network remarkably different than cryptocurrency mining. As for companies like Lightning Labs and Blockstream, they have an economic incentive to avoid becoming legacy middlemen providers.  Reputations at stake  As for the allegations that one of these companies could become another Facebook, there are reasons that this isn't exactly likely, either.  Lightning Labs, for instance, benefits from cooperation with developers like Mallers and Ou, who aren't on Stark's payroll. For blockchain startups working on this open-source technology, their professional reputation relies on their perceived efforts to keep the bitcoin network mostly decentralized.  Corporate interests generally consolidate power and access, but the bitcoin community has proven it will combat such efforts, such as when a small group of people forked the bitcoin network to create bitcoin gold in an effort to curb industrial miners. Of course, the Lighting Network is much younger than bitcoin, and a split like that could have wider implications for the Lighting community.  If entrepreneurs want to continue spearheading Lightning development, they will have to avoid aligning themselves with any party seeking disproportionate influence.  “We don't currently operate any Lightning nodes and that's not part of our plan. We build infrastructure for other people to operate nodes and for the network as a whole,"" Stark told CoinDesk.  Lightning Labs investor and BitGo CTO Ben Davenport echoed her sentiment, saying, ""They are not going to monetize the protocol directly. But there are always opportunities for smart teams, who are early in an important space, to develop business models.""  Dryja told CoinDesk it’s still too early to say how this young technology will impact decentralization at large.  However, Mallers is optimistic because channel operators never take custody of user funds. Plus, anyone with the technical skills can actually choose the path their payments take. It will be easy for cypherpunks to avoid corporate channels.  “You’re never reliant on any third party. You can even do configuration and choose which path you want to take,"" Mallers said. ""You can route around certain participants in the network if needed.""  Blockstream developer Rusty Russell believes Lightning's community pendulum will swing back towards greater decentralization in the long run, and that the barrier to entry is the chief reason.  ""It's easier to accept Lightning payments than it is to accept on-chain [bitcoin] payments. So we're seeing more people controlling their own payment infrastructure,"" he said, adding:  ""I think that will increase as we make the entire stack more usable, and it's an excellent trend for the health of the ecosystem.""

42428740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmjh,1522317042,$7K Next? Bitcoin Bears Pull Off Downside Break,"Bitcoin (BTC) bears have come out victorious in the two-day tug of war with the bulls and may push prices down to $7,000.  The cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrow range of $8,140 and $7,700 since March 27, according to Bitfinex data. At one point in time yesterday, it appeared as though the bulls had found their footing, thanks to an upside break of the descending trendline and a bullish triangle breakout.  Yet, bitcoin failed to chew through the supply around the $8,000 mark in the U.S. session, allowing the bears to take over. Accordingly, BTC fell below $7,700 at 04:00 UTC today.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,530 on Bitfinex. Further, the average price across leading exchanges, as represented by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index is seen at $7,540 – down 5 percent compared to the previous day's close of $7,937 (as per UTC).  4-hour chart  The downside break of the sideways channel signals continuation of the sell-off from the March 24 high of $9,050. The relative strength index (RSI) shows a bear flag breakdown, which adds credence to the bearish set up on the price chart.  So, BTC looks set to test $7,260 (target as per the measured height method) to $7,240 (March 8 low). Additionally, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the Feb. 6 low to Feb. 20 high stands at $7,239 as seen on the daily chart below.  Daily chart  The 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are biased to the bears (sloping downwards). The RSI has also become bearish.  As per the daily chart, BTC is stuck inside a falling channel (lower highs and lower lows) and could drop to $6,100–$6,000 (falling channel support) if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the immediate support at $7,240. That said, the weekly chart (not shown) shows, strong support around $6,600.  The much-feared and overhyped death cross could happen today if BTC falls to $7,000 and might accentuate the losses. However, as discussed yesterday, the death cross could be a blessing in disguise for the bulls, as the bearish signal is often soon followed by an upturn.  View  BTC looks set to test $7,240 and could possibly break lower to $7,000. Such a move will likely push the 50-day MA below the 200-day MA (the death cross).  Being a lagging indicator, the death cross is unlikely to do significant damage, thus BTC may be able to avoid a weekly close below $6,600.  On the higher side, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $8,135 (upper end of the sideways channel) would abort the bearish view.

The application is said to provide a more secure and anonymous method for absentee residents to cast their votes.  According to a white paper about the pilot project, lending technological support is Voatz, a voting technology startup that has previously raised $2.2 million from Medici Ventures, the subsidiary of online retail giant Overstock.com.  The effort comes as a result of technological obstacles that absentee voters from the military have encountered with the current ""cumbersome"" system, according to Warner.

The new mobile voting system resolves these concerns,"" the paper says.  Further down the road, Warner said the plan is to extend the effort to all 55 of the state's counties during the 2018 general election in November if the pilot proves to be successful.

According to a report by Shanghai Securities News Thursday, Zhang Yifeng, head of the China Banknote Blockchain Research Center, said the research and development of a digital fiat currency is on-going in China, adding that an estimated launch schedule remains unknown.  A government-funded organization, the centerhttp://www.zcblockchain.com/aboutus.html was formed under the China Banknote Credit Card Industry Development, which is fully state-owned by the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, a direct subordinate of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank.  The comments also follow previous remarks by PBoC's former governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who said in a press conference earlier in March that the development of a central bank-backed digital currency is ""inevitable,"" while not ruling out the option of building such a digital currency on distributed ledger technology.  Zhang's comments also provide clarification on the subject after his previous denial of recent rumors that have spread across the Chinese media suggesting that the country has already launched a central bank digital currency. Earlier this week during at a financial technology summit in Hangzhou, Zhang called such rumors fake news, but did not provide further detail.  In his latest statements, Zhang said even if with the launch of a central bank digital currency, it will not replace the existing monetary mechanism immediately.

42428731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdmVh,1522293941,What It's Like to Talk to the SEC About Your ICO,"It didn't take long for Scott Nelson to realize he was only non-lawyer in the conference room.  There amidst attorneys from various government agencies, including the SEC, the CEO of blockchain startup Sweetbridge and long-time logistics tech specialist was prepared to discuss his company's forthcoming initial coin offering (ICO). The lawyers on his team had tried to persuade him not to go.  It was an audacious move seeing that the SEC has recently begun dozens of investigations into various stakeholders involved in the sale and marketing of ICOs as part of an effort to better understand when such products meet definitions laid out in U.S. securities law.  Nonetheless, Nelson waved off his lawyers advice, instead asking the SEC to meet him face-to-face.  And according to Nelson, that was the right move.  ""I have always felt that the best thing to do was to talk to people,"" Nelson told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. ""I didn’t think a lawyer would be able to well represent what we’d like to do.""  And what Sweetbridge would like to do is launch two crypto tokens – one representing an asset-backed stablecoin and another that provides access to discounts on a protocol so that token holders can get better terms on their loans in an effort to unlock capital held in assets in a supply chain.  But Sweetbridge has been worried that regulators in the U.S. might impose rules that would classify the tokens as securities (a characterization Sweetbridge objects to), thus pushing the startup out of the market.  For many ICO-financed firms, the SEC's recent actions have largely made them surrender on the idea that new crypto tokens created and sold to investors could be considered ""utility tokens,"" a term denoting a digital commodity meant to represent digitally unique data on a blockchain protocol.  That said, Nelson went to the SEC in the hopes of changing that narrative and displaying why tokens that are not categorized as securities are needed to make certain blockchain business models work.  And while the regulators didn't render a verdict on the company's plan, Nelson came away with a positive view of what the SEC and other regulators are trying to do as they get their heads around a market that has exploded over the past year.  In particular, Nelson got the impression from comments made during the meeting that the SEC was frustrated about the lack of ICO executives that were willing to sit down and discuss their business.  He said:  ""I think this is a case where the American use of lawyers — and overdependence on them, I think — is probably hurting the industry.""  An open SEC  The reason this could be hurting the industry, according to Nelson, is that the SEC wants to hear not just the legal justification of crypto tokens, but about specific business models.  ""I was super pleased that the meeting started with a request not to talk about tokens and the law but to just explain the business case,"" Nelson said.  He went on to laud the SEC for its ability to ask smart questions – the sorts of things he thought exhibited thoughtful interest in what his company was trying to do.  While Sweetbridge wants to start enabling liquidity for crypto assets, its aspirations are bigger, in that one day they hope to allow a trucking company that wants to install a gas-saving platooning system in its vehicles to be able to borrow against the value of the fleet itself to pay for those upgrades. The users of the platform, both individuals and businesses, will be lending money to themselves through the use of the stablecoin, as Sweetbridge explains it.  Overall, Nelson's firm wants to create an ecosystem of companies who transact on its protocol – lenders, borrowers, servicers and more.  It's a new way of thinking about supply chain financing, but according to Nelson, those at the SEC had already considered the possibility. For example, when the issue of reporting came up, Nelson said there were comments in the room that acknowledged the protocol itself might be able to do the reporting, which wasn't something he expected to hear.  Nelson told CoinDesk:  “I found their questions unusually lucid and intelligent”  As such, Nelson believes the SEC is not only more knowledgeable about the space than some in the crypto community think, but are also far more open to crypto tokens than what many initially presumed.  The SEC declined to comment on this story.  Send the CEOs  Still, Sweetbridge was unable to get a formal decision on how the SEC would view its upcoming token sale.  But, that's not to say nothing could come out of the talks. Specifically, Nelson now hopes to obtain a ""no action letter,"" a commitment from the SEC that it won't come after a company because it doesn't see anything objectionable in its business plan.  ""They have to go back and circulate ideas internally,"" Nelson said. ""I would expect they’ll come back with more questions.""  Sweetbridge, though, believes its essential to offer its token without registering it as security, so as to not exclude a lot of small businesses from using its token to better access capital. Yet, if the SEC does categorize Sweetbridge's token as a security, the company plans merely to cut off potential users based in the U.S.  And Nelson made that last part clear during the meeting. Although Nelson believes that's not what the SEC wants.  ""They keep saying its facts and circumstances. They have to be looking for a set of facts and circumstances where they can say: 'This is all right, [because] if they just shut it down, I think they realize the U.S. is going to be disadvantaged,'"" he said.  Meanwhile, Nelson believes it would help if more ICO issuers went to talk to regulators about their business models.  ""I know there’s this group of lawyers who have been trying to meet with and lobby the SEC. How come it’s not the CEOs of projects? What do the lawyers know? We are the actual developers of the technology, the practitioners,"" he said, adding:  ""Why do we have to go through these intermediaries when we’re all about not having intermediaries?""
