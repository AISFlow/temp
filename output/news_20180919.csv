42429693,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hJh,1537392336,"Bitcoin's Price Swings to Nearly $6,500 in Volatile Trading Hour","Bitcoin's volatility was on full display on Wednesday when its price fell from $6,300 to $6,100 before shooting up to $6,500 – all within an hour's time.  As of press time, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $6,422, up 5 percent from the day's low of $6,117. The market did not waste time making its bullish move, scaling over 6 percent in less than 20 minutes to ultimately hit a high of $6,494, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Coincidentally, the move occurred within just minutes of a CBOE Bitcoin Futures expiration. Bitcoin futures expirations have been documented as having a turbulent effect on the price of the underlying cryptocurrency, so an increase in market volatility perhaps could have been foreseen.  Bitcoin's move today is more shocking than its usual volatility, as an important technical level of price support of $6,200 was breached, signaling bears were primed to drive prices lower. Evidently, that turned out not to be the case since it is clear demand still exists above the $6,000 mark.  CoinMarketCap data shows that the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market rose to roughly $201 billion during the market uptick, up roughly 4 percent and $8 billion from Wednesday's low.  At the time of writing, the 24-hour growth for other well-known cryptocurrencies is not quite as dramatic, although seven of the ten biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have seen positive price developments.

42429686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0h9h,1537387312,Bitcoin Core Developers Move to Fix Denial-of-Service Software Bug,"An abnormally severe bug was discovered in bitcoin's software, prompting developers to put together and release a fix on Tuesday.  Fixed and revealed to the wider public by way of Bitcoin Core software version 0.16.3, the vulnerability is a denial-of-service bug. If exploited, it can be used to take out nodes and at worst, temporarily crash a significant segment of the network.  However, not everyone has the power to take advantage of the bug. Only miners – those that run hardware and spend energy ordering transactions on the network – can exploit the vulnerability by double spending a transaction and placing it in a block.  But, it's not exactly painless for them to execute, either. If they try the attack, they would lose their block reward, which is worth more than $75,000 at today's prices.  The vulnerability was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 0.14.0, which was first released in March 2017. But the issue wasn't found until just two days ago, prompting contributors to the codebase to take action and ultimately release a tested fix within 24 hours.  And luckily, most bitcoin users don't have to do anything to be protected from the vulnerability now.  Developers stressed that ""stored"" bitcoins are not at risk. Yet, it could impact those using the Lightning network, an in-development transaction layer that seeks to allow faster and cheaper transactions.  Still, because the bug is potentially dangerous for the network, developers strongly advise users who are running so-called ""full nodes"" that store bitcoin's complete transaction history to upgrade their software. Moderator Theymos also pinned a notice to the top of the bitcoin subreddit.  The Bitcoin Core notes describing the software patch state:  ""We urge all network participants to upgrade to [the new software] as soon as possible.""  Impacting Lightning  As it turns out, a popular quote in tech circles aptly applies to this kind of bug.  ""A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable,"" said famous computer scientist Leslie Lamport.  In this particular circumstance, a miner making a faulty transaction can impact nodes running across the network. As noted in the Bitcoin OpTech newsletter, a miner would need to try to double spend some bitcoin in order to crash bitcoin nodes.  Bitcoin's code is set up to largely to guard against this kind of problem, but this bug shows how a way around such measures managed to seep through.  Perhaps the biggest impact is on bitcoin-tied technology that isn't ready for primetime. If this attack were to be executed, bitcoin users running Lightning on the mainnet could be impacted.  ""If you're reckless enough to be running lightning, you should really update ASAP, or close your channels. Updating is easy enough luckily,"" Blockstream engineer Gregory Sanders urged on reddit.  Since Lightning is in such an early stage, it requires users to watch their ""channels,"" which hold their bitcoins in the experimental layer. That way they can stop a party they've established a channel with if that party attempts to cheat. Of particular concern here though: if a user's node is crashed by a miner exploiting this bug, a malicious actor could use the opportunity to cheat other Lightning users.  Even so, some developers argue that successfully doing all of this would be pretty hard to accomplish.  ""I find it highly unlikely it has much of an impact,"" developer Justin Camarena told CoinDesk.  That's why some argue that regular users don't need to worry about it, although there's been a general sense of urgency in light of the overall risk.  ""Unless you're running a business or lightning network node you really have no funds at risk,"" Sanders added later.  Buggy conclusions  Yet how significant this bug is in the context of bitcoin's history remains difficult to figure out.  Blockchain.info data engineer Antoine Le Calvez tallied up a list of similar exploits made over the years, showing that they were more common in bitcoin's earlier years.  But Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr responded by arguing that exploits might not be decreasing over time as the data suggests.  ""Sadly, I think recent years suffer from lack of disclosure rather than having fewer exploits,"" he said.  He went on to admit he doesn't know why this is the case, but he nonetheless argued that some bugs in the bitcoin software are found and patched up, yet are never publicly disclosed.  Meanwhile, others are drawing other conclusions from the bug – namely that bitcoin programmers are mere mortals. OpenBazaar lead developer Chris Pacia went as far as to argue that while many users argue that bitcoin developers are among the best in the world, this proves they're actually normal developers who run into obstacles.  ""Bugs happen. This is a fact of life,"" he remarked on Twitter. ""I'm not criticizing them for having a bug. I'm criticizing the idiot minimalists who insist Core developers are God-like individuals.""  Still, Camarena thinks that because of the bug's nuances and how difficult the attack is to execute, people are making too big of a deal out of the bug.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's a serious bug, but not as bad as some are making it to believe.""

42429691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hDh,1537380440,Crypto Advocate Cody Wilson Charged With Child Sexual Assault,"Cody Wilson, founder of the 3-D printed gun company Defense Distributed and cryptocurrency advocate, has been charged with sexually assaulting a minor.  According to an affidavit, Wilson was accused of assault against an unnamed minor he allegedly met through an online dating site. Wilson, who has butted heads with the U.S. government over his advocacy for 3-D printed firearms, was one of the main developers of the privacy-centric bitcoin wallet DarkWallet and is a funder of a coding academy launched by developer Amir Taaki.  Magistrate judge Tamara Needles, of the Travis County District Court, found ""probable cause"" for an arrest warrant to be issued, per the affidavit. The charges were first reported by news station KVUE.  Wilson's present location is unknown. Austin Police Department Organized Crime Unit commander Troy Officer said in a press briefing that his last known location was Taipei, Taiwan. Though Wilson had booked a plane ticket back to the U.S., he appears to have missed his flight.  ""We're working with national and international law enforcement partners to locate him and bring him to justice … [and] we're working with the United States Marshals to locate him,"" Officer said.  Wilson reportedly left the country after a friend of the victim told him that police were investigating. However, it is unclear if Wilson already planned to go to Taipei or if he left due to the news, Officer said.  While Wilson is only being charged with sexual assault of a minor at present, more charges may be added later. That being said, Wilson faces anywhere from two to 20 years in prison and a potential $10,000 fine if he is convicted, Officer said.  He later pointed out that paying for sexual intercourse is illegal.  The affidavit notes that the victim, whose identity is being withheld but is described as ""a juvenile female under the age of [17],"" reported meeting Wilson through the website SugarDaddyMeet.com. She told authorities that he identified himself by name after texting him through the app under the screenname ""Sanjuro.""  The affidavit also details video surveillance footage from the Archer Hotel, where the assault allegedly took place, as well as a local restaurant, where cameras captured the victim getting out of Wilson's car after the reported assault.  The video evidence corroborates a statement the victim made to a counselor and law enforcement officials, the affidavit states.  Wilson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

According to the EU-focused law-enforcement organization's ""Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2018"" (IOCTA) report, published on Wednesday, the holdings of those using cryptocurrencies, as well as exchanges, are increasingly at risk as ""criminal abuse"" of the financial technology grows.  Previous Europol reports have indicated that online criminals are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies to fund their illicit activities. As CoinDesk has reported, bitcoin has lost market share to tokens with greater privacy protections, such as zcash and monero. However, it ""still remains the primary cryptocurrency encountered by law enforcement,"" the latest update states.  Notably, the report claimed that the terrorist groups have sought to raise funds using cryptocurrencies – but that to date, none of that money has been used to actually bankroll any attacks in Europe.  ""Yet despite the clear potential, none of the attacks carried out on European soil appear to have been funded via cryptocurrencies,"" Europol noted. ""The use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups has only involved low-level transactions – their main funding still stems from conventional banking and money remittance services.""  Increasingly, Europol goes on, cryptocurrency exchanges, miners and other users face the risk of hacking attempts and even ""extortion of personal data and theft.""  Ecosystem risks  The report also highlights the perceived risks of decentralized exchanges, which that are not controlled by a single centralized entity, saying:  ""Money launderers have evolved to use cryptocurrencies in their operations and are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as decentralised exchanges which allow exchanges without any Know Your Customer requirements. It is likely that high-privacy cryptocurrencies will make the current mixing services and tumblers obsolete.""  The use of illicit crypto mining programs, or cryptojacking, is also listed as an emerging trend in the world of cybercrime.  As reported by CoinDesk, malicious crypto-mining attacks jumped a massive 956 percent from the end of June 2017 to the same date in 2018, overtaking ransomware as the cyber-thief's preferred tool of the trade. Even so, ransomware remains ""the key threat in both law enforcement and industry reporting,"" said Europol.  According to the report, illicit miners hidden in website code – harnessing victims' processor power to mine cryptos – create ""additional revenue streams and therefore motivation for attackers to hack legitimate websites to exploit their visitor systems.  Similarly, mining malware ""can cripple a victims system by monopolising their processing power.""  The report warns that the latter activity is expected to become ""a regular, low-risk revenue stream for cybercriminals.""

According to a news release published Tuesday, the board's commissioner, Travis J. Iles, entered a first emergency cease-and-desist order against Coins Miner Investment Ltd., a Russia-based cryptocurrency investment promoter that has been soliciting funds from Texas residents by pretending to represent U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase.  According to the cease-and-desist, the alleged hoax firm has been sending out email promotions that are designed to appear as if they were issued by the San Francisco-based exchange.  It also used images and video to mislead state residents, the watchdog said. For example, Coins Miner presented an image it claimed was of Ana Julia Lara – a person affiliated with the firm – meeting the president of Ripple. In fact, the photo was apparently a falsely described image of an executive in the crypto media.  Lara also ""falsely claims to work at Coinbase as a cryptocurrency trader,"" the release added.  Coins Miner makes ""numerous fraudulent misrepresentations to try to make its investment offering appear legitimate"" on its website, including claiming to be based in the U.K., but actually working from Volgograd, Russia, according the the release.  In the second emergency order, the Texas regulator is targeting DGBK Ltd., or DigitalBank, a firm that is soliciting funds to develop a claimed ""hack-proof"" crypto wallet device.  The order alleges that DigitalBank is offering equity in the company, alongside the chance to buy its own crypto token called DGBK – claimed to bring returns of 1,900 percent after a supposed initial coin offering (ICO) to be held next year.  Among its promotional activities, the firm also apparently made ""liberal use"" of a video clip of Barack Obama, filmed in 2016, in which the former U.S. president talks generally of tech advances that could one day enable hack-proof devices.  Falsely linking that clip to its own product, DigitalBank said ""try to understand what Obama in 2016 already understood about the company"" on its website, on social media and in messages to investors, the Texas board said.  Further, the investments being offered by the firm are unregistered securities under Texas law, according to the order.  Ranca Romic, the director of DigitalBank, pushed back against the charges in an email, telling CoinDesk: ""We don't sell anything. No ICO. We are a software developer company. We planned maybe a future ICO in late 2019. But for the moment we are just developing the software.""  She added:  ""We just took emails of people that might be interested to invest in the future. The plan was to get back to those potential investors the moment we complete the full development and to cooperate with an investment firm that will legally arrange the ICO.""  Both of DigitalBank's websites (www.digitalbank.capital and www.digitalbank.global) have been down since Tuesday morning.  The third action is focused on Ultimate Assets, which claims to be based in Arlington, Mass., and is soliciting Texas residents for crypto and forex trading services.  However, the scheme ""appears to be a phantom entity,"" says the regulator, having no corporate records in the state of Massachusetts and not being based at the stated address.  Among other claims, according to the emergency order, Ultimate Assets made promises that an initial investment of $1,000 would be worth $10,000 in just three weeks.  The securities board said it considers that the investments being offered by the supposed firm are securities in Texas, but the firm is not registered with the state's securities board.  Coins Miner did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Ultimate Asset could not be reached.

42429687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hBh,1537365545,US Banking Giant PNC Becomes Latest to Adopt Ripple's xCurrent,"American banking giant PNC has joined the growing number of financial institutions using payments products from blockchain startup Ripple.  The bank's Treasury Management division will begin accepting cross-border transactions using the firm's xCurrent product, Ripple's senior vice president, Asheesh Birla, told CoinDesk Wednesday.  One of the top-10 largest banks by assets held in the U.S., PNC has already successfully concluded a pilot phase and proof-of-concept for the payment rail, and will immediately begin using xCurrent in a production environment. For now, Treasury Management will only be accepting inbound transactions using the product.  Birla said:  ""I think the important thing is this is not a test. Ripple only signs production clients, so they are taking this product into production. There's no pilot, there's no proof-of-concept – that's already been done. They've committed to [transactions] with other customers.""  Ripple's SVP believes that small U.S. businesses signed onto RippleNet – the umbrella term for the firm's several payment networks – would especially benefit from banking with PNC as a result of the new integration.  ""Providing instant payments instead of waiting two to three days, that sounds like a short time, [but] that's two to three days without access to capital. Having that is a real game-changer,"" he said.  PNC apparently already has customers lined up to work with xCurrent initially, although Birla was not at liberty to provide any details on those firms.  xRapid too?  While the bank will start by using xCurrent, Birla hopes to ultimately help them begin working with Ripple's xRapid platform as well, he said.  ""With PNC, the idea is to get a few corridors lit up with xCurrent … When they're ready to start talking about emerging markets, we'll introduce them to xRapid. We're working to get them started with xCurrent so it's not a completely new feature to move to xRapid,"" he explained.  More broadly, Ripple announced Wednesday that it has clients in 40 countries across six different continents now, having opened new payment corridors to parts of East and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and South America.  Birla said it is ""exciting"" to see Ripple's efforts begin to be be implemented, particularly in emerging and under-served markets.  The executive also addressed reports suggesting Ripple's xRapid product would be launched in the next month or so.  ""We haven't officially announced a timeline. I think we're really excited about xRapid, I personally am really excited about how our customers in the pilot phase of xRapid like the experience,"" Birla said.

42429690,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hFh,1537363517,Binance Reveals Plan to Launch Crypto Exchanges on Almost Every Continent,"One of the world's largest crypto exchanges by trading volume wants to set up fiat-to-crypto trading platforms on almost every continent.  Binance founder and CEO Zhao Changpeng closed out the first day of CoinDesk's Consensus Singapore event with a fireside chat, where he discussed a range of topics, including how he grew Binance from a startup with a $15 million initial coin offering to one of the world's largest crypto exchanges and his future vision for the platform.  During the conversation with CoinDesk's Pete Rizzo, Zhao indicated that by this time next year, he wants the company to launch five to 10 fiat-to-crypto exchanges, with ideally two per continent.  These plans falls in line with Binance's current efforts to roll out an exchange in Singapore that supports local fiat-to-crypto trading services.  Having conducted closed testing on Tuesday, CZ said he hopes the platform could be up and running within months, though he added that working with banks and regulators is much harder than just with cryptocurrencies.  Noting that this move appears to be a reversal to what Binance has been known for, which is its crypto-to-crypto trading, Zhao admitted that the crypto market capitalization is still significantly lower than traditional financial instruments.  ""Fiat is still where all the money is in. ... And we've got to open that gate,"" he said.  Zhao added that in order to so, Binance plans to continue working with relatively smaller countries, citing recent partnerships with nations like Malta. The main reason, he explained, is that these countries tend to respond in a much more efficient way.  ""You can access to the top-level government officials and they respond to your questions more directly and efficiently. ... And they do appreciate the investment you are bringing into the local economy,"" he said.  That said, Zhao brands this move as more of finding a sweet spot rather than an entire pivot, stating that in the long term, the goal is still to build a decentralized exchange when the technology matures.  The fiat-to-crypto plan also comes as Binance has recorded healthy businesses incomes over the past year despite the overall cryptocurrency market downturn.  During the fireside chat, Zhao confirmed that in the first quarter this year, Binance made $200 million in profits, although the assets are all in cryptos. He added that the profits in Q2 declined due to a market drop, with $150 million.  Commenting on Binance's rapid growth, Zhao said luck played some role in the company's success so far as it was established with the ""right thing at the right time.""  After quitting from OKCoin in 2015, Zhao said he spent the next two years with a team building a cloud-based system that offers crypto exchanges the infrastructure to form their own platforms, a technology he said laid the foundation of the creation of Binance.  And two years later, the exchange went online at a time when the Chinese government was stepping up its scrutiny over crypto trading and eventually issued the ban on domestic initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto trading.  ""Sometimes negative things could turn out to be positive in the long term if you leverage it right,"" he said.  Asked if he was concerned about whether market volatility would significantly affect Binance's business, Zhao responded that he sold his house in 2014 to buy bitcoin, after which its price dropped from $600 to $200. Despite the fall, he he didn't sell, adding: ""After that, I'm just not that worried.""

42429680,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0grh,1537358417,R3's Hearn and Brown Say Enterprise Blockchain's Day of Reckoning Is Here,"This space ain't big enough for all of us.  That about sums up the way R3's technical chiefs, CTO Richard Gendal Brown and lead platform engineer Mike Hearn, view the rivalry among enterprise blockchain solutions.  While it may be more genial and less chaotic than the public blockchain world that Hearn left behind when he quit work on bitcoin in 2016, enterprise tech is still a competitive business. And speaking to CoinDesk last week during R3's CordaCon event in London, the two executives described this game as, if not quite zero-sum, something close.  An enterprise blockchain ""shakeout"" is well underway, said Brown, who before joining R3 spent 15 years as a banking expert at IBM (now arguably a chief adversary of his present employer) and was also an advisor to a young and then-inexperienced Hyperledger.  In order to gain the network effects of blockchains, many firms will have to move at once, Brown told CoinDesk, and they are simply not going to tolerate multiple different platforms all in the same organization.  He added:  ""So that naturally means there has to be a shakeout and a consolidation down to a small number of platforms.""  This boils down to a Big Three, Brown argued: a choice among R3's Corda; Hyperledger, which he acknowledged is ""well governed""; and possibly one of the enterprise ethereum variants, given the conviction behind it, although ""right now we are not seeing it.""  Indeed, there has arguably been a shaking out at the sector level; as previously reported by CoinDesk, the insurance industry, for example, seems to have settled on R3's Corda platform after some deliberation.  But Hearn told CoinDesk this period of reckoning will be wider than just the enterprise space, voicing serious doubts about ethereum in general.  ""I don't think ethereum is going to go anywhere, to be frank,"" said Hearn, adding, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole, ""They have announced they are going to rewrite everything from scratch; that's why I say that.""  Hearn said he found ""ethereum 2.0"" initiatives (like moving to proof of stake and rewriting the virtual machine) ""really surprising.""  ""They have a market position now; what you don't want to do is start a new blockchain with new technology and announce that all of your existing technology is rubbish – which is kind of what they are doing.""  In Hearn's view, this will result in minimal traction in the enterprise space as well as the loss of a lot of momentum in the public blockchain space.  ""So instead of improving what they've got, they are now going to spend a long time rewriting what they've got,"" he said.  Hearn went as far as saying all the time wasted on indecision and infighting in the public space (his exasperation over which famously drove him away from bitcoin) means the really exciting and interesting technological work is happening in enterprise blockchain.  ""I think the really cutting-edge work has actually now moved to companies like us, which are better funded and more focused and not spending time with internal disputes,"" he said.  Tooth and nail  Further underscoring that enterprise blockchain is no hugbox, R3 has been involved in some dust-ups recently.  Last week the startup agreed to a settlement in a dispute with Ripple over a large swath of XRP, the cryptocurrency closely associated with Ripple. While the terms of the settlement are confidential, if the payment to R3 is sizable it could conceivably address the startup's rumored cash flow issues.  And a couple of months back, R3 launched an aggressive bid to provide technology to the Utility Settlement Coin project, which was rebuffed by its consortium of banks.  This type of hustle has earned R3 a reputation as a ""scrappy contender,"" in the words of one industry member.  ""If someone called me that, I'd see it as a compliment,"" responded Brown, adding that firms can choose whatever platform they see fit and Corda does not have an inherent right to be chosen.  He went on:  ""We have to convince them that Corda is the right choice, show them that we understand their problems. So yeah, we fight for every piece of business. Absolutely. We take nothing for granted.""  Brown pointed out that he and Hearn made some architectural decisions early on in the genesis of Corda that were viewed at the time as unusual or controversial and possibly unfashionable.  ""But we have not had to revisit any of them,"" said Brown, ""and apps on earlier versions of Corda continue to work. We don't see any u-turns or major changes on the horizon in the way maybe we see with some of the other platforms.""  But some changes afoot in other areas of the enterprise blockchain space could be interesting to watch play out. Among the possibilities, there could be closer alliances between ethereum and Hyperledger, both in terms of the Sawtooth ethereum implementation (Seth) and work underway involving Fabric and the ethereum virtual machine (EVM).  Asked about this, Brown pointed out that Corda's licensing is identical to Hyperledger's Apache 2.0 – and that from a governance and a licensing process Corda is directly aligned with Hyperledger. (Software licensing is a salient issue for enterprises when choosing which open-source platform to build on, and it has been a complex area for ethereum, although the EVM was successfully brought within Hyperledger and Apache licensing with the Burrow implementation courtesy of Monax).  Yet Hearn was circumspect about any possible alliances between ethereum and Hyperledger.  ""It's not going to change anything fundamentally about the products. So any sort of alliance would be something of a marketing event rather than a major change to way the platforms work,"" he said.  Token gesture  Despite R3's reputation as the quintessential ""I'm interested in the technology, not the currency"" organization, tokenized ownership of assets on Corda is becoming a big deal, especially as the open source community grows.  R3 co-founder Todd McDonald will now focus on tokenizing activity of all stripes, from decentralized governance tokens on Cordite to collateral lending via HQLAx.  Brown said tracking and transferring ownership of real-world assets in a regulation-compliant manner is a sweet spot for Corda right now.  ""You need strong identity and settlement finality to free up these assets, make them liquid,"" he said.  Hearn pointed out that Corda's intellectual origins are basically in bitcoin, more so than ethereum.  Harking back to his early work in the bitcoin space, and a practical vision for cryptocurrency, he said, ""The first app ever written was a cash token app. That's what it's all about: payments, coins.""  Going further with this concept means an exploration beyond technology. For instance, in a recent brainstorming session, Hearn said he was looking at a ""sort of Satoshi-style, free-floating token"" on Corda with no issuer at all.

42429696,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hLh,1537354813,"Bitcoin Price Lacks Direction After Defense of $6,200","Bitcoin (BTC) is trapped in a no-man's land between $6,200 and $6,600, technical charts indicate.  A bear flag breakdown witnessed Monday was expected to yield a drop to $6,000 (February low), but bitcoin's resilience spoiled the bear party.  The leading cryptocurrency bounced off trendline support at $6,202 on the same day and has since risen back above $6,350, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,320 on Bitfinex – up 1.23 percent on the day.  While BTC's defense of the trendline support is encouraging, a bearish-to-bullish trend change would be confirmed only after BTC has moved above the Sept. 14 high of $6,600.  Daily chart        As can be seen, the trendline from June lows (the lower end of the pennant) has worked as a strong support this month and is the level to beat for the bears.  As of writing, pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would confirm a pennant breakdown – a bearish continuation pattern – which would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000.  A breakdown, if it comes, could prove costly: the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is bearish and well above oversold levels, suggesting plenty of scope for a price drop.  Meanwhile, on the higher side, a move above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) would negate Monday's big bearish outside-day candle and confirm a short-term bullish reversal.  4-hour chart  The bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart failed to produce a bearish move toward $6,000. More importantly, BTC has re-entered the flag pattern, weakening the bearish case.  That said, the stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle MA, indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.  Further, the RSI is beginning to roll over in favor of the bears. So, it seems safe to say that prospects of a bull breakout above $6,600 are low.  View  BTC lacks a clear bias, having defended the pennant support in the last two days.  A pennant breakdown will likely yield a drop to the crucial support levels of $5,859 (August low) and $5,755 (June low).  BTC bulls may feel emboldened if the rebound from the pennant support seen on Monday is followed by a convincing move past $6,600 (Sept. 14 high) in the next few days. In this case, BTC could attack the psychological hurdle of $7,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Talking during a panel on crypto derivatives trading at CoinDesk's Consensus Singapore 2018 event, McCourt told the audience that he does not think the introduction of bitcoin futures products resulted in the recent market downturn.  ""We are just a small part of the market,"" he added.  On the contrary, McCourt said bitcoin futures market has been growing, especially with volumes coming from Asia markets, which has been ""fascinating."" Explaining that trading activities in the hours before the U.S. market opens have a strong influence on the price of bitcoin futures on CME, he said:  ""Out of the 40 percent of bitcoin futures trading on CME that's outside the U.S., 21 percent are coming from Asia.""  DRW founder Don Wilson, in a fireside chat this morning at Consensus Singapore, also said that bitcoin derivatives trading volume from Asia is approaching that of the U.S., referencing data from both CME and Cboe.  McCourt went on to say that CME rolled out its bitcoin futures products ""in response to demand from market participants who want to trade crypto derivatives on a regulated exchange.""  ""They want a regulated exchange to provide that vehicle with risk management to increase their comfort level,"" he added.  Also on the panel with McCourt, Phillip Gillespie, CEO of B2C2 Japan, said that, with larger exchanges moving into crypto derivatives and spot trading, regulators are also taking the space much more seriously now – a shift that may eventually open the doors to wider institutional adoption of crypto trading.  CoinDesk reported early this year that the trading volume of bitcoin derivative products in Japan had grown from $2 million in 2014 to a whopping $543 billion in 2017.  Gillespie said:  ""We are starting to see regulators are coming in and institutions will be ready to come back next as regulators are shaping the space into more of a professionalism for sophisticated investors with more strict hiring structure and know-your-customer measures.""

42381216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94NbL,1537344001,Swiss Crypto Startup Eidoo Announces Token Tied to the Price of Gold,"Eidoo has become the latest cryptocurrency startup to seek to create a more stable token by tying it to the price of gold.  The Switzerland-based startup says the ERC-20-compatible token, dubbed the ekon, will sit alongside its multicurrency wallet and decentralized exchange. But perhaps more notably, each token will be redeemable for one gram of 99.9 percent fine gold, which the startup says will be stored in its vaults and audited every 90 days.  ""People will be able to see the gold stored in the security vaults through a video camera, we will post a link on the website so everyone can control the gold,"" Natale Ferrara, the startup's founder, told CoinDesk in an email via a spokesperson.  Fees for buying and selling ekon on the exchange will generate revenue for Eidoo in the form of its EDO token (CoinDesk previously reported on the company's unique approach to its revenue). Ferrara also said that fees will be assessed if anyone wants to trade in their crypto token for an actual gram of gold.  ""Each Ekon token will be backed by ... [24-karat gold], so we will issue new tokens only if the gold is available and only if the user has completed the KYC and all the legal requirements that the Swiss law requires,"" Ferrara wrote.  Eidoo raised $27.9 million in a token sale last October, and its app has since become one of the more popular platforms for launching initial coin offerings. As it has expanded services to crypto users, it has added exchange services – an area that the gold-backed stablecoin fits within.  Stablecoin push  The announcement comes amid what one could call a boom in stablecoin announcements, including two – from Gemini and Paxos/itBit – which have won approval from regulators in New York.  And while the controversial tether (USDT) remains the market leader in this area, one exchange recently revealed that it's moving on from the token – suggesting that other rivals could begin to grab at market share.  But a gold-backed token is perhaps a strange choice for a stablecoin, primarily because the metal's price itself isn't very stable. Its price is down $150 since the spring, but up about $25 over the last month, according to data from APMEX.  ""Benchmarked against the USD, gold is not necessarily 'stable,'"" Dr. Wang Chun Wei of Australia's University of Queensland told CoinDesk in an email.  He went on to explain:  ""Most exchanges (and investors) use USD as the reference currency, hence it makes more sense for the stablecoin to be based on that reference currency.""  Wei – who released two papers this year, one on liquidity in crypto markets and a second focused specifically on the relationship between the stablecoin tether (USDT ) and bitcoin – acknowledged that some crypto holders might just like having something in their portfolio that's not correlated with the crypto market.  Boon for investors?  That lack of correlation was something investors spoke to in the context of crypto-based real estate investments.  Scott Hoch of Apex Token Fund, for example, previously argued that crypto-native investors want all their investments on a blockchain, which explains why they might favor a token over a gold exchange-traded fund.  That way, if someone using Eidoo wants to look at all their assets in one place, including a gold hedge against the risk of the crypto market, then it might help to have a token which does that for them.  Others aren't so convinced, including Kyle Samani of MultiCoin Capital.  ""This already exists but not tokenized,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I think it's hype. Doesn't change anything.""  But for a small brand in a crowded space, hype could make a difference.  ""I can see the appeal – i.e. the Austrian/libertarian angle,"" Wei told CoinDesk.

42381237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nsx,1537332340,Trading Legend Don Wilson: Asian Demand High for Bitcoin Futures,"Don Wilson, founder of high-speed trading firm DRW, said bitcoin derivatives trading in Asia hours is almost equal to the volume he's seen in the U.S., something he says is an anomaly when compared to other financial instruments.  In a fireside chat at the CoinDesk Consensus Singapore 2018 conference with Quartz's John Detrixhe, Wilson discussed his observations on cryptocurrency trading trends and his view on the future for the technology.  Referencing bitcoin futures trading data on U.S. exchanges provided by CME and CBOE, Wilson went so far as to suggest there may be demand for similar trading tools in Asia.  He told attendees:  ""If you look at the bitcoin futures data from CME and CBOE, volume in Asia hours are almost the same wth the U.S. ... Whereas in like foreign exchange, even for the Japanese yen-dollar trading, volume in Asia is significantly lower.""  DRW, one of the earliest institutions that moved into cryptocurrency trading, launched Cumberland, a crypto over-the-counter trading desk in 2014, at a time when others such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have yet to officially roll out similar services. Explaining the initial idea of DRW to start a crypto trading desk, Wilson said it is rooted in his belief that crypto's decentralization feature.  ""There's the argument about bitcoin as a store of value. But, more interesting to me, is the usefulness of bitcoin. The ability of transfer values without a trust in the system is hugely disruptive,"" he said.  Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cumberland had traded more than $20 billion worth of bitcoin, ether and other crypto assets since 2016.  Wilson added that custody solution could be one key obstacle at the moment to a wider institution adoption of crypto trading as he sees that as a crucial stepping stone.  Elsewhere in the fireside chat, Wilson also commented on yesterday's report by the New York Office of the Attorney General, one which saw the regulator releasing findings indicating several crypto exchange may be involved in market manipulation and the violation of state laws.  While agreeing to most of the arguments made by the regulator, Wilson sees ""one of the biggest problems in this industry is the lack of clarity from regulators on what the rules are,"" concluding:  ""Such uncertainty could drive away innovative projects in the space to other jurisdictions with clearer guidelines such as Switzerland and Singapore.""

42381223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nit,1537329610,UK Lawmakers Call For Greater Oversight of Crypto Industry,"A group of U.K. lawmakers has called for more oversight and regulation of the cryptocurrency industry in a new report published Wednesday.  Arguing that ""crypto-assets have no inherent value,"" are ""especially risky"" for retail investors and are ""particularly vulnerable to manipulation,"" the report states that ""the introduction of regulation [to the cryptocurrency space] should be treated as a matter of urgency.""  The report comes roughly seven months after the U.K. Treasury Committee first announced it would look into the benefits and risks of cryptocurrencies.  The group wants to give the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the U.K.'s top financial regulator, more authority to regulate crypto markets. The report notes that organizers of initial coin offerings (ICOs), at present, can exploit certain loopholes to avoid scrutiny from the agency.  ""Apart from drawing attention to the risks, there is little the FCA can do to protect individuals from being defrauded or losing their money. This is because most ICOs do not promise financial returns, but instead offer future access to a service or utility, meaning they fall outside the regulatory perimeter,"" the report states.  The lawmakers went on to add:  ""While there may be no explicit promise of financial returns, investors in ICOs clearly expect them: they are not buying tokens to gain access to as-yet unbuilt theme parks, or to obtain dental services in years to come, but in the hope of selling them at a profit. The development of ICOs has exposed a regulatory loophole that is being exploited to the detriment of ordinary investors.""  No stability risk  The report highlighted the speculative interest in cryptocurrencies, noting that ""in the absence of any market fundamentals, their prices fluctuate according to sentiment.""  As a result, cryptocurrencies are more volatile than other asset classes, which can result in either greater gains or a greater loss.  ""The use of blockchain as a payments system exacerbates these risks, since the exchange rate (vis-à-vis other crypto-assets, or conventional currency) can fluctuate significantly during the time it takes to settle a transaction,"" the report added.  That being said, the lawmakers argued that cryptocurrencies don't pose a threat to financial stability, primarily due to the small number of users and investors. They also noted that cryptocurrencies and blockchain can even be used positively – provided that they are regulated appropriately.  As such, the report noted that ""if the government decides that growth is to be encouraged, the committee believes that the introduction of regulation could lead to positive outcomes for the crypto-asset market.""

42381233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nrh,1537326419,Singapore Central Banker: No Securities Crypto Token Approved To Date,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city state's de-facto central bank, highlighted in interview today that no tokens representing securities have been approved to date.  During a fireside chat at CoinDesk's Consensus Singapore 2018 conference on Wednesday, Damien Pang, head of the MAS technology infrastructure office for fintech and innovation, opened up to the audience about ""A Guide to Digital Token Offerings,"" a framework it published in 2017 that was meant to provide clarity to crypto entrepreneurs.  Pang said a reason for the difference in his statements and those by regulators abroad, is that every jurisdiction has its own set of criteria for judging what is or isn't a security.  As such, he said regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has also been vocal on the subject but has yet to offer a framework, can be expected to come to a different conclusion.  Pang spoke about how MAS divides tokens into three categories – utility tokens, payments tokens and securities tokens – and went on to state for the first time that he believes the categorization of a digital token applied by MAS, could change over the time, depending their current and future characteristics.  He told attendees:  ""The MAS takes a close look at the characteristics of the tokens, in the past, at the present and in the future, instead of just the technology built on.""  ""The MAS does not intend to regulate utility tokens that are used to access certain services. But a payments service bill is expected to be enacted by the end of this year to apply to payment tokens, which have storage and payment values,"" he continued.  Should the characteristics of any of the utility or payment tokens become more aligned with features of securities offerings, such as promising future earnings, Pang reiterated that Singapore will regulate these assets.  Elsewhere, Pang also discussed the status of the central bank's sandbox initiative, and whether crypto token projects were leveraging the resources. While, to date, the regulator has not accepted any token projects, he said, MetLife Insurance is testing a blockchain-based application to facilitate medical insurance transactions under more limited rules.  Still, in conversation, Pang answered sometimes difficult questions as to why the regulator didn't go further in making clear which crypto tokens, whether bitcoin or ether, haven't been explicitly deemed to fall outside the regulations.  Asked why the authority does not intend to name names like regulators in the U.S., Pang said this approach may not help create an encouraging environment for innovation.  He concluded:  ""The moment you start naming names, people take it very literally – these are and those are not. But, in fact, there are more than 1,000 tokens. Bear in mind, we provide clear guidelines to categorize them.""
