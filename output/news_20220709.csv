We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery. ‚Äî Bret Taylor (@btaylor) July 8, 2022 Elon Musk Pulls Out Off Twitter Deal Elon Musk on Friday pulled the plug on his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter and take it private, a regulatory filing showed. Musk accused the social media giant of &apos;misleading&apos; statements about the number of fake accounts. Musk also said he was walking away because the company fired high-ranking executives and one-third of the talent acquisition team, breaching Twitter&apos;s obligation to &apos;preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization.&apos; He also decided to suspend the deal due to multiple breaches of the purchase agreement. One of them includes &apos;misleading representations over the number of spam bots on the social network. The Tesla CEO&apos;s team strongly believes that the proportion of spam and fake accounts is &apos;wildly higher&apos; than 5 percent, according to the letter. The Tesla CEO had earlier threatened to walk away from the deal if the company can&apos;t show that less than 5% of its daily active users are automated spam accounts.
