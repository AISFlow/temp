42425236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfPh,1389048122,New York Real-Estate Brokerage To Start Accepting Bitcoin,"Do you have a spare 30,000 BTC lying around with no place to spend it? Then you should consider heading for New York.      The Manhattan-based real estate brokerage firm Bond New York has announced it will be accepting bitcoin as payment for property transactions.      This means that anyone with an overloaded wallet will be able to invest in properties in Manhattan, Brooklyn and even in Honduras from the middle of next week.      Have you always wanted to open your own Manhattan bar? Then you could cough up 148.14 BTC for a 186 square meter “thriving bar with karaoke rooms on top of a busy Japanese restaurant” in Manhattan’s Midtown East.      Do you prefer a new cozy home? How about a two-bedroom flat in the Upper East Side with ""nice pre-war detail, including beamed ceilings and crown moldings"" for 1482.63 BTC?      But if that is a bit cheap and you really want to unload the bitcoin wallet you might want to consider a 30,864.57 BTC townhouse in Greenwich Village that is “beyond the dream of superstars” according the company website.      Noah Freedman, the co-founder of Bond New York, says several potential customers have already expressed interest in paying with bitcoin when it becomes available next week. But, he adds that it will be a small percentage of their sales for the foreseeable future:      “I don’t expect it to be a large amount of transactions since the market is small compared to dollars. But we are in the customer service business and we believe that this is a convenient and cheap way for people to make payments, so we are all for it.”              Bond is one of New York’s largest real estate brokerage firms with seven offices and over 500 employees. Their website lists 272 properties for sale in the New York area.      For the bitcoin transactions they will use the San Francisco-based payment processor company Coinbase.      According to Freedman, one of the main reasons for customers to pay in bitcoin is simple mathematics:      “With credit cards we often have to charge an extra 3.5 percent added to the property price but when they pay with bitcoin there will be no extra charge.”              Bond claims to be the world’s first real estate brokerage firm to accept bitcoin for all their transactions. However, bitcoin users with large wallets have already been able to buy properties on other websites.      On BitPremier, the bitcoin luxury marketplace, a penthouse condo in Montreal is available for sale for 528.6 BTC and a seven-bedroom villa in Israel for 3702.51 BTC. Bitcoin big-spenders can also purchase a luxury yacht and a small airplane.      New Yorkers have been able to spend their bitcoins on the streets of Manhattan for some time. In the EVR “gastro-lounge” in Manhattans Empire district guest have been able to buy burgers and beers with bitcoin since April 2013.      Freedman himself says that he is very excited about the bitcoin project, even though it has been a steep learning curve:      “I just purchased my first bitcoin last week,"" he concluded.

42425247,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvflh,1389025947,Bitcoin Funds Scientist's Cancer Research Project,"The bitcoin community is notoriously generous, and donations to cancer research are no exception.  Isaac Yonemoto, a PhD scientist in chemistry and biophysics, is trying to raise money to complete work on a promising cancer fighting compound called 9DS in an initiative called Project Marilyn.  Yonemoto told CoinDesk:  “I'm raising money to finish preclinical experiments on the anticancer compound 9DS. Research on this compound has been abandoned twice, so third time's the charm.”  Although it is still in the preclinical stage, according to the Project Marilyn website, 9DS has potential as an anti-cancer drug at some point. Some of the early signs indicate that it could be effective on kidney cancer, skin cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.  He continued: “9DS works by jamming up a cell's ability to copy its DNA. In order to copy itself, DNA needs to unzip like a zipper first. If you imagine something wedged in your zipper, that blocks it from unzipping, that's what 9DS does.”  This research is going to be open sourced, a term normally used for software development. But Yonemoto is willing to think outside of the box.  “What we're doing differently from most preclinical research is that we're going to open source all of our work, and we're going to release whatever molecules we make without patents. Part of this is because without licensing use of the compound it will be more accessible to all parts of the world,"" he said.  He believes that champions of decentralized currencies would easily get on board with this type of concept, adding: “The Bitcoin protocol itself started on open-source software to bootstrap its trust model. So I think bitcoin users understand the other benefits of open source.”  Yonemoto says that bitcoin validates some of the discouragement he has had with many popular economic ideas:  “I've been following monetary theory for a long time, and have been generally frustrated by mainstream economic theory ever since I tutored undergraduate [economics] concentrators in math at the University of Chicago.”  “One of the things that excites me about bitcoin is that it will put to rest a lot of obviously wrong models about the nature of money that get blabbered about by economists.”  Using bitcoin for this effort has not been easy, but Yonemoto believes that as the currency's potential lies ahead, it will be worth it in the long run:  “The protocol itself has so much potential. It's still young, so it's hard to find clients that implement all of the features that are baked in to the protocol. For this fundraising attempt, we'll have to do a lot of things 'the hard way' because there isn't a simple way to set things up. But I think those will come.”  Yonemoto thinks that bitcoin donations for Project Marilyn are just the beginning for the currency’s charitable potential.  “By donating to this you're helping to legitimize bitcoin as a transaction medium. One of my dreams is to be able to finance an original anti-cancer research idea - I have one percolating now - entirely off of bitcoin.”  If you’re interested in giving to Project Marilyn, check out the site’s bitcoin donation page.

42425231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfHh,1389018921,"TipperCoin Co-Founder on Micropayments, Dogecoin and Bringing Bitcoin to the Masses","Scott Li is an Australian who has relocated to the San Francisco area. He’s been working on a number of projects, some of them bitcoin-related. One of these projects is TipperCoin.  TipperCoin is a way of tipping people with bitcoin simply by tweeting them. It has the potential to help spread the word about bitcoin and to help increase bitcoin’s use as a payment mechanism. CoinDesk caught up with Scott to discuss micropayments, dogecoin's popularity and how TipperCoin can further bitcoin adoption on a global scale.  CoinDesk: What is TipperCoin?  Scott Li: In one sentence, TipperCoin allows you to send bitcoins over Twitter.  CD: How did you come up with this idea?  SL: We’ve actually had this idea for quite a few months now, but we never really got around to doing it because we always kind of thought it was a gimmicky little thing.  We launched another project, SpareCoins, a Chrome extension wallet, on Reddit. And we started getting tips for that on Reddit through Bitcointip Bot, which allows Reddit users to tip each other through Reddit comments. And we thought we had found a clear use case for bitcoin.  CD: How do you think Twitter is going to feel about something like this?  SL: Honestly, we’re not 100% sure yet. We know that there has been a bit of turbulence when others have tried to do payments over Twitter.  So right now we’re kind of too small for it to matter. If it gets to a substantial size we’ll be proactive in contacting Twitter in getting their thoughts on this being compliant with their conditions.  CD: When looking at how you’ve built this, it looks as if you are hosting a wallet. Is that how this works?  SL: We do hold the private keys and encrypt them in our database.  But we’re not a wallet, like Coinbase for example, in that we can’t allow you to connect USD (US dollars) to bitcoin. And you’re not holding a substantial amount with us, nor do we recommend it.  CD: So you are expecting people to move these bitcoins that they get through TipperCoin to another wallet?  SL: Oh, absolutely. We would be implementing features where if you had a substantial amount of bitcoins we might direct message you or Tweet at you to say to withdraw your coins, which would be something that we would recommend you to do.  The app is really for people to tip each other. We don’t want to be like Coinbase and hold things in cold storage, taking on that kind of responsibility. We just want to be a facilitator. In the future we may integrate with the Coinbase API.  CD: This is an open-source project. What kind of interest have you had from developers who want to add features to TipperCoin?  SL: Probably the most surprising thing for us is, everyone wants to use dogecoin. And one of the first things that some developers did is that they forked the repositoryhttps://github.com/BitcoinMafia/twittercoin and started working on dogecoin support.  People are quite excited about this. There are a number of issues on our repository now. Just people wanting certain things, tweaking certain features, etc. But dogecoin is probably the biggest feature that is being worked on right now by the community.  CD: How many people are working on TipperCoin?  SL: Originally, it was just my friend and I in San Francisco. Now there’s like ten forks on the repository of the source code.  CD: You fully expect these forks to bring in new features that you will implement?  SL: We ideally would want the community to become more involved, to add features and maintain the project.  CD: How would you make money from this?  SL: This is an open-source project. We don’t intend to make money from this. We are working on more commercial projects at the moment.  It’s kind of funny in these situations where the motivations aren’t so clear. It’s not like “you will make x amount of money, therefore you should do this”.  We certainly aren’t going to make any money from TipperCoin, it’s just we think that this is something bitcoin needs, and it is going to add value to bitcoin.  CD: When you say that this is something that bitcoin needs, what do you see people using this for?  SL: I think the bigger picture is that micropayments can really come out of tipping. And it’s something that bitcoin can enable. I think that’s the biggest use case that can come out of this.  CD: How do you get the mainstream to adopt bitcoin as a method of payment?  SL: I think Twitter is a great way to do that.  Twitter is a really good way to reach the mass market. Distribution is already built into this product. So, Twitter is a good way to spread the message of bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/06/tippercoin-co-founder-on-micropayments-dogecoin-and-bringing-bitcoin-to-the-masses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/646b02ca2a78ab18d039ae1be6a5e26f5939d87a-1171x704.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvffh,1389015644,1 Millionth Bitcoin Wallet Created on Blockchain.info,"Blockchain.info has reached the biggest milestone in its history – it now boasts over a million wallets.  A year ago it had fewer than 100,000 users and by late October the company announced that it had created 500,000 wallets, so it is evident that things are picking up.  A Blockchain.info representative told CoinDesk that the company plans to celebrate the latest milestone with some big prizes. Back in October, the lucky user who created the 500,000th wallet was rewarded with 10 BTC, so the stakes are high.  Blockchain acknowledged that reaching the one million mark is a major accomplishment for any service, especially in the bitcoin space. A company spokesman said:  ""The year 2013 has been an unforgettable one for Blockchain. As the number of wallets has doubled from 500,000 since November, the world's most popular bitcoin website is proud to announce reaching 1,000,000 wallets for their wallet service.”  Blockchain started 2013 with around 100,000 users. By contrast, 2014 is kicking off with more than a million users.  The company said: “The growth seen over the past year has happened during a pivotal time for bitcoin. Blockchain plans to build this milestone into an outreach opportunity for bitcoin newbies and enthusiasts.”  Blockchain.info added that its leadership role in the bitcoin economy is “only just beginning,” so we can expect a lot more over the next few months.  It is also keen to emphasise that it is nearly a “100% bitcoin” business, as it pays its employees and most of its services in bitcoin. It also closes its business deals in bitcoins, including the recent acquisition of ZeroBlock, the most popular iOS/Android app for bitcoin.

42425241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfXh,1389011444,Princeton Researchers Developing Bitcoin-Based Prediction Market,"A team of Princeton faculty members are developing a prediction market based on bitcoin transactions.  Prediction markets are purely speculative markets created for the sole purpose of making various predictions, ranging from all sorts of business predictions to more mundane events, such as weather and various real-world events.  Prediction markets are often frowned upon by the financial community, although a number of major companies are said to be using different prediction markets and techniques to gain a competitive edge. These include software companies like Google, chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm, along with industry heavyweights like GE, Siemens and Arcelor Mittal.  More than just gambling  The basic principle has been around for more than a century. It basically functions like a purely speculative stock market, allowing participants to trade “shares” that are tied to the outcome of certain events.  [post-quote]  The average probability of any given event is calculated using the number of people making different predictions. For example, if more people are willing to bet that Qualcomm will gain a few high-profile design wins for tablets, chances are Intel will lose market share.  Those who bet on Intel will lose their cash if the prediction comes true. Coincidentally, Intel is said to be using prediction markets to manage manufacturing capacity.  The biggest problem with prediction markets is that they are purely speculative and regulators in some jurisdictions view them as a form of gambling.  They are underpinned by people willing to put their money where their mouth is, betting on various outcomes in industries they are familiar with.  One prominent example is Intrade.comhttp://www.intrade.com/v4/home/, which was forced to shut down after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission concluded it was an illicit form of gambling. Intrade is currently working on a new version of its market, noting that “cold hard cash” can no longer be used as a “carrot” in its model, due to legal impediments.  How about a bitcoin carrot?  This is probably why the Princeton team, led by computer scientist Arvind Narayanan, is experimenting with bitcoin as an alternative to hard currency. Since bitcoin is neither regulated nor centralized, it can be employed in lieu of fiat money, effectively isolating prediction markets from financial oversight. Narayanan said:  “Now that we have this beautiful decentralized system that allows two parties to transact with each other without a central authority, can we make it so that arbitration of events can be decentralized in some form?”  The academic pointed out that the team is already converging on a successful model, but it is still too early to say whether it will work or not. He told the Daily Princetonian that he could not reveal more information until the team has published the research paper.  An existing bitcoin prediction market, Predictious, was founded in July last year. Although relatively unknown, reports suggest that the Irish company has already handled over $300,000 in BTC.  Decentralisation is not enough  Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn believes the idea has the ability to decentralize trading systems, saying:  “Making something decentralized can be a way to avoid these regulatory hassles in a way.”  However, Hearn warns that decentralisation is not a silver bullet, as even decentralised systems can be regulated in other ways.  Narayanan even suggested using the bitcoin exchange rate as a proxy to predict whether the currency will succeed. If a lot of investors believe it will, it could increase its chances of success. He argues that the value of bitcoin could increase twenty-fold if ever becomes a mainstream currency.  However, current investors do not think this will be the case. The value will continue to depend on the level of adoption by mainstream businesses.  Hearn warns that bitcoin will have a hard time competing against PayPal and credit cards, but it might gain a foothold in niche industries, including prediction markets.

42425235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfFh,1389007834,ASIC Manufacturer HashFast Faces Legal Action From Bitcoin Miners,"ASIC manufacturer HashFast is facing serious allegations from bitcoin miners who placed orders for its Baby Jet mining rigs, which have since failed to arrive.  Consequently, some of the miners affected are planning to take the company to court, according to ExtremeTech. However, the issue is more complicated than it first appears, and the miners may be facing an uphill struggle.  At the root of the dispute was HashFast’s pledge to begin shipping between 20th and 30th October 2013. In the original Terms of Service (TOS), the company also told customers that they would be eligible for a full refund if it failed to deliver the units by the end of 2013.  The relevant excerpt from HashFast's TOS reads:  “HashFast guarantees that all 'Baby Jet' units from our first production batch will be delivered by 31st December 2013. If Buyer ordered one or more Baby Jet units, and HashFast does not deliver such units by that date, then Buyer may at his or her discretion, cancel the undelivered portion and HashFast will issue a full refund the payment for the units that Buyer purchased but did not receive and cancelled.”  Buyer beware?  But here is where it gets complicated. Most miners paid for their Baby Jet rigs in bitcoin, which probably sounded like a good idea when they made the order. However, since bitcoin's value has soared over the past couple of months, these overdue rigs now look like the worst possible deal a miner could make.  On average, miners who paid with bitcoin appear to have paid 45 BTC per unit. In August, the company was taking orders at $5,600 per unit (around 55 BTC per unit). Since the units were ordered last summer, the overall price of the units was very different, as bitcoin was trading in the $75 to $150 territory.  The rise in the currency's value since then means that miners would have had a better return on their money if they had simply held on to their bitcoins and sold them today.  HashFast's CEO Eduardo deCastro told CoinDesk that the company's delays were caused by problems encountered in the production process, he said:  “Last summer, we estimated that we would begin delivering to our Batch 1 customers in late October and guaranteed delivery by 31st December 2013 ... In late October, we ran into problems with the substrates that we ordered, and decided it was best to find a new source although it meant that our first deliveries would start later, but still estimated before our December 31st delivery date.”  Additionally, in December the company encountered and debugged problems with their PCBs. DeCastro explained that: “On the eve of 31st December 2013, we still were not comfortable starting bulk production or volume shipments.”  “We remain confident that we will start bulk production soon,” he added.  Refunds  Probably the most contentious part of this story is that the “full refund” section of HashFast's TOS is not being interpreted by the company as a reimbursement in bitcoin.  Controversially, HashFast is offering to refund the customers in USD [.pdf], based on the dollar rate at the time of their purchase. Needless to say, the miners want this paid in bitcoin instead.  What’s more, the company has reportedly antagonized customers further by failing to protect their email addresses in a mailout sent on 27th December. DeCastro admitted:  “Customer emails addresses were accidentally put in the 'To' field rather than the 'Bcc' field.”  “Only customers received these emails, no other customer-specific information was included. We took immediate and decisive corrective action to put measures in place to ensure that this will not happen again.”  “We apologized, and continue to apologize, to all of our customers affected by this error,” he added.  Everyone who has followed bitcoin over the last few months will be aware that one of the biggest concerns raised by regulators and bitcoin detractors is the fact that disputes and refunds for bitcoin transactions are problematic. Bitcoin is not ""legal tender” and HashFast is offering refunds in legal tender, in this case US dollars. Pointing out that HashFast ""operates in USD” deCastro added:  “We accepted payment in Bitcoin and other currencies as a convenience to our customers. In many cases, we never received Bitcoin, but instead received USD from our payment processor, BitPay.”  The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations outline several scenarios, all of which involve payment by cash, cheque, money order or credit card – not bitcoin.  The FTC states that companies that must refund the entire amount tendered by the customer, including shipping, handling, insurance and other costs. The rules also cover sales paid for in whole or in part by promotional devices like coupons, but they simply do not cover bitcoin transactions.  Critics love legal ambiguity  In essence, HashFast does not appear to be violating any laws by refusing to pay out refunds in bitcoin. While it may be effectively killing its business in the process by antagonizing the mining community, it's likely that the company doesn't have much of a choice.  The funds raised in the pre-order process were used to develop the rigs and the value of bitcoin has increased tenfold since the company started taking orders. In other words, the money was likely spent months ago and refunding miners in bitcoin would mean that the company has to pay out ten times as much as it received.  As if that was not enough, the miners will not be compensated for lost revenue. The rigs were supposed to ship three months ago, when the bitcoin hash rate and difficulty were much lower. Three months later, the hash rate and difficulty have practically tripled.  Although some observers believe the increase in difficulty diminished profitability, this is simply not the case, as miners with the right ASICs turned a handsome profit in the last quarter of 2013.  HashFast anticipated this, so they offered to install additional capacity to compensate for difficulty increases. Oddly enough, the company reportedly told one customer that it would refund them in bitcoin if they failed to deliver, but there are two ways of interpreting this promise – either they would compensate them based on the BTC price, or the USD price converted back into bitcoin.  HashFast declined to comment on this claim, saying:  “We are unable to answer any specific questions regarding HashFast’s refund policy, beyond what is publicly available in the Terms of Sale and an email that went out directly to our Batch 1 customers.”  This is bound to remain a very controversial subject for weeks and months to come. Bitcoin critics will undoubtedly use it as an example of bitcoin transactions gone wrong, with limited legal recourse. Worse, the transactions were made by bitcoin enthusiasts and professionals rather than average consumers.  For the time being, it isn't clear whether the dispute will end up in court and whether the miners will actually find a judge who is willing to rule that the refunds must be paid out in bitcoin, as this would be a landmark ruling.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/01/06/asic-manufacturer-hashfast-faces-legal-action-from-bitcoin-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a619f2963929200bd4be67e6f99cd377ab20a55-2000x1209.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company cited “increasing operational costs and legal uncertainty” as key catalysts for its closure.  In a statement published on its website, the exchange said:  “Due to reasons well-known, the operating costs and legal uncertainty for running bitcoin [businesses] have increased in China. As such, we decided, albeit unwillingly, to close the platform that we built from scratch. No words can describe our sadness at the moment. We firmly believe that bitcoin is a revolution and have been dedicated to contribute to the cause, but the risks and difficulty have increased so much that the future is far from certain ...”  The statement also instructed users to withdraw their deposits as soon as possible, as no withdrawals will be allowed after the website’s scheduled closure date on 18th January.  The company concluded by stating that the website may open again if “opportunity is ripe”, though it refrained from making a commitment as to when this will happen, if at all.  User Reaction  Gox BTC  , launched in May this year, is one of the lesser-known cryptocurrency exchanges based in Mainland China. On 4th January, the exchange’s website indicated a 24-hour trading volume of just 2.87 BTC, which has dropped sharply from its usual level of around 100 BTC per day.  In comparison, China’s leading exchange Huobi.com, saw a trading volume of 100,737 BTC during the same period.  The news of Gox BTC’s closure has created unease among Chinese Bitcoiners, who have grown wary of government interference, after the nation's central bank barred banks from working with exchanges last month.  On Sina Weibo, China’s leading microblog service, some users posted “condolences”, while others praised the website’s timely update as act of responsibility.  Most people attribute the exchange's closure to increasing competition in the industry. At the moment, all major Chinese Bitcoin exchanges don’t charge trading fees, which makes profitability an unattainable goal for many.

42425234,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfNh,1388975689,Taiwan Regulators Block Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs,"Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has stated it will prevent the installation of Robocoin bitcoin ATMs there, responding almost immediately to the company's plans to introduce machines in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Zeng Mingzong, FSC chairman, made the statement in an interview with the Central News Agency (CNA). According to an article published on CNA’s website at 14:56 Taipei time today:bitquick    “Central Bank and FSC recently released a joint statement warning against bitcoin. According to the Central Bank, bitcoin is not a currency; financial institutions and the public shouldn’t use it as medium of payment.”      “Given bitcoin’s non-currency status, no bank deposits should made in it, and banks are not allowed to receive or provide (bitcoins). To install bitcoin ATMs would require approval from FSC, which will not be given. So it is impossible for a bitcoin ATM to come to or appear in Taiwan.”    Robocoin had only just announced plans to expand into East Asian markets, designing new user interfaces for Chinese-language speakers. Taiwan was also seen as a bright hope for bitcoin in Asia after mainland China began issuing its own strong statements on bitcoin use in December. As well as having an advanced economy and local high tech hardware industry, it is also one of the few places (besides Hong Kong and Macau) where banks can legally exchange mainland Chinese currency (CNY, or renminbi).  Hong Kong, which retains legal autonomy from the rest of China, has so far refrained from intervening in bitcoin business or adoption.  Taiwan has a buy-sell bitcoin exchange called BitQuick.tw, and digital entertainment company Wayi announced its intentions to accept bitcoin and become an exchange itself last December. Wayi's online retail arm, Wmall, still features the bitcoin logo prominently on its banner and front page.  Las Vegas-based Robocoin became famous in October last year when the world's first ""bitcoin ATM"" went online in a Vancouver coffee shop. Its machines are also bi-directional, dispensing and buying users' bitcoins for cash.  The company has always stressed compliance with financial regulators as a priority in any market its machines enters. Both biometric information (palm scans and facial recognition) and government-issued ID are required to trade.  The ATMs have been a huge success. The solitary machine in Vancouver reportedly took over CAD$1m and processed over 1,500 transactions in its first 29 days of operation. Robocoin said it has taken ""dozens"" of orders since then and the company had planned to distribute 39 units internationally in January.  Bitcoin has weighed on the Taiwan FSC's mind recently. No sooner had calendars ticked over when it issued the world's first bitcoin warning of 2014, containing all the usual cautions about volatility and lack of legal protections. It then went further by saying the Committee might take “necessary steps” if financial institutions engage in bitcoin operations.  Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission has existed only since 2004. According to the Taipei Times, it appointed and replaced four different chairpersons before 2007 and several high-ranking personnel were involved in scandals over the same period.
