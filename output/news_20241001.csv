34205688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645604,1727823618,Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop – On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand,"Cardano has seen a strong 26% surge following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts announcement two weeks ago, boosting optimism across the crypto market. Analysts and investors are questioning the sustainability of the recent surge. Despite the initial rally, Cardano’s price failed to close above a key resistance level, signaling potential weakness in the uptrend. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst On-chain data from Santiment reveals a decline in demand for ADA, adding to investor caution. Decreased network activity and buying pressure raise doubts about the sustainability of the current rally. As the market awaits further developments, investors are closely watching for signs of a reversal or continuation of the uptrend, understanding that ADA’s next move could set the tone for its performance in the weeks ahead. Cardano Indicator Shows Concerning Data Cardano faces a significant risk of a 30% drop to its yearly low of around $0.27, as on-chain data from Santiment reveals rising selling pressure and diminishing demand. The warning signs for ADA’s price have become clearer, with its daily active-address (DAA) divergence showing a negative reading of -43.3% at the time of writing. This metric, which tracks the correlation between an asset’s price movements and changes in its daily active addresses, has remained negative since September 7, indicating a troubling trend for Cardano. The negative DAA divergence suggests that much of ADA’s rally this month, following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, has been fueled more by broader market sentiment than by any specific demand for ADA itself. This lack of organic demand increases the likelihood of a steep correction shortly. Without sustained buying pressure, Cardano’s price could drop sharply as traders begin to lock in profits, further driving prices downward. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon If ADA fails to break above its current resistance level of around $0.41, analysts expect a deeper correction, potentially pushing the price back to the yearly low of $0.27. With weakening demand and increasing selling pressure, Cardano’s near-term outlook looks uncertain, and traders are bracing for further downside risk. ADA Price Action: Testing A Crucial Supply Level ADA trades at $0.38, following a 10% dip from its daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.41. This level has become a crucial resistance area, as the price formed a new local high around this zone. ADA must reclaim the $0.41 level and push above the next key resistance at $0.45 to confirm a bullish trend for the coming weeks. Successfully breaking past these levels would signal renewed strength, giving the bulls control and potentially leading to higher prices. However, if ADA fails to push above these critical levels, the altcoin could face further downside pressure. A failure to reclaim $0.41 and surpass $0.45 would likely result in increased selling, triggering a potential 30% drop. In such a scenario, ADA would be at risk of revisiting its yearly low of around $0.27. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally?

34204137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645591,1727820050,Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges,"With the start of the highly anticipated Uptober here, market experts have been super bullish on the Bitcoin future outlook. In line with this, a crypto analyst has identified a major catalyst that could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs (ATHs) in the Fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2024. Bitcoin Sets Sights On New ATH In Q4 Bitcoin has been on a roll these past few days, with its price skyrocketing towards the end of September after experiencing a decline earlier. The cryptocurrency has been confirming analyst’s predictions of a bullish Q4 with its recent price movements. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready For 4x Jump To $2.6 As Major Bullish Pattern Breaks Occurs According to CoinMarketCap’s data, Bitcoin rose by about 1.03% in the past seven days, ending September on a bullish note. Given the cryptocurrency’s positive momentum in September, crypto analyst, Eric Crown has predicted on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin could rise to new all-time highs in Q4. Crown has based his predictions on the historical performance of Bitcoin, particularly focusing on the months following September. He disclosed that historically, whenever Bitcoin closed a green September, it followed up with a bullish trend in Q4 every single time. Following this trend, Crown has surmised that Bitcoin closing September in the green was a major catalyst for a bullish surge. As a result, he predicts that the average return for Bitcoin in this current Q4 would be close to 170.42%. If a few major “outliers” are removed, a modest return of 50% would be a more realistic expectation of potential gains. Calculating Bitcoin’s projected price using these percentage returns would see the cryptocurrency rising to $173,344 with a 170.42% return and $96,153 with a 50% return. While he remains generally bullish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, Crown has also disclosed in a more recent X post that the month of October has generally seen low momentum in Bitcoin during the first 10 days. This analysis is also evident in Bitcoin’s current price which has declined today by 0.69% and is trading at $63,976, as of writing. Considering this trend, Crown has projected that Bitcoin is likely to witness a price low at the beginning of the month, before starting its projected bullish rally to new highs. Analysts Confirm Green Q4 For BTC According to crypto analyst Kaizen, Bitcoin’s price performance in October from 2013 to 2023 was 80% in the green. The analyst also disclosed that during every United States (US) election year, the months of Q4 were 100% green. Moreover, each year after Bitcoin closed positively in September, it always had a green October. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why Following this recurring historical trend, Kaizen notes that this Q4 could be extremely bullish for Bitcoin. He highlighted that not only is 2024 an election year, but Bitcoin has recently closed the month of September on a positive trend, as a result the cryptocurrency could be gearing up for a major rally.

A spokesperson for Bitwise confirmed that the filing was real.  “We can now confirm that this is both legitimate and from Bitwise,” the spokesperson said.  This isn’t the first time that rumors about a potential XRP ETF have circulated.  Similar filings, which later turned out to be illegitimate, have previously been uploaded to the website in an attempt to pump the token's price.

42390269,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvFil,1727817569,"Tether's USDT Has Uses Beyond Crypto Markets, Trading: CEO Paolo Ardoino","In an interview with Bullish CEO Tom Farley, Tether's CEO said USDT is a necessary part of the global financial system, especially in inflation-stricken countries.  Tether's CEO also said the company is a key supporter of the U.S. dollar through large holdings of T-bills.  Tether's USDT may have started as a cryptocurrency, but today the largest stablecoin by market value is the most used digital dollar in the world, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in an interview with Bullish CEO Tom Farley.  Bullish is the owner of CoinDesk and a significant holder of USDT.  Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, form the backbone of crypto trading. They provide a way to store value within the cryptocurrency market without worrying about the fluctuations of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC). Most are linked 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, though some reflect other currencies and assets such as gold.  But there's more to USDT than crypto markets, Ardoino said. In countries like Argentina and Turkey, the stablecoin provides a lifeline as an alternative to volatile national currencies. Before the widespread adoption of USDT, people in inflation-stricken countries had to resort to the black market to get dollars.  ""USDT works much better outside of the U.S.,"" he said. ""In the U.S., there are 15 different transport layers for the U.S. dollar. You have banks, credit cards, debit cards. You have Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, and many others ... But who needs a dollar?""  That might help explain why USDT is not only the largest stablecoin, with a market cap of almost $120 billion, it's the third-largest cryptocurrency overall. Only bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} are larger. And it's more than three times the size of its nearest rival, Circle's $35.6 billion USDC.  More than half of USDT – $61 billion – is issued on the Tron blockchain, with $54.3 billion on Ethereum, the blockchain most widely associated with decentralized finance (DeFi). That's because it's significantly cheaper to conduct transactions on Tron, Ardoino said.  According to Etherscan, the transaction costs known as gas fees for a simple swap on Ethereum average around $14.60. On Tron, it's closer to 20 cents.  ""Imagine someone living in Haiti that earns $1.34 per day. How can they pay $5 for transaction fees?” he said. ""These markets cannot afford to pay five, six dollars per transaction on Ethereum or some other chain.""  Ardoino also discussed another angle where stablecoins and geopolitics intersect: Treasury bills. The debt provides backing for the cryptocurrency, easily switchable into dollars if USDT holders want to cash out. And, in the meantime, the interest payments roll into Tether's coffers.  While China, the second-largest holder of U.S. government debt, continues to trim its holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, stablecoin issuers like Tether have had a voracious appetite for them, scooping up just over $100 billion worth as the People's Bank of China dumps them.  If Tether were a country, data shows, it would have holdings equivalent to Germany and would be closing in on South Korea.  ""We added resiliency to the ownership of the U.S. dollar, so now you don't have one single country, one single decision maker that can sell hundreds of billions of T-bills at once,"" Ardoino said. ""USDT and Tether are the best friends for the U.S. dollar.""  Cantor has most of Tether's reserves  For most of its history, the state of Tether's reserves has been a big question mark, and for good reason.  During its early days, the company was repeatedly de-banked and was a bit of a vagabond, having to open and close accounts around the world from Qatar to China, Taiwan, and Canada.  When USDT's backing was unclear, CoinDesk fought to have the full details of Tether's banking relationships released by the New York State Attorney General, which had obtained them during an investigation (the stablecoin is banned in New York as part of a settlement). Initially, the NYAG opposed CoinDesk's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request for details about the reserves, but a judge dismissed their case.  Now, things have changed and the relationship is more simple: Most of the money is managed by financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald with the bank's CEO, Howard Lutnick, regularly vouching for the stablecoin issuer.  Ardoino said that Lutnick would have a perfect line of sight into the reserves backing USDT, and Tether completes the same style of attestation by a large accounting firm as its competitors.  ""Whoever believes in these conspiracy theories should get out from their mother's basement,"" he said, referring to speculation the company doesn't have sufficient backing for USDT.  The market doesn't seem to.  A Polymarket contract gives a 4% chance that Tether will declare insolvency in 2024, which is lower than the market's belief that a nuclear weapon will be used this year, which comes in at 9%.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/01/tethers-usdt-has-uses-beyond-crypto-markets-trading-ceo-paolo-ardoino,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5ca56792fd0543d689bfd55eb2eab11da2bfe4c-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token went steadily up last week but managed to make an even bigger leap over the weekend. This resulted in an increase in its value by a whopping 13%. The price jumped from $0.5889 to $0.6622 and reached a six-month high. Quite a lot of buzz has been seen in the crypto world, and the community feels this rally might just be the beginning for Ripple’s native currency. Related Reading: Humor Or Sarcasm? Dogecoin Leaps 20%, Co-Creator Says He Doesn’t Know Why While the rest of the crypto market has cooled down a bit, XRP continued in its movement and was greatly noticed by investors and traders. Despite having pulled back a bit, the token still remains strong and is trading at $0.6518 at the time of writing. According to CoinCodex, a cryptocurrency analysis tool, XRP will continue its bullish path and gain by around 19.60% in the coming quarter. On the basis of this optimistic outlook, which reflects growing market confidence in the token, the price may reach $0.743019 by the 31st of October in the year 2024. Big Things Coming For XRP Well-known trader Anup Dhungana recently hyped up the excitement with his statement that XRP may be set to see some major price actions in the coming months. On X (formerly Twitter), he said he believes that XRP is placed for a proper breakout.

Other experts shared Dhungana’s enthusiasm and projected XRP would reach $3 before Christmas. The token would have to skyrocket 360% from its present value if such is to occur. More analysis, however, holds the belief that the $3 mark will not be a top but a new floor to continue the move upwards into 2025. Related Reading: XRP To $1,000? Experts Weigh In On Bold Predictions And Market Realities Price Forecast Points To Growth Technical study supports XRP’s forecast. CoinCodex predicts a 20% growth by October, boosting hope on this platform. XRP has had 16 of 30 green days in a month, demonstrating momentum. Given a Fear & Greed Index of 50, which denotes a neutral market attitude, there is possibility for more consistent development as the market negotiates its present state. In addition, the price volatility for XRP has been pretty low in the last 30 days at 4.80% and thus traders have chances to gain from slight fluctuations in prices.

The price has surged approximately 13% since Friday, putting it within striking distance of the key psychological level at $0.65. Reclaiming this level would signal the start of a new bullish cycle and renewed market optimism. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon Analysts and investors closely watch this price movement, hoping XRP will break above $0.65 in the coming days. With the broader crypto market pushing for higher prices, there is a growing sentiment that XRP will follow suit and continue its upward trend. If momentum continues, surpassing this level could set the stage for a more significant rally, with expectations of new highs. However, failure to break through could lead to further consolidation or even a retracement. The next few days will be pivotal for XRP as it attempts to solidify its bullish trajectory. XRP Testing A Crucial Resistance XRP is at a critical turning point as it nears the crucial $0.65 mark, a level it hasn’t consistently closed above since March, aside from a brief breakout. Investors and analysts closely monitor the price action, speculating about potential outcomes as the market remains uncertain. The inability to close above this resistance level has kept XRP in a consolidation phase for months, leaving traders anxious for a clear direction. Prominent crypto analyst Crypto Tony has weighed in on the situation, sharing a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting this price level’s significance. According to Tony, reclaiming $0.65 would signal that bulls are back in control, setting the stage for a potential rally. In his analysis, Tony suggests that if XRP breaks through this resistance, it could push the price to a new target of $0.92—a significant 40% surge from current levels. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst The $0.65 level holds substantial psychological and technical importance, and a successful breakout would likely shift market sentiment in favor of a sustained uptrend. However, until this level is decisively reclaimed, uncertainty remains. All eyes are on XRP to see if bulls can drive the price to new highs in the coming weeks. Price Action: Key Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $0.63 after months of volatile price action marked by aggressive pumps and discouraging dumps. The $0.65 level has acted as a daily resistance since early 2023 and was previously a key demand level, offering support from April 2021 to May 2022. However, this level has flipped into a challenging resistance zone for XRP. If bulls want to regain control and push higher, XRP must break past $0.65 and confirm it as support. A successful breakout would signal strength and potentially set the stage for a larger rally. However, failure to break through this level would lead to a correction toward the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.54, representing a 12% drop. This scenario could also result in further sideways consolidation for XRP, extending the uncertain price action for the coming months.

Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for the collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX, hired Shapiro to handle his appeal shortly after his conviction. Last month, she filed a 102-page appeal in the Second Circuit, requesting a new trial for Bankman-Fried and accusing the judge overseeing his case of being unfairly biased against him.  Lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk are largely skeptical of the appeal’s chance of success.  Read more: Does SBF’s Appeal Stand a Chance of Succeeding?  The fraudster is currently six months into his sentence, and has chosen to remain in Brooklyn’s notoriously dangerous Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) while he awaits the outcome of his appeal, rather than be moved to a low-security prison near his family in California.  The unlikely result of Bankman-Fried’s decision to stay in MDC is that he’s now roommates with Diddy. According to a recent report from the New York Times citing sources familiar, Bankman-Fried and the rapper are both living in the same unit of the jail, sleeping in a “dormitory-style room” with other inmates.  On Sep. 12, New York prosecutors charged Diddy with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion and transporting for prostitution.  The sex trafficking charge alone carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, with minimum sentences of 10-15 years depending on the ages of the victims.

This is positive news for Bitcoin investors, as the crypto industry is now transitioning into a historically bullish fourth quarter of the year.

However, his stance isn’t just based on speculations but is backed by technical price data and analysis. Ki Young Ju draws his bullish outlook on the Bitcoin growth rate difference, which presents an interesting outlook on the cryptocurrency. Essentially, the Bitcoin growth rate difference compares the market cap of Bitcoin to its realized cap in order to gauge its bullish or bearish strength. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why The market cap of a cryptocurrency is the total value of all coins in circulation, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total supply. In contrast, the realized cap takes into account the actual value paid for each BTC in circulation based on the price at which each coin last moved. A higher market cap growth rate suggests the spot price of the average coin has increased compared to the last it was moved. According to a Bitcoin technical chart he shared on social media platform X, Ki Young Ju noted that Bitcoin’s market cap is still growing faster than its realized cap, which continues to point to a bull cycle. Notably, the analyst has mentioned in an earlier analysis of the growth rate difference that this trend, which started in late 2023, typically lasts for an average of two years. What Does This Mean For BTC? Going by past bull cycle trends, which Ki Young Ju noted typically lasts for about two years, Bitcoin is expected to continue in a bull cycle for at least more than a year going forward. Furthermore, current fundamentals point to steady growth for Bitcoin as inflows continue to pour in from institutional investors.

Particularly, they registered $61.3 million in net inflows yesterday, which is a sign of good things to come. Institutional involvement, especially through vehicles like Spot Bitcoin ETFs, is a crucial factor in BTC’s sustained price growth. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,080.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, ByBit, and OKX have listed EIGEN, providing liquidity to holders of the token, many of whom received it through airdrops earlier this year. In a statement released through X, the Eigen Foundation highlighted the importance of this milestone: “We’re thrilled to announce the unlocking of the EIGEN token, a big step for the Eigenlayer ecosystem. This opens up new possibilities for open innovation, shared security, and participation across the network.” Related Reading: EigenLayer’s Exclusive $15 Billion Token Launch: Who’s In And Who’s Out? They added that the unlock enables developers to build Actively Validated Services (AVSs) using EIGEN staking, enhancing protocol security and functionality. “The unlock of EIGEN marks the beginning of broader engagement. It acts as a catalyst for economic expansion, governance, and protocol development, driving growth and strengthening the decentralized ecosystem,” the Eigen Foundation added. Buy Or Sell Eigenlayer (EIGEN)? Market sentiment has been mixed on the first day of trading. Lookonchain reported significant purchases by whales, indicating strong interest from large-scale investors. One transaction involved an address purchasing 383,672 EIGEN at $4.05, totaling $1.55 million. Another address spent 1.31 million USDC to acquire 318,651 EIGEN at $4.10. 2 whales bought 702,324 $EIGEN($2.86M) in the past 4 hours! 0x2dcd spent 588 $ETH($1.55M) to buy 383,672 $EIGEN at $4.05.https://t.co/QtcgQQJfSR 0xb112 spent 1.31M $USDC to buy 318,651 $EIGEN at $4.1.https://t.co/qy5SoAuuru pic.twitter.com/Dzt65tYwJT — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 1, 2024 Despite these buys, not all activity has been bullish; notable crypto whale GCR was reported to have sold a significant amount of EIGEN shortly after the unlock, depositing over 250,000 EIGEN into Binance. “GCR (@GiganticRebirth) claimed an airdrop of 253,946 EIGEN($1.06M) through 7 wallets and deposited all of it into Binance 40 minutes ago. #GCR“ Lookonchain reports. Crypto analyst Aylo offered a comparison of EIGEN’s market performance relative to other tokens via X: “EIGEN launched exactly in line with the pre-market price, sitting at $7B FDV. A few coins with bigger FDVs than EIGEN currently include OP ($8B), ONDO ($7.9B), UNI ($7.7B), FIL ($7.6),BCH ($7.2B),” he noted, suggesting that EigenLayer’s role in Ethereum’s ecosystem could be a critical factor in its valuation. Related Reading: EigenLayer Founder Reiterates Support For Ethereum, Why Is ETH Struggling? “EigenLayer is the innovation on Ethereum this cycle, and has had more coverage than almost anything else in the EVM in the last year. Really does feel similar to the conditions that TIA launched in. Does the PA play out the same way? No unlocks for a year too…,” Aylo noted. Daan Crypto Trades, another prominent analyst, remarked on the market dynamics: “EIGEN Launched today. I think many market participants will be watching the price action develop to gauge overall market strength and sentiment. So far, price has held up, and even gone up slightly, even though there’s a lot of airdrop participants selling their tokens.” He speculated on the potential for EIGEN’s market valuation to rise, indicating that the current conditions might be more favorable than in recent months. “If the market keeps trending from here I’m assuming EIGEN can go much higher than $7B FDV. Earlier this year it was estimated to launch at $20B+ (in better market conditions). Having said that, I don’t own any right now but I’d definitely be a buyer at $2-3 and I think many would. So not sure if it gets there at all if it doesn’t do so in the first few days of airdrop selling,” Daan concluded. At press time, EIGEN traded at $4.127.

The trading app launched in the EU in December as more and more U.S. exchanges look to expand in the trading bloc.  Robinhood (HOOD) customers in the European Union can now transfer more than 20 cryptocurrencies, including include bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}} and USD coin {{USDC}}, in and out of the trading app.  The California-based company is expanding its offerings as the bloc's crypto laws known as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) come into effect.  “With the launch of crypto transfers in Europe, we’re making self-custody and entering DeFi simpler and more accessible for our customers,” Johann Kerbrat, VP and general manger of Robinhood Crypto, said in a statement. “Support for deposits and withdrawals gives customers more control over their crypto, while ensuring they have the same safe, low-cost, and reliable experience they expect from Robinhood.”  The new capability comes 10 months after the trading app started letting customers in the EU trade crypto, saying the region has one of the world’s most comprehensive policies for crypto asset regulation.  In March, the company fully rolled out its brokerage operations in the U.K. It began to onboard customers in the non-EU country a year ago after an earlier attempt failed due to a shift of focus during the Covid pandemic.  Many U.S.-based crypto exchanges have doubled down their operations in Europe after the advent of MiCA, which will come into effect this year.

34193857,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645771,1727797205,"Uptober Outlook: Why Bitcoin Could Reach $98,000 Following Bullish September","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently celebrated a remarkable September, achieving a two-month high of $66,560 last Friday. Although it fell short of its all-time peak of $73,700 in March, the strong performance in September has raised expectations for significant gains as the year draws close. Historical trends suggest that when Bitcoin ends September positively, the following three months often yield even larger returns. Best September Ever Could Lead To Major Year-End Rally Crypto expert Ali Martinez highlighted this historical pattern in a social media post, emphasizing the correlation between a bullish September and subsequent price increases. As seen in the image below shared by the analyst, Bitcoin has experienced four particularly strong September since 2015, with average gains of over 20% in October, around 10% in November, and over 20% in December. Related Reading: Crypto Researcher Reveals Why XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Not A Pipe Dream In contrast, Bitcoin’s past Septembers that ended in the green showed more modest gains, with the last bullish month yielding an average increase of about 8%. This time, however, Bitcoin’s best September in history may pave the way for even higher gains than those recorded in previous years. Currently trading at $62,000, Bitcoin’s potential trajectory appears promising. If the cryptocurrency adheres to historical averages following bullish Septembers—projected gains of 20% in October, 10% in November, and another 20% in December—BTC could realistically approach a price of nearly $98,000 by year-end. Moreover, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency tends to go on a “parabolic bull run” in October of each Halving year, as Martinez also pointed out, adding to the bullish outlook for what could be one of the best fourth quarters in Bitcoin’s history. Options Market Suggests Potential Bitcoin Dip Ahead While Martinez is optimistic about BTC’s potential for significant gains in October, one expert is cautious about the current market dynamics. Analyst InspoCrypto recently noted that the options market presents a more cautious picture. Data indicates that many positions are leaning towards a bearish outlook, with some block trades suggesting a potential dip in Bitcoin’s price, specifically targeting ranges between $60,000 and $55,000. The current “max pain” point—where the most options would expire worthless—is $62,000. Given that the price is hovering near this level, there is concern that this could contribute to continuing the bearish trend. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Additionally, the analyst pointed out that long positions around the $60,000 mark are vulnerable to liquidation. However, despite these cautious signals for October, the outlook beyond this month appears much more optimistic. InspoCrypto emphasized that data from the options market shows a strong bullish sentiment for the months following October. Many traders are anticipating Bitcoin prices to exceed $80,000, with some even forecasting a rise to $100,000. Suppose a dip does occur in mid-October, as some data suggests. In that case, the analyst believes it may represent the last opportunity for investors to enter before Bitcoin embarks on a significant upward trajectory.

42390268,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvFdd,1727796600,Crypto Winter-Era Seed Startups Mostly Persist Despite Tumult and Crisis,"Crypto's hellish 2022 was awash in washouts: Terra-Luna crashed, FTX rugged and crypto lenders bombed. Yet the disasters failed to sink many of the teams perhaps most vulnerable to mayhem: early-stage startups.  Over 80% of the crypto startups that announced seed rounds in 2022 continue to build today, according to a new report from Lattice VC.  The finding may add some retrospective hope to what was otherwise crypto’s darkest year yet. Venture capital companies deployed over $5 billion into 1,200 teams that unveiled their seed rounds during the tumultuous months of 2022 – 2.5 times more capital than in 2021.  “Because of the massive influx of capital for 2022, there was just a natural expectation” of a higher fail rate, said Mike Zajko, co-founder at Lattic. The prediction hasn’t really come to fruition.  Eigen Labs led the pack for crypto’s 2022 class. Its restaking invention set a narrative that two years later anchors many incoming startups in Ethereum and beyond.  Such success is hardly representative of the whole. A mere 1% of teams found product-market fit, and only 12% of the teams have raised follow-on rounds, Lattice said.  That sobering reality indicates rocky times ahead for teams that continue to hope for a home run. It will be harder for them to come by without the exuberance and retail inflow of a true bull market. At some point, their runways may run out.  “Teams have been able to stretch it to try to get to the other side,” Zajko said.  2022-era startups have seen notably fewer token launches than teams of 2021, according to Lattice: 15% in 2022 compared to 2021. This may be explained by teams missing the “bull market window,” said Zajko, as well as centralized exchanges becoming “choosier” about which assets to list.  Platform appears to be as important as product, if not more so. Teams that launched on NEAR, Flow and StarkNet – three ecosystems that raised nine-figure sums in 2021 and 2022 – have completely failed to raise follow-ons, the report said.  Crypto’s gaming sub-sector provides a useful explainer case. In 2022, that pack raised $700 million from venture companies betting on crypto-powered video games as the lucrative future.  That hasn’t happened yet. The big ideas of crypto gaming – NFTs and the metaverse – are mostly afterthoughts in 2024 despite dominating media and investor attention in 2022.  “Whatever the hot trend is during that year is not likely to be what people are talking about or excited about 1-2 years later,” said Zajko.  Meanwhile, the two big trends of this year – AI and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) – saw little cap table action in 2022. In two years the market will get a better sense of whether the 2024 narratives have more staying power than those of 2022.",NEUTRAL,NEAR,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/01/crypto-winter-era-seed-startups-mostly-persist-despite-tumult-and-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f54d96ad79f6dfb6e63f48969986aca2b9c9df0d-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""War news"" rarely have sustainable negative impact on asset prices, Swissblock analysts wrote.  Cryptocurrencies tumbled during the Tuesday U.S. session as headlines of escalating tension in the Middle East prompted investors to flee risk assets.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest digital asset by market cap, climbed to around $64,000 during European hours before quickly tumbling to $62,500 as Axios reported the White House as having indications Iran was prepping an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel. Another leg down followed to $61,000 when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that Iran launched missiles at the country.  A late-afternoon move lower brought bitcoin's price to just above the $60,000 level, now having given up nearly all of the gains seen after the U.S. Federal Reserve sparked a big rally with a 50 basis point interest rate cut in mid-September.  The broad-market digital asset benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was down nearly 5% over the same period, with ether {{ETH}} faring a bit better with a 3.8% loss at just above $2,500. Altcoin majors suffered even deeper pullbacks, as Solana {{SOL}}, Polkadot {{DOT}}, Avalanche {{AVAX}}, Uniswap {{UNI}}, Render {{RNDR}}, Polygon {{POL}} and Hedera {{HBAR}} endured 5%-10% declines.  Key U.S. stock indexes opened the day lower, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq trading 1% and 1.7% lower, respectively, in the later hours of the session. Gold jumped 1% to $2,690 per ounce and neared its record high just above $2,700 set last week, while WTI crude oil surged 3% to over $70 per barrel.  The diverging price action of gold and bitcoin highlighted the leading digital asset's high correlation with risk-on assets like stocks, not to mention gold fulfilling its traditional role as a safe-haven asset. The 30-day rolling correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 is now approaching yearly highs at 0.62, K33 Research noted in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin's Tuesday drop was also reminiscent of the price action at the start of this current Middle East tumult nearly one year ago today, not to mention similar instances earlier this year in April and July when crypto assets knee-jerked lower in reaction to headlines from that region.  Swissblock analysts reiterated its bullish outlook for digital assets in a Telegram market update, saying that ""'war news' like those pressing on markets today rarely turn out to have a sustainable negative impact on asset prices.""

34192017,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645589,1727793046,WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential,"WIF is showing impressive strength as bullish momentum takes control, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pointing to even greater upside potential. The current RSI reading suggests that buying pressure remains strong, fueling optimism for continued gains. While bulls hold their ground, they are increasingly confident that WIF could be poised for a significant breakout toward the $2.8 mark. As market sentiment shifts favorably, this article aims to explore the bullish dominance in WIF, with a focus on how the RSI signals promising upside potential. By analyzing key technical indicators and market trends, the objective is to assess whether WIF can maintain its upward momentum and successfully break through upcoming resistance levels. Bullish Sentiment Strengthens: Will WIF Break $2.6? On the 4-hour chart, WIF has displayed robust bullish momentum after successfully breaking above the $2.2 mark. This upward surge has pushed the price closer to the $2.8 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential breakout. As the bulls continue to assert control, this resistance level becomes a critical hurdle. A decisive move above $2.8 could open the door for further gains, attracting more buying interest and potentially leading to new highs. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a renewed potential for upward movement, with the RSI climbing back to the 68% level after previously dipping to 62%. If the RSI continues to rise, WIF may push higher, possibly breaking through key resistance levels. Related Reading: Dogwifhat Rally Far From Over As Analysts Predicts 1,600% Jump Furthermore, WIF has decisively surpassed the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $2.2 level on the daily chart, marking a notable shift in its price momentum. By holding above these key levels, the asset demonstrates its strength and reinforces a bullish outlook. This optimistic trajectory is not simply a temporary fluctuation. Rather, it reflects robust buying interest and heightened market confidence, suggesting that WIF is ready for additional gains soon. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is currently at 79%, showing no signs of declining in the near term. An elevated RSI level implies that WIF is in overbought territory, signifying strong buying pressure and heightened market enthusiasm. Although high readings can point to potential exhaustion in upward movement, the absence of immediate signals for a pullback suggests that bullish sentiment is still prevalent. What To Expect In The Short-Term For The Meme Coin Presently, WIF is demonstrating strong positive motion, prompting traders and investors to monitor key levels for potential price movements. Maintaining its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $2.2 mark could lead to more gains, with the $2.6 resistance level on the horizon. A successful breakout above $2.6 may unlock additional price growth and enhance traders’ optimism, signaling a more sustained upward trend. Related Reading: Is DogWifHat (WIF) The “Most Bearish” Of All Major Meme Coins? However, with the Relative Strength Index indicating overbought conditions at 79%, a price correction could occur if buying pressure wanes, causing WIF’s price to start dropping toward the $2.2 mark for a retest.

42390279,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvGSv,1727792403,How the Crypto Retail Market Has Changed,"In 2021, daily liquidations worth billions of dollars occurred due to retail mania, with 80% of futures trading collateral margin in bitcoin.  Retail investors are now more ""smart money,"" having evolved to strategically buy the dips and sell the peaks in bitcoin.  Retail investors currently hold approximately 15% of the circulating bitcoin supply, equating to around 3 million bitcoin.  Retail investors were a big factor in the last crypto bull run, helping drive up prices and enthusiasm around digital assets. Many tasted crypto for the first during the COVID lockdowns of 2021 and 2022. And crypto companies were keen to drive interest among regular folk. The result: Super Bowl ads, celebrity endorsements and stadium sponsorship deals.  Then came the crash. This cycle, starting mid-way through 2023, has been more institution-led. These days, the big narratives are around ETFs and slow-but-steady TradFi adoption. And, as yet, retail investors have yet to return in the same numbers. (Memecoins are an exception, which I discussed here.)  I took a deep dive in market data from last year, trying to understand the retail/institutional split, and how the behavior of retail investors has changed from three years ago. Here are my top takeaways.  The evolution of retail  We can split retail investors into two categories: shrimps, who hold less than one bitcoin {{BTC}}, and crabs, who hold anywhere between one and ten bitcoin.  In the last six months of 2017, bitcoin soared from $2,000 to $20,000. As hundreds of thousands of bitcoins were accumulated by retail, the price started to climb higher, showing they were chasing the market as crypto hit the mainstream media.  Read more: Bitcoin Retail Activity Remains Low Despite Recent Rally  However, coming out of a prolonged bear market in 2018 and 2019, bitcoin moved again in late-2020 into early 2021 as the price climbed from roughly $10,000 to $60,000. However, we can see that this cohort was selling bitcoin during the entire period, locking in those gains as they were buyers in the previous bear market instead of buying the top they were selling.  Then came the Luna and FTX collapses in 2022, where retail investors really showed their intelligence, accumulating the most bitcoin on record. In June 2022, they accumulated over 300k bitcoins, while during the FTX collapse, it was over 525k bitcoins. Even as recently as the March 2024 peak, they were selling into the bull.  Retail investors are perpetual buyers  The second takeaway is that as retail has evolved into “smart money.” There is increasing adoption of a dollar-cost averaging approach or been seen as a perpetual buyer. Again, taking less than ten bitcoins as retail, they currently hold around 15% of the circulating supply, translating to around 3 million bitcoin. But, as a cohort, they continue to increase their holdings with very little sell-side pressure. The data suggests they are the dollar-cost average cohort, and it would be fitting to categorize them as smart money as they continue to grow their bitcoin holdings and not be shaken out by price corrections.  This behaviour and mindset are similar to that of an ETF buyer or a passive investor who buys index funds each month. If we look at the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has seen $21.5 billion of net inflows since launch, there have been only three trading days of net outflows, which is remarkable given bitcoin's volatility. Notably, during the yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5 and 6., IBIT registered $0 of outflows.  The ETF cohort has been underwater several times this year due to bitcoin's multiple bull market corrections. However, they remained unfazed and continued buying. The current average price of the ETF investors is around $58k, so they are currently up 8% on their investment.  Liquidations are now a fraction of 2021  Lastly, retail isn't being liquidated as much as 2021, when the government gave out cash stimulus on top of everyone being at home, which coincided with peak retail mania. As we can see in the data, liquidations were plentiful in the futures market in 2021, with billions of dollars worth of monthly liquidations becoming a regular occurrence.  One of the main reasons for this is that a large percentage of futures contracts were margined in bitcoin and not dollars. So, the underlying collateral used for futures trading was bitcoin, which is volatile by nature. This got as high as 70% in 2021. As you can see below, the use of crypto-margin has continued to drop, with the majority of margin-trading in futures now being cash, which is not volatile by nature.  As investors matured and the cycle progressed, liquidations have became a feature, but considerably smaller than in 2021.  Over the last couple of years, retail investors have become much savvier when investing in bitcoin and have similarities with ETF buyers. As the bitcoin market evolves, the next step is an options market to be traded on the ETFs, bringing a new sophisticated investor into the market and further enhancing retail intelligence.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/10/01/how-the-crypto-retail-market-has-changed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f4b2782e15b1b14a52be4922124cd30439d2916-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390275,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvFy9,1727792126,Bitcoin Bull Run in Question as Balances on OTC Desks Rise to 410K,"The OTC bitcoin balance has reached a 2.5 year high of 410,000 tokens.  The run-up is similar to that which took place during the bull run of late 2020 into early 2021.  A decline in bitcoin balances will likely be necessary for a continuation of the recent bull run.  One possible headwind to the idea of 'Uptober' and a general fourth quarter rally for bitcoin {{BTC}} is the recent surge in tokens moving to over-the-counter (OTC) desks.  Data from CryptoQuant suggests there are over 410,000 bitcoins in total on OTC desks, the highest since May 2022 and more than double the 185,000 seen back in March.  The balance can indicate the amount of liquidity available at an OTC desk for purchase or sale, with a high balance showing strong liquidity and the ability for trading desks to fulfill large orders. A lower balance is the opposite and may indicate more difficulty in making trades.  Who uses OTC desks? Clients are mainly high-net-worth individuals or institutions outside retail exchanges. Making trades OTC allows sizable buys and sells without impacting the price of bitcoin on traditional exchanges.  The data show that the OTC balance has shot up in the past six months while bitcoin has been ranging in a downwards channel from its all-time high above $73,500 in March. The run-up in balances is fairly similar to that seen in late 2020 into early 2021 when the OTC balance shot up from 235,000 to 435,000 tokens in six months. The difference is that bitcoin's price was on the rise then, but modestly downward now.  In the bear market of 2022, the OTC balance dropped alongside the decline in bitcoin's price, suggesting net buying.  If bitcoin is to continue its bull run into the fourth quarter, one factor will likely be the need to see a drop in OTC desk balances.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/01/bitcoin-bull-run-in-question-as-balances-on-otc-desks-rise-to-410k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/663f4c991d17f1c5d2f4d4a9047906ef070af96a-4000x2250.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390258,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvF3j,1727789662,'Is Daddy on the Airplane?' Jailed Binance Exec Gambaryan Family’s Ordeal in New Podcast,"“The other day, I took them (kids) to a nearby park and my son saw an airplane in the sky and said, ‘Mommy, look there’s an airplane. Is Daddy on the airplane?’” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of the Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan.  Yuki was speaking to Illicit Edge’s new podcast “Designated” which will focus on stories related to financial crimes.  Tigran Gambaryan has been detained since February in Nigeria, where he was invited as Binance’s head of financial crime compliance to discuss the nation’s dispute with the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Since then, his health has deteriorated. He has been suffering from malaria and a herniated disc, which has left him struggling to walk with a crutch.  “It was heartbreaking,” she said, illustrating how hard it is to “keep things from” her two children, 5 and 10 years old. “I'm not doing well mentally or physically. I am having this constant fear of losing Tigran. What if he gets another malaria and die(s)?”  Gambaryan isn’t just any crypto industry executive. He’s a former investigator with the Internal Revenue Service, who became a “kind of legendary figure within this crypto crime investigation world” as the “agent at the center of so many cases,” said WIRED’s senior writer Andy Greenberg in part two of the podcast. This is the “reason that Tigran is the protagonist of my book,” Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, he said.  Gambaryan’s background as a federal employee has perhaps contributed to the case becoming a legal, diplomatic and business quagmire, with Nigeria playing hardball with Binance and, in particular, the U.S.  “This is an obvious case of holding somebody hostage to punish a business they have a problem with,” said U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, (R-GA) in whose district the Gambaryan family lives. “He's just being treated absolutely horribly and he is an American citizen, and that should be taken very seriously by our government. America has a tremendous amount of leverage over the country.  ""All cards should be on the table,” McCormick said on the podcast. Gambaryan faces money laundering charges. Binance is facing a tax-evasion trial in the country, which is demanding $10 billion in penalties for enabling some $26 billion of untraceable funds. This and other alleged facilitation of illegal capital outflows by the crypto industry at large purportedly led to the Nigerian naira weakening to record lows against the dollar.  “He is being held as a hostage, as leverage, to make Binance pay or to find a scapegoat for Nigeria's own inability to manage its national currency,” Greenberg said. Gambaryan’s wife Yuki said, “They can pursue any legal actions whatever to solve this issue they're having with Binance. But they just don't need Tigran there.”  She also said that her husband had previously been in Nigeria in January and at that time “he had almost got detained.”  “He and his team attended some meetings, and it went hostile. They basically told them that they would confiscate their passports. So, Tigran and his team just immediately got out of the country. So, it was a close call.” On the second trip, she said, my understanding is that Tigran was assured things would be okay.  Nigeria’s authorities did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

42390265,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvFYV,1727788166,How DAO Crowdfunding Could Revolutionize Sports,"In the high-stakes world of sports, strategy is everything. Traditionally, game plans and tactical decisions have been the exclusive domain of coaches and analysts, decided behind closed doors.  But imagine a scenario where thousands of passionate fans have a direct say in those crucial calls. Thanks to the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), this once-unthinkable concept is rapidly becoming reality.  Ben Notaris is a high school senior and the author of #OwnTheGame: Sports DAOs and Beyond.  As a lifelong sports fanatic and high school athlete, I've always been fascinated by the strategies that underpin victory. I have spent endless hours dissecting game footage, debating player trades, and second-guessing coaching decisions from the comfort of my armchair.  As I write in my book:  Overlooking hall-of-fame caliber talents before they blossomed are only a few of the infamous blunders fans have excruciatingly criticized throughout sports history. It's easy to think you’re better, you wouldn’t have missed that opportunity, but you won’t ever have the chance to prove it if you’re not a general manager, let alone a billionaire owner ... UNTIL NOW!  When I stumbled on the concept of DAOs in late 2022, I was immediately captivated by their potential to transform the fan experience. The idea of fans holding real power, not just in the stands but in the boardroom, felt like a game-changer. The prospect of fans becoming active participants in their teams' strategic decisions sparked a fire in me, propelling me to delve deeper into this burgeoning field.  Read more: How Sports DAOs Can Offer Fans a Piece of the Action  The Democratization of Sports Strategy  DAOs, built on blockchain technology, are communities where members who hold tokens can vote on key decisions. In the context of sports, this could mean anything from pre-game strategies to real-time play calls during a match.  Imagine a world where fans of an NFL team could vote on whether to go for it on fourth down, or basketball fans could decide when to implement a full-court press. This level of involvement could transform the sports viewing experience, making every fan feel genuinely involved.  The concept of leveraging (in this case, collective) intelligence to gain a competitive edge is not entirely new, even in sports. The Oakland A's, as chronicled in Michael Lewis' book and the film adaption of Moneyball, famously used data analytics to challenge traditional scouting methods and build a winning team on a shoestring budget.  DAOs take this idea to the next level, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd—thousands of passionate fans who live and breathe the game.  ""DAOs are power equalizers offering true fractional ownership,” I argue in the book. They “empower members with any tangible stake… to enjoy their participation.”  My research, which involved interviews with DAO founders and members, suggests that crowdsourced strategies can introduce a diversity of perspectives, leading to more innovative and adaptable game plans. They can also boost fan engagement and loyalty, as fans feel a deeper connection to the team when they have a direct stake in its success.  Read more: From DOH! to DAO: The Rise of Decentralized Organizations  Fan-Controlled Football and Beyond  Fan-Controlled Football (FCF) is a prime example of this shift. In FCF, a league that plays during the NFL's off season, fans use a DAO-like model to call plays in real time during games. Using a mobile app, they vote on offensive plays via blockchain, with the majority decision relayed to the players on the field. Though the league has been on pause the past two years due to a lack of high-profile players who attract a large enough audience, it looks to return strong in 2025.  During my research, I observed how, by tapping into the collective wisdom of thousands of fans, FCF demonstrates how crowdsourced strategy can add a new level of excitement and unpredictability to sports.  FCF is the tip of the iceberg. DAOs are making waves across a variety of sports.  Krause House, though its NBA dreams were put on hold, acquired a team in rapper Ice Cube's Big3 basketball league, showcasing the potential for fan-owned teams at a professional level.  LinksDAO, a golf-centric DAO, made headlines by purchasing a Scottish golf course, opening up access to a traditionally exclusive sport.  The audacious BuyTheBroncos DAO, though unsuccessful, proved that fans are willing to mobilize significant capital to pursue ownership of their beloved teams.  Other DAOs are pushing the boundaries of fan participation in strategy even further. For instance, the Veloce metaverse racing platform allows token holders to manage a virtual racing team, influencing decisions like car upgrades and driver selections. MotorDAO, meanwhile, is bringing this concept to life by creating a community-owned racing team.  Karate Combat, the world’s largest DAO, creates immersive CGI experiences for virtual fans, who tune into Up Only Gaming, a decentralized app, to make predictions on the league's real-world fights.  Read more: Building a Sports DAO: 4 Lessons From LinksDAO  The Collaborative Future of Sports  ""The DAO mechanism allows for voting on critical decisions; it gives everyone a say,"" I write in my book. ""Sports DAOs have the potential to democratize sports and empower communities like never before.""  As DAOs continue to evolve, we might see a future where professional sports teams operate as full or hybrid DAOs, with fans making decisions on critical transactions from player acquisitions to coaching hires.  What’s more, the integration of DAOs with artificial intelligence and data analytics could create a powerful new model in sports strategy, combining fan input with objective data to make the best possible decisions.  The power of the crowd is set to change the game forever. As an aspiring economist, I'm excited to be part of this revolution.

34189548,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645570,1727787607,"Crypto Researcher Reveals Why XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Not A Pipe Dream","The XRP price has struggled for the last three years, staying down even when Bitcoin and other altcoins rallied to possible new all-time highs. However, even through this, the XRP community has remained steadfast in their belief that the altcoin’s price will reach new peaks. Forecasts have ranged from reaching $1 to as high as $1,000. The latter has been hotly debated among crypto investors. However, one crypto researcher believes that the XRP price will be able to touch $1,000 eventually, giving reasons for why this could happen. Dominating Global Banking Systems The selling point of the XRP token has always been the fact that it is to be integrated into the world banking systems, allowing for cheaper, faster, and smoother transactions. The expectations for the token’s use in banking were the initial reason behind its meteoric rise, and this has continued to foster belief in its future. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why Crypto researcher CryptoTank took to X (formerly Twitter), to reiterate the value proposal of this for the XRP Price, alluding to this utility. The researcher points out that SWIFT is already integrating the RippleNet into its systems, and given SWIFT’s volume, it could mean a lot of inflow for the token. They point out that SWIFT currently does around $5-$7 trillion in daily volume, even with high fees of $20-$50 per transaction. However, compared to this, using RippleNet would bring fees down to pennies, allowing the payment platform to save hundreds of billions of dollars yearly. Furthermore, the researcher explains that even if Ripple were to only get 10% of SWITF’s trading volume, it would mean a substantial $500 billion at least passing through RippleNet daily. At this rate, the low XRP price would not be adequate to handle the volume from SWIFT alone. Thus, the researcher believes that the XRP price would rise to be able to compensate for this new volume. “XRP has to be very high to move just 10% of Swifts daily volume,” the researcher said. “When you start adding the other banks in it gets crazy how high XRP will go.” XRP Price To $1,000 Debate The recent debate surrounding the XRP price reaching $1,000 began with the Uphold crypto exchange asking the community what they would do if the XRP price were to hit $1,000. This sparked speculations on whether or not the altcoin can actually reach this price, triggering input from various angles.

42390277,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvGDX,1727785779,First Mover Americas: BTC Is Little Changed Following Muted Asia Trading,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,075.25 +1.1%  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,851.97 +0.27%  Ether (ETH): $2,63297 +0.62%  S&P 500: 5,762.48 +0.42%  Gold: $2,648.98 +0.52%  Nikkei 225: 38,651.97 +1.93%  Top Stories  Crypto markets were muted during the first half of the Asia trading day owing to public holidays in China, Hong Kong and South Korea. Bitcoin traded around $63,900, an increase of about 0.5% in the last 24 hours, while ether rose just over 1% to $2,635. The wider digital asset market gained 0.2%, according to the CoinDesk 20 Index. China and Hong Kong are both off for China's national holiday, which is a week-long affair known as Golden Week in mainland China and one day in Hong Kong. South Korea is closed for Armed Forces day, a holiday introduced this year.  Traders have locked in almost $1 billion in bullish bets of bitcoin reaching $100,000 on derivatives exchange Deribit. The dollar value of the number of active call options contracts at the $100,000 strike price was over $993 million, the highest among all other BTC options listed on the exchange, according to data source Deribit Metrics. The second most popular option was the $70,000 call, boasting an open interest of over $800 million. ""The highest open interest across all expirations appears at $100K and $70K for bitcoin, which some market participants interpret as supporting the bullish sentiment that seems to be pervading the market,"" crypto trading firm Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  The digital assets sector continues to outperform the stock market this year, with bitcoin leading the charge, broker Canaccord said. The broker noted that the world's largest cryptocurrency finished the last quarter up around 140% year-on-year, outperforming ether which gained about 60% and the S&P 500 stock index, which rose almost 30%, over the same period. If bitcoin follows historical patterns it tends to rally 6-12 months following the halving, and reach new highs 2-6 months later, meaning a potential rally could start between now and April, the broker said. Bitcoin is still performing like other risk assets for now, and is reacting positively to the ""lower-rate environment,"" analysts led by Michael Graham wrote.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the dollar value of the total transfer volume over the Bitcoin blockchain since 2015.  The level of economic activity remains depressed relative to previous bull market peaks.

If you invested in Bitcoin at the beginning of the year, most likely you've earned solid gains on your BTC investments. My bullish bet on Bitcoin through the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) performed wonderfully, outpacing the S&P 500 index by a huge margin. However, the Bitcoin ETF landscape keeps evolving, so it's time to reconsider the tools used to get exposure to Bitcoin. I stay positive on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin amid the global interest rate cutting cycle, though I downgrade the BTCO ETF to Hold as there are cheaper and more liquid alternatives out there. BTCO ETF Overview According to the fund's description , Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that reflects the performance of the spot price of Bitcoin as measured using the Lukka Prime Reference Rate , less the fund's expenses and other liabilities. As of late September 2024, the BTCO ETF has only $531 million of assets under management, which is not much compared to other BTC ETFs. Together with the expense ratio of 0.25%, the BTCO doesn't look like an optimal option these days. Seeking Alpha Let's compare the BTCO ETF with peer funds. For comparison, I've picked the other four most liquid spot BTC ETFs. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) looks the best of the bunch, with just a 0.12% expense ratio and an immensely larger AUM. It should be noted that even though the stated expense ratio for the BITB is 0.00%, the actual expense fee is 0.20% because the fee waiver has already expired. Seeking Alpha IBIT's bid/ask spread is more than five times better compared to the BTCO ETFs, which is especially important if you want to trade bitcoin-related ETFs frequently. Seeking Alpha Overall, I'd like to see more competition in the spot BTC ETF space. In my opinion, competing ETF providers need to take more aggressive action to counter the growing dominance of the IBIT ETF, which has been strengthened even more after the SEC approved options trading for the IBIT. Performance Recap Since my previous article in late January, the BTCO grew by more than 53%, greatly outperforming the S&P 500 index. Seeking Alpha The BTC performance was quite shaky throughout the year, but the latest rate cut from the Fed has ignited the interest of the public again, with the rate cut cycle serving as a major near-term tailwind for Bitcoin. There's Still A Gap To Be Closed My approach to trading Bitcoin heavily relies on the correlation between the BTC price and the S&P 500 index. As we can see, the BTC price moves largely together with the index, with short-term spikes usually caused by overly positive or negative investors' sentiment. TradingView The BTC price needs to reach at least $71000 to match the current level of the S&P 500. For me, it's hard to imagine the BTC price lagging behind the S&P 500 for too long amid rate cuts. Also, I'd like to highlight an interesting seasonality pattern for the BTC. Historically, if September ended in green for Bitcoin, then there was a whole quarter of growth. Coinglass There's no guarantee that this pattern will repeat itself this year, though positive BTC performance this September still improves chances of robust returns until the end of the year. The Bottom Line The reason I'm downgrading the BTCO is quite simple. After nine months since the inception of all major spot BTC ETFs, more liquid and cheaper options have established their place in the ETF space. Given that all spot BTC ETFs trade the same asset, it's the liquidity and fees that matter. The BTCO ETF isn't a bad ETF to hold, it's just worse than the current competition, and I think investors should stick to the best options available.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724411-btco-that-was-a-great-run-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34188089.jpeg

34187218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645576,1727782258,"Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why","In an analysis shared on X, Kelly Greer, Vice President of Trading at Galaxy Digital, presents a compelling argument for why the Bitcoin price could surge to as high as $118,000 by the end of the year. Greer’s insights are grounded in a combination of historical performance data, current market dynamics, and broader macroeconomic factors, all of which she believes are aligning to create a highly favorable environment for Bitcoin. Here’s Why Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $118,000 Greer begins by highlighting Bitcoin’s strong historical performance in the fourth quarter (Q4) of previous years. She pointed out that since 2020, Bitcoin’s average Q4 return to its intra-quarter high watermark has been approximately 85%. This figure includes a best-case scenario where the return reached a staggering 230%, and a worst-case scenario with a 12% decline. “BTC average Q4 return (to max [intra quarter high watermark, full q return]) since 2020 is +85% (worst -12%, best +230%)—press you to find a stronger asymmetry,” Greer writes. This statistical asymmetry suggests a significant potential upside compared to the downside, making Q4 historically a period of robust growth for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Record September Gives Bitcoin 82% Odds For An Ultra Bullish Q4: Analyst A merely average Q4 with a price increase of 85% could mean a year-end price of $118,000 for Bitcoin. If the BTC outperforms its record of 230%, the price could even rise well above $200,000. Notably, Greer believes that the current market is not fully positioned to take advantage of this potential. She attributes this underallocation to a few key factors. Firstly, there is apprehension surrounding the upcoming US presidential election scheduled for November 5. Secondly, other assets such as gold and China’s A-shares are attracting significant attention and capital, potentially diverting investment away from Bitcoin. “I still don’t think the market is allocated accordingly—2024 is a unique case where some portion of the market is underindexing on the Q4 asymmetry due to a) Nov 5 US election risk and/or b) other assets are screaming (gold, China A-shares etc.),” Greer remarks. Key Reasons To Be Bullish On BTC To support her assessment of the market’s current positioning, Greer cites her interactions with risk managers and noted specific market indicators. She mentioned observing “low volatility and contained perp funding,” which suggests that traders are not aggressively betting on significant price movements. Beyond these market dynamics, Greer identifies several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors that she believes are creating a “broadly very positive” backdrop for Bitcoin. One significant point is the presence of global stimulus measures in major economies such as the United States and China, excluding Japan. Greer also highlights that BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, received a SAB 121 exemption. This exemption allows the bank to offer custody services for Bitcoin without the stringent capital requirements that previously made such services less attractive. Greer describes this development as “massive and underappreciated,” noting that it will “loosen financing in our industry substantially.” Related Reading: Analyst Sees Bitcoin Reaching $8 Trillion Market Cap: What Price Will This Surge Bring? Furthermore, Greer points out that ETF flows have become “very constructive.” Over the past few days, spot BTC inflows have reaccelerated massively. Last Friday, net flows were $494.8 million, making it the highest net inflow day of the quarter and the highest net inflow day since June 4th. Another positive indicator is that Bitcoin miners are entering agreements with hyperscalers—large-scale cloud service providers. These partnerships can enhance mining efficiency and reduce operational costs. Greer also mentions that “supply overhangs [are] mostly done,” suggesting that large sell-offs that could suppress the price are unlikely in the near term. Additionally, she anticipates that “demand from FTX cash distros [is] around the corner,” implying that funds distributed from the FTX exchange could find their way into Bitcoin investments, further boosting demand. However, Greer also acknowledges potential risks that could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. These include signals from the Federal Reserve regarding monetary policy and the possibility of a pullback in equity markets. Such events could introduce volatility or dampen investor enthusiasm. However, she believes that the overall sentiment remains positive. “There are risks of course—Fed signaling, equities pullback, what have you—but net net vibes are quite good, and flows are just getting started,” she remarks. Greer also describes Bitcoin as a “reflexive asset.” She explains, “BTC is the ultimate reflexive asset: price -> flows -> price.” This means that as the price of Bitcoin increases, it attracts more investment flows, which in turn push the price even higher—a self-reinforcing cycle. Greer notes that Bitcoin is entering Q4 after breaking a key price level at $65,000. If the price were to reclaim the $70,000 mark, she expects that the inflows would accelerate as investors respond to the positive momentum and recall the strong Q4 performances of previous years. At press time, BTC traded at $63,947.

The average bitcoin {{BTC}} price and the network hashrate rose slightly in September, while daily mining revenue and gross profit fell for a third straight month, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Tuesday.  The hashrate rose for the third month in a row, adding 2% from August to 643 exahashes per second (EH/s).

JPMorgan estimated that miners earned an average of $42,100 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue last month, 6% less than the month before.  ""We estimate daily block reward gross profit declined 6% month on month (m/m) to $16,100 per EH/s (38.4% gross margin) in September, the lowest point on recent record,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.

42390274,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvG8P,1727780846,Open Interest in XRP Zooms to $1B as Ripple Tests RLUSD Stablecoin,"Open interest in XRP has surged past $1 billion amid growing enthusiasm for Ripple's forthcoming RLUSD stablecoin, currently in private beta testing on both XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain.  Bets on XRP futures grew to over $1 billion over the weekend, a level last seen in March and June last year.  Open interest in xrp {{XRP}} tokens has zoomed in the past few days with enthusiasm buoyed by tests of RLUSD, a stablecoin being developed by closely related Ripple Labs.  Recent activities include minting significant amounts of RLUSD, suggesting that the testing phase might be wrapping up or moving into a more active phase of development. This has created speculative buzz around RLUSD on platforms like X, with users tracking the minting activities closely.  Open Interest (OI) refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts not settled for an asset. An increase in OI and a price increase typically indicate that new money is coming into the market. On the other hand, if the price rises but OI falls, the rally might be driven by short covering rather than new buying, potentially signaling a weaker trend.  On Monday, Ripple reiterated that RLUSD remains in private beta on XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain. In a post on X, it warned of scams using the stablecoin as bait.  Ripple plans to use RLUSD in its cross-border payments product, providing liquidity, facilitating faster and cheaper transactions, and potentially integrating with various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across multiple blockchains.  Bets on XRP futures grew to over $1 billion over the weekend, a level last seen in March and June last year. Crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit account for almost half of the placed bets, open interest data tracked by Coinglass show. Spot trading volumes more than doubled in the past week to as high as $2.5 billion on Sunday, data shows.

The SEC shall confer with Steven Sprague, CEO of Rivetz, and file a proposed judgment for injunctive and monetary relief on or before October 22, 2024, the filing said.  A United States District Judge has sided with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a case where the regulator is alleging that the mobile crypto wallet Rivetz sold unregistered securities, a court document showed on Monday.  Judge Mark Mastroianni granted the SEC's motion for summary judgement, a decision based on evidence made without going to trial.  ""The SEC shall confer with Sprague [Steven Sprague, CEO of Rivetz] and file a proposed judgment for injunctive and monetary relief on or before October 22, 2024,"" Mastroianni said. ""Sprague shall file any objections to the proposed judgment on or before November 5, 2024.""  The SEC filed this action against now defunct crypto firm Rivetz in 2021, alleging that they offered unregistered securities and violated the securities act when they conducted a $18 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017 for the Rivetz token. ICO's are a way for crypto companies to raise money for early stage crypto projects and offer incentives.  ""The undisputed facts here clearly establish that Sprague personally promoted the ICO in the United States and knew that no registration statement was filed prior to the ICO,"" the SEC filing said.  Many crypto firms have been sued by the SEC in recent years.  In August, a federal judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million after finding that the company violated federal securities laws with its direct sales of XRP to institutional clients, a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC initially sought.  The SEC also brought an enforcement action against crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and alleged that Coinbase ""intermediated transactions in crypto securities on its trading platform,"" and the court sided with the SEC according to a filing in March.

The market might be in a phase where it's waiting for retail investors to provide exit liquidity even as new whales accumulate BTC from older ones, according to some observers.  This behavior typically precedes retail traders entering en masse when bitcoin prices approach new highs.  Retail investors are lagging behind institutions in ramping up purchases of bitcoin {{BTC}} at the start of October, a month that's historically been bullish for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Net inflows from smaller investors are still at levels considered normal even as bigger investors are increasing purchases. Data from crypto exchanges OKX and Binance, popular with retail market participants, show minimal activity compared with bull markets in 2021 and 2022, and less even than during the bear market of 2019-2020.  The restraint is remarkable because, since 2013, October has only twice ended in the red, chalking gains of as high as 60% and an average of 22% to make it the most best month for investor returns.  In recent months, fewer than 40,000 wallets have been active each day on the two exchanges. That's less even than during the bear market when the BTC was below $10,000 and active wallets numbered around 50,000 a day. The data is in line with other indicators such as popularity of the Coinbase mobile application and on-chain usage, as reported.  “We’re in the middle of a bull cycle, waiting for retail exit liquidity, while new whales are accumulating BTC from old whales,” CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju said in an X post Tuesday.  Retail traders, often referred to as individual traders, buy or sell assets for personal accounts. Institutional traders buy and sell for accounts they manage for a group or institution and are colloquially referred to as “whales” due to their sizable influence in the market.  Retail traders are often seen as less informed or more emotion-driven than institutional investors. A significant influx of retail money can indicate bullish sentiment – a general belief is that prices will rise.  However, extremely high retail inflows might signal an overheating market, potentially nearing the end of a rally or market cycle. Early signs of increasing retail inflow might suggest the end of a bear market and the beginning of an accumulation phase.  Sudden spikes in retail buying can sometimes precede market peaks, followed by corrections when these investors start selling out of fear or profit-taking.  Retail traders “usually enter when the BTC price is skyrocketing and reaching an all-time high,” Ki said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/01/bitcoin-retail-inflows-hold-steady-as-whales-pile-in-at-start-of-historically-bullish-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/967e160d487b8a89e9334e52bb03d1744aa064cb-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390297,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc409p,1727779348,Bitcoin $100K Bullish Bet Draws Nearly $1B Open Interest on Deribit,"Traders have locked in over $990 million in BTC $100,000 call option, according to Deribit.  The $45,000 put is most popular among the U.S. elections expiry options.  Traders over Polymarket see only 15% chance of prices rising to $100,000 by the year end.  Need evidence of just how bullish the bitcoin {{BTC}} market sentiment is? Look no further than crypto exchange Deribit, where traders have locked in nearly $1 billion in call options at a $100,000 strike, providing buyers with an asymmetric upside above the said level.  As of writing, the dollar value of the number of active call options contracts at the $100,000 strike price was over $993 million, the highest among all other BTC options listed on the exchange, according to data source Deribit Metrics. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC.  The second most popular option was the $70,000 call, boasting an open interest of over $800 million. More importantly, call options accounted for over 50% of the total BTC options open interest of $14.15 billion on the exchange.  ""The highest open interest across all expirations appears at $100K and $70K for bitcoin, which some market participants interpret as supporting the bullish sentiment that seems to be pervading the market,"" crypto trading firm Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  A call buyer has the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date and is implicitly bullish on the market. Traders, anticipating price rallies, often buy cheap out-of-the-money options like the $100,000 call, which are relatively cheaper than those closer to the ongoing spot price.  U.S. elections options  BTC options expiring on Nov. 8, the day when the results of U.S. election results will be announced, boast a cumulative open interest of $938 million, with $117 million concentrated in the $45,000 strike put options.  The popularity of the $45,000 points is consistent with the tendency of traders to seek downside hedges ahead of a binary event like the election results.  ""The volatility surface indicates a bias toward the downside until late October/November when the market begins to favor calls over put protection. Current positioning suggests support for a post-election rally,"" Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk in an email.  Open interest in December expiry is concentrated heavily in call options, with the $100,000 strike being the most popular in a sign of expectations of a year-end surge.  Polymarket traders are unsure  Traders over decentralized betting platform Polymarket see a low probability of the cryptocurrency tapping the !00,000 mark by the end of the year.  At press time, the Yes side shares in the ""Will Bitcoin Hit $100K in 2024"" contract traded at 15 cents, representing a minuscule probability of a rally into six figures. The contract will automatically resolve to yes should BTC's price Coinbase hit a high of $100,000 on or before Dec. 31.

Dogecoin Leaps 20%, Co-Creator Says He Doesn’t Know Why","Making headlines in the crypto scene last week, Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped an astounding 20% in a few days. Renowned for its meme beginnings and devoted following, the coin moved from $0.10745 to a peak of $0.13080. Many people were perplexed by this surprising surge and questioned what might have produced such a sharp change. Related Reading: XRP To $1,000? Experts Weigh In On Bold Predictions And Market Realities ‘No Idea’ Prominent for his sardonic views on the crypto market, co-creator Billy Markus answered nothing. Emphasizing the erratic character of cryptocurrencies, he said he had “no idea” why the price jumped so much. Q&A Q: why is dogecoin up 20% this week? A: no idea — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) September 29, 2024 Having lightened the mood, Markus headed to the X platform to connect with his followers. Commenting on how prompt he was in addressing this huge change in the market, Markus said, “It’s pretty almost my answer to everything crypto price related.” It’s a statement that epitomizes not just his humor but also the ultimate reality faced by so many crypto enthusiasts: a lot of art and not so much science when predicting a price move. Closely tracking Dogecoin is another analyst – Trader Tardigrade. On the monthly graph of Dogecoin, he noted a technical pattern sometimes referred to as the Falling wedge. This trend sometimes shows positive reversals, implying that the coin might be about to undergo notable price rise. Tardigrade’s observations add still another level of mystery since he calls this era “DOGE season,” stressing the coin’s possible upcoming trajectory for significant gains depending on past trends. #Dogecoin monthly chart shows early sign of breakout to a Falling Wedge, which kicks off the start of $DOGE season 🔥 The pattern is almost the same as last two cycles. There’s no reason for this time is different. Send $DOGE to $1.6, Doge fam 🚀 pic.twitter.com/snqNsDpIhO — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 29, 2024 Whale Activity Drives Price Explosion The increase in whale activity is most likely the cause of Dogecoin’s amazing climb. Major cryptocurrency owners grabbed 1.4 billion DOGE over just 48 hours, valued roughly $140 million. Such large acquisitions can cause waves in the market that raise prices and draw interest from smaller investors. Related Reading: UNI Surges 30% Amid Ongoing On-Chain Development Talks Another unidentified whale arrived on the scene purchasing an extra 1.4 billion DOGE, which caused Markus to react with a little surprise or confusion. His surprise emphasizes the peculiar characteristics of the crypto market, in which big holdings can greatly affect pricing. Markus stated that he is not planning to introduce any new cryptocurrencies, even if he is absolutely instrumental in building Dogecoin back in 2013. He advised prospective buyers against believing fraudulent assertions regarding his participation in other initiatives. Those who are thinking about investing in the often shifting terrain of cryptocurrencies, where false information can proliferate like wildfire, depend on this clarity. Analysts See Potential Breakout With excitement building, some analysts even suggest that Dogecoin could be on the brink of a big breakout. As of this writing, the tone in the crypto space remains positive. Experts believe DOGE can shoot up all the way to a price of $1.6 in the near future. The identification by Tardigrade of the Falling Wedge pattern is one decent reason for such optimism as this pattern had historically preceded some mammoth price rallies for Dogecoin.

The company now holds over 500 BTC, using it as a strategic reserve to hedge against yen volatility and Japan's debt, leading to a significant 420% increase in its stock price since starting its bitcoin investments in April.  Japanese firm Metaplanet said earlier Tuesday it had purchased an additional 107 bitcoin {{BTC}}, worth $6.9 million at current prices, at an average price of 9.26 million yen ($64,168) per BTC.

The Tokyo-based company said it borrowed the money from shareholder British Virgin Islands-based MMXX Ventures ""with the entire amount allocated for purchasing bitcoin.”  In May, Metaplanet adopted bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset and a hedge against Japan's debt burden and the resulting volatility in the yen. It started buying bitcoin in April with initial transactions of 117.7 BTC, or $7.19 million at the time.  The firm now holds over 500 BTC and is the largest holder among publicly-traded Asian firms after Hong Kong-based Meitu, Bitcoin Treasuries data show. The holdings were accumulated at an average price 9,373,557 yen per Bitcoin, or $64,931.  Meanwhile, the move has helped bump the company’s stock prices, bringing a market capitalization to holdings ratio to joint highest of 20% on Tuesday.

Canaccord said bitcoin's dominance should decline given the lesser need for an inflation hedge, but it still performs like other risk assets for now.  If bitcoin follows historical patterns post halving a rally could start between now and April, the broker said.  The digital assets sector continues to outperform the stock market this year, with bitcoin {{BTC}} leading the charge, broker Canaccord said in a quarterly report on Monday.  The broker noted that the world's largest cryptocurrency finished the last quarter up around 140% year-on-year (y/y), outperforming ether {{ETH}} which gained about 60% and the S&P 500 stock index, which rose almost 30%, over the same period.  If bitcoin follows historical patterns it tends to rally 6-12 months following the halving, and reach new highs 2-6 months later, meaning a potential rally could start between now and April, the broker said.  The Federal Reserve's 50 basis points (bps) interest rate cut triggered a move higher for both equities and digital assets, Canaccord noted.  ""We think the most healthy reaction for crypto's long-term future in a scenario like this would be a decline in BTC,"" the report said, given the lesser need for an inflation hedge, and a rise in ether and other digital assets alongside risk equities, as ""investors become more willing to underwrite longer-term growth and innovation.""  Bitcoin is still performing like other risk assets for now, and is reacting positively to the ""lower-rate environment,"" analysts led by Michael Graham wrote.  BTC's correlation to risk assets is 0.4, down from all-time highs of 0.6 in June 2022, the authors wrote.  While the timing of any future rate cuts is unclear, beneficial supply and demand dynamics following the bitcoin halving in April could add to the positive tailwinds from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the report added.  Stablecoin supply grew 7% in the third quarter, the report noted.

34184228,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24222,1727773568,What is Eigenlayer (EIGEN)?,"EigenLayer is a protocol on Ethereum that introduces a new crypto economic security model known as “restaking.” This allows Ethereum stakers to reuse their staked ETH or Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to secure additional Decentralised Applications (DApps) and services within the EigenLayer ecosystem. By opting into EigenLayer smart contracts, users can extend the security of their staked assets across multiple services, earning additional rewards. Restaking offers a way to leverage the capital staked in Ethereum’s consensus layer, providing a shared security pool for various DApps without requiring new validator networks. The motivation behind EigenLayer is to address the fragmented security landscape in Ethereum’s decentralised ecosystem. Normally, every new decentralised service needs to establish its own security network, leading to duplication and inefficiency. EigenLayer’s pooled security model allows these services to tap into the existing security infrastructure provided by Ethereum stakers. This reduces capital requirements for stakers and enhances security guarantees for the services that adopt the protocol, encouraging more innovation on Ethereum without the need to independently bootstrap trust networks. EigenLayer’s architecture is centred around a system of delegation and validation. Ethereum stakers can either delegate their staked ETH to operators or act as operators themselves, running the software needed to secure decentralised services known as Actively Validated Services (AVSs). These AVSs include applications that require high levels of security, such as DeFi platforms, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. By restaking ETH, stakers can choose which AVSs to support, contributing to the security and functionality of the network while earning rewards. The mutual opt-in process between stakers and operators ensures a flexible and permissionless system for securing decentralised services. EigenLayer significantly expands Ethereum’s security model by introducing a restaking mechanism that allows staked ETH to secure a broad range of decentralised services. It optimises capital efficiency by reusing existing staked assets, thus reducing the barriers to security for new protocols. By facilitating a shared security pool, EigenLayer enhances the trust and reliability of the services built on Ethereum, encouraging greater innovation and scalability within the blockchain ecosystem. Trade Eigen Now What is the EIGEN Token? The EIGEN token plays a critical role within the EigenLayer protocol, designed to secure AVSs through a unique staking mechanism. Unlike traditional staking models, which focus on securing a single blockchain, EIGEN staking is designed to resolve intersubjectively attributable faults, issues where consensus among users can be achieved, but which may not have objective, cryptographic proofs. The token is used to facilitate a fork-aware staking model, where malicious actors can be slashed through social consensus rather than just cryptographic enforcement. This makes EIGEN essential for securing services that rely on subjective decision-making, such as decentralised oracles and AI systems. A primary use case for EIGEN tokens is to provide crypto economic security for AVSs. These are decentralised services that need an additional layer of security but operate outside Ethereum’s native consensus layer. By staking EIGEN, operators and validators can secure these services, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. This extends the security framework of Ethereum into new areas, such as data availability layers, cross-chain bridges, and decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, without requiring these services to bootstrap their own security networks. The modular nature of EIGEN staking enables developers to build complex, secure decentralised systems using the existing crypto economic infrastructure provided by Ethereum and EigenLayer. Another crucial function of the EIGEN token is its role in the governance and slashing mechanisms within EigenLayer. Validators and operators who stake EIGEN are subject to slashing penalties if they are found to be acting maliciously or failing to meet service requirements. This slashing mechanism can be triggered through social consensus, ensuring that services remain secure even when objective proofs are not available. Additionally, EIGEN’s governance model allows stakers to participate in the decision-making process around slashing rules, validation requirements, and other critical aspects of EigenLayer’s security architecture. This gives stakeholders a direct influence on how the ecosystem evolves and ensures that security measures remain adaptive to the needs of the broader community. The introduction of EIGEN also fosters a marketplace for security on the Ethereum network, enabling services to leverage pooled security from restaked ETH and EIGEN tokens. This marketplace allows AVSs to buy security from validators while validators can sell their staking power, creating a dynamic system where both parties can optimise for risk and reward. In addition, the versatility of the EIGEN token allows it to be used for intersubjective staking, providing crypto economic guarantees for digital tasks that cannot be resolved purely through mathematical or cryptographic proofs, such as censorship resistance or data availability verification. As the ecosystem matures, the EIGEN token is expected to play an even larger role in securing a diverse array of decentralised services. Join the discussion about EigenLayer on our Discord !

""We are excited to work with MHC Digital to pave the way for a new era in digital finance in Australia and beyond.”  Circle's expansion has been evident in recent times as it moved its headquarters to New York City's iconic One World Trade Center, ahead of its planned initial public offering at a valuation of around $5 billion. Earlier this month, its USDC stablecoin was made available to investors in Mexico and Brazil, through the banking system, not just through crypto exchanges. It also became the first global stablecoin issuer to get licensed to offer dollar- and euro-pegged crypto tokens in the European Union (EU).  Circle's USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether's USDT, has a market cap of $35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.87 billion, according to CoinDesk price data.  Carnegie's MHC Digital Group will work with Circle to provide USDC access to wholesale clients across Australia. The move could help superannuation funds avoid big bank fees and the partnership may extend to creating an Australian dollar stablecoin in the future, Carnegie told The Australian Financial Review.  “People claim there is no use case for crypto, yet hundreds of billions move globally at a fraction of the cost of traditional payment infrastructure, said Founder and Executive Chairman of MHC Digital Group Mark Carnegie. ""Crypto is simply a better mouse trap for the vast majority of international payments. Circle is the obvious candidate to be the long-term winner in the regulated stablecoin space, and we are very excited to work together to expand access to USDC in Australia and beyond.”  Read More: Circle's USDC in Brazil and Mexico Now Available to Businesses Via Banking System",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,ASIA | BUSINESS | TRADING | USDT | USDC,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/01/circle-signals-plans-to-bring-usdc-to-australia-with-venture-capitalist-mark-carnegie,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbb1ca6422b4ad63958c43d6e47caa453346e04-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Shares ‘Realistic Targets’","Crypto analyst Wisdom Matic has shared realistic price targets for Bitcoin (BTC), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Fantom (FTM). The analyst suggested that these coins would reach these price levels in this bull run, although he didn’t state when exactly it would happen. Bitcoin, Dogwifhat, And Fantom To Reach These Price Targets Wisdom Matic predicted in an X post that Bitcoin would reach $80,000, Dogwifhat would reach $7, and Fantom would reach $2. He claimed these were realistic targets compared to other predictions, providing a more bullish outlook for these coins. However, the analyst failed to state whether these price targets represented the market top for these coins or were prices he expected these coins to reach soon enough. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready For 4x Jump To $2.6 As Major Bullish Pattern Breaks Occurs However, based on market experts’ predictions, Wisdom Matic’s predictions will likely be short-term targets. Experts like Standard Chartered and Bernstein have predicted that Bitcoin could at least reach $100,000 in this bull run. Interestingly, Standard Chartered predicted that BTC could reach this price level even before the US elections on November 5. Meanwhile, they added that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by year-end if Donald Trump wins the election. Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $90,000 if Trump wins, although they still see the flagship rising above $100,000 before the market peaks. Meanwhile, in a recent market update, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $75,000 by late October as it breaks its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Bitcoin’s rise to a new ATH this month is also supported by the fact that the flagship crypto usually records double-digit gains in October. Therefore, a repeat of these double-digit gains would easily send the BTC price above $70,000 and on its way to a new ATH. The Altcoins Also Boast Bullish Outlooks Dogwifhat and Fantom can undoubtedly reach Wisdom Matic’s price targets, as they both boast bullish outlooks. As the foremost meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, Dogwifhat moves alongside SOL and is bound to rise as SOL surges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why Solana’s fundamentals are currently bullish, which supports the price rise. Some of these bullish fundamentals include the plan to launch the Solana Seeker mobile next year. Meanwhile, institutions like Franklin Templeton and Citibank want to adopt the Solana network for their tokenized offerings. Wisdom Matic predicted that SOL will reach $350, representing a new ATH for the coin. Fantom’s outlook is also bullish because of its fundamentals. Fantom is set to transition to Sonic sometime in November or December of this year. Sonic will be EVM-compatible, ensuring that decentralized applications (dApps) on other EVM chains can be integrated onto the network. Andre Cronje, Sonic’s co-founder has also hinted at potential decentralized finance (DeFi) plans for the Sonic ecosystem, which is also bullish for the FTM price as it could aid the coin’s adoption among DeFi users.

34180262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645505,1727766048,"Bitcoin Hype Bites Back As BTC Crashes Under $64,000","Data shows social media users had become overly excited about Bitcoin after the recent rally, which may be why BTC has retraced. Bitcoin Topped Out As Hype Around The Coin Shot Up According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, crowd sentiment around BTC has noted a sharp surge recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio,” which keeps track of the difference between the positive and negative comments related to Bitcoin that are being made on social media platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $66,000, But Analyst Warns Against Fresh Longs—Here’s Why The indicator separates posts related to negative and positive sentiments by putting them through a machine-learning model devised by the analytics firm. When the value of this metric is greater than 0, it means the social media users are participating in more positive talks than negative ones. On the other hand, it being under this threshold suggests the dominance of bearish sentiment on these platforms. Now, here is a chart that shows what the Positive vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio’s recent trajectory has been like: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Positive vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio had observed a significant surge during the cryptocurrency’s earlier run toward the $66,000 level. Yesterday, when Santiment shared the post, social media users made 1.8 bullish posts for every 1 bearish post. Thus, the traders had become quite optimistic after the price surge. This, however, may not have been an ideal development for the coin. Historically, BTC has tended to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting, with the probability of a contrary move only rising the more lopsided the sentiment gets. Today, Bitcoin has retraced back under the $64,000 level, a possible indication that the earlier hype that the social media users had shown has backfired, just like it has done many times. It’s also not just the social media users that have been excited recently, as the Fear & Greed Index, an indicator created by Alternative that considers more factors than just social media, has also been showing a rising optimism in the sector. The Fear & Greed Index currently sits at a value of 61, which suggests that the investors are leaning towards being bullish around Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector in general.

42390285,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bc3zPf,1727765866,Bitcoin’s Link to Ishiba-Led Swoon in Nikkei Comes Into Question as Yen Declines,"BTC dropped over 3% on Monday, with analysts blaming Japan's incoming PM Ishiba's hawkish bias and Nikkei's slide for the losses.  The yen, however, depreciated across the board Monday, contradicting the Ishiba link.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} fell 3.5% Monday, with at least half of the losses occurring during the European trading hours.  Market pundits jumped the gun, attributing the entire slide mainly to early morning losses in Japan's Nikkei index, which tanked after Shigeru Ishiba, seen as a monetary policy hawk, won the leadership race to become Japan's prime minister.  It's common for BTC to take cues from major regional equity market indices. However, on Monday, the Japanese yen, barring a minor early morning bid, weakened across the board, challenging the narrative that hawkish Ishiba weighed over risk assets, including BTC. Hawkish/dovish developments typically have a greater bearing on national currency.  The USD/JPY pair rose 1% on Monday, and the AUD/JPY cross, seen as a risk barometer by analysts, rose 1.15%, offering positive cues to bitcoin and other riskier assets. Both pairs are up at press time, hinting at continued yen depreciation and risk-on environment. Besides, on Sunday, Ishiba said monetary policy must remain accommodative as a trend, suggesting the bias for lower borrowing costs as opposed to faster rate hikes.  Clearly, markets currently do not seem worried about Ishiba's supposed pro-monetary tightening image and potential faster rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). The central bank raised rates in late July, triggering a broad-based unwinding of the risk-on trades funded by cheap JPY-denominated loans. Back then, BTC dropped from roughly $65,000 to $50,000 in a matter of days.  It appears other dynamics were at play on Monday rather than just Ishiba and Nikkei's influence. Perhaps, BTC was simply overbought and due for a good old bull market pullback after a near 90-degree rally from lows under $53,000.  Looking ahead, the yen and not Nikkei warrants attention, as the Japanese currency is a ""U.S. recession trade,"" according to Amundi Investment Solutions.  In a recent blog post, the firm said that ""repatriation of Japanese foreign assets is not a material risk for now, but its potential for a large market impact always warrants attention.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/01/bitcoins-link-to-ishiba-led-swoon-in-nikkei-comes-into-question-as-yen-declines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c961c4d2947f1a788099475ccecaf34c3ef4f850-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PoliFi tokens are having a good week, with the Trump-themed MAGA token up 70% in the last seven days.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} were flat for the first half of the east Asia trading day as markets around the region were quiet owing to public holidays in China, Hong Kong, and Korea.  China and Hong Kong are both off for China's national holiday, which is a week-long affair in mainland China known as Golden Week and one-day in Hong Kong. Korea is closed for Armed Forces day, a new holiday the government proposed earlier this year.  BTC is trading above $63,700, down 1%, according to CoinDesk Indices data, while ETH is trading above $2,600. The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the world's most liquid digital assets, is down 0.7%.  Markets are also mixed after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cooled expectations that another mega rate cut is coming.  “Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,” Powell said. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.”  ""This is not a committee that feels like it’s in a hurry to cut rates quickly,” he continued.  Bettors on Polymarket are putting their money behind a 25bps rate decrease in November, giving it a 63% chance of happening, up from 42% last week.  Bitcoin ETFs see inflows, PoliFi tokens in the green  In the U.S, BTC ETF inflows continued their positive streak, now in the green on their eighth day, clocking in at $61 million Monday, according to data from SoSoValue.  Most of that flow went into BlackRock's IBIT, which currently leads in net inflow since its inception at $21.5 billion.  In Japan, MetaPlanet, which aims to be a locally listed crypto proxy stock like MicroStrategy announced it had purchased another 107 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 507 BTC worth $32.2 million.  As the U.S. election gets closer, political finance (PoliFi) tokens are enjoying a solid week in the green as the U.S. election ticks closer.  Data from CoinGecko says the marketcap of the category is nearly $700 million. In the last week, the MAGA token which trades under the ticket TRUMP is up 70%, while its Solana counterpart TREMP is up 33%.  Kamala Harris' token KAMA is up 61%. Harris leads Donald Trump by 1 percentage point on Polymarket.  Given the popularity of prediction markets and crypto election betting, with election betting volume on Polymarket crossing well over $1 billion, Woo X announced today that it is adding HARRIS and TRUMP tokens from Outcome Market, a decentralized prediction market backed by Wintermute.

34178644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645548,1727762440,Ethereum Struggles To Reach Higher Highs Unlike BTC: Key Levels ETH Must Break,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently lagged behind other top tokens, posting losses on both a 24-hour and weekly basis. Despite this downturn, some analysts believe that if Ethereum can overcome critical resistance levels in the near future, it may follow seasonal trends typically seen in “Uptober,” potentially leading to a price recovery. Ethereum Struggles To Break $2,800 Resistance Technical analyst Daan Crypto Trades recently pointed out that Ethereum has yet to make a higher high, a feat achieved by Bitcoin (BTC) last week. In order to reverse its current trend, the analyst explains that ETH needs to break through the $2,800 level, which coincides with the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA). Currently, Ethereum’s price has retraced over 1% in both the last 24 hours and the past week, currently trading at $2,611. This decline contrasts with the gains recorded over the past two weeks (14%) and the past month (4%).

In contrast, Bitcoin recently reached a two-month high of $66,500, moving closer to its all-time high of $73,700 set in March, highlighting the stark difference in performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum during this period However, much like Daan Crypto Trades, other analysts maintain a bullish outlook for Ethereum if important support levels are held by the bulls and if the price can break through key resistances. Analysts Forecast New All-Time High In Early 2025 Market expert Guru Vedas has recently noted that ETH appears to have hit a curve support on its two-hour chart, with support levels between $2,550 and $2,600. He suggests that a recovery could be imminent from this support base. Another analyst, known as “Man of Bitcoin,” echoed this sentiment, asserting that ETH could continue to rise as long as it remains above $2,560. He identified key support levels for a larger wave, ranging from $2,539 to $2,351, which are critical for any near-term recovery. Related Reading: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi Adding to the optimism, analyst Ted Pillows highlighted that Ethereum is forming a similar fractal pattern to one observed during its previous bull cycle, which saw prices surge from $1,600 to $4,000. The analyst predicts that the ETH price could reach between $4,000 and $4,400 by the end of this year, with a potential new all-time high anticipated in the first quarter of 2025 above $4,800.

The price is now holding the key $565 support and might aim for a fresh increase. BNB price started a downside correction from the $620 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $590 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $585 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $565 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Extends Rally After a major upward move, BNB price saw a rejection pattern nears the $620 zone. A high was formed at $618 and the price started a downside correction like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $600 and $590 levels. The price even dipped below $580 before the bulls appeared near $565. A low was formed at $564 and the price is now rising. It climbed above the $570 level and now approaches the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $618 swing high to the $564 low. The price is now trading below $585 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $580 level. The next resistance sits near the $585 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $585 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. A clear move above the $585 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $600 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $618 swing high to the $564 low at $597. A close above the $600 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $650 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $585 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $570 level. The next major support is near the $565 level. The main support sits at $550. If there is a downside break below the $550 support, the price could drop toward the $532 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $520 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.

Proton claims it is enhancing the value of 2040 Energy, and not harming Swan.  Proton Management argued in a court filing that Swan Bitcoin does not own any mining business of its own. Proton responded to Swan Bitcoin’s allegations that Proton and six ex-employees of Swan conspired to “steal” its mining business.  “Swan does not have a mining business of its own,” counsel for Proton wrote in a filing Monday. “Rather, as Swan admits in its complaint and publicly, what Swan has called its mining business is really just the separate entity called 2040 Energy, which is fully funded by Tether.”  Tether is not a named defendant in the suit, and spokesperson for the company has denied any and all implications of wrongdoing in prior comments to CoinDesk.  “2040 Energy is not controlled by Swan, although Swan maintains a minority stake in the business.

The cryptocurrency’s performance continues to fuel investors’ sentiment, but some believe the upcoming unlock event could hinder its rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) next quarter. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon From ‘SUIptember’ To ‘Uptober’ In the past three months, SUI’s price surged 114%, moving from the $0.8 mark to the $1.75 price range. The cryptocurrency was among the best performers throughout Q3, registering green numbers while most tokens bleed during the market retraces. In August, the token saw up to 50% price surges amid the market downturns, registering a 73% recovery from the monthly lows and 14% from its opening price. This month, the token also saw a massive increase from September’s opening, registering a 119% surge in the last 30 days. Market analyst Crypto Bullet noted that SUI’s monthly candle is “absolutely phenomenal” as it has been retesting levels unseen since April and is sitting 20% below its all-time high (ATH) of $2.17. The analyst previously suggested that the cryptocurrency was poised to test and break its major resistance level of $2 in Q4, which is usually a bullish period for the market, and reach a new ATH around the $5 mark. During its 10% jump over the weekend, SUI tried to reclaim the $1.85 resistance but dropped to the $1.7 support zone as the market saw a 2.5% dip in the past day. Since the drop, the token has been hovering between the $1.70-$1.75 price range, recovering its levels from 24 hours ago. Sui Network Milestones Fuel The Token’s Rally The sentiment surrounding SUI seems fueled by the networks’ recent achievements. According to Artemis Terminal data, Sui Network surpassed all other chains in daily net flows on Monday, reaching $6.8 million in positive net flows in the past day. Comparatively, Ethereum and Solana registered $4.9 million and $3.4 million net flows in the last 24 hours. The network also had the second-largest daily inflows by chain with $10.3 million, only surpassed by Ethereum’s $35.8 million. Moreover, the chain reached the long-awaited $1 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone on Sunday, less than two years after its Mainnet launch. Nonetheless, many investors and crypto analysts consider that the upcoming October unlock event could negatively affect SUI’s performance. The event will unlock 64.19 million tokens worth $112 million, increasing the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply by 2.4%. Despite the unlock, some market watchers consider the cryptocurrency’s performance will continue its bullish rally. Crypto analyst Bluntz recently called the token “a certified beast” due to its recovery from the dips. Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Holds Crucial Support Level: Is the Rally Still Alive? Bluntz noted that “every dip on 4h end up abc-looking and keeps trucking higher,” including the latest weekend drop. He suggested that the token is still in the “macro wave 3 still and hasn’t even had a wave 4 yet.” Per his chart, SUI’s wave three will target the $2 resistance level before retracing to the $1.65-$1.70 support zone in wave 4, setting the wave five’s target around $2.6. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $1.76 and has outperformed the global crypto market in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.

The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.6320 and $0.6350 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price extended its increase above the $0.620 resistance, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even cleared the $0.650 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.6642 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $0.6450 and $0.6350 levels. The price tested the $0.6100 zone. A low was formed at $0.6091 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.6200 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6642 swing high to the $0.6091 low. The price is now trading above $0.6150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.6320 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6350 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6642 swing high to the $0.6091 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.6420 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6500. A clear move above the $0.6500 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6640 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.680 resistance or even $0.700 in the near term. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6350 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.6150 level. The next major support is near the $0.6080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.6080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.600 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.580.

34174636,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645539,1727753455,Analyst Sees Bitcoin Reaching $8 Trillion Market Cap: What Price Will This Surge Bring?,"Bitcoin (BTC) reached a two-month high of $66,500 last Friday, fueled by fresh market liquidity and renewed investor confidence in risk assets following the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on September 18. However, one analyst predicts that the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization and price could grow significantly in the coming years if the current bullish trends continue. Bitcoin Price Could Hit $550,000 Amid Market Changes In a recent social media post, crypto analyst Doctor Profit outlined a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, predicting that its market capitalization and price could significantly increase if past growth patterns hold over the coming years. Doctor Profit argues that the largest cryptocurrency on the market could reach a market capitalization of $8 trillion, which he estimates would be equivalent to a price of around $550,000 by 2030. Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Holds Crucial Support Level: Is the Rally Still Alive? Doctor Profit’s analysis compares Bitcoin’s potential to gold, which currently has a market cap of around $16 trillion. He bases his calculations on several factors, including new liquidity inflows and movements in the gold market. Specifically, the analyst estimates that the market capitalization of gold could rise to between $13 trillion and $19 trillion, strengthening Bitcoin’s position as a viable alternative asset. His analysis also includes considerations of inflation and the substantial amount of Bitcoin that is effectively lost. With estimates suggesting that about 15 million BTC are still in circulation and around 6 million BTC lost forever, the scarcity of Bitcoin could drive its value higher. In addition, Doctor Profit expects the M2 money supply – the Fed’s estimate of the total money supply, including the cash people hold in their hands – to increase from $21 trillion to $33 trillion by 2028, which should further boost BTC’s price over that period. Analyst Expects Significant Corrections Ahead For BTC The analyst also discussed technical analysis, suggesting that while Bitcoin might face periodic corrections—a healthy occurrence in any upward trend—these should not be mistaken for bear markets. Doctor Profit expects 3-4 significant corrections of 40-50% as Bitcoin approaches milestones such as $120,000, $160,000, and $220,000, notably surpassing BTC’s current record high of $73,700 reached in March this year. However, he emphasizes that these corrections represent opportunities rather than risks for long-term investors. Related Reading: EigenLayer Founder Reiterates Support For Ethereum, Why Is ETH Struggling? Doctor Profit also clarified that a long-term investment strategy can include active trading and holding. The analyst believes that corrections should not deter investors but rather be viewed as chances to buy at lower prices. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $63,590, recording losses of 3.4% in the 24-hour.

34173050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645521,1727749824,Is Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Bigger Rally? Here’s What On-Chain Data Reveals,"Bitcoin has seen an uptick in price enough to recover from the losses in value from August. So far, the asset has surged by nearly 10% in the past two weeks alone, registering a 24-hour high of $66,000 earlier today, although BTC has now seen a slight retracement, currently trading at $63,508. Amid this price performance, Axel Adler Jr, an analyst from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, has shed light on the potential for Bitcoin to see a bigger rally shortly based on key indicators. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set For Biggest September Gains In A Decade: Here’s Why Bitcoin Key Indicator Pointing To A Bigger Rally According to Adler, a significant shift observed in Bitcoin’s market activity appears to suggest that the crypto market might be gearing up for a bullish momentum soon. One of the focal points of Adler’s analysis is the “Exchange Flow Multiple,” which plays a crucial role in understanding the movement of Bitcoin on exchanges. This indicator measures the ratio between short-term (30-day) and long-term (365-day) Bitcoin inflows and outflows on exchanges. When this multiple declines, short-term exchange movements are considerably lower than long-term ones, which could point to decreased volatility. Adler Jr elaborates on this by highlighting two primary factors that influence the decline of Bitcoin Exchange Flow Multiple. The CryptoQuant analyst mentioned Long-Term Holders Retaining Assets as the first factor. Also referred to as “HODLers,” long-term Bitcoin holders when not actively trading their assets, preferring to hold onto them with the expectation of future price increases, can lead to a decline in exchange flow multiple. The analyst also draws attention to the natural market correction and recovery process. The market typically needs time to stabilize after significant drops in Bitcoin’s price. This stabilization period reduces exchange activity as investors wait for a clearer price direction. Adler Jr noted that a low exchange flow multiple in such contexts might reflect a “wait-and-see” attitude among investors, anticipating a favorable price shift before they re-enter the market actively. Drawing Parallels To 2023’s Bull Market Adler Jr’s analysis further indicates that the current behavior of the Exchange Flow Multiple resembles patterns seen before previous rallies. Notably, similar low levels of the indicator were observed before the major market uptrend in 2023.

XRP Whales Have Added 470 Million Tokens To Their Supply Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the XRP whales have expanded their holdings over the last 10 days. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens that a given wallet group is carrying right now. Addresses or investors are put into these groups based on their current balance. Wallets with 5 coins, for instance, fall inside the 1 to 10 coins group. In the context of the current topic, the whale entities are the addresses of interest. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $66,000, But Analyst Warns Against Fresh Longs—Here’s Why This group’s range is typically defined as 100 million to 1 billion XRP. At the current exchange rate, the lower end of this range converts to around $63.1 million, while the upper one to $631 million. Generally, the influence of any entity on the network goes up the more holdings that they carry, so the whales, who have quite the humongous balance, would carry some degree of power. As such, the behavior of these investors can be worth keeping an eye on, because even if it may not directly impact the price, it can at least tell us what the sentiment among this cohort is like. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution of the XRP whales over the past several days: As displayed in the above graph, the supply of the XRP whales has registered a notable increase recently. More specifically, these humongous investors have added more than 470 million (almost $300 million) tokens to their wallets during the last ten days or so. From the chart, it’s visible that the bulk of this buying had come while the asset had still been trading around the $0.58 mark, suggesting that the whales believed the level to be offering a profitable window into the coin. The bet of these investors has clearly paid off, as the cryptocurrency’s price has increased from below the $0.59 mark to above the $0.63 level over the past weekend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Rallies 34%, But Will FOMO End The Rally? While things have been going well for the coin so far, the indicator could be to keep an eye on in the near future, as what this cohort would do next can end up reflecting in the asset’s price once again. Naturally, if the indicator continues to go up, it will be a bullish sign for XRP since it would imply the whales are supportive of a further surge. On the other hand, a decline could be bad news, as it would mean the whales are participating in profit-taking. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.631, up 8% over the past week.
