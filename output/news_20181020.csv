42402020,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Fqg,1540033179,What China's Cashless Revolution Can Teach the West About Crypto,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Cash appears to be disappearing from China's teeming cities.  Foreign tourists talk of struggling to buy things because they don't have Alipay or WeChat Pay installed on their smartphones and because merchants no longer bother to accept the banknotes they get from ATMs.  These stories elicit fascination among Americans, but not much more. Here in the U.S., many can't grasp what the big deal is about digital payments. After all, pulling a credit card from your wallet isn't much more inconvenient than pulling a smartphone out of your pocket and it costs you – if not the merchant – no more than if you used cash. To the average American, China's system seems no different from Venmo or Paypal, just more pervasive.  But as Andreessen Horowitz partner Connie Chan told me during a fireside chat at the HYTSA conference at Stanford a week ago, the real benefits of China's cashless revolution lie in how this new, software-based system of value exchange has become a platform on which new business models can be built.  Digitizing payments in this way, at very low cost, enables micropayments and seamless integration across different service providers, which in turn means merchants can provide a variety of new services to customers over an app. This helps to enhance the user' experience, boost loyalty and engagement, and build network value.  Consider how Kuguo, the most popular of a number of Chinese music apps, provides ""song coins"" to fans, based on their level of engagement, which they can exchange into renminbi, the local currency.  Essentially, by removing intermediation costs from the payments system, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay – which together now boast a billion users, according to Aite Group – have created a seamless foundation for a whole new digital economy. Chan says this is where U.S. app developers are being left behind, because their products can't integrate with this new model.  The relevance in this for CoinDesk readers, with their interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, starts with the fact that this dream of a seamless, micropayments-enabled system of hitherto impossible new services is one that's often cited by crypto enthusiasts.  So, does China prove that you don't need a blockchain to build a new Internet of Value, powered by device-to-device exchanges in an Internet of Things economy?  Well, yes, and, no.  Crypto dream, Chinese characteristics  There is a very real and illuminating limit to China's system: It can't easily go outside its borders.  Although some U.S.-based providers are now creating services for Chinese tourists so they can buy things in America with their WeChat Pay or Alipay accounts, most of the activity on these networks happens in China. Most importantly, while Alipay and WeChat Pay are trying to crack other markets, there is no cross-currency facility. For all intents and purposes, this ""cashless revolution"" is happening within the boundaries of a renminbi universe.  The reason for that is that unlike cryptocurrency systems, the Chinese digital payments system is entirely built on the rails of the Chinese banking system, which deals almost exclusively in the Chinese currency. In that sense, it does share a foundation more like Venmo's and Paypal's, whose accounts also settle back into the banking system, than that of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.  The big difference is that for a host of reasons, the banks don't charge the same kind of exorbitant interchange fees to Chinese merchants that U.S. banks do to U.S. businesses, allowing the digital payments providers to build a much more fluid micropayments model on top.  But here's the thing: the Chinese banking system is essentially an instrument of Chinese policymaking. The four biggest banks make up the bulk of the financial system and are all majority government-owned. Their capacity to make profits, essentially on the spread they charge for loans over what they pay for deposits, is enabled by a carefully managed monetary policy. The People's Bank of China sets a ceiling for deposit rates – often below inflation – and can get away with that because it imposes capital controls on savers to prevent them fleeing low rates for higher-earning currencies.  To be sure, Ant Financial and Tencent both have a variety of financial and banking licenses of their own. But their own financial profits are very much enabled by the same interest rate policy framework that a wider state-run Chinese banking system is compelled to accept.  For now, that policy framework has sustained a quid pro quo arrangement with Chinese savers, who more or less support a banking system that otherwise eats into their savings because the benefits are manifest in continued economic growth and in services like those of Tencent and Alibaba.  But for some time, there has been an expectation that China, in its desire to ""internationalize"" the renminbi, will relax both its interest rate and capital controls, which could seriously undermine banks' profit margins. If China were also to allow more private and foreign investment into the banks, would those institutions continue to subsidize the digital payments economy? Maybe, maybe not.  Since we can't be like China, maybe embrace crypto?  The bigger point is that China's circumstances are unique. There aren't many governments, if any, that could get away with this kind of control over the banking system. Others have tried – such as Venezuela and Argentina – and have destroyed confidence in their currencies in the process.  So, if the rest of the world can't use compliant banks to subsidize a fluid, digital payments system, what instead will it use as the platform?  The answer may well lie in cryptocurrency and blockchain-based protocols. And as the race to build a stablecoin proceeds, a foundation for something that could viably compete with China's model may emerge. It might even go one step better, as it would allow for cross-border payments.  As U.S. government officials look nervously across the Pacific at China's growing economic clout, rather than launching destructive trade wars that do nothing but prop up outdated, 20th-century industries, they should instead be figuring out how to emulate and compete with China's new Internet of Value model for business development and innovation.  It's in that context that they should be looking at cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology less as a threat and more as an opportunity.

42402032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3G0W,1540029637,Bitcoin's White Paper Gave Us Liberty – Let's Not Give It Back,"One of bitcoin's earliest entrepreneurs, Charlie Shrem is the former founder of BitInstant and co-founder of cryptocurrency intelligence service CryptoIQ.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" opinion series.      Ten years after Satoshi published the white paper that gave us bitcoin – and the explosion of innovation it launched – I continue to be astounded at its transformative power.  Money is such a fundamental part of life, and it has played such a huge role in mine, for good and bad. Bitcoin is the awakened sleeping giant of it all because it has fundamentally and forever changed money and, more importantly, money's seat of power.  For me, this is the most important aspect of bitcoin and cryptocurrency: its role in propagating power to the greatest number of people possible. What Satoshi did when he democratized money was hand every individual alive – and generations to come – vast personal liberty.  This shift in power from the few to the many equals events in history like the advent of democracy itself, the invention of the printing press and the Renaissance. But it's important to remember that nothing is free. What we gained in liberty with bitcoin, we lost in the security of knowing someone else was responsible for protecting our money.  But which would you rather have? Would you rather be able to spend your money exactly how you see fit and know that it is safe from the whims of political leaders with no skin in the game? Or would you rather have the comfort of knowing that if you fail to be vigilant, someone will make you financially whole again?  This is why I'm an ardent student of history. It's a shortcut to understanding human nature, and it tells me I'd rather take my chances being the one making decisions about my life.  A Real Use Case  These days you don't even need to study the past. The 24-hour news cycle gives us a window on economic disaster as it unfolds. We're seeing in real time every stage of financial collapse on a national scale.  Look to Venezuela to see a society in the last throes of a financial meltdown, its people starving while its leaders continue to thrive, inflation hitting numbers that seem made up.  The International Monetary Fund expects that Venezuela's year-end annual inflation rate will approach 13,000 percent. That's astonishing when you consider that 4 or 5 percent makes news in other parts of the world. We've all heard about post World War I Germany and people using bags of money to buy bread. Here we are, a century later, and people are still subject to the capriciousness of the powerful.  Bitcoin could have changed things for the Venezuelans if they'd had an inkling of what was to come – and they should have – and thought to buy bitcoin or some other currency not tied to the bolivar.  Look to Turkey to see the early stages of a financial meltdown. The country is battling rising government debt, double-digit inflation and a currency whose value has plummeted. Turkish citizens are frantically unloading their lira to hang onto whatever value they can.  Many are turning to foreign currencies and many to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  According to a survey of 15,000 people by Statistica, roughly one in five Turks owns cryptocurrency, the greatest rate of adoption of any of the countries surveyed. Bitcoin is already changing things for the Turks.  To see a society in the earliest stages of this kind of collapse, look to the U.S. Few here realize where we are headed with our inflationary monetary policy and runaway spending. But those few are already hedging against what many experts say will be a new and massive financial crisis for this country.  For the few paying attention, bitcoin is changing things in the U.S. before they even get started.  Fiat's Star is Setting  We all know from trading cards and small toys in the schoolyard that money is part of being human. If it doesn't already exist for us, we create it. I saw that in prison.  Despite rules and razor wire, prisoners were able to create a currency of mackerel packets and a black market economy that was stunningly diverse in what it offered for sale – everything from personal services like weight training and letter writing to specialty catering built on the limited, shelf-stable foods available.  So in a sense, bitcoin is nothing new to money. People are always innovating, and bitcoin is the logical next step. It is the response of people long imprisoned by a system that puts them at a significant disadvantage compared to the powerful. It's a system that has allowed those who rule money to steal from the people who use and save it for themselves and their families.  Again, you don't need a history book to see what happens when governments are sloppy and even malicious with monetary policy, when leaders neglect their duty to protect not only a country's currency but also its value. All we need to know from history is that this has happened many more times than once and that it will happen again – is happening now.  Our dependence on others to take care of us at the expense of personal liberty and responsibility has grown insidiously to the point when people are at the mercy of individuals and organizations who have never had their best interests at heart.  Bitcoin comes with great rewards and risk, but your national currency is fiat with everything that entails and has its own even graver risks, I believe. To me, it is handing someone else the keys to the future and crossing your fingers.  Any history book will tell you how well that's worked out.
