The average price has reached as high as $1,494.53 as of press time, representing a climb of more than 3% over the course of the day’s trading. The day opened at an average of $1,443.68, BPI data shows.  The price move brings bitcoin’s value closer to the $1,500 level, though several exchanges saw this price emerge during today’s session.  Yet available data shows the price slipping after nearly reaching $1,500, sliding to $1,477.58 at press time.  Prices have hit several new highs in recent days, as reported by CoinDesk, climbing rapidly during yesterday’s session to come within striking distance of $1,500. The developments are notable given that the price first exceeded the $1,400 mark on the BPI on Monday.

42399815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoaT,1493838030,LocalBitcoins User Pleads Guilty After Undercover Sting,"A LocalBitcoins user based in Missouri has plead guilty to running an unlicensed money transmission business.  According to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri, Jason Klein plead guilty to the charge yesterday after selling bitcoin to two undercover agents on five occasions between February 2015 and July 2016. Prosecutors argued that he failed to obtain approval from both the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as the Missouri government to operate a money transmission business.  All told, Klein sold roughly 98 bitcoins to the agents, according to court documents, accruing about $30,000 over that period and charging commission on top of those sales. An unnamed second individual took part in two of those transactions, the documents state, but the identity of that person was not included in the record.  A LocalBitcoins account name identified in court documents shows that Klein has been selling bitcoins since at least 2013, with most of the publicly available feedback posted in that year. According to the site, he was last seen online eight months ago.  Klein is being represented by Mark Milton of St Louis-based law firm Husch Blackwell, along with Baker Marquart's Brian Klein (the two are not related), who said in a statement:  ""Jason has accepted responsibility for his actions, and we intend to ask the Court to sentence him to probation (no prison time). We have no further comment at this time.""  According to a copy of the plea agreement, Klein faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. A sentencing date has not yet been set or publicly announced, the documents show.  Latest case  It's the newest federal case involving a seller of bitcoins based in the US in recent weeks, a development that has prompted observers to decry a larger trend.  Last week, Richard Petix of Rochester, New York, plead guilty to unlawful money transmission and lying to federal officials after he sold $13,000 worth of bitcoin to an undercover agent. And in late April, federal authorities raided the home of an Arizona bitcoin trader and advocate, who as of last week was being held pending trial.  While it's not immediately clear what factors are driving the recent spate of cases, observers like Carol Van Cleef, financial technology lead for Washington, DC-based law firm BakerHostetler, argue that the case underscores the gray areas in which bitcoin sellers operate in the US today – and the need for more clarification from FinCEN, which released guidance on the issue in 2014.  ""I think it requires further explanation from policymakers as to where the lines are,"" she told CoinDesk.

42399814,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoYV,1493831711,Hyperledger Adds 'Indy' and 'Composer' Blockchain Projects,"The Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger blockchain project got a little bit bigger this week.  Yesterday, the group’s blog showcased Project Indy, which is focused on digital identity tools for blockchain ecosystems. Indy is being spearheaded by a group called the Sovrin Foundation, founded last year to provide solutions for decentralized identity.  According to the group’s chair, Phil Windley, the goal is to draw in additional developers to the cause by way of the Hyperledger community.  ""Our hope is to attract even more developers who want to unleash the transformative power of digital identity that is truly decentralized, self-sovereign, and independent of any silo,"" he wrote.  But Indy isn’t the only project to join Hyperledger's ranks.  Composer  , unveiled earlier today, is aimed at developing ""business networks"" on top of Hyperledger-tied systems such as Fabric, Iroha or Sawtooth Lake. The project was developed by a team drawn from IBM and blockchain startup Oxchain.  Like the group behind Indy, those backing Composer are hoping to tap the development community around Hyperledger for further iteration.  ""By working with the community, we would like to continue to develop Composer to be a powerful and complete development framework that allows users to easily and rapidly build blockchain business networks,"" the team said.

42399823,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyojK,1493827288,Coinbase Users Can Now Buy and Sell Litecoin,"Coinbase is officially adding support for the digital currency litecoin to its wallet offering.  The decision comes months after Coinbase's digital asset exchange, GDAX, added support for litecoin trading, though the startup has long teased the prospect of additional litecoin integrations – its creator, Charlie Lee, serves as the startup's director of engineering.  Overall, it's the latest notable boost for the older cryptocurrency, which has seen its public profile rise recently amid news of its forthcoming adoption of the scaling solution SegWit. That adoption has signaled the possibility for additional tech upgrades (not to mention a rising price).  In statements, Coinbase positioned its litecoin integration as part of a larger strategy, explaining:  ""At Coinbase, our mission is to create an open financial system for the world. We're paving our path to that goal by creating the most trusted and easiest way to buy [and] sell digital currency.""  Litecoin is unlikely to be the last blockchain token added to the startup’s online service, Coinbase went on to indicate.  ""This [integration] is part of our shift to supporting more types of digital assets over the coming year,"" the company said.

42399825,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyokJ,1493820950,Analysts Predict $100 Price for Ethereum's Ether Token,"The price of ether rose a meteoric 65% in April to touch $80, but already analysts are predicting that the digital token could pass $100 – and soon.  In remarks to CoinDesk, cryptocurrency hedge fund managers were perhaps the most bullish about this projection, stating that they believe it will hit this mark in coming trading sessions. Opened to the market in 2015, ether tokens, which power the ethereum blockchain, are up 2,800% from their original sale price during a fundraiser for the platform.  ""I told my head trader two days ago that ether was going to hit $100, and probably hold there for a while,"" Tim Enneking, manager of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk.  Arthur Hayes, operator of the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX, agreed, predicting that ether's ""massive bull run"" will likely end with its price reaching $100, though he believe active traders will likely take profits and reassess the asset at this point.  Still, not everyone believes that ether's price movements are worthy of the spotlight.  Jacob Eliosoff, an algorithmic trader, pointed to what he called the ""general hysteria"" around the market for publicly traded cryptographic assets. (Data from Coinmarketcap reveals the total market added $11bn in April, compared to just $3.6bn in March.)  Such a development points to a broader narrative that suggests as bitcoin's price gains become more narrow, traders are seeking profit elsewhere.  Eliosoff told CoinDesk:  ""When ether is barely outperforming dogecoin, it's a strong sign that ethereum itself is not the real story here.""  Indeed, the price of tokens on the dogecoin blockchain has risen 133% over the last month, though dogecoin, founded as a joke project, has seen less institutional or developer traction.  Other respondents pointed to the general trend of positivity around the ethereum platform as the reason for ether's gains. Ethereum has of late become the subject of interest of institutions including Bank of America and JP Morgan, as well as a budding ecosystem of decentralized applications that use the blockchain for automated operations.  The result, according to Eliosoff, is that there is a growing belief ethereum will be among the platforms that prevail when market fervor settles.  He concluded:  ""I give ether a good chance of being among the keepers.""  Track the price of ether on CoinDesk's new ethereum price page.

42399811,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoXW,1493819173,ECLAC: Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Empower Dictators,"A central bank-issued cryptocurrency could be dangerous in the hands of a dictator, according to a recent UN report.  The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) published a new report on 1st May which explores how blockchain-based systems could help improve conditions in the region’s financial system. While outlining how the tech could boost transparency and cut the cost associated with international funds transfers, the organization did include some caveats, particularly political ones.  The paper explores the concept of a central-bank issued digital currency (CBDC)– that is, one in which a central bank uses some implementation of blockchain to underlie the issuance of an electronic money distinct from the kinds they maintain today. It's an area of research being conducted by a range of central banks, including those in China, Canada and the UK, to name a few.  Yet such a project – in which an institution would have the ability to see any and all transactions within the network, ostensibly with information about who is making those payments – poses risks should a more repressive regime take control and have access to those resources.  In particular, this broad control and oversight could empower a dictator to target the financial resources of their political opponents.  The report notes:  ""A CBDC would have the potential to be a very potent tool for social repression in the event that a dictator was to come to power. Under CBDC system, this hypothetical dictator would have the ability to deny participation in the financial system to political dissidents, and would also have access to a very complete picture of all entities having financial relationships with those dissidents.""  The report goes on to argue that this approach would be ""ill-advised"" in certain regions that lack ""a very strong tradition of adherence to the rule of law"". But the authors go on to note that the risk would be lower if that digital currency’s area of usage extended beyond the borders of a single country.

42399812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyoWX,1493814612,Microsoft's Blockchain Supply Chain Project Grows to 13 Partners,"While Microsoft's blockchain supply chain group, Project Manifest, is gaining traction with potential partners, the effort to track everything from auto parts to medical devices remains tightly held under non-disclosure agreements.  Still, that isn't stopping those involved from dropping hints about the group's progress.  Soon after providing a sneak peek at the technology last week, Dan Doles, CEO of supply chain tech firm Mojix, revealed plans for an upcoming test, describing a more academic project being spearheaded by another Project Manifest member, Auburn University.  In total, Doles said a group of more than a dozen companies is now working on the project in the laboratory.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We're working with the lab down there, they've lined up seven retailers and six brand owners to participate in this.""  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk in January of this year, Project Manifest debuted just a week after Microsoft and Mojix confirmed the participation of two professors and 10 students in the project.  Further, while details of Project Manifest’s work with Auburn University's renowned RFID Lab are not being disclosed, lab director Justin Patton told CoinDesk that a white paper is currently being developed, and that the names of additional participants are likely to be revealed upon completion.  To give an idea of the scope of the work being undertaken by Auburn University's lab, sponsors include Mojix, along with Amazon, FedEx, Target, Home Depot and more.  By making improvements to traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, and combining it with the electronic data interchange (EDI) transaction standard, the group has already been able to make improvements to the traceability of supply chains using existing centralized databases, Doles explained.  However, Mojix and the rest of Project Manifest are now working to turn a distributed ledger into the ""connective tissue"" that gives complicated cross-industry supply chains real-time accuracy, according to the CEO.  ""We're automating the writing, shipping and receiving of transactions in smart contracts on the blockchain,"" said Doles, adding:  ""What I suspect is, it will bring to surface all of these issues of applying blockchain to enterprise.""  Increasingly this year, the global supply chain has come in the sights of blockchain disruptors. With the strong correlation that exists between efficient supply chain management, increased revenue and profit, a number of companies have entered the space.  Enterprise embrace  In April, US software firm SAP Ariba partnered with blockchain supply chain startup Everledger, and shortly thereafter IBM joined up with Chinese supply chain management firm Hejia for its own blockchain trial.  Another recent trend is that 'blockchain supply chain' also means moving trade finance to a blockchain, with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn spinning off a related startup with P2P lender Dianrong, and Chinese lender CreditEase launching its own blockchain service.  As industry leaders continue to push the technology, Mojix, too, has plans: namely, to deal with the issues of incorporating blockchain benefits into existing enterprise applications.  ""The next step is we're going to take two to three retailers and set up automated verification, RFID readers, so we can track either shipments or receipts,"" said Doles, as he used one of his company’s readers to scan a box of shirts from several feet away.  Testing the theory  If all goes as planned, decentralizing the supply chain could have trickle down effects to smaller contractors, according to Microsoft's global business strategist in charge of blockchain.  Rhodes believes that the results of improving multi-party work flows include improved cash flow and stronger margins. ""Ultimately,"" said Rhodes, ""companies will be able to radically change how they think about supply chain insurance, financing, and letters of credit.""  To test that idea the Project Manifest proof-of-concept currently being built is being designed use specially designed 'adapters' that connect RFID scanners directly to the ethereum blockchain. Brand-owners that ship goods, and the retailers that receive them, would then automatically trigger a diverse set of smart contract functions.  Doles concluded:  ""If we can solve that problem and create a secure way to verify the perfection of those contracts, then we have a way to expand upward and outward from there.""

42399821,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyogN,1493809212,Bank of America Eyes Adoption as Next Hurdle For Ethereum Test,"Bank of America has revealed progress on a blockchain application designed to make it easier for global treasuries to do business with new customers.  At a Microsoft event last week, Bank of America's director of trade and supply chain finance, Ann McCormick, showcased a new version of the ethereum-based application, demoing how it automates the process of creating a standby letter of credit.  A type of guarantee crucial for creating trust between new business clients, the letters are being encoded on a blockchain as part of the trial with the help of Microsoft Azure's blockchain-as-a-service sandbox. In essence, instead of letters being manually sent between multiple parties, they are being translated into smart contracts on a private version of ethereum blockchain.  However, it turns out the work with Microsoft is about more that just building a technological solution for a given problem. McCormick argued that Microsoft's diverse set of clients could help accelerate adoption of blockchain tech by new users.  She said:  ""We're partnering to ensure we get adoption, because this only works if you get the parties to adopt.""  McCormick acknowledged, though, that achieving widespread adoption of any new service isn't merely technological – it's also about knowing who is interested in using the tech, and who might already be capable of doing so.  For that, McCormick said Microsoft and Bank of America have been leveraging their corporate client networks to better understand where synergies might exist.  ""When we’re looking at next steps,"" said McCormick, ""we're looking at it from the bigger picture first, and then what can we deliver in the near term.""  Complex process  Also called a 'payment of last resort', a standby letter of credit is a guarantee of payment by an issuing bank on behalf of the applicant to a beneficiary.  But in the current, complicated process, multiple parties can only contribute to the letter after others have done so. This means errors and inaccuracies can remain undetected until the final issuer – in this case Bank of America – reviews the documentation.  This is what McCormick calls the ""spaghetti world"" of finance, because if a problem is discovered the entire process must start again from the beginning.  Instead, Bank of America’s ethereum solution moves the entire process to a single, self-executing smart contract.  ""You have these smart contracts, that the blockchain facilitates, that both do routing and event triggering,"" said McCormick. ""But they also can have the terms that Microsoft or Bank of America require in that standby letter of credit.""  Tapping into blockchain  The problem the blockchain solution is designed to tackle is that Microsoft Treasury – which acts as a kind of in-house bank for the tech giant and was recently valued at $120bn – has over 1,000 different bank accounts held by many more providers than just Bank of America. Further, Bank of America issues letters of credit to a wide range of potential suppliers.  To really capitalize on the network effects of moving such a work flow to a blockchain, more banks would need to use the service and more suppliers would need to be able to tap into the tech.  This is where interoperability could really come into play.  For example, last year Bank of America teamed up with HSBC to launch a blockchain supply chain project built using Hyperledger, a Linux-led consortium that manages different blockchain codebases. Then, earlier this year Microsoft became one of founding members of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an alternative private blockchain software system.  As a result, the fragmentation of traditional finance is increasingly being mirrored in blockchain, further making it likely that each solution will need to be able interoperate with the others.  Still, addressing the potential issues starts with recognizing that compatibility is a likely next step.  Microsoft's principal architect in charge of Azure blockchain engineering, Marley Gray, concluded:  ""This ecosystem is only going to scale when it’s not just Bank of America – it’s got to be all these other international banks. We have to get that network effect going.""  Bank of America image via Shutterstock.

42399824,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyofO,1493805605,Major Credit Unions Will Unveil New Blockchain Tech Next Week,"A blockchain initiative backed by dozens of US credit unions is set to give a live demonstration next week.  CULedger, a consortium project unveiled late last summer, is supported by more than 50 credit unions and four of the biggest credit union service organizations in the US. Spearheading the project are the Credit Union National Association and Mountain West Credit Union Association (MWCUA).  Those involved in the initiative say they want to utilize the tech in a bid to improve how credit unions function – while also making them more competitive in an increasingly tough environment for financial institutions. The idea is to create a blockchain-powered utility through which credit unions could send money or exchange other types of information.  The live demo of a CULedger proof-of-concept focused on identity is being unveiled an event on 9th May in Tuscon, Arizona. The concept was first outlined in a demonstrationhttp://www.culedger.com/Portals/CUBlockchain/The%20Case%20for%20CULedger%20InOHvate.pdf?ver=2017-04-28-094506-963 given by MWCUA vice president of innovation and product development Rick Cranston early last month.  In that presentation, Cranston – who helps lead the CULedger project – also touched on the topic of smart contracts, arguing that self-executing code operating on a blockchain could have a major impact on the credit union industry, particularly when it comes to cost savings.  ""Smart contracts will do several very important things for the credit union industry but there is one very big thing it will do. Smart contracts will save credit unions lots and lots of money,"" he wrote.

The organization is developing the two white papers – one focused on technical matters and the other on business cases – as well as a half-day workshop, tentatively scheduled for sometime this autumn.  The project was officially approved on 20th April, with CEFACT noting in the proposal:  ""The scope of this project is to look at how existing UN/CEFACT deliverables could be used by blockchain application developers ... possible changes to existing UN/CEFACT deliverables, or new deliverables, that could be considered in order to support blockchain trade-facilitation related applications … [and] how blockchain technology could be used to facilitate trade and related business processes.""  This is the latest blockchain development out of the UN, which has seen a number of its agencies pursue activities around the tech in recent weeks and months.
