Solcial has raised $2.9 million to expand in a round led by Alameda Research with Solana Foundation, Rarestone Capital, GBV, Shift Capital and Noia Capital participating.  Around 5% of Solcial’s planned SLC tokens are earmarked for seed funders, according to pseudonymous founder “Idris,” for a valuation of about $58 million.  The platform, which has not yet launched, plans to build a hub for sharing content, following the news and even trading assets, in a censorship-free environment. It’s hardly the only crypto stab at hands-off social media (BitClout is perhaps best-known) though one of the first on Solana.  “It has to be very cheap, and very fast to post a comment or a photo,” Idris said in a Telegram chat. “People have high expectations (in terms of user experience) with centralized social networks, and we have to have a decentralized solution that could match.”  Read more: Nader Al-Naji (Formerly Known as ‘Diamondhands’) Unveils Long-Term Plan for BitClout Blockchain  Even so, Solcial is content on courting the crypto crowd for now. It will place a heavy focus on monetization opportunities of content creators, Idris said.

The “crypto social network” backed by Andreessen Horowitz lets users speculate on the value of creator coins that in many cases are listed without their namesakes’ consent.  “Their launch wasn’t well received,” Idris said in the Telegram chat.

42376130,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwEdCX,1632772922,Analysts Turn Negative on Ether as Weekly Chart Tips Bearish,"Ether remains on slippery floors despite the weekend’s bounce to $3,000, analysts studying chart patterns told CoinDesk Monday. One source signaled the possibility of a $1,000 drop over the next few weeks.  The second-largest cryptocurrency is stuck in a four-week falling channel with the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram – an indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes – signaling a downward bias.  “A bearish short-term bias still seems appropriate given the recent breakdown and a negative reading in the daily MACD indicator,” Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in a weekly research note shared with CoinDesk on Monday.  Ether has established a foothold under the 50-day moving average (MA) in the past few days, having flipped the crucial support into resistance a week ago.  The weekly chart MACD histogram has also crossed below zero this week, adding to bulls’ woes. As per Stockton, the indicator needs to stay negative till Friday to yield a sell signal.  “That would be an intermediate-term setback if we also see [immediate] support near $2,874 taken out,” Stockton said in an email.  Short-term cautious  The last time the weekly MACD turned bearish, in June, ether fell by nearly $900 to revisit May lows near $1,700.  Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, said both the macro and technical picture appear aligned in favor of the bears for now.  “Broadly speaking, if ether fails to stay above $3,300 there is a risk of a deeper correction to perhaps $1,400 by the end of October,” Noble said in an email. “The Evergrande situation could be similar to the events of 2008, so while the ETH bull case is intact for the long-term, it may be best to be cautious in the short-term.”  A breakout above the 50-day MA would weaken the bear case and expose a path higher, toward the Sept. 16 high near $3,675. Ether was trading near $3,000 at press time, a 2% drop on the day.

42394420,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDyp,1632771642,3 Takes About China’s Crypto Ban That Are Wrong,"Following China’s surprise move to make crypto mining and crypto trading services explicitly illegal within its borders, there is still much we don’t know about the real impacts. But, of course, that’s not stopping plenty of commentators from peddling simplified reactions. Here are three common ones – and why they, at best, need fleshing out.  ‘China’s ban will destroy crypto markets’  We’ll start with the easy one – what you might call “the mainstream media take.” BTC, ETH and many other cryptos dropped dramatically when news of China’s ban hit, some plunging nearly 9% in just four hours. Clearly, somebody thought the sky was falling, expecting millions of Chinese investors to immediately exit the market and destroy everyone’s bags in the process.  But prices have more or less recovered just a few days later. This doesn’t mean there’s no serious broader impact (see below), just that the crypto asset market was, in some sense, ready for the China shock. China’s incremental moves against crypto, particularly the ejection of miners earlier this summer, have served as ample warning that something more severe could arrive.  That said, remember that the market today isn’t an airtight arbiter of long-term truth. With cash and liquidity extremely high in the broader market, a dip in nearly any asset triggered by an outside shock is going to attract a certain amount of cash from those who see a buying opportunity, even a very short-term one. If you bought the Friday dip, you’ve already made a little over 3%, or over 300% APR returns; You get to keep that money no matter what you actually think about crypto’s future without China.  ‘China wants to crush crypto because it hates the smell of freedom’  OK, look, I know this is a very tempting way to think, especially for crypto die-hards. China truly is a repressive society, and the idea that the crypto crackdown is act one of some sort of “V for Vendetta” situation is gratifying: Every crypto activist wants to be a heroic, crusading anti-authoritarian. It is also objectively true that uncensorable cryptocurrencies are threats to the Chinese Communist Party’s authority and goals, particularly when it comes to capital controls.  But the current moves against crypto are part of a much larger moment of reckoning for financial experimentation and risk in China. It has come at the same time as a series of moves against fintech and even traditional banking and investment firms, making it clear that crypto isn’t some singular threat to Xi Jinping getting a good night’s rest.  Recently, for example, China announced it would be “parachuting” financial oversight officials into China’s 25 largest financial institutions to review their practices. The planned initial public stock offering of fintech Ant Group was famously kneecapped by the Party. China also recently implemented a “three red lines” policy to reduce the debt leverage of real estate developers – a policy which has brought down the massive developer Evergrande.  In that context, what’s happening to Chinese crypto exchanges is barely a footnote. In fact, it’s arguably misleading to call what’s happening a “crypto crackdown” at all: It is by all appearances an attempt to curtail leverage risk across the financial system, and crypto is just a small part of that.  ‘China’s ban won’t impact crypto at all’  While token markets have digested the bad news without much trouble, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a downside to all this. It will just be a long time coming, and hard to see.  The medium-term impacts, for a start, are very real. For example, Huobi, a massive domestic exchange until recently, appears poised to cut off mainland users. Sources including former BTCC CEO Bobby Lee are also telling CoinDesk to expect an end to over-the-counter trading sooner rather than later. Right now, users of those OTC desks seem to be cashing in their chips: In the immediate aftermath of the announced clampdown, the stablecoin tether temporarily broke its peg against the RMB, suggesting heavy outflows.  In other words, it seems likely that many Chinese investors, and especially traders, will leave the market. Crypto continues to grow everywhere else, hence the steadied market, but that’s still a lot of volume to offset.  Some of that volume will move to decentralized exchanges. Interest in that technology in Chinese crypto circles has surged in response to the crackdown, Matthew Graham, China-based cofounder of blockchain VC firm Sino Global Capital, observed on Twitter. That would be in line with what some China watchers argue is the CCP’s real goal here – not to crush crypto entirely but to push it to the margins where only a few dare tread.  And that speaks to the real long-term concern here. Over time, the clear pressure from Chinese leadership to move away from decentralized blockchain tech will have a determining influence over how young people in China and Hong Kong spend their time and attention. Among the more draconian measures of the new Chinese policy is that Chinese residents cannot work for crypto exchanges abroad, meaning there will be a much narrower career path for young Chinese people who want to do crypto professionally.  Even grassroots activity seems likely to experience a major chilling effect, because Chinese policy changes are usually read as broader signals of what the government considers socially acceptable. Sino Global’s Graham also shared over the weekend that crypto-related WeChat groups are being renamed to conceal their topic. Whatever the letter of the law, at least some Chinese people are afraid to even be caught talking about crypto. If nothing else, that means the pipeline of real individual talent and energy coming from China into the blockchain universe will slow.  That, rather than declining exchange volumes or hash power, is the real worry here.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,David Z.

Past pattern may suggest that this accumulation could be dry powder for Bitcoin&apos;s next big move. Bitcoin Stablecoins Reserve Rises Up Again As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the stablecoins reserve seems to have risen again back to peak levels. The stablecoins reserve is an indicator that shows the total amount of stablecoins being held on wallets of all exchanges When the value of this indicator moves up, it means investors could be moving out of volatile crypto markets, and into the stable fiat tokens. High values can imply investors are piling up these coins while waiting to find the optimal openings into markets like BTC.

He also said the institutional crypto exchange is evaluating Miami as a potential location for expansion after several firms have opened offices in the crypto-friendly city in recent months.  FalconX is trying to tap the growing demand from institutional investors trading cryptocurrencies as larger competitors such as Coinbase do the same. On its last earnings call, Coinbase said that institutions accounted for 69% of its $462 billion in second-quarter trading volume.  While FalconX is looking at mainly internal growth, it’s also considering acquisitions, Yarlagadda said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The exchange is looking at potential deals to add talent and is also considering strategic purchases that will help the company become more of a “one-stop shop” in crypto for institutional investors.  Read more: Crypto Trading Startup FalconX Achieves Unicorn Status With Latest Raise  He said that pension funds are starting to dip their toes into cryptocurrency through hedge funds.  “Instead of getting direct exposure to crypto, like parking some money in bitcoin, they’re getting indirect exposure to the hedge funds that typically deploy money,” Yarlagadda said.  SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci told Bloomberg last week that the majority of institutional investors are still reluctant to invest in crypto and blockchain technology, but that may be changing, according to Yarlagadda, who recently met with six of the top 10 hedge funds in the world.  Hedge funds are allocating about 1% of their assets under management toward crypto, Yarlagadda said. The hedge funds he met with said they are looking to increase that figure to 8% to 9%., while asset managers want to get to about 5% over the next 12 to 18 months, he added.  “That’s why we are hiring as fast as we can,” he said.  Last month, FalconX reached unicorn status (startups worth at least $1 billion) with a $210 million Series C funding round led in part by Tiger Global that valued the firm at $3.75 billion.

Hangzhou-based SparkPool said it had initially stopped providing services to new users in China as of Sept. 24, and would completely suspend services to all its existing users, both in China and abroad, as of Sept. 30, in a message to users dated Sept. 26.  The company said the reason was “an effort to be maximally compliant with regulatory requirements.” China tightened its crackdown on cryptocurrencies last week, declaring all cryptocurrency-related activities illegal.  Founded in 2016, the Chinese Ethereum mining provider is the second-largest miner in terms of the hashrate on the network, behind Ethermine.  It currently contributes around 142 TH/s, which is roughly 22% of the hashrate of the entire network, according to data from PoolWatch.

Higher in the hierarchy, some of the country’s elite studied at my parents’ alma mater. I’ve heard stories of how those students had the sort of arrogance born from being untouchable – a reputation not that different from some of their Chinese counterparts, which is expected, for I’ve also heard that the China of the mid-20th century was not too different from the North Korea of the 21st. I’ve thus always wanted to go to North Korea.  Ethan Lou is an independent writer. This article is adapted from “Once a Bitcoin Miner: Scandal and Turmoil in the Cryptocurrency Wild West.” Copyright Ethan Lou, 2020. Published by ECW Press.     So, in April 2019, I and seven others flew from Beijing to Pyongyang on Air Koryo, the only airline on which I’d flown that did not board passengers by zones. While Koryo did in fact have a business class, there were no classes at the gate, where everyone boarded together. But the door was only so big – normal door-size. Not everyone could board at once, so there was still a queue. Whoever got to the gate quickly was still first, and the laggard was still last.  There’s a kind of communism joke that can be made from that, which would be funny because everything else about the airline also hearkened back to the time of the Cold War, including the flight attendants – it was clear they were chosen solely for their looks, unlike Western airlines. The purpose of my trip, though, was decidedly modern. It was partly to satiate my long-standing personal curiosity, but it was also for something else. I was there to attend a cryptocurrency conference.  North Korea had allegedly been embracing cryptocurrency, accused of stealing coins through hacking and all manner of related crime. Digital assets, circumventing the traditional financial system, theoretically help North Korea overcome the international sanctions that have crippled its economy. That underscores a formlessness to cryptocurrency. It grants freedom from the financial system. It represents a new structure immune to the whims of powerful nations. But whether that is good or bad is often a matter of perspective. The trip, to me, was an opportunity to see what North Korea had been up to.  On the surface, North Korea certainly did not look like the sort of state capable of harnessing cryptocurrency.  With North Korea, though, while you may never know what you will get, it will always be unexpected. The trip had been months in the making, the sum of much anxiety, excitement, effort and cost – and a cold Air Koryo chicken sandwich famous for its terribleness to cap it all. I ended up thoroughly disappointed when, contrary to my expectations, the foreign attendees were expected to give presentations to the locals. I declined, and not a single North Korean gave a talk at the conference, which provided no information on the state’s alleged activities. Still, looking back, considering the international scandal that would spring from that conference, it was a trip that I would never forget.  On the surface, North Korea certainly did not look like the sort of state capable of harnessing cryptocurrency. Outside of the conference, our North Korean minders brought us around, and at one class at the teacher’s college, the instructor used an unactivated version of Windows. The domestic businesses we visited flaunted at length completely unspectacular technology like television media boxes, 3-D movies so boring I fell asleep and arcade games that seemed to be decades old. One of them involved shooting cows, and that was about it. There were no objectives, no levels, no challenges in the game. I can’t remember if there was even an end – you just grabbed a gun and killed animals in unending carnage.  But, at the same time, a running theme of that trip was the subjectivity of truth that had been a hallmark of Cold War–era totalitarian states. In that dictatorship, people believe the United States started the Korean War, and that their side “won” it. Objective facts are a rare commodity. In retrospect, if North Korea had grand plans for cryptocurrency, why would it show it to random foreigners like us?  Nothing, however, could hide the obvious, the constant reminder of the geopolitical tensions all around.  The North Korean women were afraid, for we had pulled the snake from the bottle. I didn’t see who did it, but the dead serpent was out in the open. The bottle was empty. We had drunk all the snake wine. Sixty percent alcohol. It’s particularly healthy for men, our Korean minders said earlier, sniggering. Sitting in that karaoke lounge – dark and smoky, where three nights earlier, Virgil Griffith of the Ethereum Foundation impressed us with his rendition of R.E.M.’s “Losing My Religion” – my head was spinning. I could make out that a Mandarin-speaking foreigner, newly met at the hotel, was extolling the virtues of buying a North Korea bank, but that was about it. That was my last clear memory, talking to that Mandarin speaker with the big face and big hands. I didn’t quite feel like myself again until the next night, when I ran into that guy again, and he bought my party fine wine totaling €400 and talked about his bank plan yet again.  I never really learned anything in North Korea, except for the sharp taste of snake wine, which was itself an experience, and the hospitality of our hosts – we got along with them so well, we hugged when we left. Many nights were like the snake-wine night, some sort of unexpected drunken revelry. Each seemed to blur into another with its sameness.  The Mandarin speaker had wanted to use my name to get a loan to buy a bank. At least, that’s what I could remember and make out. I never speak good Mandarin when drunk. That proposal sounded shady in every way. It was a signal of the dangers of dealing with North Korea. The sanctions loomed large over our trip, just like everything else to do with the country, for it had been a sensitive time. A tragedy was still fresh in the memory. Otto Warmbier, an American who got detained in North Korea, had died upon his return due to what his parents said was torture. With worsening tensions, insults like “dotard” and “rocket man” had entered the diplomatic lexicon. U.S. President Donald Trump held two unprecedented summits with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, all sound and splendor, signifying nothing, but they were high-profile and thrust the issue firmly into the zeitgeist.  The day after the snake-wine night, as we woke still reeling, not far away, also in Pyongyang, the Kim boarded a train for Russia, toward Vladivostok and Vladimir Putin. The leaders had a gala and shared a toast. They exchanged gifts of ceremonial swords, and then President Putin publicly backed Kim’s position in talks with the United States. And one day, as I walked out of an elevator, I ran into a Chinese military officer, for whom a flock of Mercedes sedans – supposedly barred for export to North Korea – waited outside the building.  “That’s a three-star general,” I said, half a statement, half a question.  “Yes,” my North Korean minder smiled. That was the highest rank in the People’s Liberation Army.  Read more: Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy Charge in North Korea Sanctions Case  Aside from the literal, there was also the figurative China I observed. A university professor might speak accented English, but even service staff spoke pitch-perfect Mandarin. Chinese electronics and Chinese cars – the shadow of North Korea’s uneasy “Elder Brother” ally was everywhere. Like in the Korean War that began in 1950, the peninsula was not just a battleground in itself, but also a proxy arena for struggles between bigger powers. It was a powder keg. Observers feared a nuclear crisis.  Against that backdrop, it would not be surprising if cryptocurrency and blockchain, issues already mysterious and with a sometimes unsavory reputation, would be deemed extra evil if linked with North Korea. Even as some locals were literally falling asleep during the conference, half a world away, there were those who sat up and paid attention. None of us knew then how vigorous that attention was.  By the time of that trip, bitcoin had fallen from $20,000 to $3,200. I had become older, more haggard, but only wiser in terms of what I knew and could envision. None of the conference goers expected that something stirred in the West – a sleepless eye and peerless resources. Trouble brewed in more ways we could imagine or foresee, and it would compound what we had all already gone through in the cryptocurrency world for the past year.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Ethan Lou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/7-nights-in-pyongyang-inside-the-north-korean-trip-that-got-ethereums-virgil-griffith-arrested,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5850d71e4de7216c302b3d0eea2bead476e79288-2560x1439.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the headwinds that digital assets have faced recently, such as China’s ban, the inflows suggest that price declines may have been seen as buying opportunities.  The flows into crypto funds during the week ended Sept. 24 were the most since the $98 million in the week through Sept. 3, and brought total inflows over the last six weeks to $320 million.  Bitcoin saw the largest inflows of any crypto investment product with a total of $50 million, also the most in three weeks, although bitcoin has experienced the brunt of negative investor sentiment over the last two quarters, the report said. Funds focused on the largest cryptocurrency by market value have suffered outflows in all but four of the past 17 weeks.  For Ethereum, sentiment has remained relatively buoyant; funds focused on the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), had inflows of $29 million last week. The prior week, ether-focused funds saw $6.6 million in inflows.  The report estimates 6.6% of Ethereum’s total supply is staked to Eth 2.0 – a planned upgrade of the blockchain network that aims to increase transaction capacity, reduce fees and make the network more sustainable and efficient.  “Growth in staking is essential for investor sentiment,” the report stated. “Investors see it as a potential environmentally alternative to other proof-of-stake digital assets.”  Meanwhile, Solana and Polkadot continued to attract interest from investors.

In a proposal on Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance forum on Monday morning, user “salmanblocks” called for adding Fireblocks as the first whitelister on the compliant implementation of Aave. Rob Salman, the head of business development for Fireblocks, submitted the proposal on behalf of the company, a spokesperson told CoinDesk.  “Fireblocks’ R&D, compliance and legal teams have developed a new whitelister framework for permissioned DeFi. This framework meets both enterprise-grade requirements for accessing DeFi and adheres to Aave Arc’s whitelister governance criteria,” salmanblocks wrote.  Read more: Aave, Fireblocks and Galaxy Explore Next Steps Toward Permissioned DeFi  Aave Arc is an implementation of the Aave version 2 code designed to allow institutions to enforce regulatory compliance. Whitelisters would ensure that users of these permissioned lending pools comply with relevant laws depending on the jurisdiction of the user. Here to date, the permissionless nature of DeFi, where lenders do not know who they’re lending to, has been a key blocker for corporate legal teams.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Aave founder Stani Kulchov said this initial proposal could be the first in a string of potential whitelistings.  “Fireblocks aims to be the first whitelister and would add new whitelisters as well over period of time,” he wrote in an interview on Telegram. “Whitelister can be anyone that fulfills similar compliance requirements that Fireblocks initiated the market with.”  The majority of the proposal breaks down Fireblocks’ regulatory bona fides, noting that the company “is a registered ‘money services business’ in good standing with FinCEN” and that it is up to speed with the latest know-your-customer and anti-money laundering standards set forth by global watchdogs.  New products  The proposal also noted the significant possible benefits adding Fireblocks as a whitelister could bring to the Aave community.  For one, bringing on Fireblocks as a whitelister could aid in “the creation of sustainable governance practices for Aave Arc whitelisters and whitelister customers.”  Major firms participating in DAOs have led to notably mixed results. Perhaps the highest-profile instance is Andreessen Horowitz, which is working to open source its governance delegation model following a pair of contentious governance votes.

Kulechov said he would not be voting on the proposal, a personal policy in Aave’s governance “even when as interesting a proposal as it is.”  “All in one, it’s a big step forward for getting a new demographic into DeFi and would definitely make DeFi more accessible to more risk-averse users,” Kulechov wrote.

Despite these record-breaking numbers, many would-be investors still find themselves on the outside looking in, with the same dozen or so blockchain-focused wealth funds invariably bootstrapping every promising early-stage venture that comes along. Last year, just 22% of investments in the crypto space had no VC involvement at all - and that percentage is only getting lower. More often than not, these heavyweight hedge funds are simply better connected than ordinary retail investors and with much deeper pockets. Although initial decentralized exchange offerings (IDOs) represent a golden opportunity for little guys to invest in a project they believe in, even they&apos;re becoming painfully oversubscribed. Helping Regular Investors Take Part in Crypto&apos;s Gold Rush Into this milieu comes Waggle Network, a project committed to promoting the participation of more retail investors in the cryptoconomy.

42394417,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDeJ,1632761237,What Do DAOs Actually Do?,"Crypto, like any speculative asset, is driven by hype: Elon Musk tweets and the market responds; China cracks down and investors run for cover. Big ideas become bite-sized initialisms – think ICOs and NFTs.  The latest three-letter code word favored by crypto utopians is “DAO,” short for “decentralized autonomous organization.” A DAO is essentially a corporate governance structure built around crypto – an exclusive club, where the price of admission is paid in tokens. Holding a certain amount of tokens or NFTs makes you a member of the club, which usually gives you access to a paywalled channel in a Discord server.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  DAOs are also meant to incentivize engagement. Because DAO tokens can trade on exchanges, they can have real-world monetary value. (One prominent “social DAO,” Friends With Benefits, has a token worth about $110; 75 tokens are required for admission.) The idea is that the more a community works to improve itself, the more people want in and the more valuable its tokens become.  This can be an effective mode of organizing. And Friends With Benefits, in particular, has found a way to make it extremely lucrative. But most DAOs are also pretty limited in terms of what they actually do, once everyone is all together in those private Discord channels.  Read More: What Is a DAO?  Most DAOs treat tokens like voting stock in a company: token holders, rather than majority shareholders, get to decide how to spend the group’s collective crypto.  “DAOs are basically like if you started a business that went public on day one, and held shareholder votes way more often,” says the writer Nathan Baschez. There’s a program called Snapshot that facilitates this voting process, allowing DAO members to use tokens as votes in a group poll. The more tokens you have, the more votes you get.  The result is that most big DAOs end up as investment collectives, putting money into NFTs that they eventually hope to unload on the secondary market. PleasrDAO, SharkDAO and FlamingoDAO all work this way.  There are other ways to orient a DAO: Seed Club is a DAO that runs a kind of boot camp for the crypto-curious; MetaCartel’s Venture DAO works a little like a VC firm; and PartyDAO built a program for bidding on fractionalized NFTs. Decrypt, my old employer, is taking a stab at a media DAO.  I’m excited about the potential of rallying a community around shared financial interests without the need to actually incorporate anything (time will tell whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shares this view), but I remain skeptical about the current wave of hype in and around DAOs.  That’s largely because DAOs, in their current form, have an almost impossibly broad ambit. It’s worth making sense of the chaos: What should a DAO actually do once everyone has found their way to the paywalled Discord channel? Crypto utopians say DAOs are the new companies, but, for now, many just operate like social clubs; a list of DAOs in a Twitter bio has become a status symbol in certain corners of crypto.  Read more: DAOs May Be the Future of Work, but Don’t Bet on Them Being the Next Big Asset Class  Successful DAOs, like PleasrDAO and SharkDAO, have kept their scope relatively narrow. But it’s the smaller ones, like the aforementioned PartyDAO, I’m most interested in keeping an eye on.  As with traditional companies, DAOs need coherent roadmaps if they’re going to grow and change over time. None of the DAOs I’ve mentioned so far have existed for much longer than a year, and the effectively leaderless shareholder model could lead to power struggles and coordination problems down the line.  It’s a new paradigm – something that’s clearly still in its infancy. But if DAOs are going to succeed in the long term, they’ll need to get serious about how – and if – they plan to capitalize on their increasingly broad ambitions.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/what-do-daos-actually-do,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b89fbebe47e05fa9b5556d9c57c8b1e70005c5-2400x1577.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zerbe wrote that he believes Silvergate should be valued based on its earnings growth rather than on comparisons to traditional banks and “slower-growing” banks, especially given its “minimal” credit risk. He highlighted that Silvergate has increased its earning asset balances by 434% over the last year to $12.1 billion with almost all of the growth coming from increasing the deposit balances of its digital currency customers.  Silvergate Bank accepted a whopping $4.3 billion in new deposits from new and existing digital currency customers in the second quarter, the company announced in July.  “Given the wide range of outcomes, both in terms of its growth potential and meaningful risk factors, SI has the widest risk-reward skew of our coverage, with a $300 bull case (189% upside) and a $40 bear case (61% downside,” Zerbe wrote, referring to Silvergate’s ticker symbol.  Still, Zerbe noted that Silverage is one of the only banks that provides “payment solutions” to the cryptocurrency market and so increased competition may provide an alternative to the Silvergate Exchange Network, which could “materially” limit the number of new clients and slow deposit and fee income growth.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Josh Fineman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/crypto-focused-bank-silvergate-gains-6-as-morgan-stanley-sees-potential-52-increase-for-shares,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7debc6d2a6c582fa321e89120ee7348f9ee8905c-371x218.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A significant percentage of all Bitcoin in circulation is currently owned by long-term holders (or LTHs), according to the latest information from Glassnode. This data basically indicates that there may not be sudden BTC dumps or sellings in the market anytime soon, as usually seen with the short-term holders (or STHs). This is bullish to help sustain the price of Bitcoin on the uptrend. LTHs are dominating Bitcoin supply According to the on-chain analytics provider, about 80.5% of Bitcoin supply is currently held by long-term holders, and this is the highest level ever recorded since the history of Bitcoin. On the contrary, the short-term holders account for only 19.5% of the circulating supply. Assuming this supply at 18,827,731 BTC per CoinMarketCap, the STHs are holding only about 3.671 million BTC. Glassnode further broke down the LTH position, noting that only 9.4% of the Bitcoin supply held by the long-term holders is in a state of loss, while 71.1% are currently in profit. LTHs are mostly known for HODLing, as opposed to STHs.

Huobi, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, suspended service to Chinese users over the weekend after Beijing’s latest crackdown on crypto mining and trading last week.  Lee further predicted crypto and digital assets will become “foreign assets,” similar to real estate.  “I think bitcoin will become that kind of asset where you can’t sell that foreign property within mainland China. But if one day you were to travel to that country … you can then take care of buying or selling these foreign assets, but while inside mainland China, you won’t be able to do that,” Lee said.  Earlier this week, the People’s Bank of China banned any crypto-related transactions, including services from offshore crypto exchanges, another step in the country’s move to further control its financial system.

The Fantom Foundation will work with OJSC Orienbank, one of the oldest banks in Tajikistan, on a possible CBDC product to be evaluated by the country’s central bank.  The agreement makes Fantom one of the first blockchain projects to begin development of a CBDC platform for possible use by a national government, the foundation said.  Once completed, the proposed CBDC would undergo testing and refinement, Fantom said. Following trials, both companies will seek central bank approval to roll out the product nationally.  Orienbank and Fantom will join to develop commercial and retail payment networks for a digitized Tajikistani somoni (E-SOM).  While Fantom said the product is being developed under the central bank’s regulatory “sandbox” regulation, a type of environment that typically allows companies to experiment safely while creating CBDC models, the National Bank of Tajikistan made it clear that it has no agreement with Fantom.  “The National Bank of Tajikistan informs that it has not signed any cooperation agreement with Fantom Foundation on Digital Currency Platform (CBDC) and has no intentions to do so,” the central bank said in its statement.  While almost every major economy in the world has demonstrated an intent to explore the potentials of a CBDC, developing nations such as Tajikistan may find more use cases for them because of their potential to reduce costs of remittances.  Remittance inflows to Tajikistan made up 26% of the country’s gross domestic product last year, according to data from the World Bank.

Messari data shows the PERP token has gained 55% in the past 24 hours to trade at $17. PERP is the utility token facilitating and incentivizing the decentralized governance of the Perpetual Protocol.  Launched in 2018 as “Strike” and later relaunched with a new name and mainnet in December 2020, Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for leveraged trading, short positions and low levels of slippage. It uses a virtual automated market maker (vAMM) and collateralization vault to settle trades and enable trading in perpetual contracts, which are futures without expiry.  Coins associated with other decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, SushiSwap, dYdX and Curve have risen between 22% and 35% in the past 24 hours, outperforming crypto leaders bitcoin and ether by a significant margin.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) coins have picked up in the wake of China’s blanket ban on virtual currency-related businesses announced Friday, and Huobi’s decision to stop serving mainland Chinese investors. The crypto market is perhaps pricing an impending shift in trading volumes to the supposedly censorship-resistant DeFi rails from centralized exchanges.  DEXs are seeing a pickup in the activity. For instance, derivatives DEX dYdx has registered a trading volume of more than $4.3 billion in the past 24 hours, surpassing the Nasdaq-listed centralized crypto exchange Coinbase’s $3.7 billion. Perpetual Protocol has facilitated trades worth $258 million so far today, amounting to a near 10-fold rise from Sunday’s tally of $16.16 million, CoinGecko data shows.  According to China journalist Colin Wu, Chinese users will flock to DeFi platforms, bringing solid user growth to MetaMask and dYdX. “All Chinese communities are discussing how to learn DeFi,” Wu tweeted Sunday.  Synergia Capital’s Denis Vinokourov told CoinDesk that the great rotation into all things DeFi has begun, and the sub-sector could see a prolonged bull run. Spartan Capital’s general partner and head of research, Jason Choi, tweeted that overregulation would be a bullish catalyst for DeFi, while ByteTree Asset Management’s Market Insights published last week said “investors should look to DeFi for long-term alpha.”  Bitcoin trims Friday’s loss  While bitcoin has partially erased Friday’s 4.5% slide with a bounce to near $44,000, the cryptocurrency is still trapped in a four-week falling channel.  On-chain data continues to paint a bullish picture. “Whales bought the China FUD, adding 80,000 bitcoin to their fat stacks,” crypto analyst Lark Davis noted, referring to large investors.  Blockware Market Intelligence’s market newsletter published Friday also noted the continued accumulation by large investors, adding that the big players tend to buy early on in broader uptrends and begin selling into strength.  That said, the breakout from the bearish channel may remain elusive if the macro picture turns bleak again. Bitcoin fell sharply in the first half of the last week along with S&P 500 on fears that the crisis at the Chinese property giant Evergrande Group may become a systemic problem for global markets.  While equities stabilized in the latter half of the week, China’s property market turmoil may not be over yet. “The Evergrande collapse only shows a dangerous reality in several Chinese sectors: excessive indebtedness without real income or assets to support it,” Daniel Lacalle, chief economist for Tressis SV, said in his opinion post at Mises Institute. “The hope that the government will fix everything contrasts with the magnitude of the financial hole.”  Futures tied to the S&P 500 are currently trading 0.4% higher, signaling a continued risk reset in financial markets.

42394428,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEOT,1632753644,"Gary Gensler, You Should Be Watching How Canada Is Regulating Coinbase","The question of how to regulate cryptocurrencies, and by extension cryptocurrency exchanges, is getting heated.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has been regularly hinting that exchanges such as Coinbase should be registering with the SEC because they offer “dozens of tokens that may be securities.” A frustrated Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, has accused the SEC of “sketchy behavior” and is planning to publish his own advice on how authorities should regulate crypto.  Up north in Canada, all is quiet. The debate over whether cryptocurrency exchanges need to register with Canada’s version of the SEC has already been settled. In a March 2021 notice, the Canadian Securities Administrators confirmed that crypto exchanges do need to be registered with a securities regulator. Exchanges that want to keep serving Canadians are rushing to comply.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Given how excruciatingly vague the status of cryptocurrency regulation remains in the U.S., it’s striking how Canada’s version of the SEC has been able to bring rapid clarity to the issue. Is it possible that countries casting around for a definitive solution to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges adopt the Canadian blueprint?  You probably list some securities, so get regulated  Before turning to Canada, let’s review the situation in the U.S. The SEC’s jurisdiction over cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken hinges on whether the tokens these exchanges list are deemed to be securities. The SEC has said that bitcoin and ether aren’t securities. XRP is.  If tokens are securities, and Kraken and Coinbase list them, then Kraken and Coinbase are securities exchanges and they must register with the SEC. Delisting security tokens like XRP is how exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase avoid the registration requirement.  But what about shibu inu, dogecoin, USDC or the thousands of other tokens? Are they securities?  Read More: El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin: Hype or History in the Making? | JP Koning  Divining the security-or-not status of a token seems to be more art than science. It rests on how lawyers interpret the SEC’s definition of security, which includes a long list of instruments like notes, stocks, bonds, investment contract, fractional undivided interest and more. Esoteric U.S. Supreme Court cases such as SEC v. W. J. Howey and Reves v. Ernst & Young provide extra levels of legal detail on what it precisely means to be an “investment contract” or a “note.”  Now, perhaps SEC officials could comb through every one of the thousands of crypto tokens created over the last 12 years and make a list of which of them are securities or not. And then Coinbase and Kraken could delist everything that the SEC says is a security and thus avoid SEC registration requirements.  But in his recent public pronouncements, SEC Chair Gensler has taken a less helpful approach. It goes a bit like this: “Coinbase, you list 300 tokens, and odds are that a bunch of them are securities (we’re not going to say which), so you should register with the SEC anyways.”  Not your keys, not your coins (and definitely a security)  If Gensler’s approach to pulling crypto exchanges under the ambit of securities law seems oblique and vague, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has taken a much more direct approach. The CSA is an umbrella organization for Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators, the biggest of which is the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).  To bring Coinbase and Kraken under the jurisdiction of securities law, the CSA has created a new catch-all term: a crypto contract. Crypto contracts are securities, and because Coinbase and Kraken offer them these platforms come under the ambit of Canadian securities law.  Let me explain a bit more.  Pretty much everyone (including Canada’s regulators) agree that bitcoin is not a security. But according to the CSA, the bitcoin that a Coinbase client holds in their Coinbase account isn’t actually bitcoin. It is a contractual right or claim to underlying bitcoin, or as the CSA terms it, a crypto contract. Furthermore, the CSA deems all crypto contracts to be securities, even if the underlying crypto, say bitcoin, isn’t itself a security. Since Coinbase and other exchanges deal in crypto contracts and offer a marketplace for them, they must register with one of Canada’s provincial securities regulators.  This approach is remarkably different from the U.S. In the words of law professor Ryan Clements, the CSA’s assertion about crypto contracts is one that “no other international securities regulator has yet taken.”  The CSA’s list of requirements is long and demanding (see Appendix B of this document). Canadian exchanges and dealers, a category that now includes Coinbase, must abide by a set of universal market integrity requirements that cover things like abusive trading, front running, client priority, and more. Coinbase would be required to consider appropriateness and suitability when dealing with clients. And that’s just a sample.  Many exchanges won’t meet the CSA’s requirements, or can’t. Binance quit Ontario in June. FTX no longer onboards users from Ontario either. OKEX stopped serving Quebec and Ontario customers and Huobi has declared all of Canada to be a ‘restricted jurisdiction.’  But Canadian cryptocurrency venues such as Wealthsimple and Coinberry have fallen into line. And they don’t seem too salty about it, either. Coinberry’s CEO Andrei Poliakov has welcomed the CSA’s “measured” regulations as an “end to the ‘wild west’ of cryptocurrency in Canada.”  You can see why regulation would be welcome up north. Canadians were collectively stunned by the collapse of local cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, which at the time was Canada’s largest. Regulation is seen by all parties – customers, regulators, and cryptocurrency businesses – as a way to purge Canada of future crypto awfulness.  Will large U.S. exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase that serve Canadians choose to comply with Canadian securities laws?  To bring Coinbase and Kraken under the jurisdiction of securities law, the CSA has created a new catch-all term: a crypto contract.  Kraken has long disputed Canada’s assertion that a Kraken customers’ bitcoin balances are a type of Kraken IOU, and thus a security. In a 2019 letter to Canadian securities regulators, Kraken’s lawyers likened Kraken to a “bailee;” that is, in the same way the provider of a safety deposit box doesn’t take title to the box’s contents, Kraken doesn’t take title to the customer’s bitcoins. And so Kraken is offering a service, namely storage, and not a security.  But Canadian regulators never bought Kraken’s claim. The CSA has taken the old bitcoin maxim “not your keys not your bitcoin” to heart and ruled that crypto held at a platform like Kraken is not true crypto, but a contract for crypto.  It remains to be seen if any of the big U.S. crypto exchanges will go to court to defend what they see as their bailee business model against the CSA’s concept of a “crypto contracts.” That would mean wading into Canadian securities law, which like its U.S. cousin boasts a long list of bewildering instruments that are defined to be securities, including the amorphous “investment contract” category. (Whereas the U.S. relies on Howey to define what an investment contract is, Canada has Pacific Coin vs the OSC.)  Read More: How the Prediction Markets Are Wagering on Canada’s Election  Or maybe Coinbase and Kraken will just suck it up and comply with CSA guidance.  From the perspective of consumers, I’d argue the Canadian approach makes a lot of sense.  Coinbase may not be regulated by the SEC, but it does operate under a specific U.S. regulatory framework. It holds 43 different money transmitter licenses, each one issued by a state financial department.  This is a strange fit, though. State money transmittal law is geared towards regulating remittance companies like Western Union or MoneyGram. Coinbase is very different from Western Union. It facilitates billions of dollars worth of trading each day, rivaling large, regulated securities exchanges such as the Toronto Stock Exchange, NYSE American, and the Nasdaq BX. It’s not apparent how a supervisory official who oversees remittance agents is equipped to deal with an international trading platform.  By contrast, the Canadian approach says that if you are a payments company like Western Union, then you’ll be regulated like a payments company. And if you are an exchange like Coinbase, you can’t pass as a payments company for regulatory purposes. You’re going to fall under securities law because that’s the most appropriate regulatory category for you and your customers.  Whether Canada’s approach to crypto regulation becomes another export to the U.S., along with maple syrup or hockey, remains to be seen.

42423983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3rh,1632752403,"5 Reasons Why Bitcoin Remains Below $50,000","On Sept. 8, Standard Chartered’s cryptocurrency research team projected the price of bitcoin could reach $100,000 in the last days of 2021 or the early months of 2022. Several crypto CEOs have also made similar predictions, as has Thomas Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat Global Advisors.  However, apart from a momentary break beyond the $50,000 price mark in the first week of September, bitcoin has failed to attract any bullish momentum. At press time, the price of bitcoin is around $43,700, as it continues to range between the $41,000 support and the resistance level near $50,000. So what’s causing this downward pressure?  1. DeFi continues to grow exponentially  It goes back to last year. For the better part of 2020, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector recorded unprecedented trading volume and saw thousands of crypto users lock away their assets in multiple DeFi protocols in order to generate high-interest yields. As such, it would be expected that many investors would have converted their bitcoin holdings to ether or other smart contract-supported tokens to participate in the craze.  Although there was a momentary drop in DeFi-related activities in the latter part of 2020 and into early 2021, the sector experienced a second wave of investment in recent months as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) started to gain prominence. On Sept. 7 the total value of assets locked (TVL) in DeFi almost surpassed the $100 billion milestone for the first time, according to DeFi Pulse. This latest surge has already exceeded last year’s growth, with the TVL ballooning 253% from $23.8 billion to $84.1 billion compared to 183% last year ($8.39 billion to $23.8 billion.)  A lot of this new growth is thanks to the arrival of new competitors in the decentralized application space, including:  Solana  Avalanche  Fantom  Cardano  Each of these smart contract-focused platforms have already established their own DeFi ecosystems of native dapps and tout cheaper fees and faster transaction speeds than Ethereum’s current blockchain technology.  2. The NFT boom  It’s not just DeFi that is stealing the spotlight away from bitcoin. The NFT market has also enjoyed significant success in 2021. The amount spent to purchase NFTs through a 30-day period has risen dramatically from around $10 million at the beginning of 2021 to roughly $2.6 billion as of Sept. 17.  Due to the ascendancy of DeFi and NFT, bitcoin’s dominance (the total percentage of bitcoin’s market cap relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap) has dropped significantly – it was 69.7% at the beginning of the year but is now down around 41.9%. In other words, bitcoin is not commanding the same level of interest and attention it was nine months ago. This could point to why it has struggled to gain the type of buying pressure necessary to break above $50,000.  3. U.S. regulatory pressure  The U.S. Senate recently passed the contentious infrastructure bill. This involves a $1.2 trillion budget intended to be used to improve various areas of the economy. Part of the proposal includes amending the rules around cryptocurrency taxation in order to help foot this gargantuan bill. One of the changes includes requiring crypto brokers to report transactions. While the requirement itself is seen as a means to surveil crypto users and ensure better tax compliance, the main bone of contention is the lack of a clear definition for the term “broker.” Crypto advocates argue the term is too broad and may be interpreted to include crypto miners, developers and node validators – none of which are custodians of customers’ funds.  Although there have been attempts by a bipartisan group of crypto-friendly congressional members to amend the bill, it is looking less likely that much can be done to alter the crypto reporting requirements before it is passed into law. Historically, regulatory uncertainties such as this have often impacted the performance of bitcoin.  Then there are the ongoing regulatory tussles between state securities regulators in the U.S. and crypto lending companies, including Celsius and BlockFi. Regulators argue that the interest-bearing crypto savings accounts offered by both companies violate state securities laws. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has maintained its cautious approach to crypto, which is why a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is yet to be approved in the U.S. Analysts believe that the approval of a bitcoin ETF could spur a new flow of retail and institutional interest in bitcoin, which may prove vital to the realization of the $100,000 price projection.  While the SEC does not seem too thrilled about a bitcoin ETF anchored by physical bitcoin, there is a slim possibility that it might consider approving a bitcoin futures ETF (an ETF that has bitcoin futures as its underlying asset).  4. The dollar is rising  Following the release of the retail sales report for August, the dollar rose to a near three-week high on Sept. 17. The retail sales rose by 0.7% despite expectations they would fall by 0.8%. This data shows that America’s economy is on a bullish trend, and businesses are easing into a new market reality after COVID-19 lockdowns. Despite the outbreak of the delta variant of the coronavirus, the appetite to spend has not decreased. As such, a recovering economy means less interest in economic hedge assets like bitcoin.  Another economic data that might have spurred the lackluster reaction to the bitcoin market is the drop in the U.S. inflation rate from 5.4% to 5.3% in August. While some believe this figure is high relative to the country’s historical figures, others see it as a positive indicator, considering that the situation could have been much worse.  5. China completely bans bitcoin for the first time  On Sept. 24, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) issued a new statement regarding the illegality of cryptocurrency transactions and mining, adding that now crypto-to-crypto, as well as crypto-to-fiat transactions, are banned. This means virtually all crypto trading-related activities are prohibited in the country for the first time ever, including buying, selling or trading virtual currencies like bitcoin, ether and tether.  The Chinese central bank also made it clear any citizen found working for offshore crypto exchanges will be investigated.  But it wasn’t just the PBoC that weighed in on the new crypto laws, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) also voiced intentions to ramp up the enforcement of the country’s ongoing crypto mining crackdown. In a statement entitled “Notice on the rectification of virtual currency ‘mining’ activities,” officials set out plans to completely phase out crypto mining in the country.  First, new companies looking to enter the mining industry will be restricted. Secondly, local authorities will be ordered to cease all support for existing mining operations – this includes shutting off direct electricity supplies and encouraging other suppliers to ramp up costs to make mining operations financially unviable. Finally, the NDRC has said it will prevent any new investment from flowing into the sector and sever any remaining financial services to crypto mining businesses.  Bitcoin’s price fell by almost 10% when the announcement was made, from $45,099 to $40,693. But since then, prices have recovered around 8% back to $43,890.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/27/5-reasons-why-bitcoin-remains-below-50000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c16227d0f75b17c8aec5aa437294ea37c648e01b-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In July, the exchange said it would sell the tokens, dubbed Carbon Neutrality Token (CNT).  CTX sold tokens corresponding to 5,000 metric tons of carbon credits generated by a wind project in Zhangjiakou. Another 5,000 units will be released later this month, it said.  To issue a token, companies verify their carbon credits with a third-party agency, and then “freeze” the carbon credits at China’s national carbon trading market, according to a press release in July. “Freezing” is a bureaucratic procedure by which the firm asks the market trading operator to stop selling the credits.  Tokens contain “shared carbon information including emission records and tracing, carbon offsetting, carbon capture, storage, and reuse,” according to the July press release, which can help companies prove they are pursuing environmental goals.  Zhangjiakou is a city in Beijing’s neighboring Hebei province that will co-host the 2022 Winter Olympics. The carbon credits come from a wind project developed by a Chinese state-owned enterprise in Zhangjiakou’s Olympics facilities, according to the CTX website.  CTX is licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. According to its website, it holds a market operator license, which is necessary for operating an exchange as well as two capital markets licenses for asset custody and dealing in capital markets products, and is exempted from Singapore’s Payment Services Act while it is waiting for its license application to be approved, along with dozens of other companies.  China launched its carbon trading market in July. The market is predicted to be the world’s largest once it is fully operational.

The funding round, which was announced Monday, will drive the Swash data-monetization browser extension and help expand a “Data Union” marketplace protocol. Swash also plans to introduce a line of data science and developer tools later this year so that developers and businesses can build on top of the platform.  Giant internet companies like to hoard data, which has been called the crude oil of the digital economy. Tools like the Swash browser extension, which the company says is used by 64,000 people, let users take control of their data and receive a passive (if meager) income from it.  Uptick  User adoption for the extension over the past several months has been more than expected, according to Swash Chief Marketing Officer Chloe Diamond.  “It means our mission resonates with everyday people. It takes a couple of minutes, and once you’ve installed the browser application, it basically captures your data while you use the internet,” Diamond said in an interview.  Swash user data is then aggregated into a Data Union, where buyers – ranging from advertising and marketing firms to hedge funds – can purchase it. The profits are distributed to the Data Union members.  A SWASH token will soon be introduced to handle these sorts of transactions, among other things, Diamond said, but for now, it’s paid using Streamr DATA tokens, an early partner of Swash.  “Until deciding to do this ecosystem expansion, it didn’t make that much sense for us to have a SWASH token, whereas now it does,” Diamond said. “Obviously, timing depends on things like the launchpad exchanges, but it will be this year.”  SWASH token  In addition Streamr, Swash has been working closely with Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data market infrastructure firm, particularly on the business-to-business and data science side of things.  “We see that the mission of Swash aligns very closely with Ocean,” Ocean Protocol founder Bruce Pon, who is also an adviser to Swash, said in a statement, adding:  “It’s about getting people’s data in a way that has their consent and has the conditions of how they feel comfortable to share the data while providing an economic incentive for them to do so.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/blockchain-startup-swash-raises-4m-to-make-data-monetization-click,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99df02d4041844b5f134a044d69d00468b62d1e8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto 2.0 focused on the underlying blockchain technology behind cryptocurrency, which gave birth to the tokenization revolution. However, following Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols, certain issues like scalability, high cost, and transaction speeds have remained.

A branch of the Development and Reform Commission in Bayannaoer city found an illicit mining operation at the park, local media reported, citing China’s official Xinhua News Agency.  The action comes days after the country’s top government agencies announced a renewed crackdown on crypto trading and mining. China’s highest economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, banned investment in new mining operations, and said all existing projects will be phased out.  The closure brings Inner Mongolia’s total to 45 mining projects shut down, saving the province 6.58 billion kWh of electricity – or 2 million tons of coal – a year, the article said.  The mine in question was consuming 1,104 kWh, according to the report, and was located at “SME [small and medium enterprises] Pioneer Park,” in the city’s Economic and Technological Development Zone.  Such zones and parks are areas where the government sets preferential policies such as reduced tax rates or cheap rent, usually for specific industries, hoping that hubs for innovation and development will flourish.  In the policy circular distributed Friday, central authorities told provinces and cities to stop all support of crypto mining firms, which would include any preferential treatment afforded to companies working in a government tech park.  In May, the State Council called on local governments to crack down on crypto mining. Inner Mongolia outlined a plan for shutting down the industry just days later. The latest policy gives a more comprehensive plan for the industry and gives control back to the central government.

Binance Coin price movement in the last 24 hours: Binance Coin drops to $320 Today, BNB/USD saw prices drop to $340 before picking up any further downside and bouncing higher in search of more substantial support at $3241 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement) before moving lower once more. At the time of writing, Binance Coin is trading at $355.54 after seeing a further 1.20 percent price hike, outperforming the wider market in today&apos;s session. We can see BNB/USD has broken below its 20-day EMA, which would usually indicate bearish momentum will dominate in this period; however, bulls are picking up any selling pressure and pushing prices higher for now. The RSI indicator is producing higher lows which would indicate bullish momentum is in play for now. However, the trading volume has notably decreased further still, indicating lack of interest may impact any short-term recovery. Looking ahead, if prices can continue to climb northward through resistance at $360.00 (Fibonacci retracement, hori...",POSITIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13AaCwbASapU8KrkJyTkC_2b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

The price of Solana is down today as the market fell further over the previous 24 hours, establishing another local low and high. As a result, we anticipate SOL/USD to plummet further today and potentially reach the $136 recent major swing low for a retest. Solana price has declined further overnight, coming to rest around the previous major support at $136. The drop in value shows that it could retest the local swing low of $133 before any recovery is seen. As noted yesterday, this market has now seen three significant rejections of the $145 resistance level. At each instance, prices fell to establish a new low at $133 before rebounding. It&apos;s worth noting that these lows are beginning to congeal together as support and serve as a fundamental level for traders moving forward. The long-run outlook is simply a continuation of yesterday&apos;s outlook. We believe Solana will receive solid support at $136, and a new swing low could be set before the price rises again. Solana price movement in the last 24 hours: SOL breaks past $136 major support Looking at the chart, we see a large consolidation area with a resistance of around $142.

The center will be based in CMU’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Jeremy Avigad, a professor of philosophy and mathematical sciences at the university, will lead the center.  Mathematical theorems focusing on discovering proofs, verifying steps and certifying correctness via the assistance of computers will be the center’s main area of research.  The university said in a statement last week that the center will drive a “new way” of doing math by creating “collaborative digital libraries” for mathematical tools. CMU said it will make the technology widely accessible and advance discoveries across a broad range of disciplines, including computer science, physics and economics, among others.  Hoskinson’s donation is considerably large by comparison to the seven-year median donations the university generally receives per student. Forbes highlights CMU’s 81st ranking as the result of “lower alumni participation numbers,” which typically receives around $9,483 per student.  “I think in a very short amount of time the output of this center is going to be remarkable,” Hoskinson said during a speech at CMU on Thursday. “It’s going to start small, but big things do have little beginnings... later on it will grow to cover maybe another Bourbaki-style moment where we can cover the entire pedagogy of math and have open-source textbooks with this paradigm.”  Read more: IOHK Opens Cardano Research Lab at University of Wyoming Following $500K Donation",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-donates-20m-to-build-math-center-at-carnegie-mellon-university,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5736626f2847fa2dc99de9f7c148e0667b030b19-1300x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
