42426869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxK3h,1463179809,Digital Currency Exchange Gatecoin Offline After Loss of Funds,"UPDATE (14th May 11:40 BST): This piece has been updated with a statement from Gatecoin.      Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Gatecoin has reportedly experienced a hack, resulting in losses from its connected wallets.  CEO Aurélien Menant took to the Slack channel for the DigixDAO project yesterdayand indicated that the exchange lost control of bitcoins and ethers, the native token of the Ethereum network, during the incident.  Menant said that tokens tied to the DigixDAO project as well as the Augur and TheDAO projects were unaffected.  The CEO indicated via Slack that he was not entirely clear on the amount of funds taken, but noted “[the numbers] are big” and that the exchange will seek to refund customers following the loss. Though unconfirmed by any official source, rumors have begun circulating that the losses could be as much as $2m.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Gatecoin said:  ""Last night Asia time, we suspected a potential leak on our hot wallets. Therefore, we decided to shut down the exchange and ports in order to minimise further potential losses, and we are conducting a full forensic investigation to identify the root of the issue. This is why Gatecoin's user interface and API are currently offline.""  The hack comes amid the ongoing crowdsale for TheDAO, an initiative aimed at providing a funding mechanism for Ethereum projects.  Gatecoin has been facilitating the sale of tokens used to hold votes in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through the use of IOUs, which according to materials on the exchange’s site would be swapped for tokens following the completion of the crowdsale.  Earlier today, the exchange took to Twitter to report that it had taken its website offline “due to a high risk” that funds would “leak” from some of the connected wallets. The warning read:    Alert: our website is down due to a high risk of leak in some of our hotwallets.        — Gatecoin (@Gatecoin) May 13, 2016    On Twitter, Gatecoin later said it was investigating the issue, and other posts suggest that the exchange had been taken offline prior to the announcement, a move attributed on the main Gatecoin page to “maintenance”.  Gatecoin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42426865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxK1h,1463176428,Taiwan Police Arrest Man Behind Alleged Bitcoin Trading Scam,"Local authorities in Taiwan are said to have arrested a man believed to have orchestrated a bitcoin trading platform scam.  Central News Agency  reports that a man identified only as Ho defrauded as many as 49 customers out of roughly $300,000 after promising outsized returns on a bitcoin margin trading platform. Reports indicate that Ho told investors in January 2015 that they would receive a windfall after ""major market players"" bought their bitcoins at a higher price.  Yet, Ho appears to have done the opposite, according to the report, which stated:  ""Ho simply changed the company's server settings and turned his customers' bitcoins into his own. He then publicly claimed that his company was being hacked online and shut down his operation, the police said.""  The report further indicates that Ho may have faced debt problems, as police reportedly told CNA that he ""owed money to loan sharks"".  The arrest highlights the prevalence of digital currency scams in Asia that have targeted unsophisticated investors with promises of big returns. Last August, local authorities arrested two individuals tied to the MyCoin scam, which resulted in millions in losses for those targeted.

42426874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxKFh,1463168632,Bitcoin Price Stabilizes at $450 But Forecast Ahead Unclear,"Bitcoin prices fluctuated little in the week ending 13th May, staying largely between $450 and $460 amid lackluster trading volume.  While Craig Wright’s claims of being bitcoin’s founder likely helped generate visibility for the digital currency and was still the subject of some headlines this week, this event has begun to fade from the public eye.  In the aftermath of Wright's re-emergence after months of silence, market observers have once again turned their attention to the fundamental challenges facing bitcoin. Some observers say recent events in the bitcoin development community, particularly as it relates to network scaling, have had an impact on overall market activity.  Until developers create applications “which can successfully change Bitcoin’s fundamentals,” the digital currency’s price “will not fluctuate drastically,” Chen Xin, chief financial architect at OKCoin, told CoinDesk.  Others were more optimistic about the future development of bitcoin, including Daniel Masters, who runs the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund.  He told CoinDesk:  “I think there's tangible progress on Lightning networks and segregated witness - both of which free up considerable capacity in the network. I think the collaboration being seen is a consequence of Mike Hearn's rage-quit.”  Masters noted that the July halving is approaching, but he also emphasized that at least for now, current conditions are “stable.”  By contrast, ether prices experienced notable volatility during the period, changing roughly 17% amid modest trading volume.  Relative price stability  This stability was reflected in bitcoin’s price movements in the seven days through 13th May at 12:00 UTC, as the digital currency edged 1.4% higher week-over-week, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Bitcoin did experience some notable price movements, reaching a weekly high of $464.21 between 15:00 UTC and 17:59 UTC on 9th May and a weekly low of $447.76 between 09:00 UTC and 11:59 UTC on 10th May.  After falling to that level, bitcoin remained largely between $450 and $455 for the remainder of the week. These mild price fluctuations took place as market participants traded 10.4m BTC during the seven days through 4:30 p.m. UTC on 13th May, Bitcoinity data reveals. While 48.35% of these trades, or 5.15m, went through Huobi, 45.10%, or 4.8m, were transacted through OKCoin.  The modest price movements bitcoin experienced recently contrast with the fluctuations of the last few weeks. Even though it has calmed down lately, some say the digital currency is still seeing notable volatility compared to other currencies.  ""Bitcoin is still substantially more volatile than any OECD fiat currencies,” Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, told CoinDesk.  ""It's a lot more stable compared to itself historically, but it is still far more volatile than fiat currencies,” Enneking continued. “Bitcoin will need to become even less volatile to receive the approval that most give to fiat currencies.”  Yet others view bitcoin's declining volatility as a sign of progress. Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, weighed in on how this relative calm could point to the market’s changing perception of the digital currency.  “The lack of speculative trading around the Satoshi news indicates that more and more people are believing that bitcoin is worth holding as a long term store of value rather than an asset to make a quick buck off,” he told CoinDesk.  Calm before the storm  The current stability could simply be the calm before the storm, as market data provided by full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub on 11th May showed a long-short ratio of 5.1:1, sharply lower than the previous week’s figure of 3.1:1.  “We’ve observed many traders closing out their longs on the bounce from $440 to $465,” Petar Zivkovski, director of operations, told CoinDesk. “Because of the large amounts of long positions that were stacked up in the price run up from the low $400's, we believe there are still many long positions open and in the red across exchanges.""  While bitcoin markets have proved to be above prediction in the past, Zivkovski suggested that bigger moves might lie ahead.  ""These could serve as good fuel for a long squeeze (further sell-offs) and could depress price to new swing lows,"" he said.  Charles L.

42426877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxKDh,1463164573,New York Police Win FinCEN Award for Bitcoin Investigation,"The New York State Police won formal recognition this week for its work tracing bank deposits back to a number of drug deals conducted in bitcoin on an online dark market.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) presented an award to the New York State Police Suspicious Activity Review (SAR) Team and the New York State Police Financial Crimes Unit during an event held at the US Department of the Treasury in Washington, DC.  In a statement to announce the award and five others, outgoing FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery spoke to the increasing sophistication of financial crimes investigation by US officials.  Calvery said:  ""Without the valuable information that US financial institutions provide, the significant cases recognized here today would likely never have seen the light of day.""  In this particular case, while reviewing financial reports provided as part of the Bank Secrecy Act, the police department’s SAR team discovered that over a six-month period, an unnamed individual made more than 20 un-sourced deposits totaling $170k, in amounts seemingly designed to evade detection.  An investigation by the department’s Financial Crimes Unit discovered that an individual had deposited cash into several bank accounts, used the cash to purchase bitcoin, then closed the accounts shortly thereafter. Eventually, the investigation revealed the individual had moved more than $250k through two different financial institutions derived income claimed to have been generated while trading bitcoins.  In cooperation with multiple unnamed companies in the bitcoin space, investigators eventually traced the money back to an unidentified dark market, culminating with both an arrest and a seizure of narcotics.  Similarities to Rochester arrest  Though the names of the institutions involved and the individual’s name are not disclosed, the details closely resembles the case of Dylan Soefing of Rochester, New York, who last year was reportedly found with 800 Xanax pills and $170 in cash.  According to the Syracuse Post-Standard, the alleged scheme employed the services of Bitstamp and Coinbase, with Soeffing allegedly using online blackmarket, Darknet, to sell illicit goods.  Albany law enforcement officials and FinCEN did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the investigation. According to FinCEN, the individual was successful prosecuted.  Once the currency of choice at the now-shuttered Silk Road dark market, which in 2012 generated a reported $22m revenue, bitcoin is now seen by some law enforcement elements as easier to trace than cash. Last month, Science Magazine published a lengthy report on why criminals should think twice about using the digital currency owing to its transparent nature.

42426861,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJnh,1463160375,Bank of Japan Official: Central Banks Need to Watch Blockchain,"A deputy governor of Japan's central bank has said that central banks worldwide need to pay close attention to developments surrounding digital currencies and blockchain technology.  Speaking during a conference earlier this week in Japan, Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso weighed in on several aspects of the financial technology landscape, including bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Noting that the technology has ""attracted considerable attention"", Nakaso stated in his speech:  ""The application of those technologies would also change the structure of the financial infrastructure that has been built around centralized ledgers managed by trusted third parties. Thus, central banks will and have to follow these issues closely and with great interest.""  The comments come two years after another Bank of Japan official, governor Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters that he did not believe bitcoin qualified as an actual form of currency, and as such, Nakaso’s new comments suggest more openness on the part of the central bank.  The Japanese financial industry has certainly indicated its willingness to test the technology – an intriguing move given that Japan was home to Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that collapsed amid allegations of fraud.  Recent  investments in Japan’s bitcoin and blockchain space indicate that local investors see a future for the technology, with two startups recently raising a combined $30m to advance their regional bitcoin and blockchain businesses.

42426866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJzh,1463151909,Japan's TechBureau Raises $6.5 Million for Bitcoin and Blockchain Services,"A Japanese blockchain startup has raised ¥720m (or just over $6.5m) in a new Series A funding round.  TechBureau, which operates a bitcoin exchange called Zaif and a permissioned blockchain platform named Mijin, netted the investment from a group of investors. Participants in the round included Arara, a financial services firm; online information portal OKWAVE; VC firms Nippon Technology Venture Partners and Hiroshima Venture Capital; and FISCO, a corporate analysis firm.  The round also included an existing investor, Money Partners Group, a forex broker that invested in the startup last month.  According to the announcement, the startup will use the capital to hire additional employees. TechBureau also intends to develop blockchain applications in partnership with its investors.  TechBureau CEO Takao Asayama said that the funding follows a successful test conducted with Nomura Research Institute (NRI) and SBI Holdings, a Japanese firm that has made a number of investments in the country's digital currency and blockchain space in recent months.  Future plans, he said, include a merging of the Zaif and Mijin business lines, as well as expanding geographically.  Asayama told CoinDesk:  ""We [aim to] start working on similar alliances outside of Japan, getting ready for the launch of distributions.""  The investment comes amid a shifting landscape in Japan for bitcoin and blockchain. As the government looks to clarify its position on digital currencies – including a move to classify them as a form of ""asset-like value"" – some aspects of the administration have begun exploring applications of the technology as well.
