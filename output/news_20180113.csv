42380240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MaKh,1515878515,Kraken Exchange Is Back Online After Troublesome System Upgrade,"UPDATE (14 January 16:43 UTC): As of its last status page update, at 06:35 UTC, Kraken still had not reactivated withdrawals (it had cautioned in the Saturday blog post that they would remain disabled for at least 12 hours). ""All funds remain secure as we continue preparations for withdrawal activation,"" the company says.      Kraken, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, has resumed service after scheduled maintenance that was supposed to take two hours but instead took two days.  The unexpectedly long downtime agitated many users, since not only trading but also withdrawals were unavailable for the period, during which coin prices gyrated on bearish news coming out of South Korea.  As a penance of sorts, the exchange, based in San Francisco, is waiving trading fees for all its clients through the end of the month, it said in a blog post published Saturday. However, the waiver does not apply to margin trades.  In the blog post, the company reassured clients that their funds were kept safe during the incident and expressed contrition, saying:  ""We apologize for the uncertainty our downtime has caused. The scheduled downtime was to replace our old trading engine with a brand new trading engine – an improvement that customers have long asked for and that we have long been working hard on.""  'Possibly longer'  It all started when Kraken gave customers a heads up on Wednesday that the next day it would be offline for a systems upgrade. The company estimated then that this upgrade would take ""about 2 hours ... possibly longer.""  As scheduled, the downtime began Thursday at 05:00 UTC, according to a status page on Kraken's website. But the rest did not go according to plan.  ""We got a late start and the upgrade is moving slower than anticipated,"" Kraken said on the page at 07:34 UTC, about a half hour after the the work was initially expected to be done.  A few more hours went by, with a couple updates from Kraken. Then, at 15:27 UTC, it looked like there was a light at the end of tunnel, with Kraken telling users:  ""We are in the final stage of installing the upgrade now. We are getting close but hard to give an exact ETA since it depends on how the final testing goes.""  No such luck. Three and a half hours later, Kraken said it now had to ""resolve a number of issues that came up during final testing"" and that it could not give a hard estimate for when that would be done.  The pattern of periodic updates, but no resumption of service, continued. ""Yes, this is our new record for downtime since we launched in 2013,"" one update confessed. ""No, we're not proud of it.""  All the while, users were unable to access their funds. Understandably, many of them took to social media to voice their complaints.    #kraken #krakendown longest silence between update messages. Last one was 6h ago. Anybody still in there??        — Jakub Karczynski (@KubaKarczynski) January 12, 2018      'Elusive bug'  At 20:15 UTC Friday, Kraken said that ""an elusive bug"" was still holding up the relaunch of the site. In its next message, Saturday morning at 09:32, it said service would resume ""shortly"" but all orders had been canceled.  Finally, at 11:30 Saturday, Kraken's systems were back online, and by 15:47 trading had resumed.  In its subsequent mea culpa blog post, Kraken gave a general explanation for the delays:  ""Our system is replicated in development, where all tests passed. However when the new engine was moved to the production environment, regression tests picked up a condition that proved quite difficult to track down.""  A more detailed breakdown of what happened, and how Kraken intends to prevent such snafus from reoccurring, will come in the next few days, the company said.  In the meantime, it said it would be monitoring the performance of the new trading engine and cautioned that ""the site will come down if needed, which may occur with little to no notice.""  Progress bar image via Shutterstock  Correction: A typo in an earlier version of this article misstated the scope of Kraken's waiver on trading fees. The waiver does apply to non-margin trades, and only those (fees on margin trading will be temporarily reduced).

42380257,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mag5,1515843021,3 Web Giants That Could Be Decentralized on a Blockchain,"The web has taken over our lives, and with that, online enterprises have grown into huge monoliths of power.  Yet, while tech giants give us access to the stuff we like – music, movies, shopping – blockchain enthusiasts think an individual's web experience could be greatly improved by decentralization.  If the web's giants decentralize, the web itself will become a wildly different place – it's hard to even wrap your head around, just like it would have been impossible to imagine meme culture in 1999.  Today, a site and its database are one entity. In the decentralized version, the database doesn't belong to its creators; it belongs to its community, and that community can build lots of different business models on top of the database.  Think of it like this: if the web had been decentralized from the beginning, you could have made your first social media profile on Friendster in 2003. Then, when MySpace came along, you wouldn't need to create a new profile, you'd just give MySpace permission to access the one you had already made for Friendster. Same thing for Facebook.  Obviously, each new site would add new features and ways of interacting, but users would not have needed to start over, lose friends from other sites or the content created on prior platforms.  Are those advantages strong enough to upend the Dot-Com era's familiar incumbents?  Entrepreneurs and the various investors who have committed capital – whether that be in the form of traditional venture capital, or perhaps more common in the space today, through initial coin offerings (ICOs) – have made their bets that it is.  And with ICOs providing not only a new fundraising mechanism for these blockchain startups, but also a tool for users to interact with these new distributed networks, the underlying infrastructure for a new internet – a ""web 3.0"" – is growing.  Below are three verticals on the web that blockchain startups are aiming to take market share from through the use of crypto tokens.  Eliminating eBay?  While eBay is an internet O.G., in the early days of the web, there were also other sites built around specific products, such as comic books, where sellers sold directly to buyers.  One might imagine that focused marketplaces would naturally provide a better customer experience, but eBay, which offered an array of different products, proved that wrong. It turned out that it was better to sell comic books on the site that also sold bicycle parts, because someone might come looking for one and end up buying both. On top of that, it was just easier to remember one site for buying used stuff, rather than many.  While there's nothing stopping a seller from offering one product on both a specialized site and a general site, such as eBay, it would take sophisticated software to make sure the same item didn't get sold twice, and eBay doesn't want to make that kind of thing easy.  But what if consumers could have both? What if the comic books, for example, lived in the same database as the all the other products, but different websites could be built around that data? In that way, a listing could show up in a variety of marketplaces, but if one listing sold on any one marketplace, it would show as sold on all of them.  That's possible, according to Gee Chuang, the CEO of Listia, an existing marketplace that's developing a decentralized version of eBay called Ink Protocol:  ""Ink Protocol's vision is to decentralize peer-to-peer marketplaces, taking the power away from the companies that run them and giving it back to the buyers and sellers. As a result, more value is distributed back to the actual user.""  In an effort to create this system, Listia plans to sell $15 million worth of crypto tokens, starting on Jan. 29. Listia will also seed early users of its existing marketplace, where people already earn Listia credits for trading items peer-to-peer, with the token. Listia credits will convert into the crypto tokens as the blockchain network launches.  It's a similar goal to OB1's OpenBazaar, one of the longest-running and most popular decentralized marketplaces, except that OB1 is also focused on making it easier for users to transact anonymously, and has only used bitcoin for transacting. Yet, that could soon change, as OB1's CEO Brian Hoffman announced at Token Summit II recently that that company would be pursuing a token offering in response to increased congestion on the bitcoin network.  Speaking to the benefits of a decentralized marketplace, Listia's Chuang said, ""Sellers in decentralized marketplaces have the freedom to use any platform they like at any time, while bringing that hard-earned reputation with them everywhere they go.""  Move over YouTube  YouTube is the number one place in the world to share and search for video.  While the site has created a new career path for content creators, the tensions between those creators and its central administrators have become heated.  Content creators suffer as YouTube decreases its revenue share with video makers and uses automation to pull advertisements from their videos if they suspect the video displays offensive or inappropriate behavior, catching some suitable videos in its wide net. Consumers, meanwhile, complain that advertisements are becoming too prevalent on the site in general.  A new generation of startups believes decentralizing their platforms will allow content creators to interact directly with their audiences with the use of a crypto token. At the same time, users will get more choice in how their attention can be monetized – they can view ads, release personal information or even contribute part of their computing power to the operation of the system.  ""Bittorrent — with more than 250 million users worldwide — has been already proven to be capable of delivering good quality content in a decentralized and compelling manner,"" said Adrian Garelik, CEO of Flixxo, a decentralized video sharing platform that closed its token sale in November.  Released in 2001, Bittorrent works by connecting users to copies of content held on other people's devices, rather than a centralized server system. And Garelik envisions making the torrent network more robust by giving people more incentive to host content by earning cryptocurrency.  ""By creating this incentivized network, any kind of content could be distributed in a peer-to-peer fashion, with a lot of monetization possibilities,"" Garelik said.  According to Flixxo creators, users of peer-to-peer file sharing platforms have been in need of an effective peer-to-peer payment system to make the platforms more useful. And that seems to be a thought shared by a number of blockchain-based startups looking to decentralize file sharing, including Stream, Theta and Livepeer, each that has its own token.  And that's not all of them – there are handfuls of players at each level of the online video stack.  As explained by another decentralized video company Paratii in a blog post:  ""What we see forming is not a single pyramidal stack, where the choice of one piece of tech inevitably 'disables' another. Rather, what we have are protocol silos, with more or less interoperable layers.""  Disrupting Apple Music  It's possibly taken years to purchase and download all that music that gets your heart racing when you're at the gym or mellows you out after a long day of work – the perfect soundtrack to your life.  And just as special as all that is to you, those tastes are just as important to the companies that control the online music marketplaces where you get that music. That's because, as users participate in marketplaces like Apple Music, they build up their own intellectual property by creating playlists, following artists and flagging their favorite songs.  And that data is lucrative for the marketplaces to track and control, so much so that they make it difficult to move those preferences to another service.  According to Jesse Grushack from Consensys's Ujo, a blockchain-based music supply chain provider:  ""We are being locked into these systems controlled by corporate giants.""  And many startups, not just Ujo, agree. A handful of blockchain-based companies have started up looking to disrupt various layers of the music industry, including Viberate, which looks to eliminate the need for musicians' rent-seeking agents with smart contracts.  Even more mainstream names are seeing potential benefits in adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency in the music biz. Icelandic singer Bjork announced in November that she'd be accepting four different cryptocurrencies for her forthcoming album, and a former Universal Music Group executive raised $1.2 million in October for a music-rights management platform called Blokur that uses the ethereum blockchain.  While many of these platforms haven't announced crypto token sales, Grushack admitted that Ujo might issue a token down the road.  Currently, though, the company is focused on the concept of a ""portable fan badge"" – a token-like instrument that links identity to data – so that as a fan, you could port what musicians, songs and genres you like across all different kinds of music marketplaces. In this way, Grushack said, the musician would really know a person is a fan, and could then market them new content directly.  And not only that, but the portal is designed to make it easier for any number of parties to share rights, for example of one song, where each musician that participated gets paid out based on the work they put in. While this is technically possible today, the process would require a significant number of intermediaries who would all want to take a cut, making it worthless for artists today.  ""Right now Apple is in the process of phasing out purchases for music, so that leaves us in a scenario where everything we consume is in a rental model,"" Grushack said, adding:  ""If we did transition back into a system in which we bought music, being able to own that music and relationship regardless of the platform is something blockchain enables.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blokur, Livepeer and OB1.

42421806,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXurSn,1515841215,What the Data Tells Us About Bitcoin in 2017,"Jameson Lopp is an engineer at BitGo and the creator of Statoshi.info.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.  I've always been fascinated with the raw numbers relating to the operational status and growth of bitcoin, especially as we ride the rollercoaster of the adoption life cycle.  That's why I created Statoshi.info in 2014 to track bitcoin metrics from the perspective of a full node.  To that same end, I've compiled statistical measurements of bitcoin's growth in 2017 from a variety of sources.  A couple things are clear: bitcoin is at the forefront of an increasingly complex ecosystem that continues to grow in a variety of ways. And for the ninth straight year, it stubbornly refused to die.  While 2017 is well known as the year that institutional investors started showing interest in bitcoin, it was also picking up steam in smaller countries.  http://twitter.com/lopp/statuses/947506875909726208  Academic interest continued to increase, which is great for the long-term prospects of this industry as we continue to gain a greater understanding of what we're building.  Funding and forking  Venture capital funding continued to flow it in at pretty healthy levels, though there's more to this story.  It may be that VC funding did not accelerate because new funding avenues have opened up for entrepreneurs in this space. The initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 saw unprecedented levels of funds raised in a non-traditional form. CoinDesk's ICO tracker logged over $3.5 billion in funds raised via ICOs!  On top of the ICO explosion we also saw another type of boom: in a new type of bitcoin fork that has come to be known as an ""altcoin airdrop.""  While most of the crypto assets in existence have been created via software forks of Bitcoin Core, they have historically started with a new genesis block and thus a new distribution scheme for the tokens themselves.  You can see a fairly complete list of the airdrops at btcdiv.com, but many of them don't even show up on market cap lists because they have little value.  From looking at the top few forks you could claim that about $50 billion in value was created/raised via bitcoin forks in 2017.  As an engineer who had to deal with the fallout from the fork frenzy, it became tiring pretty quickly as it was clear that the vast majority of these forks would not have sufficient value to warrant spending scarce developer resources trying to support them.  Technical development  At a protocol level, there was a great deal of work done in 2017. The Bitcoin Core repository in particular was a hive of activity.  Bitcoin usage  While you may think of bitcoin as being a cryptocurrency, some users think of it as a trust anchor. By embedding data into bitcoin's blockchain, other systems can gain new properties such as tamper evidence and immutability.  The amount of outputs that embedded data into the blockchain more than doubled year over year, due to the increased popularity of platforms such as Blockstack, Colu, and Omni.  As adoption continued to increase, so did the size of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set, AKA the state of all bitcoin ownership.  A more controversial aspect of the changing nature of bitcoin is the transaction fees.  While rising fees have caused significant frustration for users trying to transact in smaller amounts of value, an optimistic view is that the network security is on the right path toward sustainability.  If fees don't eventually replace the block subsidy, then either the thermodynamic/computational security of the network will have to drop or perpetual inflation will have to be introduced in order to pay miners to maintain the same level of hashing power.  Bitcoin's privacy properties are still pretty terrible, but at least we're seeing some improvement on the address reuse metrics.  Network security and health  The size of the network mesh of nodes that validate and propagate bitcoin data is back on the rise after stagnating for several years.  As bitcoin becomes more valuable, miners are able to expend more energy securing the system from computational attack.  Technical improvements to block propagation continued to decrease the latency at which new blocks are seen by most peers across the network. This means that nodes come to consensus about the state of the blockchain faster, which reduces the occurrence of orphaned blocks.  Bitcoin economics  With an exchange rate increase of over 1,300 percent, bitcoin's market cap increased past $230 billion, earning it 19th place globally in terms of M1 money supply.  While 30-day BTC/USD volatility was on the decline in 2015 and 2016, it began rising again in 2017.  On average, an estimated $12,000 per second was transacted via BTC in 2017 compared to ~$2,000 per second in 2016.  Interestingly, the output value of the average transaction (without trying to guess and subtract change outputs) appeared to rise along with the exchange rate. Almost as if BTC is being used as the primary unit...  And indeed, we can see from the raw UTXO value being spent that it was pretty consistent in BTC terms.  Bitcoin in 2018  Looking forward to 2018, Lightning Network development has been progressing nicely. I wrote about the promise of Lightning Network two years ago and it's finally coming to fruition, though there are still plenty of challenges to overcome.  We've even seen Lightning Network payments conducted on the main network!  The next phase of development in the ecosystem will be speeding up economic interactions.  Payments via second-layer networks will be one leap forward, but the ""atomic age"" will usher in even greater innovations such as trustless, decentralized, real-time peer-to-peer exchanges.  I expect 2018 to be another exciting year with plenty of development and drama. Stay tuned!
