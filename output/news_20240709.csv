30718496,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628651,1720566044,Bitcoin Now Forming Pattern That Last Led To It Blasting Off,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin is forming a pattern in its Total Amount of Holders, which last proved bullish for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Has Seen A Fall In Its Total Number of Holders Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC investors have been liquidating their wallets amid the recent bearish wave in the asset. The indicator of relevance here is the “Total Amount of Holders,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses holding some balance on the network. When the value of this metric goes up, it means new investors are joining the network, and old ones who had sold earlier are returning. The trend can also arise due to existing users creating new addresses for privacy purposes. Related Reading: Solana Mirroring 2021 Bullish Pattern, Crypto Analyst Reveals In general, some net adoption occurs when the Total Amount of Holders rises. Adoption is a constructive sign for any cryptocurrency in the long term. On the other hand, the indicator registering a drop implies some investors have decided to exit from the asset as they are completely emptying their wallets. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for five top coins in the sector: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Chainlink (LINK), since the start of the year: As is visible in the above graph, the total number of holders has recently gone through a drawdown for Bitcoin. This decline in the metric has come as the price of the asset itself has been moving down. In total, 566,000 BTC wallets have emptied themselves during the last three weeks. The timing would suggest that the bearish market has spooked these investors into exiting. Interestingly, Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP have continued to see a net increase in this indicator, implying that adoption has only furthered for these altcoins. While BTC’s decrease does imply that holders are moving away from the network, the fact that FUD is the reason behind this departure may play into the cryptocurrency’s favor. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to show moves in the direction opposite to what the crowd thinks, so the development of FUD has often led to the coin finding a reversal towards the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Make-Or-Break Test: Will Support Hold? From the chart, it’s apparent that the total amount of holders also decreased in January and February, and this trend followed a sharp rally for the coin towards a new all-time high (ATH). “Patient bulls should be pleased with this, as self-liquidating wallets from impatient non-believers is a sign of FUD-causing bottoms, just like we saw in January,” notes Santiment. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,400, down more than 7% over the last week.

30715228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628597,1720560657,Crypto Whales Buy The Dip As $22 Million In XRP Flows Out Of Binance,"XRP is starting to recover after bouncing off $0.405 on July 5, suggesting the early stages of a rebound may be brewing. The crypto market has been volatile lately, and XRP hasn’t been spared. The crypto’s price took a dip recently, dropping below $0.40 for the first time in over a year. It is interesting to note that on-chain data suggests that some whales may be accumulating in anticipation of a major comeback, which may even be responsible for the bounce off of $0.40. XRP Whales Buying The Dip? Various on-chain data has shown large XRP transactions in the past few weeks to and from exchanges, suggesting some whales might be taking advantage of the dip to accumulate more tokens. Particularly, recent transaction alerts from Whale Alerts on social media platform X noted a recent transfer of 52.1 million XRP tokens worth $22.7 million from crypto exchange Binance into an unknown wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Crashes 5% To Lowest Level In 3 Months, What Happens Next? The details of this $22 million XRP transaction are pretty fascinating and transfers like this are worth paying attention to as they can either increase or decrease buying and selling pressure. In this case, the movement away from Binance suggests a decrease in selling pressure on the exchange. 🚨 52,103,936 #XRP (22,713,495 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/7TUiD49tYb — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 9, 2024 Interestingly, on-chain data shows that this wasn’t an isolated transaction. Data shows a similar transaction occurred over the weekend, which saw the movement of 31.9 million XRP tokens from Binance into an unknown wallet. At the time of transfer, these tokens were worth $14.22 million. Furthermore, the blockchain analytics engine Blockchain also revealed the transfer of 10 million XRP tokens worth $4.2 million from Binance into another unknown wallet. What’s Next? Key Levels To Watch At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.434. If the bulls regain control, the first minor resistance is at $0.45 and the next key resistance level to watch is around $0.50. Punching through that could open the floodgates for a rally towards $0.70 or even the $0.80 mark. Related Reading: Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Could Crash To $44,000, Here’s Why To fuel that kind of upside, XRP would need to see a surge in trading volume and buying pressure from both retail and institutional investors. Positive news from Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC could be a major catalyst. An outright win or settlement would remove a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over XRP. On the flip side, if the bears maintain their grip, the first support level to watch is around $0.40. This is because XRP recently bounced off $0.40 after an intense selloff last week. A break below that could see XRP tumble towards another support at $0.3750.

The Argentine player shared a link to Watercoin (WATER), propelling the token by 350%. The crypto community has expressed concern about Messi’s endorsement of the project. Related Reading: Can Solana Hit $160? SOL’s Resilience Sparks Rally Optimism Global Football Stars Promote WATER Lionel Messi, one of the best players in football history, promoted a Solana project named Watercoin. The football player’s Instagram account shared an image of Messi with the project’s logo and a link to its Instagram page. Following the post, the memecoin surged over 350%, going from $0.00032 to $0.0015 in a few hours. WATER’s market capitalization rose by 325%, surpassing the $100 million mark. Quickly, users expressed their concerns and doubts about the posts. Many speculated that Messi was a new victim of hackers who have restlessly targeted public figures’ social media accounts in this cycle. Nonetheless, Messi’s Instagram story has not been deleted as of this writing, and no official report of a hack has been made public, suggesting that the post was authorized. Additionally, several uses pointed out the football player’s previous endorsement of crypto projects. In February, the Inter Miami player announced his partnership with the Real-World Assets (RWA) tokenization platform. At the time, the platform’s token PLANET saw high volatility after soaring by 1,500%. Moreover, the legitimacy of Messi’s promotion seems to be confirmed on Tuesday morning. Earlier today, retired Brazilian sensation Ronaldinho promoted WATER on his Instagram account. The post has the same format as his former teammate’s story, with a picture of the football player and WATER’s logo. Is WATER Another Solana-Based Scam? Regardless of the posts’ legitimacy, the crypto community remains concerned about the project. Many users pointed out that the team behind Watercoin is the same team responsible for another Solana-based memecoin, Beercoin (BEER). As reported by NewsBTC, BEER crashed down last month after whales started selling large sums of the token. Seemingly, team-related wallets started cashing out, which plummeted the price and fueled deep concerns about the project. Since then, BEER has seen a 95% price decline. Like Beercoin, WATER is surrounded by insider trading concerns. Crypto analytics firm Bubblemaps urged users to remain vigilant of the Solana token. Per the post, insiders control 30% of WATER’s total supply. It is worth noting that WATER raised over $40 million in presale and reached a $1 billion market cap after launching last month. However, the token seemingly experienced “significant insider activity,” which plummeted the token’s valuation by 97%. Related Reading: Notcoin Rises 80% Over The Weekend, Is A NOT Explosion Coming? Despite this, some market watchers believe WATER is “starting to look solid” based on its current trading activity.

42407901,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7ONW,1720553245,5 Blockchain Games: What Works and What Doesn't,"Crypto as a whole is, I think, at something of an inflection point. With the recent “bull run” either on hold or cut short with prices below 2021 highs, the mounting crypto-speculative mania of the past decade seems to have settled down. That puts a premium on products that deliver, instead of just making big promises.  That includes blockchain-backed gaming, which has been on the horizon since the announcement of Ethereum, and which I’m happy to report is actually becoming a Real Thing. In the past, “blockchain games” have often been hasty cash-ins designed to entice speculators rather than players. But, as an embarrassingly experienced gamer who spent my childhood loading Doom from a DOS command line, I’m happy to report that blockchain games are now emerging fully-cooked: that is, many are at least as enjoyable as games that have nothing to do with crypto.  What follows is a lightning-round of quick reviews of a selection of blockchain games. Each game is judged on standard metrics of gameplay and graphics. But unlike more conventional games, blockchain games should also be evaluated for their onboarding experience and tokenomics.  Onboarding is significant because games are great ways to attract people without crypto experience, and hitting them with a laundry list of complicated tasks before they can play is a great way to lose their interest immediately. And tokenomics matter because they’re hard to get right, and the temptation for developers to be shortsighted and self-interested is strong.  Also worth noting: The reviews below are mostly based on fairly short play time (and few if any of these games are deep enough to demand more.) The reviews are also based on the current state of these games: Roadmaps and projections are all well and good, given the financial stakes, this is a “verify, don’t trust” situation.  Note: I had also planned on reviewing Nifty Island and My Pet Hooligan. But Nifty Island was offline for maintenance when I tried to log in. While My Pet Hooligan (which is in Early Access) looks and feels great offline, it’s a PVP shooter, and the game’s few servers weren’t cooperating when I tried to play.  Hamster Kombat (Mobile/Telegram)  Onboarding: A  Gameplay: D  Graphics: A  Tokenomics: D  It’s new, it’s hot, it’s incredibly effective at what it was designed for – but Hamster Kombat isn’t really “a game.” At present, the only ‘gameplay’ proper is clicking one object for points, then spending those points to earn more points. If there’s any actual “Kombat,” it’s completely opaque to me as a new player. Instead, Hamster Kombat, where you play the role of a growth-minded CEO of a crypto exchange, gamifies social engagement, offering in-game “gold” for things like following and promoting the game’s X/Twitter account, or recruiting friends.  The scammy vibes of this pyramid-built-on-nothing element are impossible to ignore, but one thing can’t be denied – it’s working, driving the “game” to huge popularity (see Jeff Wilser’s recent feature on the growth of Hamster Kombat and other TON-based games. The tiny bit of gameplay is impressively addictive (I’m clicking right now …). And, in most other respects, Hamster Kombat is top-tier, with a flawlessly smooth interface and, most impressive of all, a truly effortless onboarding experience that’s integrated directly into Telegram. That both mutes the impression of scamminess, and leads one to believe promises that a real game will emerge from beneath this perpetual self-promotion machine.  Unfortunately, though, gameplay evolution seems to be a low priority for the devs for the moment. The Hamster Kombat roadmap includes gameplay upgrades like “Squad Kombat,” but by far the most focus is on an upcoming airdrop, with a token that is promised to be integrated into gameplay. It seems iffy to release your token before anything resembling an actual game, so between that and the fact that the financial tease is probably leading to a lot of people wasting their lives clicking on a phone, the hamsters get a “D” on tokenomics.  Pixels (Web Browser)  Onboarding: C  Gameplay: A  Graphics: A+  Tokenomics: A  Proof that low-hanging fruit can be delicious. Pixels is a resource-gathering and building game, a bit like Farmville, but with a lot more style. Even the writing is good, in its cutesy way, which is really notable. There are also promised and plausible extensions into more active forms of gameplay, such as dungeons, but the simple harvest-cooking-sale loop is already satisfying in itself. There are definitely periods of downtime in the early game, but that’s what you’re signing up for – this is a game you can run in the background and check in on every once in a while (I’m making Popberry Jam while I write this).  The graphics and overall vibes of the game are also excellent. The game is designed in a nostalgic 8-bit style, one seeming reason that Pixels actually has NFT imports. You can play as your Pudgy Penguin or Bored Ape, and the Pixels team has guidelines that allow any collection to submit game versions of PFPs. This unambiguously rocks, increasing the value of the entire Web3 space, and reflecting what seems to be the team’s more general deep alignment with crypto ideas and values. At the same time, there’s an outright downplaying of the possibility of massive growth in token prices, which is equally refreshing.  In what will become a theme, however, I was annoyed by Pixels’ onboarding process, which frankly seems to directly contradict the care and values on display elsewhere in the game. While Metamask login is teased, it no longer works for new players, who must instead download and install a boutique wallet for Sky Mavis’ Ronin Network – an EVM chain that has its own flavor of Wrapped Ether (WETH), but otherwise seems to only handle assets on Mavis’ own Ronin Network. This is an illustration of a common misalignment of incentives in Web3 gaming: there are big incentives to use an attractive game to rope users into your niche network, instead of improving interoperability by using a more widespread public network. It’s a toxic dynamic the industry should be wary of.  Gods Unchained (PC, Mac, iOS, Android)  Onboarding: B  Gameplay: A  Graphics: A  Tokenomics: B  It’s time for a horrifying confession: In 2019, I decided to spend money on Gods Unchained NFT cards instead of buying a Cryptopunk. I could have retired by now on a Punk or two, but it is illegal for anyone to make fun of me for my choices. (Mostly, buying a Punk was just incomprehensibly complex back then.)  In 2019, Gods Unchained was a concept rather than a working game, so I am ecstatic to report that not only has it become a game, it has become a really good game, with a blockchain use case that makes sense. It also has really solid user and trading metrics, with more than 200,000 holders recently trading over $250,000 worth of NFT-based cards per day. I also had great luck with matchmaking – casual queues are very short, indicating a lot of players are online actually playing, not just trading.  One possible criticism of Gods Unchained is that it’s, in essence, a copy of Hearthstone, the World of Warcraft-based CCG. Of course, there are other digital card games out there with similar-enough formats and gameplay, but GU has detailed similarities, down to the points and stats of specific (reskinned) cards. Honestly, though, there’s no real shame in that – Hearthstone is an incredible game, and, having familiar mechanics, makes GU quick to jump into.  Gods Unchained also looks and plays great, though its designs and illustrations are quite generic. Specifically, the way the game marks the rarity of cards is pretty opaque, muting one major fun part of playing a CCG.  That doesn’t mean there weren’t downsides. GU becoming part of the “Immutable Passport” ecosystem adds a seemingly pointless layer of intermediation. Why can’t I just sign in with Ethereum via Metamask, where my cards are, and which the game ultimately connects to anyway? Plus, Immutable itself uses Google or email login rather than its own wallet – which seems convenient until you remember this is an entirely superfluous step already. On the other hand, I was surprised by how smoothly I was able to connect back to my pre-Immutable GU account.  Finally, the tokenomics of Gods Unchained barely matter … and that’s great. You earn cards and packs for playing in a way that, again, will be familiar to Hearthstone players. And there are daily quests that can earn you $GODS tokens, which I would assume can be swapped for real money somehow. But, in stark contrast to Hamster Kombat, these are nice bonuses for playing a game that’s inherently rewarding – not bribes for endlessly clicking on a static image.  Guild of Guardians (iOS and Android)  Onboarding: A  Gameplay: F  Graphics and presentation: D  Tokenomics: C  I’ll admit up front this is Not for Me, but somehow, this dungeon roguelite auto-battler with actual animation is less engaging than clicking a still image in Hamster Kombat. “Auto-battlers” strike me as bleak artifacts of our era, games that play themselves with the goal of producing player satisfaction without player effort or skill. In the case of Guild of Guardians, the only gameplay seems to be tapping a few heroic special abilities, if you feel like it – but you’ll “win” either way. I wrote this review while the game was playing for me, and I don’t think I missed much.  The game is also aesthetically janky as hell, from middling graphics to truly bad interface and design, and generally feels like it was built by contractors working to an investor spec rather than actual game designers. On the plus side, it was seamless to log in to, and I didn’t get a cringey crypto-based sales pitch. On the other hand, I can’t imagine any human ever caring about this game enough to connect a crypto wallet to it, and its backend tokenomics are utter boilerplate, with a vesting schedule that seems to privilege insiders.  Rumble Racing Star (PC, Mac)  Onboarding: C  Gameplay: D  Graphics and Presentation: D  Tokenomics: F  One thing I noticed during these reviews is that many games built or backed in Asia still appear to be in a token-bubble mindset. The homepage of Rumble Racing Star is a good example, starting with an immediate pop-up encouraging users to spin a wheel and win obscure crypto tokens and NFT prizes. At the same time, I was unable to find any meaningful description of the game’s token design from the front page. Where you’d normally find a white paper there’s only a vague gameplay description.  Unfortunately, the game itself reflects this – it’s basic and, to be blunt, janky as hell. At its core it’s a Mario Kart knockoff with lawnmowers for carts, but the tracks, characters, and vehicles are uninspired, and worst of all, the controls are unreliable and “squishy.” This surely isn’t the last we’ll see of blockchain games that haven’t figured out that they have to be good games first – but hopefully, they’re a dying breed.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET,David Z.

42407898,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7O6z,1720551508,It's Not Germany Selling Bitcoin. It's One of Its States and It Has No Choice.,"It's not the country of Germany that's been selling millions of dollars worth of bitcoin, but a small German state called Saxony.  The state confiscated almost 50,000 BTC in January and has been selling its holdings as per standard practice for assets seized during criminal investigations, an expert said.  For days, news outlets worldwide have reported on Germany's sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin {{BTC}} and the ensuing distress in markets and major sell-offs in crypto prices.  First, it's not Germany itself that is selling the cryptocurrency. It is a small state in the eastern part of the country called Saxony.  Second, though crypto fans have roasted the decision to dump so much of their beloved bitcoin, Saxony doesn't have a choice.  Earlier this year, the state's Criminal Police Office (known by its German acronym LKA) seized 49,857 bitcoin (worth almost $3 billion at current prices) from the operator of Movie2k.to, a website Saxony found guilty of money laundering and other illegal activities.  About a week ago, a crypto wallet that belongs to the German Federal Criminal Police Office, or BKA, started moving thousands of BTC to exchanges including Kraken, Coinbase and Bitstamp, signaling an intent to sell them. The wallet's bitcoin holdings have dwindled to 23,788.  Reactions on social media have been harsh.  ""Germany selling all their #Bitcoin will go down as one of the most retarded things their politicians ever did,"" one X user wrote.  ""Germany's govt officials are literal idiots,"" another said.  But what's happening in Germany isn't a bad investment strategy – it is merely standard procedure that applies to assets confiscated in criminal investigations, an expert said.  ""The general prosecutor's office of Saxony is responsible for liquidating confiscated assets, and the sell-off is hardly surprising,"" said Dr. Lennart Ante, co-founder and CEO of German-based Blockchain Research Lab. ""Seized assets are always liquidated within a certain period. This is a routine business process, although at a larger-than-normal scale.""  The reason why the wallet belongs to the country's BKA – not Saxony itself – is probably because the police agency was involved in the initial investigation and had the technical know-how to handle such a large amount of bitcoin, he speculated. However, BKA does not have decision-making power and solely acts on instructions from the state.  In most cases, confiscated assets can only be transferred or sold with the proceeds going to the state budget once a judge rules that the state is allowed to do so, which isn't the case in this particular situation. However, states can request to initiate an emergency sale, which could be issued if the asset's value might quickly lose value or is difficult to store, for example, Ante explained.  ""In the case of bitcoin, this could at least be argued on the grounds of volatility,"" he said.  There is evidence, however, that Saxony is trying to sell too much bitcoin at once. On Tuesday, it received $200 million back from some of the exchanges, indicating that there wasn't enough demand to buy such a huge sum.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/07/09/its-not-germany-thats-selling-bitcoin-its-one-of-its-states-and-it-has-no-choice,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/612099705b25c78c7a214fed7e588e245d26bbb4-8216x4622.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the battle between bulls and bears progresses, it is clear that sellers have the upper hand for now despite the recent price stability. BTC Prices At A Crucial Price Level: Will Bulls Take Over? As BTC bulls attempt to reverse losses posted last week, one analyst, citing technical candlestick formation and the reaction at the 200-day moving average, thinks how prices react for now will be consequential in the coming days. In a post on X, the analyst noted that the coin dipped and closed below the 200-day moving average following last week’s losses. This formation was crucial. Over the months, this dynamic line had acted as critical support, anchoring buyers throughout the last bull cycle from October through mid-March. The rally was sustained, and though the level was not retested until late June, when prices were weak across the board, the break last week was decisive. Related Reading: If History Repeats, Bitcoin Price Could Crash 33% Again: Here’s Why While bearish, the analyst acknowledged that last week’s break was clear. However, as it is, there is hope for bears because there has been no confirming bear bar. For this to happen, prices must break below $56,500 and sink below $53,500, marking last week’s low. When this happens, it will be official that bears are back, and sellers will likely continue pushing lower in a bear trend continuation formation. If Bitcoin is to turn around, it is imperative that prices reject last week’s losses and break higher, closing above the 200-day moving average. This recovery will be the bullish signal that may mark the start of a leg up, resuming the uptrend of Q1 2024. For now, traders are watching the psychological line at $60,000 and, ideally, the close above $66,000. In that event, Bitcoin might find the momentum to retest $72,000–an important liquidation level. Eyes On Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Even amid the optimism, traders are closely watching inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially in light of the sustained dump by the German government. The sell-off has been heaping more pressure on BTC, capping gains, and deflating the upside momentum. If sellers are persistent and mirror recent trends, there could be more blood, and spot Bitcoin ETF issuers might register outflows. Related Reading: Can Solana Hit $160?

42407886,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7NZv,1720548343,"MEV Has Spread to Bitcoin, in Subtler Forms Than on Ethereum","Arbitrage opportunities exist in traditional finance and in crypto, but in the latter they are more pronounced due to the visibility of pending transactions and slow settlement times.   Although less prominent than on Ethereum, MEV on Bitcoin is emerging through practices like ""sniping"" Ordinal inscriptions, mining empty blocks, and miner cartelization.   MEV emerging on Bitcoin could lead to pressure from the market for mempools to “go private” which would undermine the cryptocurrency's founding tenets.  One of the supposed “killer apps” for cryptocurrencies and blockchains is the ability to trade all kinds of assets (if you can call them that) without a centralized financial intermediary. Never mind that the majority of these assets do nothing or purportedly do something by doing nothing at all. People have made immense returns trading them. Like the time in 2020 when everyone got rich off of SHIB and then again in 2023 trading WIF and trading PEPE.  When the early capital piled into these tokens, they were first purchased on decentralized exchanges with Automated Market Makers (AMM) well before they were available on centralized crypto exchanges. AMMs are decentralized applications which match buyers and sellers of crypto tokens without all the data sharing rigmarole associated with a regulated exchange. No passport pictures or snaps of your driver’s license or treble selfies or need to wait for anything or anyone in particular. All you have to do is connect your crypto wallet, tell the AMM you want to buy a certain amount of a certain asset, click buy, and you’re on your way.  What’s immediately interesting about these AMMs (aside from the convenience and privacy of avoiding identity checks) is that while crypto opinion leaders promote crypto and blockchains as the “next iteration” of the stock market (imagine the stock market, but it never closes… and if you make a mistake there is no recourse … which isn’t great unless you somehow profit off of a mistake or glitch, like say if you were on the right side of the trade when Berkshire Hathaway stock appeared to trade at around $180 instead of around $600,000), in a way equities markets are more real-time than AMMs are.  Crude example: Person A wants to buy Stock XYZ at $100 and Person B is selling Stock XYZ at $99. Because today’s financial markets are so hyperconnected, Person C somehow knows this (there are legal and illegal ways to find and act on this information) and buys Stock XYZ from Person B for $99 and instantly sells it to Person A for $100. Everyone is happy: Person A gets Stock XYZ, Person B gets $99, and Person C gets $1 arbitraging the trade.  That money making trade is now over, done and dusted, and with it gone and gobbled up by the arbitrageur Person C is the inefficiency in the market for Stock XYZ (the $1 difference between Person A’s buying price and Person B’s selling price). And this all happened in real time, by which we mean linearly, Person C had to get in between Person A and B at exactly the right time to execute that trade and it had to happen in that order (A to C to B).  We can, of course, see the same type of arbitrage with AMMs, albeit in a slightly different form. Suppose you heard about SHIB early and you wanted to buy some before it was available on a centralized exchange. Because it’s not on an exchange you called on an Ethereum-based AMM (SHIB was created on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token), and you clicked the buttons to make your purchase of SHIB tokens. When you make that order, it gets thrown into a big batch of proposed Ethereum transactions. Some of those transactions could be people buying stuff online with USDC, but many of them are trades for tokens like SHIB or WIF or PEPE.  All these transactions are viewable by everyone before they’re finalized and carried out because they hang out in a digital waiting room called the mempool. If the AMM you used for your trade mispriced SHIB because of a market inefficiency (like in our Stock XYZ example) someone on the network could construct an Ethereum transaction that purchases the SHIB before you using a different AMM to then sell it to you for a profit (because, remember, these transactions are viewable before they’re finalized).  To take this example even further, let’s assume your purchase of SHIB is rather large. In this situation everyone can see your very large, market-moving transaction is pending and can place trades around yours to take advantage of both market inefficiencies and the market-moving nature of your order.  Trades like this can be grouped together under the rubric of sandwich trades. Some opt for the term sandwich attacks because the AMM is not matching the buyer to the intended seller or sellers and because it could lead to the original buyer losing out in a big way before their trade even goes through (imagine if you wanted to buy 1 billion SHIB tokens and you only got 800 million because of an AMM inefficiency getting sandwich-traded).  Sandwich trades and other types of “inefficiency finding” are more broadly called Maximal (or Miner) Extractable Value. (Miners don’t exist in Ethereum anymore, hence the rebrand). This is what crypto technobabblers mean when they use the initialism MEV in conversation as if that’s common parlance (a la high finance’s EV or IRR). All MEV means is that in crypto those who verify transactions choose to order them in a way which is most profitable for themselves rather than for the transactors. Because block times (the time it takes for transactions to be verified) are not real time (in Ethereum transactions are verified every 12 seconds or so), there’s plenty of real-world time to make arbitrage trades. Especially if you are a bot instead of an actual human.  With this in mind, it shouldn’t take much to imagine that MEV has expanded beyond AMMs. A fair conclusion to the preceding technobabble is this: The more complicated the thing you’re trying to do is, the more likely MEV will occur (just like in regular ol’ finance).  MEV: Merits, drawbacks, and its tenuous existence on Bitcoin  The discussion around MEV is expansive. Is it good? Is it bad? Is it illegal?  Depends whom you ask.  On the plus side, MEV is the free market figuring out the actual costs of things on blockchains by snuffing out inefficiencies which will be taken advantage of until the inefficiency approaches zero. On the minus side, MEV makes it possible for unknowing laypeople and newer users to get absolutely demolished by the experts and the power users (sound familiar?).  So far, we’ve only mentioned Ethereum because, for all its first mover advantage, MEV has historically not existed on Bitcoin. It existed in theory, but in practice it’s not economically viable (except in very specific situations).  You’re probably wondering: “No MEV? If there’s MEV for Ethereum-based AMMs then surely there’s one for the Bitcoin-based AMMs?”  And you’d be right except that there aren’t any (meaningfully sized) Bitcoin-based AMMs. That’s because Ethereum is more expressive than Bitcoin, meaning you can “do more stuff with it,” like create coins with dog mascots or other memes to trade on AMMs and become rich.  And because Bitcoin isn’t as expressive, there isn’t a thriving market or AMM for new tokens on Bitcoin. And without new, fresh non-bitcoin assets on Bitcoin how could an AMM-related MEV opportunity present itself? What exactly would you be doing? Trading bitcoin for other bitcoin?  Well, yes. This is exactly where MEV on Bitcoin has begun to present itself.  MEV on Bitcoin  MEV is nowhere close to as robust on Bitcoin as it is on Ethereum and when the topic is discussed among experts it’s always larded with caveats.  “It’s more like games you can play than MEV,” said Colin Harper, head of research and content at bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technology (no relation to the hotel in Vegas).  Three years ago, Bitcoin went through an update called Taproot, which made the network more expressive. This expressivity also accidentally made the Bitcoin equivalent of NFTs possible through Casey Rodarmor’s Ordinals protocol. This is what I mean by “trading bitcoin for other bitcoin”: “NFTs” can work on Bitcoin because the Ordinal protocol is able to see which satoshis (the smallest unit of bitcoin, a hundred millionth) are inscribed with arbitrary data which can be a picture or text or something else. These collectibles are called inscriptions so as to not be confused with NFTs (which are separate tokens). If you were buying an inscription, instead of buying an entirely new token as you would on Ethereum, you’re just buying some bitcoin that’s only special when seen through the lens of the Ordinals protocol.  This is, literally, buying bitcoin with bitcoin (buying less with more, of course). And like buying SHIB for ETH or USDC for USDT, buying bitcoin with bitcoin is an activity that can be front-run.  “When you sell inscriptions on Magic Eden or another marketplace like it, you’re using a PSBT [Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction],"" Harper explained. “The seller signs their half, and when the buyer purchases it they complete the transaction with their signature and the buyer pays the fee for the transaction. So if an NFT trader sees the transaction in the mempool, they can snipe it by broadcasting their own transaction that replaces the original buyer's payment and address with their own. To do so, they broadcast an RBF [Replace-By-Fee] transaction with a higher fee to ensure that their transaction is confirmed before the original one.”  Although this isn’t quite like the pure-play MEV as discussed in the first section of this article, it still looks like MEV: The intended buyer and seller weren’t matched because a third party came in and offered more compensation for miners in exchange for the inscription and miners maximized their own value in the transaction by accepting the third party transaction.  Other things that feel like MEV on Bitcoin  Bitcoin still has miners (read here what that means compared to Ethereum's validators) and in the business of mining there are some things happening somewhat regularly which look like MEV.  One common example is the mining of empty blocks. Periodically, a bitcoin block is mined with nothing in it. The block is useless to anyone save the miner who won the block, as no transactions which are waiting to be confirmed are verified except for the coinbase (small ""c,"" not the company) transaction which rewards the miner with the block reward. There’s a technical reason this happens, and really it’s an accident that empty blocks even occur, but it’s hard to argue that this is a) not MEV and b) good for Bitcoin (although it is also hard to argue that it’s bad).  There’s also the cartelization of miners. Many bitcoin miners now use mining pools to smooth out their revenue by mining in aggregate and being paid their proportional share. This could present an issue, especially as mining pools get bigger and bigger. As Walt Smith of VC firm Cyber Fund wrote in an extensive “MEV on Bitcoin” piece:  “… [P]ooled mining enables savvy multi-block MEV by raising the odds of winning consecutive blocks, creating systemic risk. Pools and other mining cartels have enforced common block templates by abusing pooling economics, blacklisting smaller miners practicing nonstandard block building. Consistent surplus fees plus economies of scale induces consolidation, birthing a pathological loop.”  Right now, some mining pools control a massive share of total network hashrate and two or three of them could club up to control over half of the computational power. If this cartel of pools won enough blocks in a row, it could exercise its monopoly power to maximize profits.  There’s one more real example of bitcoin miner behavior which might be MEV: out-of-band payments. These are instances where bitcoin miners are paid (either off-chain, or in a separate and seemingly unrelated bitcoin transfer) to accept transactions which are considered non-standard. Again, this isn’t pure-play MEV, because the extracted value does not occur on the blockchain as the result of savvy programmatic decisions. Instead, value is extracted by miners being paid more than they would have been paid otherwise to do something.  Some researchers worry that out-of-band payments are the first step on a slippery slope and could obscure incentives. But miners are jumping at the opportunity. Publicly traded mining giant Marathon (NASDAQ: MARA) has launched a service called Slipstream offering to accept non-standard transactions.  The concern is that this under-the-table practice could lead to private mempools, which would be troubling on any blockchain. As CoinDesk’s Sam Kessler writes: “Most pressingly, there's the worry that private mempools might cement new middlemen at key areas in Ethereum's transaction pipeline.”  If private mempools become where most transactions are submitted for confirmation, that would make it so only the selected few, the somehow ordained few, can affect Bitcoin transactions. This would centralize authority on the blockchain, an obviously unsavory situation for anyone who values censorship resistance.  There are other examples of MEV on Bitcoin and more will inevitably crop up. Since it’s here in some form, network participants need to pay attention.

42407897,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7ODb,1720546200,What Still Needs to Happen Before Spot Ether ETFs Can Trade,"There's a lot of excitement over the possibility that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be around the corner. Here's what still needs to happen before one may launch.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Following BTC  The narrative  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems poised to approve spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and they could begin trading as soon as this week – though there's still a bit of work left to be done.  Why it matters  The crypto industry has pushed for spot ether {{ETH}} ETFs for years, nearly as long as it's pushed for spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs. The SEC approved the bitcoin products in January after a decade of rejections, but did not seem ready to approve the ether counterparts until May. As with the spot bitcoin ETFs, advocates for spot ether ETFs argue they'll create a safe and regulated investment vehicle that will grant the general public exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap without requiring them to invest in it directly.  Breaking it down  A handful of would-be issuers filed amended S-1 forms on Friday and Monday, suggesting progress is being made. Notably, the filings did not contain fee information, so there's likely to be at least one more round of comments from SEC staff before trading can begin. Invesco and Galaxy published a fee – 0.25% – on Tuesday. VanEck was the only would-be issuer to publish a fee prior to the latest round of updates.  To be clear, there's no firm timeline for approval. Unlike the 19b-4 filings the SEC approved in may, there's no imminent final deadline the agency must meet for a final decision, and so the back-and-forth between regulators and issuers could wrap up as soon as Friday or take a few weeks still. One individual familiar with the process told CoinDesk they expected the dialogue to continue for a few weeks.  The filings also do not detail expense ratios. If amended filings include those key details, that may signal they are the final set of amendments.  Should the SEC provide feedback by the end of the day Tuesday, it's entirely plausible the issuers will file a final set of amended forms by Wednesday. They would have to include fee information and any other details required by the regulator. For the spot bitcoin ETFs, it took the SEC two days to send out the final approvals after issuers had submitted fees. If that holds this time round, provided issuers submit their fees by Wednesday, it is possible that an approval could be in by Friday.  The products could begin trading relatively quickly afterward.  Hours before the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC in January, one of the listing exchanges, Cboe, added the funds to its “New Listings” page, saying that was “standard procedure” before the approval of a new ETF. If so, given that five of the potential ether ETFs will be listed on Cboe, we may well see a similar situation happening on the day that these ETFs receive approval.

The platform suggested that the worst might not be over as the flagship crypto could still experience further dips from its current price range. To Buy Or Not To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Santiment mentioned to those considering buying the dip that market participants also anticipate a rebound. They added that these dramatic dips, like the one Bitcoin recently experienced, are usually met with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). Related Reading: XRP Price: Crypto Analyst Identifies ‘Point Of Control’ That Could See A Repeat Of 2017 This suggests that those looking to buy the Bitcoin dip may have to be careful as Bitcoin could dip further due to those waiting to offload their holdings out of panic once the flagship crypto recovers. Regarding FUD, there have also been calls that Bitcoin could still drop to the $40,000 range. As such, such statements could prove bearish for Bitcoin’s price, causing it to further decline. Meanwhile, Santiment noted that Bitcoin usually recovers from such dramatic dips after the average trader has given up hope on crypto. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto also had some words for those looking to buy the dip at Bitcoin’s current price range. He mentioned in an X post that anyone looking to buy at these current price levels must be okay with being “underwater” for a while. He added that anyone uncomfortable with being underwater for a while should wait until some positive price action develops. He noted that this positive price action could ideally come in the “form of a major liquidation flush (open interest reset) or some LTF impulsive price action.” The crypto analyst also addressed spot Bitcoin buyers. He assured them that they need not worry about this current price range, claiming that Bitcoin could drop lower on the higher time frame (HTF) without invalidating the HTF bullish structure. Based on Bitcoin’s bullish structure, he mentioned that the price correction following this downtrend will send the flagship crypto to $100,000. Institutional Investors Are Buying The Dip Recent data from Farside investors shows that institutional investors are buying the Bitcoin dip. On July 8, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded total net inflows of $294.8 million. BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC all recorded impressive net inflows of $187.2 million, $61.5 million, and $25.1 million, respectively. Related Reading: Finance CEO Raoul Pal Says Crypto Will Reach $100 Trillion Market Cap – Here’s When These Spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded net inflows of $143 million on July 5, which marked a turnaround considering that they had experienced two consecutive days of outflows before then. These inflows into Bitcoin have contributed to the recent price rebound that the flagship crypto has witnessed. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $57,100, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A CoinDesk investigation reveals former Eclipse Labs CEO Neel Somani pledged Pant a stake in Eclipse tokens worth $13.3 million.  Somani pledged the tokens as an incentive for Pant to secure Polychain's funding, according to sources close to Eclipse.  Polychain says Pant did not disclose the deal to the fund.

The situation provides a glimpse into the shadowy dealings that have come to typify the crypto industry's fundraising scene, where venture firms cozy up to projects and invest in exchange for tokens instead of traditional equity.  Crypto venture capital giant Polychain has accused Niraj Pant, a former employee, of making a backroom deal with portfolio company Eclipse Labs that broke the fund's policies.  According to three sources close to the situation and internal Eclipse documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Neel Somani, the former CEO of Eclipse Labs, quietly allocated Pant 5% of a forthcoming Eclipse crypto token in September 2022 – just days after Pant directed Polychain to lead the company's $6 million pre-seed funding round.  The allocation was eventually reduced to 1.33%, worth $13.3 million at the token's most recent fully diluted valuation in a private investment round. (According to a source close to Eclipse Labs, the company's latest funding round valued the token at a fully diluted value (FDV) of $1 billion.)  Polychain was founded by Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee of crypto exchange Coinbase, and is one of the largest and best-known crypto venture firms, with more than $11 billion in assets under management. Pant was a general partner there from 2017 to 2023, tasked with steering the firm's venture money into promising crypto startups.  Pant has since become a prominent figure in the crypto industry, currently serving as co-founder of the blockchain AI startup Ritual, another portfolio investment of Polychain's.  Eclipse Labs builds a blockchain that mixes technology from the popular Solana and Ethereum networks. After leading Eclipse's August 2022 pre-seed funding round, Polychain went on to participate in its $50 million Series A funding round in March 2024.  Pant spearheaded the pre-seed deal, and a CoinDesk investigation revealed that around that same time, he was allotted about as many Eclipse crypto tokens as Polychain itself. The deal was not, according to CoinDesk's sources, disclosed to most of Eclipse's executives, advisors or large investors.  Pant insists the arrangement was completely kosher because it wasn't finalized until September 2022 – the month after Polychain had already invested in Eclipse. He shared legal documents with CoinDesk showing that his ""advisory"" allocation of Eclipse tokens was revised to 1.33% in 2024 but declined to comment on the size of his original stake, or why it was altered.  Polychain told CoinDesk it was unaware that Pant had a financial stake in Eclipse until after he left the firm in 2023. The fund said he should have disclosed the deal under its policies, which are meant to protect the firm and its investors against conflicts of interest.  ""Polychain was unaware of the financial relationship between Eclipse and Niraj Pant until after his departure from the firm,"" a Polychain spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk. ""Polychain has robust policies and procedures surrounding employees serving in advisory roles. Following Mr. Pant’s departure from Polychain, the firm became aware that he violated its policies and investigated the matter.""  Polychain's statement to CoinDesk grants a rare insight into the sausage-making process of the cozy world of crypto VC firms and the projects they fund. Venture firms rarely discuss personnel matters or deal structures publicly, and Polychain did not publicly disclose Pant’s policy breach until CoinDesk reached out for this story.  A murky timeline  The revelation could deepen the controversial narrative surrounding Somani, who stepped aside as Eclipse's CEO in May amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Somani denied those allegations and declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Somani specified that no legal charges have been filed against him in connection with any sexual misconduct allegations.  Two sources close to Eclipse who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity claim Somani promised Pant his 5% advisory stake in Eclipse tokens beforethe pre-seed deal even closed.  According to documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Pant's stake was higher than that of any Eclipse investor except Polychain, which was also slotted for 5% of Eclipse's token. Pant's stake exceeded the allocations to other advisers, investors and every Eclipse employee except for the former CEO.  Somani told his inner circle that the generous token grant was meant to incentivize Pant to secure Polychain's cash and the veteran VC's coveted endorsement, according to two people familiar with the matter.  According to Polychain officials, the arrangement was not disclosed to the venture capital firm or its limited partners at the time.  Tokens, not equity  The episode also provides a glimpse into the dealings that have come to typify the crypto industry's unique fundraising norms, with digital tokens often granted alongside any equity, or in lieu of it. Blockchain apps, digital assets and decentralized ledgers are often pitched as a more transparent alternative to traditional finance, but the ownership structures of many leading projects and cryptocurrencies remain opaque.  Eclipse Labs builds a layer-2 blockchain that offers users a faster and cheaper way to transact on the Ethereum network. The network's main draw is that it borrows elements of the popular Solana blockchain to power key elements of its technical design – a detail that has helped it earn buzz across two of the largest blockchain communities.  In the case of Eclipse's fundraising, the token allocations were crucial because few investors received equity in the project. Most were simply promised a cut of Eclipse's token – a cryptocurrency that doesn't exist yet and that Eclipse has not even publicly announced.  This setup isn't atypical. Crypto investors frequently offer cash in exchange for tokens rather than traditional equity, and companies rarely disclose these arrangements to the public, lest they arm financial regulators with ammunition in their fight to classify cryptocurrencies as investment securities.  ""Eclipse Labs does not disclose investor ownership percentages to the public,"" a spokesperson for Eclipse Labs told CoinDesk.  According to internal token allocation tables reviewed by CoinDesk, Eclipse's employees, investors and advisers have already been promised nearly 50% of the supply of a future Eclipse token.  Pant insists that his own advisory agreement with Eclipse was above board. He shared legal documents with CoinDesk showing that he is set to receive a 1.33% stake in Eclipse’s token.  This sum – revised from an earlier total that Pant did not disclose – is lower than the 5% that documents and people familiar with the matter reveal Pant was initially promised, but still higher than that of every other Eclipse adviser and almost all of its investors and employees.  The advisory agreement shared by Pant is dated April 29, 2024 – after he left Polychain – and signed by two parties: Neel Somani, on behalf of Eclipse Labs; and Niraj Pant, on behalf of ""The Psychological Operations Co.""  Under the agreement, Psychological Operations Co. would receive a grant of Eclipse's tokens in exchange for ""periodic teleconference sync meetings"" as requested by Eclipse. The agreement itself says nothing about Polychain or its pre-seed investment into Eclipse.  The version of the agreement provided to CoinDesk by Pant states that it is an ""amendment"" to an earlier advisory agreement dated Sept. 8, 2022 – just weeks after Eclipse's pre-seed round would have closed and while he was still a general partner at Polychain.  Pant declined to share that original agreement.  Polychain's policies  Whether or not Pant’s advisership was finalized before the pre-seed deal, if his initial advisership with Eclipse started while he was still at Polychain – as his own documents attest – then he may still have been required to disclose this under the firm’s ethics policies, which the firm described in a lengthy disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In an official policy filing with the SEC, Polychain writes: “In order to monitor any conflict of interest, Polychain employees are required to pre-clear certain contemplated transactions in their personal accounts which may present the appearance of impropriety, and must disclose on an initial and annual basis the holdings of all personal accounts, as well as all transactions on a quarterly basis.”  The situation is particularly remarkable because Pant is not only an ex-employee of Polychain but also the co-founder of Ritual, one of Polychain's buzziest portfolio companies.  After departing Polychain and founding Ritual last year, Pant quickly rose to become a staple of the blockchain industry's speaker circuit, looked to as a thought leader on the intersection between crypto and artificial intelligence. Ritual, which aims to decentralize the execution of AI models, is among a category of blockchain-meets-AI projects that have evolved into a venture darling in its own right. Last November, it raised $25 million from Polychain and others.  Polychain declined to comment on whether its relationship with Ritual has changed as a result of Pant's supposed policy breach, or whether it learned of the breach before it invested in Ritual.  Despite the alleged policy breach, Polychain's investment in Eclipse might still pay off. According to a source close to the fund, its stake in Eclipse has increased in value 10-fold since the company initially invested in 2022.

One of the exchanges on which WATER is available for purchase is Bitget, which may explain Messi's apparent endorsement.  The promotion and the team behind the token drew skepticism from the crypto community on social media.  Soccer legend Lionel Messi promoted Solana-based meme coin WATER on his Instagram story on Monday, prompting a 350% surge in the token's price.  Messi shared an image displaying the token's mascot, a cartoon glass of water, perched on his shoulder, with a link to the project's Instagram page on Monday. WATER jumped from $0.00032 to $0.00146 in the two hours following the post, a surge of 356%.  WATER subsequently pulled back and sits at just over $0.001 at the time of writing, up 215.6% in the last 24 hours, according to data by CoinMarketCap. The token has a market cap of around $94 million and a 24-hour trading volume of slightly under $40 million.  The project's website says WATER ""aims to have a net-positive impact on real world with the help of charity,"" though it doesn't elaborate how. One of the exchanges it is available for purchase is Bitget, which may explain Messi's apparent endorsement. The Argentinian Inter Miami star has been partnered with Bitget since October 2022.  Messi's media relations team couldn't be reached for a comment.  Several celebrities, including media personality Caitlyn Jenner and rapper Iggy Azalea, cashed in on meme coin season earlier this year, minting tokens on the Solana blockchain. Such activities were met with accusations that they were attempting to make a fast buck from unsuspecting followers.  As such, Messi's post was met with skepticism from some commentators in the crypto community. Analyst @ericonomics wrote on X, ""They will probably rug [pull] soon so make yourself a favour and don't buy that sh*t.""  ""Third token scam that Messi promotes,"" he wrote. ""The first one was Leafty, which was a rug (they removed the liquidity like 5 days later lol). The second one was Planet, an slow rug that is like -90% since that promotion.""  Subsequently, former Brazilian soccer superstar Ronaldinho seems to have promoted the project on Instagram, leading to a slight bump in the token's price. He also couldn't be reached for a comment.

42407894,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Ntl,1720541691,Why We're (Still) Investing in Web3 Gaming,"With game tokens down 37% overall in 2024, there’s been some trash talk saying Web3 gaming is dead. But crypto is cyclical, and the current downturn is nothing we haven’t seen before. As angel investors focused on seed and pre-seed, we think this is a wonderful time to invest. Having emerged from the Crypto Winter, but not yet priced out by the utter madness of the crypto bull run and its ridiculous valuations, this is a special time when builders are pitching mind-bending new ideas and shipping intriguing MVPs. And, guided by the thesis that Web3 gaming will move us further forward in terms of innovation, adoption and impact than any other use case, we’re putting our money where our mouth is.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week.  Today, our company Emfarsis is investing in and advising early stage Web3 projects with a focus on gaming. We originally became interested in blockchain way back in 2016 because we saw the potential for the technology to empower marginalized groups and champion inclusion, redistribute wealth and power more fairly and transparently, and improve the lives of billions of people all around the world. Ultimately, we believed that Web3 could be a force for good.  It wasn’t until late 2017 when we went all in on Web3, joining a crypto payments startup that sought to level the playing field for business operators that were fighting tooth and nail with the banks for a fair go. We got to go around the world giving talks and running workshops, while Leah wrote red pill-styled opinion pieces on everything from peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and crypto-asset backed remittance to decentralized identity and reputation. But, OMG, the education effort was a hard slog. Yes, of course, people would nod emphatically as we told them they could be their own bank, and transact permissionlessly — yada yada yada — but only a small number actually converted. Even then, they were more likely to buy on a local, licensed CEX and HODL, rather than self custody and go off exploring the decentralized ecosystem.  We found ourselves asking: what’s the point of world-changing tech if you can’t get people to use it? Not just check the balance on their wallets once in a BTC moon, but really use it? At the time (circa 2018-19), we felt the learning curve was too steep, the UX sucked, and quite frankly, talking about wallets, payments and remittance put people to sleep. Not to mention that most people weren’t overly enthused about investing their savings into “magic beans” that they viewed as volatile, risky, and possibly scammy. Few normies wanted to gamble on that.  But making money by playing a video game? Now THAT was a different proposition altogether. This was the promise of play-to-earn and we discovered it before most, when “blockchain gaming” was still an oxymoron. When Leah first wrote about it for CoinDesk in August 2020, Axie had less than 500 DAU, was still on Ethereum, and suffered all of the same UX and on/off ramping issues as the rest of crypto. But that didn’t stop a tidal wave of new users, when word got around about the game that paid you to play — particularly in the Philippines where we’d relocated in 2018 in the belief that the country would see a crypto adoption miracle thanks to its young, digitally-savvy but mostly unbanked population that was highly proficient in English.  At its peak in July 2021, Axie counted nearly 3 million daily active users (DAU). Largely, they were poor, low-skilled service sector workers hailing from emerging economies in Southeast Asia, Latin America, India and Africa — exactly the kind of people that we’d hoped might one day find personal empowerment in crypto. This community had previously been ignored by crypto marketers due to their lack of disposable cash, and here they were, finally, and legitimately, competing in the global decentralized digital economy as equals. It was the miracle we had predicted; we just never dreamed a video game would be the catalyst.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  It’s critical to note here that Axie’s developer, Sky Mavis, had achieved this great adoption feat without needing to make blockchain easier to use or understand. It didn’t even lower the cost of participation, as you still had to buy the NFTs you needed to play (at least, you did in the early days — more on that later). Instead, Axie changed the game entirely, by delivering an unapologetically Web3-native experience that was unparalleled. It financialized gaming in such a way that anyone who contributed real value to the game’s virtual economy (not just the developers and the publishers) could reap the benefits. And people wanted it so bad, they jumped through hoops to have it.  At the time, countless articles cited Axie’s crazy growth but possibly the biggest contributor to this was the rise of scholarships. You might remember this as a commission model whereby the owner of an Axie NFT could rent the asset to another player and take a cut of their in-game earnings. But, what many didn’t realize was that scholarships were not the brainchild of Sky Mavis; they were a business model invented by and for the Axie player community in response to the problem of rising NFT prices and stunted in-game productivity, and ultimately designed to onboard more new players into their world of financialized fun. Scholarships were built without permission, leveraging tools supplied by the game’s developer in a way that wasn’t necessarily intended.  Scholarships are now largely redundant because most Web3 games have implemented a free-to-play model, so NFT ownership isn’t a requirement for players to get started. But we still think of them as a harbinger for what could be possible when newer and more sophisticated trends around composable “modding” including fully onchain games (FOCG) and permissionless user-generated content unlock unbridled entrepreneurial creativity in Web3 games. FOCG have been criticized for their early stage of development, slow progress, and low DAU, but we see these games as Web3’s R&D sector. We believe their tinkering will lead to wildly experimental combinations of Web3 primitives, fusing new types of NFTs like soulbound tokens, and new standards like ERC-6551, with DeFi, DAOs and more, to come up with unique tokenomics around ownership, incentives and governance, while delivering totally novel user experiences that were never even thinkable let alone achievable in Web2.  We began angel investing when we realized that mass adoption was possible without having to dumb down the Web3 elements, and while making crypto more fun to play with and learn about. That epiphany continues to guide all our decision making, particularly as we are quite sure that it represents a massive total addressable market (TAM). The mind boggles at how to calculate the potential TAM for a new category of video game that is underpinned by crypto’s open, decentralized rails, and has given rise to a whole new breed of gig economy.  We’ve come a long way since the early days of CryptoKitties and Axie. As of July 2024, there are over 994 quality, playable web3 games across 70 blockchains, spanning multiple genres, according to BlockchainGamer.Biz. This is remarkable when you consider that most of these startups were funded around 2021-22, but it can take traditional gaming studios around eight years to build a AAA game.  From where we are, we see consistent building, measurable progress and boundless originality from Web3 game devs, driving promising growth across the sector, with every L2 clamoring for a slice of the growing pie. Even when the DAU is low and the token prices are down, gaming is one of the few corners of Web3 where you can find real, genuinely active, thoroughly engaged crypto users. As such, we remain convinced that gaming is still, by far, the best use case we’ve ever seen for blockchain.  Now all the investors want to know: what’s the next Axie to kickstart the next bull run?

Matercard and Baanx also have a debit card with DeFi firm 1Inch and are working on one with MetaMask.  Tezos, the smart-contract blockchain founded by the husband-wife team of Arthur and Kathleen Breitman in 2017, will have its name on a new crypto payments debit card, created in association with Baanx, the digital assets card facilitator and partner of Mastercard.  Transactions involving the Tezos-branded, non-custodial crypto card will take place on Etherlink, an Ethereum-compatible layer-2 blockchain powered by Tezos Smart Rollups technology, to allow fast, cheap payments. The Tezos Foundation-backed debit card will be accepted by over 110 million global merchants compatible with Mastercard.  Crypto cards linked to non-custodial wallets – which allow customers to keep hold of their crypto until needed – are becoming popular. Matercard and Baanx are reportedly rolling out a MetaMask debit card, and DeFi firm 1Inch has one in operation. Baanx's relationship with Tezos is over four years old, and the Tezos Foundation has been included in previous Baanx funding rounds.  The Tezos Etherlink layer 2 offers sub-second transaction finality at around 500 milliseconds right now and will become faster in the coming months, said Siddharth Singhal, head of business development at Trilitech, a Tezos developer.  “We have built an on-chain, non custodial payment experience allowing users to spend their on-chain balance in a non-custodial fashion, as you would with any MasterCard,” Singhal said in an interview. “So, like Apple Pay, Google Pay, as well as real-life retail scenarios – wherever a debit card is acceptable.”  The rationale behind crypto cards includes being a replacement for online banking and helping people who are unbanked or underbanked, and also for the creator economy looking to build wallets that pay out to users, said Simon Jones, Baanx's chief commercial officer.  “As well as the roughly 1.2 billion people who don't have access to financial services, you have those who basically want to bin their bank, but need that real-world connectivity,” Jones said in an interview. “Another use would be for the creator economy, where you might be running a gaming wallet, say, and pay out to users, but don't want to hand back revenues to Apple.

30702083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628595,1720539039,"Solana Mirroring 2021 Bullish Pattern, Crypto Analyst Reveals","An analyst has explained how Solana (SOL) is currently mirroring the same pattern that led to a bullish breakout for its price back in 2021. Solana Appears To Be Showing Similar Trend To 2021 Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how the pattern recently forming in SOL has been reminiscent of what the cryptocurrency showed back in the July of three years ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Make-Or-Break Test: Will Support Hold? Below is the chart shared by the analyst, that highlights the similarity between the two periods: As is visible in the graph, the Solana 3-day price has so far shown a trajectory that has been similar to the one in 2021. Not only that, the current Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also at around the same level as the one back then. The RSI refers to an indicator in technical analysis (TA) that basically measures the speed as well as the magnitude of the recent changes occurring in SOL’s price. This momentum indicator is generally used for determining whether the asset’s price is fair or not. When the indicator has a value greater than 70, it’s a potential sign that the cryptocurrency is becoming overvalued as its price is growing too quickly. As such, corrections can become more likely in this region. On the other hand, the metric being under 30 implies a possible oversold condition is forming in the asset, meaning that a bottom could be probable to form in its price. From the chart, it’s visible that the RSI is at around 40 for Solana currently, suggesting that the asset is slightly leaning towards being undervalued. Interestingly, back in 2021, this same RSI level led to a big bullish breakout for the cryptocurrency. Given that the coin’s price has shown a similar trajectory as back then, and its RSI has also been pretty much the same, it’s possible that another surge might start for Solana from here. It now remains to be seen if past pattern will repeat for the asset or if it will follow a new path entirely. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Extreme Greed’ Is Almost Here: Price Bottom Now Close? In some other news, a SOL whale made a massive move on the blockchain just a couple of days ago, according to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert. The move, which involved the transfer of 287,019 SOL (equivalent to over $40.3 million at the time the transaction was executed), travelled from an unknown wallet, likely to be the whale’s personal address, to an exchange: Binance. Thus, given the direction, it’s possible that this humongous holder had made the deposit for selling purposes. Soon after the move had come, the asset’s price had seen a dip towards the $128 mark, suggesting that the whale had played a role or had at least anticipated the drop. Whatever the case be, though, Solana has already made recovery from the drawdown. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $141, down more than 8% over the past week.

Bitcoin bounced higher, but quickly gave back any gains.  The chances of a September rate cut edged just so slightly higher on Tuesday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said elevated inflation is not the only risk faced by the economy.  ""Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,"" said Powell in prepared remarks for his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in front of a Senate committee. In the question and answer session that followed, Powell furthered those thoughts, saying the latest data show ""considerable cooling"" in the labor market and that the Fed is ""very much aware"" of downside risks.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} received the briefest of knee-jerk bounces on the Powell testimony, but quickly gave back any gains and was trading just above $57,000 at press time, modestly higher over the past 24 hours.  A check of traditional markets finds the major U.S. stock indexes roughly flat and the dollar and bond yields slightly higher.  Any hint of dovishness by the Fed chair was balanced out by his continued focus on inflation. ""We do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,"" he told the committee.  According to CME FedWatch, the odds of one or more rate cuts at the Fed's September are now at about 75% – that's up only a hair from 24 hours ago, but up from 50% one month ago.

42407891,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7NqS,1720537510,Move Over Hollywood: Why Gaming Is the New King of Entertainment,"The global entertainment and media industry is expected to hit a market size of approximately $2.9 trillion by 2027, and it’s gaming, not Hollywood, that’s driving this surge. With an expected revenue of $312 billion, gaming is eclipsing the combined might of the music and film sectors. This isn’t just a trend; it’s a seismic shift in how we consume entertainment.  Gaming habits in the U.S. demonstrate substantial engagement across various age groups. A significant portion of Americans regularly play mobile or console games, with many dedicating considerable time to gaming each week. Millennials are particularly active, with some gaming for over 13 hours weekly.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's GameFi Theme Week. Yemel Jardi is a co-founder of Decentraland, and the Executive Director of the Decentraland Foundation. Launched in 2020, Decentraland is a virtual social world powered by the Ethereum blockchain and the first decentralized metaverse.  This phenomenon isn't confined to American shores. Gaming is booming in markets like China, Japan, and South Korea, showing that its appeal is both universal and unstoppable.  Read more: What Hamster Kombat Did: How Telegram Built a Web3 Gaming Juggernaut  But the story doesn’t end there. The gaming industry's influence extends beyond traditional boundaries, creating interdependencies with other forms of media. Younger generations are increasingly inspired to play video games based on TV shows or movies, and many express a desire for video game adaptations of their favorite media properties. This interconnectedness between gaming, traditional media, and social media is opening up new opportunities for audience engagement and monetization, signaling that the future of entertainment is not just watching or listening, but also about interactive, immersive, and social experiences that gaming uniquely provides. Traditional media needs to catch up, or risk being left behind.  Evolution of different segments  Mobile gaming as the dominant industry sector accounts for about half of the total revenue within gaming. The accessibility of smartphones and the success of free-to-play models with in-app purchases have made mobile gaming immensely popular. Mobile games like Roblox target younger audiences, with 86% of Gen Z globally engaging in mobile gaming, shaping the future generations of consumers.  Blockchain promises a new wave of high-quality games using true ownership of in-game assets and greater interoperability between games.  PC and console gaming continues to be the platforms of choice for high-performance and exclusive titles, together accounting for the other 50% of the industry. These segments thrive on their ability to deliver immersive, graphically rich experiences. Advances in AI are enhancing GPU capabilities, resulting in better graphics and more engaging gameplay. This is the preferred platform for AAA games and onboarding new intellectual properties, ensuring sustained growth in these areas.  VR and AR gaming, though still in their early stages, show immense promise. These platforms are leading the next computing revolution, with major companies competing for dominance. Social VR experiences, such as VRChat with its 20,000 daily active users, highlight the potential of these technologies. XR is seen as the next generation of personal computers, with Meta and Apple vying for dominance in a battle resembling the Windows vs. Mac and Android vs. iOS wars.  Distribution fragmentation and blockchain revival  Control of game distribution is crucial, with major brands establishing their own stores to manage game releases. The game store market is becoming more fragmented, with Steam, Google Play, and the App Store holding significant shares, while other big publishers like Xbox, Nintendo, Epic, and EA also have their own stores. Publishers play a vital role in financing and supporting game development. The blockchain industry is making significant inroads into gaming, acquiring titles and studios to integrate the technology. This promises a new wave of high-quality games using true ownership of in-game assets and greater interoperability between games.  Role of AI in the gaming  AI is set to transform the gaming industry by reducing costs and enhancing creativity. Creating a game requires a wide range of skills, including art, writing, animation, and programming. AI can automate many aspects of this process, making development more efficient and cost-effective. The technology powering AI, primarily GPUs, is the same used for rendering games. This alignment has been reflected in NVIDIA's stock price, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. Moreover, as AI takes on more tasks, people will have more free time to engage in gaming, a trend that became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Gaming has emerged as a transformative force in the entertainment industry, redefining how we consume media and interact with digital content. Its influence extends far beyond traditional gameplay, shaping storytelling, community building, and technological innovation. As gaming converges with other forms of media and embraces cutting-edge technologies like AI, VR, and blockchain, it's paving the way for more immersive, interactive, and personalized experiences.  The future of entertainment is intertwined with the advancements and growth within the gaming sector, opening up a future where interactive digital experiences take center stage. To stay relevant in this dynamic environment, the entertainment industry must innovate and integrate with these emerging technologies or be satisfied with increasingly reduced engagement from the generations to come.

42407890,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Nn9,1720537200,TON Blockchain Ecosystem to Get New Layer-2 Network Based on Polygon Tech,"A new project called TON Applications Chain (TAC) is building a layer-2 network for the TON Blockchain ecosystem, known for its affiliation with the popular messaging app Telegram.  The project, which is backed by The Open Platform, an investor focused on the TON blockchain ecosystem, will rely on technology from the Ethereum-focused layer-2 developer Polygon, according to a press release. The team made the announcement on Tuesday at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Brussels, Belgium.  A key feature of the TAC project is that it will be compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, which is akin to the Ethereum blockchain's operating system. Such compatibility is crucial because developers who have built applications under the widespread Ethereum standard could easily port over to the new TAC layer-2 network within the TON ecosystem.  According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, TAC is “designed to enable EVM-based decentralized applications to TON’s ecosystem” while also allowing Ethereum developers to build new programs for Telegram’s users.  The project's arrival could facilitate development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications within the TON ecosystem as well as gaming and decentralized identity solutions, according to the press release.  The new layer-2 network will make use of Polygon’s Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own layer-2 blockchains based off of Polygon’s zero-knowledge technology, as well as Polygon’s AggLayer, their interoperability layer for solving blockchain fragmentation.  “We chose to build on the Polygon ecosystem for its EVM compatibility, seamless availability of liquidity from EVM chains via AggLayer, comprehensive deployment support, and Polygon's EVM expertise,” Pavel Altukhov, founder of TAC, said to CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “The vibrant community surrounding Polygon was also a crucial factor in our decision.”  The news comes as other major blockchain companies have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year, though primarily atop Ethereum.  In August, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain with Optimism’s OP Stack atop Ethereum, kicking off the trend. Since then, protocols like Celo and Worldcoin have shared their plans to launch layer-2 rollups with OP Stack atop Ethereum, and cryptocurrency exchange OKX also released an Ethereum layer-2 in April called “X Layer” with Polygon’s CDK.

42407910,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7XRc,1720535824,"Former FTX Execs Nishad Singh, Gary Wang to Be Sentenced Later This Year","Two former senior FTX executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges and played a role in their boss Sam Bankman-Fried's conviction will be sentenced later this year.  Former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and former Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang will learn their fates on Oct. 30 and Nov. 20, respectively.  Following their pleas shortly after FTX's massive, industry-shaking collapse in late 2022, they testified against Bankman-Fried at his trial, saying they were made aware of wrongdoing at the exchange shortly before it filed for bankruptcy. Another former FTX executive, Ryan Salame, was recently sentenced to 7.5 years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges. Salame did not testify against Bankman-Fried.  Another executive, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, pleaded guilty alongside Wang, but a sentencing date has not yet been scheduled. Ellison pleaded guilty to seven criminal charges – two counts of wire fraud and five conspiracy charges – and Wang pleaded guilty to four – one count of wire fraud and three conspiracy charges.  In February 2023, Singh pleaded guilty to six criminal charges including fraud and conspiracy. During Bankman-Fried's October 2023 trial, he said he discovered that there was an $8 billion hole in FTX's finances around September 2022, but still signed off on transactions involving money that'd been taken from customers.  ""I learned that there was a hole that was enormous and that it had been spent and lost by Alameda, and I knew that it was $8 billion in size. So the last $8 billion of spend had necessarily come from customers. That spend included things like real estate investments, VC investments, campaign donations, and speculative events in trading,"" he said.  Singh also testified that he programmed systems in 2019 to rout FTX customer deposits to Alameda bank accounts. In addition, he built out systems that gave Alameda ""special privileges"" that other FTX customers didn't have, including the ""allow negative"" feature that enabled Alameda to withdraw funds in excess of its balance and collateral.  Read more: Former Top FTX Executive Testifies He Knew $8B of Customer Money Was Missing  Wang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and wire fraud. During Bankman-Fried's trial, Wang said he had helped develop parts of FTX's website. His most damaging admission may have been identifying a piece of code designed to reflect FTX's ""public insurance fund,"" the public-facing figure meant to reassure investors that FTX had a reserve in case of mass withdrawals or other issues.  This figure was essentially made up, and had nothing to do with what was actually in the insurance fund, Wang testified.  He told prosecutors that he cooperated with the FBI ""because it seemed like the right thing to do"" and to stay out of prison.

30698545,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628603,1720533615,"If History Repeats, Bitcoin Price Could Crash 33% Again: Here’s Why","The Bitcoin price is already down more than -22% since the mid-March high over $73,000. While BTC is currently stabilizing above $57,000 following the recent price crash, there could be even more downside ahead if history repeats, according to Jacob Canfield, a trading mentor at the Trading Mastery. Canfield’s latest analysis points to a potential further decline in the Bitcoin price, potentially reaching lows not seen since the beginning of the year. Why Bitcoin Price Could Crash Another 33% Canfield’s analysis on TradingView hinges on historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s pricing trends. “Historically, Bitcoin loves to retest the yearly open levels,” Canfield notes. According to him, these retests can either confirm bearish or bullish trends but are a consistent feature in Bitcoin’s market behavior. Since 2017, each year’s opening price has been retested within the year, with the notable exceptions of 2023 and 2024 (thus far). Related Reading: Massive Mt. Gox Bitcoin Shift Unlikely To Disrupt Prices, Says CryptoQuant CEO “Since 2017, the yearly open has been retested every year except 2023 and 2024,” Canfield remarked. For instance, the bearish retest of the 2018 opening BTC price occurred right before the COVID-19 pandemic crash, and similar patterns were observed in subsequent years. “Even the 2019 yearly open at $3,850 was retested during the 2020 Covid Crash,” the crypto analyst added. Moreover, the 2020 yearly open was retested within the first 3 months of 2020. The 2021 opening price was also retested and marked the lowest point before a significant rally that led to a peak of $69,000, just before the collapse of FTX. “The 2022 Yearly open was a bearish retest similar to 2018 before the lows around $16,500. Similar to the 2021 yearly open retest giving us our bottom, this gave us our local top,” Canfield observed. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Undervalued Now? Industry Expert Decodes The Market State Looking ahead, the crypto analyst speculates about the potential bottom for Bitcoin in the coming months. “Here is where it gets interesting. The 2023 and 2024 yearly opens have not been retested yet. The question is, do we form a bottom at the 2024 yearly open before more all time highs or do we capitulate all the way down to the 2023 yearly open at $16,500 like we did in 2019.” Crucial Indicators To Watch The answer may lie in several technical indicators that Canfield considers pivotal. First, Canfield mentions the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This indicator aligns closely with the projected yearly open for 2024, suggesting a higher likelihood of finding support in the $38,000 to $42,000 range. Notably, a price crash this low would mean another -33% for BTC holders. The second crucial indicator is the weekly 200 EMA/MA Ribbon. This indicator is also converging around the 2024 opening price. It reinforces the potential for this level to act as a strong support zone. “This gives us a higher probability that we will form a bottom around that region and the 2023 yearly open may act like the 2017 yearly open and never get retested,” Canfield speculates. Despite the bearish outlook, Canfield’s analysis leaves room for various scenarios, emphasizing the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s market dynamics and the role of historical precedents in forecasting future trends. “Either way, I think this gives us a high likelihood target based on historical precedence for where we may find a local bottom,” he concludes, inviting further discussion and analysis from the community. At press time, BTC traded at $57,479.

42407915,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Xol,1720531858,DePIN 2.0: What the Next Generation of DePINs Is Doing Differently,"DePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) are everywhere. Or, at least they are for those of us reading CoinDesk in July of 2024. As someone who’s been involved in the vertical since its inception back in 2019, I recognize that I might be more of an early adopter, more DePIN-fanatical than most. But as I sat down to write this piece and took a quick mental inventory of the DePINs I contribute to on a daily basis, even I was surprised at the number and variety of projects out there now.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure. Connor Lovely is the DePIN Lead at IoTeX and Host of the Proof of Coverage Podcast. He was previously a consultant at BCG.  For starters, there’s a Cudis ring on my hand that gives me health data and pays me points towards a future airdrop. There are the Helium and XNET WiFi hotspots in my home that provide wireless connectivity for my devices (and others’) and pay me tokens when it is used. Helium Mobile (my sole cellular provider by the way) has an app on my phone that pays me crypto for opt-in sharing of location information that is used to better triangulate data usage and network demand. There’s the Grass browser extension running on my computer that allows AI labs and web scrapers to view the internet through my residential IP and earns me airdrop points. And, finally, there’s the DIMO device in my car that provides me with real-time data on my vehicle, makes this anonymized data available to third-party developers, and (again) pays me tokens.  If you think this list is exhaustive, you’re thinking too small. Today, the DePIN sector is 1300+ projects strong and its growth is accelerating through the bull market. While the proliferation of the DePIN model is exciting, what’s even more interesting to me is how exactly this next generation of DePINs is going about building their networks…and how that differs from their predecessors. Here’s what I’ve been seeing.  The DePINs of this generation are improving upon the last five years of learning and iteration in these ways:  Being demand-led in everything  The most common, yet fair critique of the first DePINs (like Helium’s IoT network) were that they had done a great job building out supply, but didn’t have enough demand. The DePINs of this generation are securing demand as early as possible, in many cases pre-TGE. They’re also building out supply in a more targeted, measured way, allowing demand to dictate where in the country or world they incentivize supply-side buildout.  For example, Spexi is a DePIN for aerial drone imagery. They’ve secured seven figures of demand contracts pre-TGE and have paid out six figures in cash to drone operators, who are salivating at the simple, gamified opportunity to earn money from their existing drone assets.  Lowering contributors' barrier to entry  This cycle, we’ve seen the rise of DePINs that utilize generic, not custom-built hardware, that already exists for their supply-side. Another way to speed supply-side growth is to tap into everyday activities people are already doing. An example of both of these strategies is Natix, which uses smartphones in cars as dashcams for street-level imagery. The company is looking to capitalize on a behavior (driving) that is already occurring day to day, rather than trying to motivate net new behaviors with tokens (a much more “expensive” proposition from a token incentive standpoint). The example here for contrast would be a wireless DePIN like Helium looking to incentivize contributors to climb a roof and install a CBRS radio. That’s a net new behavior.  Read more: Daniel Andrade - DePIN Is the Sharing Economy 2.0  Leaning into the speculation  Incentives make the world go round. DePIN has always known that, but this cycle we’ve seen things be amped up a notch. The advent of points as a mechanism to account for contributor contributions pre-TGE has been wildly successful and gives the DePINs of this generation more flexibility and time to gather data before finalizing their tokenomics. Referral programs where a contributor might receive a fixed amount of points or tokens, or even a % in perpetuity of their referral’s points or tokens, have been a game-changer and driven viral supply-side growth. Grass is the best example of a successful points program driven by referral incentives.  Staying centralized, longer  No project, idea, or concept will get off the ground without a dedicated person or group of people making quick decisions, iterating and pushing things forward. Ideas are most fragile (yet also most nimble) at their earliest stages. This cycle, we all want to see DePINs that quickly find product-market fit (PMF), scale supply and demand effectively and generate revenue on-chain; we could care less about decentralization until there are some early signs of PMF. It’s only worth decentralizing something that is working.  Take 3DOS, a DePIN for manufacturing. The founder created a popular 3D printer operating system that allowed the devices to be networked together and have their print jobs be automated and controlled remotely. He saw great uptake in the Web2 world, counting NASA, Google, and 40% of the universities in the U.S. as clients. He sees 3D printers as a shared resource and is creating a global manufacturing network where businesses can submit a job, find printers in the area closest to the end customer (reduce shipping cost and time), and then contract with a printer owner or shop to fulfill the contract. 3D printer owners can monetize their existing assets, businesses can save money and time on printed goods, and everyone is better off.  I mention 3DOS because it’s an exciting use case, but also because it’s very early on in its life cycle and John Dogru (the founder) is exerting complete, centralized control over the idea, the software, the network, the demand-side, etc., as he should. Without him taking the reins at this early stage, nothing would get done and there is not much worth decentralizing anyways!  DePIN (as an industry) is still fairly nascent but has had enough time to learn lessons from its first generation and improve upon them. This generation’s DePINs are prioritizing demand at the earliest stages, scaling their supply-sides even faster by lowering barriers to entry and leaning into speculation, and staying centralized longer to ship at a faster pace.  New DePINs are launching at an astonishing rate and there will be much more iteration and learning to come. DePIN remains one of the most impactful ideas to come out of the crypto industry and a serious force for good in the real world. I look forward to the success of the DePIN 2.0 cohort and towards writing an update to this piece on the DePIN 3.0 cohort in just a few short years!

42407913,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7XYE,1720530000,Why Crypto Donations Are Surging in 2024,"In 2021, the nonprofit sector quietly became the most crypto-friendly arena in the world. Millions of dollars were being donated, and thousands of nonprofits had active initiatives to partner with crypto philanthropists.  When crypto markets tanked in 2022, the nonprofit sector started thinking the crypto philanthropy party was over. After a record-setting 2021 in which my organization, The Giving Block, facilitated $69 million in crypto donations, crypto-based charitable giving slowed down as FTX collapsed.  Pat Duffy is a co-founder of The Giving Block, a platform that helps investors donate cryptocurrency to charities, educational institutions and faith-based nonprofits. The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Today, market caps are climbing again and, in turn, crypto donations are pouring in. We’ve spent the last few months helping crypto investors give tens of millions of dollars to charities, faith-based organizations and Universities, from ocean conservation charities to refugee aid organizations.  If anyone thinks that this is simply business as usual, you’re sorely mistaken. Crypto philanthropy is back in a big way. And what makes this surge unique is the diversity of giving modalities, driven by much more than the price of BTC, ETH and so on. The current Web3 charitable-giving trends were built during the last bull cycle, battle-tested, and optimized through the bear market, and are now reaching maturity as the market approaches a period expected to shatter previous all time highs.  Here are some of the under-discussed ways that Web3 and the crypto community are changing the nonprofit world for the better.  Memecoin Fundraising  When we launched The Giving Block six years ago, we knew that Bitcoin and Ethereum donors were here to stay. The generosity of meme coin holders, however, has surprised us.  In the last cycle, we thought the rise of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu donors would be a fad, with DOGE becoming the most donated cryptocurrency of the $30 million Team Seas campaign led by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober. But memecoins remain a genuinely valuable source of charitable funding today. This time around, some new memecoins have burst onto the charitable giving scene to make a difference.  The Baby Doge team has donated over $500,000 to support animal shelters and other animal welfare programs around the world. Baby Doge is even launching an API to enable crypto donations easily from their community, as they appear to be making charitable giving a part of their DNA. They’ve even set a Guinness World Record for most pet food donated in 24 hours.  Meanwhile, BONK was one of the most donated cryptocurrencies when the price took off earlier this year, as their community immediately turned gains into impact. The BONK community is in the process of developing an on-chain program and decentralized application that allow users to donate crypto to animal-focused charities working with The Giving Block. The application handles the donation process, burns a small percentage of BONK tokens, and matches donations. We’re hyped that a community that’s up 8,000% on their investment in the past twelve months has been inspired to make a long-term commitment to charitable giving.  Quadratic Funding  We’ve always said that crypto philanthropy is a two-way street. Meme coin projects demonstrate how crypto communities grow by funding social causes, creating a mutually beneficial cycle of growing awareness for the token and the cause they support. But these relationships don’t exist in a vacuum. Some philanthropic strategies coming from Web3 have a real opportunity to change how legacy nonprofits fundraise systemically, as some organizations have begun to embrace quadratic funding.  It’s well known that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin co-devised quadratic funding, which has been called a “mathematically optimal way to fund public goods in a democratic community.” Over time, it’s become one of Web3’s favorite methods of funding projects of all kinds.  In December 2023, the Gitcoin community’s quadratic funding round garnered 2,971 donations from 1,058 donors to fund six projects that will advance the American Cancer Society’s lifesaving work.  For nonprofits seeking ways to engage new communities of donors, quadratic funding presents a path forward, a way to break the mold with traditional fundraising methods and embrace innovation.  In a similar vein, more and more humanitarian organizations have piloted delivering aid via stablecoins, from UNHCR to Mercy Corps Ventures. With each test, the impact sector is getting closer to embracing more of crypto and blockchain’s most promising use cases.  NFT and Influencer Fundraising  We’re also seeing the legacy of NFT fundraising continue. During the last bull market, innovative projects like Women and Weapons, which donated six figures to Malala Fund, which supports girls' education, set the stage for a culture of charitable giving. We even saw major charities and global brands collaborate on NFT initiatives, as was the case when brewery Stella Artois tapped Gary Vaynerchuk’s Vayner3 to launch an NFT drop to support Water.org, a group that promotes clean water and sanitation initiatives  Today, bitcoin-based ordinals projects such as NodeMonkes are expanding the borders of NFT charitable giving. Creators including Jack Butcher have empowered collectors to understand the positive impact they make with each NFT purchase.  We have also seen an increase in Web3 influencers asking their communities to donate crypto for good. One example is the Crypto Twitter personality known as Leap, who raised over $100,000 in Ethereum and Solana donations for cancer care and research.  Bottom Line  Billions of dollars have been donated to nonprofits using cryptocurrency, and tens of billions of dollars will be given as the market matures and donors take advantage of the tax breaks it offers. As a result, crypto fundraising has become a major focus in the nonprofit sector, and as long as crypto continues to grow as a major asset class, nonprofits will continue to bet on crypto donors as a pillar of their strategies for thriving through the Great Wealth Transfer from elder generations to Millenials and Zoomers.  Some nonprofits will find the kaleidoscopic diversity of the crypto donor community daunting. Despite the fact that the majority of the Forbes Top 100 nonprofits are fundraising crypto today, many small and mid-sized nonprofits are not even equipped to accept major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, let alone navigate topics like NFTs and meme coins.  Forward-thinking philanthropists across the Web3 ecosystem will continue to provide incredible opportunities for the nonprofits at the cutting edge. These efforts will set the stage for some of the most exciting crypto philanthropy programs in the years to come. But I’m equally excited about the crypto philanthropists who are slowing down to meet charities where there are.  With more nonprofits accepting crypto than ever, the crypto investors who take the time to educate their favorite organizations about Web3 basics will play one of the biggest roles in driving continued adoption in this sector.  There are more nonprofits fundraising crypto today than ever before, but that’s only because of the people in the Web3 community who continue to step up and make the donations and opportunities that attract them to our sector.  Today’s trifecta of nonprofit adoption, Web3 innovation, and bull market conditions has primed us for crypto philanthropy’s most exciting chapter yet. And if we continue to be innovative in the philanthropic projects, patient with our philanthropic partners and generous with our philanthropic contributions, crypto will remain one of the fastest growing donation methods in the nonprofit sector.",POSITIVE,ETH | BONK,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | BONK,Pat Duffy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/07/09/why-crypto-donations-are-surging-in-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70753bf4ddc55bed230a13ff9ad08ffafbf8f3bf-1920x1442.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means that select developers can apply to build, test, and give feedback to Tools For Humanity, the developer firm behind Worldcoin, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  World Chain has tapped Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology, to build out its own network. OP Stack has become a popular choice for creating layer-2 chains, and was used by Coinbase to build its ‘Base’ network.  “I think they're a visionary, the team behind it, they have been at this for a while,” said Remco Bloemen, the head of blockchain at the Worldcoin Foundation, the non-profit organization supporting Worldcoin, in an interview with CoinDesk.  World Chain is expected to open to users later this summer, according to earlier reporting from CoinDesk. Bloemen wouldn’t give an exact timeline for when mainnet will go live, but said they aren’t planning to open a testnet for users.  “This is going to evolve into mainnet at some point. But it's just an opportunity for people to test their infrastructure and be ready for when this turns into mainnet,” Bloemen told CoinDesk  In addition, the World Chain project would operate Reth, a new Ethereum client software that was developed by venture capital firm Paradigm, in shadow mode, and Tools for Humanity plans to commit engineering resources to have Reth ready for mainnet.  Reth is a new client for the Ethereum network, developed by Paradigm, with an emphasis on being “user-friendly, modular, fast, and efficient,” according to Paradigm’s website. While Reth is typically used for the Ethereum network, Paradigm shared that it will accommodate a broad user base including layer-2 networks like Optimism.

The government has already sold millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, putting immense pressure on the pioneer cryptocurrency amidst broader market volatility. German Government Initiates Massive BTC Sell-Off Bitcoin’s consistent price decline has been driven by multiple factors including outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, unfavorable market conditions and Mt Gox’s BTC redistribution plans. Lately, the cryptocurrency’s price has been further pressured by the substantial BTC sell-offs executed by the German government. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins For weeks, Germany has sold thousands of Bitcoin worth hundreds of millions of dollars. On June 25, blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence reported that the government sold 900 BTC worth about $52 million. They moved 400 BTC to Coinbase and Kraken and transferred the rest to an unidentified address. Additionally, last week the German government executed another major Bitcoin sell-off, transferring a whopping 3,000 BTC valued roughly at $172 million to exchanges. The government moved 1,300 BTC to Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase and sold the rest to an unknown wallet address. The most recent BTC transaction was on Monday, June 8, when the German police sold an additional 2,738.7 BTC worth approximately $155.3 million. Arkham Intelligence revealed that the Bitcoin was likely sold to crypto exchanges or market makers, including Kraken, Cumberland, 139Po, and address bc1qu. As of writing, the German government still holds a staggering amount of Bitcoin. Arkham’s data has revealed that the government’s holdings amount to 26,053 BTC valued at approximately $1.49 billion. Despite the BTC’s recent crash, the German government Bitcoin continues to sell their BTC holdings at a rapid pace. Joanna Cotar, a member of the German Bundestag, the National parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, has shown her displeasure with the government’s decision to sell off their BTC holdings. Cotar disclosed that the government should be strategically holding BTC and not selling them off. She disclosed that their recent BTC sell-offs were counterproductive and not sensible, urging the government to utilize their BTC as a strategic reserve currency. Bitcoin Price Update After Crash Over the past week, Bitcoin’s price fell by a substantial 8.71% after crashing by 17.10% in the past month. This decline has been attributed to unabating selling pressures and recent bearish trends in the crypto market.

42407948,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Y1z,1720526801,AI Tokens Outperform CoinDesk 20 Index Tuesday Despite Clouds Forming Over Industry,"AI tokens outperformed the broader market early Tuesday.  This comes despite clouds forming over the industry and growing talk of a bubble.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens outperformed the CoinDesk 20 Tuesday, a broad measure of the performance of the largest digital assets on the market, despite bearish reports from major financial firms that argue AI's growth potential is constrained.  CoinGecko data shows that the AI token category was up 4.5% Tuesday, while the CoinDesk 20 was up just under 1.5%.  Major AI tokens include NEAR {{NEAR}}, Internet Computer {{ICP}}, Render {{RNDR} and SingularityNet {{AGIX}}.  This market move comes after Goldman Sachs released a report that criticized generative AI for limited productivity benefits, uncertain returns, and high power demands, questioning its economic viability.  In particular, Goldman's research highlights the massive jump in power demand that AI will require. They estimate that by 2030, power demand from data centers will jump from 3% to 8% of the total share of the grid.  ""The US has unfortunately lost the ability to build large infrastructure projects—this is a task better suited for 1930s America, not 2030s America,"" the report quotes Brian Janous, a former Vice President of Energy at Microsoft, as saying. ""So, that leaves me a bit pessimistic,"" he continued.  Janus argues that utilities and policymakers are investing in transmission infrastructure to adapt to new energy sources, but key to their ability to pull this off is a massive overhaul of the grid while keeping consumer rates flat – or the politics around the issue will sour.  ""On balance, I’m optimistic that America can rise to meet the challenge, though the next decade will likely prove painful as the demand for power outpaces the available supply,"" he concluded.  Meanwhile, another report, this time from Sequoia argues that there's still a significant revenue gap in the sector, coming in at $600 billion.  The report's author emphasizes that AI will create a ""huge amount of economic value,"" but first, we need to tread through the speculative frenzy.  ""Those who remain level-headed through this moment have the chance to build extremely important companies,"" the author, David Cahn, writes. ""But we need to make sure not to believe in the delusion that has now spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world.""  AI tokens certainly have the potential to be some of these extremely important companies. Nvidia has recognized this, inviting NEAR's founder Illia Polosukhin on-stage at its GTC Conference earlier this year for a fireside chat with Jensen Huang. NEAR revolutionized natural language processing with its research on transformers, the underlying architecture behind LLMs.  But crypto has also been known for its speculative frenzy.

42407919,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Y5I,1720526460,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Regains $57K Following $300M of ETF Inflows,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin found some stability above $57,000 following Monday's slide to $55,000 as a German government entity received over $200 million worth of the asset back from various exchanges late in the U.S. day, helping revive sentiment. BTC was trading around $57,400 during the European morning, an increase of 1% in the last 24 hours, having fallen to $55,000 on Monday after a wallet address belonging to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) sent over $900 million to various other addresses, spooking traders. In the past 12 hours, the entity received refunds from Kraken, Coinbase and Bitstamp, Arkham data shows, indicating that while the assets were sent to these exchanges, they ultimately did not hit the market.  Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded nearly $300 million in net inflows on Monday, the most since early June, when the cryptocurrency traded over $70,000. BlackRock’s IBIT led buying activity with nearly $180 million in net inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC. Grayscale’s GBTC – infamous for its outflows – recorded over $25 million in purchases. Some investors may be viewing the drop in the bitcoin price as a buying opportunity, investment firm CoinShares said in a report on Monday. Traders largely expect July to be a generally bullish month for the crypto market as it has seen a medium return of 9% historically, with the trend expected to continue.  Data tracked by Coinwarz shows Bitcoin’s mining difficulty slumped from 83.6 TH/s to 79.50 TH/s on June 5, a level last seen in March, a month before the halving. That’s one of the largest difficulty drops since crypto exchange FTX's collapse, which sent bitcoin prices spiraling down more than 10% in a week, CryptoQuant noted. Downward adjustments mean a proportional decrease in the network’s hashing power. A drop can favor smaller miners and spell profits for farms that were closed due to being unable to keep up with costs. Miners were a major source of bitcoin selling pressure in June with over $1 billion worth of BTC sold over two weeks as prices ranged between $65,000 and $70,000.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily net inflow of BTC into wallets tied to centralized exchanges.  On Friday, exchanges witnessed a net outflow of over 68,000 BTC, the highest since late 2022.  Outflows are taken to represent investor bias for long-term holding strategy.

42407905,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7X7m,1720526400,Crypto Wallet Provider Exodus Aims to Solve Web3's User-Friendly Issue With 'Passkeys Wallet',"Exodus is rolling out a new ""Passkeys Wallet"" to make the Web3 experience smoother for new users.  Developers will have additional incentives to integrate the wallet into their applications, the company said.  Passkeys Wallet will support various blockchains, including Bitcoin and Solana.  Crypto wallet provider Exodus is starting a new product that is looking to make the user experience (UX) of Web3 as easy as possible for newcomers to the sector.  The ""Passkeys Wallet"" will enable new users to create a wallet to explore various decentralized apps (dapps) without creating a new wallet or leaving the application. ""With this Passkeys Wallet, with one click of your finger, you can create an encrypted, embedded wallet that is self-custodial,"" David Reising, head of product for Exodus, told CoinDesk in an interview.  One of the main frictions for the mass adoption of crypto has been the complex user experience. Multiple assets in different blockchains need of separate wallets just to interact with different dapps, remembering 12-word seed phrases and the steep learning curve to navigating Web3 have acted as deterrents for many Web2 users looking to onboard into crypto. To bank the unbanked, crypto needs to streamline the UX like the Web2 apps such as Instagram or Facebook. Exodus is looking to do precisely that for newcomers to the industry.  ""If I'm a user, I don't need to sign up, there's no email verification, I don't need to worry about importing, or even really managing 12-word mnemonic phrase [seed phrase]. It takes so much of that complexity out,"" Reising said. Additionally, Exodus has worked with some payment processing partners to help new users fund their Passkeys Wallet easily, he added.  Another feature of the new product is that it will support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Bitcoin {{BTC}}, and Solana {{SOL}} among others, which will help users access multiple blockchain ecosystems without having to leave dapps they want to interact with, the company said in an email statement, noting that it will be a ""distinguishing feature amongst competitors.""  Passkeys Wallet, however, isn't a magical solution that will do everything for users; developers will still need to adopt it in their applications. On that front, Exodus says it's making it easy for developers to integrate the wallet with ""just a few lines of code,"" and it has Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology for security. Reising said Exodus would also partner with the developers and share revenue on any on-chain transactions.  The Class A shares of Exodus Wallet trade on an OTC exchange under the ticker EXOD. The company's efforts to uplist onto NYSE American, the New York Stock Exchange’s sibling market, were postponed in the 11th hour after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that agnecy staff was still reviewing Exodus' registration statement.

30692005,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628530,1720522807,Can Solana Hit $160? SOL’s Resilience Sparks Rally Optimism,"Currently, the price of Solana has been showing resilience amid market volatility. This recent performance of SOL has raised rally optimism among market participants as to whether the digital asset’s price could potentially reach the $160 mark in the upcoming days. Particularly, this article aims to provide technical insight on recent price performance and technical indicators that suggest the potential for the crypto asset to hit $160 focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart. At the time of writing, SOL’s price was up by over 7%, trading at about $143, with a market capitalization of more than $66 billion and a trading volume of more than $3.5 billion. In the last 24 hours, SOL’s market capitalization and trading volume have increased by 7.81% and 55.69% respectively. Technical Insights On SOL’s Recent Price Actions Presently, the price of SOL on the 4-hour chart with bullish momentum is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The digital asset has been on an upward spiral since after failing to retest its previous low of $121 and given the price movement, there are possibilities that it could still extend its rally. Also, an analytical view of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator shows that the price of Solana may continue its bullishness as the signal line has crossed above the SMA of the indicator and both are attempting a move above 50%. On the 1-day chart, Solana is attempting a bullish move towards the 100-day SMA and the $160 resistance level after it has formed what looks like a double-bottom pattern. With this price formation, the digital asset could skyrocket, challenging previous resistance levels. Finally, on the same 1-day chart, the composite trend oscillator also indicates that SOL could potentially expand its bullish move as the signal line is attempting to cross above the SMA of the indicator and are both trending slightly above the oversold zone. Future Outlooks If Solana Achieves The $160 Mark Given that Solana is currently attempting an upward rally toward the $160 resistance level, if the asset’s price reaches this level and closes above, it will continue to ascend to test the $188 resistance level. It may probably move on to test the $205 resistance level and other higher levels if the $188 level is breached. However, if the price reaches $160 and witnesses a rejection, it will start to drop again toward the $118 support level. Should it break below this support level, it will continue to descend to test the $99 support level. Furthermore, the digital asset may witness a steeper decline to test the $79 level and other levels on the chart if it breaks below the $99 support level.

The GameFi sector used inflationary emissions of a native token to generate earnings, whereas WOOFi distributes revenue based on a share of fees on the platform.  WOOFi, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) and sister to crypto exchange WOO X, is applying novel elements from the world of role-playing games (RPG) to decentralized finance (DeFi), using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to boost yields generated by customers staking tokens on the platform.  So-called “Boosters” – something like a magic power potion or weapon in an RPG – can be acquired by performing challenges such as cross-chain swaps, depositing into earn vaults or trading on WOOFi Pro and then used to enhance the yield from WOO tokens, which are staked to earn a share of the DEX’s fees.  The world of DeFi, a hotbed of innovation several years ago, could probably use some fresh ideas. The WOO ecosystem, which is also known for pushing things like index-linked meme coin perps on the centralized WOO X platform, is appealing to an audience familiar with gaming and exploring the concept of utility NFTs, which have a function beyond being merely collectible.  Within the GameFi vertical, the likes of DeFi Kingdoms have been working along similar lines. But prior experimentation within the sector was largely by inflationary emissions of some native token or other, whereas “the WOOFi Boosters release is tied to value accrual generated by actions on the protocol,” said Ben Yorke, VP of WOO Ecosystem.  “Over the last year, we've distributed around $5 million in USDC to people who are staking on our protocol,” Yorke said in an interview. “These new boosters will dictate how much of this future revenue share is distributed, so it's actually tied to some real value.”",POSITIVE,WOO,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | WOO,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/09/decentralized-crypto-exchange-woofi-uses-gaming-style-nfts-to-boost-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7614db6cfbfe9ca78bf559f58e5d43a349930519-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407908,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7XOJ,1720522800,Blockchain Startup Rome Raises $9M to Serve Ethereum Layer-2s Through Solana,"Rome, a crypto startup project aiming to use Solana as an auxiliary network to provide services to layer-2 blockchains built atop Ethereum, emerged from stealth and announced it has raised $9 million of funding from top-tier investors.  The financing was provided by Hack VC, P2 Ventures, HashKey, Portal Ventures, Bankless Ventures, Robot VC, LBank, Anagram, TRGC, Perridon Ventures, as well as notable angels including Anatoly Yakovenko, Nick White, Santiago Santos, Comfy Capital, Austin Federa, Jason Yanowitz, according to a press release shared first with CoinDesk.  Rome, founded by Anil Kumar and Sattvik Kansal, aims to set up Solana as the network underpinning shared sequencers as well as data availability (DA), according to the release.  A sequencer is the component of a layer-2 blockchain that batches up transactions and sends them to the base Ethereum blockchain to be settled, and some experts say these sequencers need to be decentralized to eliminate what can be single points of failure. A DA project is designed to store the reams of transactional data generated by Ethereum layer-2s, and to do so at a lower cost than what it takes to put the data onto the main Ethereum chain.  ""The main thing is, a shared sequencer needs to be its own chain, and it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort to do that, so we were looking for what chain we should use,"" Kumar said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""If we look at Solana as a state machine, it is the best state chain, in comparison to Bitcoin, Cosmos, Ethereum.""  The project also aims to allow ""atomic transactions"" between Ethereum layer-2 networks, Kumar said. This is where multiple legs of a transaction are made on different blockchains. If any part of the transaction fails, none of it goes through, and the user is only out the cost of a Solana transaction, which is typically very low, he said.  Rome joins the fray with other crypto projects that are working to develop shared sequencers or DA – part of the broader trend of ""modular"" blockchains where certain functions previously handled exclusively by the main Ethereum chain are unbundled and handled instead by alternative projects.  Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 project, runs a decentralized sequencer, and Espresso Systems is building what it describes as an ""L2 sequencing marketplace.""  Last month, NEAR Foundation, which supports the alternative layer-1 blockchain NEAR Protocol, spun out a project with $13 million in funding called Nuffle Labs that aims to provide DA.  Another project, Avail is using its own network for DA, and disclosed in April that there are plans for it to be integrated as an option into five Ethereum layer-2s including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, StarkWare and zkSync.  Rome says a closed network will be open to developers starting this month, with plans for a test network at the end of 2024 and a main network launch in mid-2025.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | SPONSORED | NEAR,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/09/blockchain-startup-rome-raises-9m-to-serve-ethereum-layer-2s-through-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b16360e8ee13bd3ad35d2cc202ab3444440869b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox announced creditor repayments.  Slippage surged across centralized exchanges, signaling poor liquidity as prices fell.  Bitcoin cash {{BCH}}, a cryptocurrency created by a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain in 2017, fell 20% last week, its biggest slide since April, according to data on TradingView and CoinDesk.  The sell-off happened as defunct exchange Mt. Gox said it would begin paying back creditors the roughly $9 billion worth of tokens taken in a 2014 hack. That includes $73 million worth of BCH, equating to 20% of the token's daily trading volume.  The resulting panic selling by BCH holders anticipating potential mass liquidations by the Mt. Gox creditors was amplified by poor liquidity, or order-book depth, across centralized exchanges, according to Paris-based Kaiko. In a market with poor liquidity, traders find it hard to execute large orders at stable prices, and a single large buy or sell order can disproportionately influence the asset's price, leading to a volatility explosion.  ""Looking at BCH price slippage for a simulated $100k sell order, it reached its highest level in over a month on most exchanges, indicating worsening liquidity due to insufficient order book depth for large market orders,"" Kaiko said in a newsletter published Monday.  Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. A spike in slippage is representative of poor market liquidity and/or high volatility.  According to Kaiko, on July 5, the day Mt. Gox announced reimbursements, slippage in BCH markets listed on Bybit rose to 2.8% from 0.2% and on Itbit to 3.5% from 0.3%.  Poor liquidity has been a problem, particularly for alternative cryptocurrencies – that's everything other than BTC – since the FTX exchange and its sister concern, Alameda Research, went bankrupt in November 2022. Alameda was one of the biggest market makers, providing billions in liquidity in altcoins.  The poor liquidity ""coincided with strong selling pressure related to the Mt. Gox repayments event, with the highest slippage increase observed on Itbit and Bybit,"" Kaiko said.  According to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, market makers have completely disappeared in a situation analogous to the 2009-10 credit markets.  ""The fallout of Alameda/FTX in 2022 is still rippling through the market as market makers have exited the business, liquidity has dried up, and there are no intermediaries to help smooth out trading. And since liquid funds are not getting inflows, and retail has moved back to memecoins and equities, if someone has to sell a token, it just gets hammered.,"" Dorman explained in a LinkedIn post.",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/09/bitcoin-cashs-mt-gox-led-sell-off-is-amplified-by-poor-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/738754f19c4aa6f718a912b45bca43e47c0a20fa-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30688927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628504,1720517704,Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $0.07 Amid Triangle Breakdown,"Crypto analyst @Ripple_Effect11 predicts an imminent XRP price crash in a new technical analysis shared via X. His prediction is underpinned by a bearish breakout from a major triangle pattern that has been forming since the $3.84 all-time high on January 4, 2018. The analysis paints a dark picture for XRP in the coming months, with a potential drop to as low as $0.07, contingent on certain technical events. Why The XRP Price Could Crash To $0.07 Elliott Wave Theory, which forms the basis of @Ripple_Effect11’s analysis, is a form of technical analysis that predicts future price movements by identifying recurring wave patterns linked to investor psychology. The theory posits that market movements primarily unfold in five ‘impulse’ waves followed by three ‘corrective’ waves. In the case of XRP, the analyst identifies that the cryptocurrency has been in a corrective phase since its peak in 2018, marked by an A-B-C correction pattern. Wave A saw a sharp decline as low as $0.105 in March 2020. Wave B experienced a partial retracement upwards to $1.96 in April 2021. Wave C, where XRP is currently, is typically the final leg and involves another downward move, often completing the corrective phase. Related Reading: XRP Holds Bullish 2014-2017 Pattern Unless This Happens: Analyst The analysis suggests that within this final Wave C, XRP is undergoing its sub-waves. It’s currently in the third wave which traditionally is significant in terms of the depth and length of the price movement. Notably, the chart also shows a large triangle formation which has encapsulated the price action of XRP over several years. A triangle in technical analysis often represents a period of consolidation before the price breaks out decisively in one direction. According to @Ripple_Effect11, last week’s close below $0.42 confirmed a bearish breakout from this pattern and further supports the theory of a massive price crash. “No one is talking about this MASSIVE XRP triangle breakdown. A weekly close below $0.42 is extremely bearish,” he stated. Related Reading: Buy The Dip? XRP Whales Doing Exactly That – Is A Price Rally Next? The analyst’s first target is at $0.33 where minor psychological support may exist. A second, more significant target at $0.18, which could represent a firmer historical support zone. The third target ranges between $0.12 and $0.14, possibly acting as interim support before more substantial selling. This price represents the end of the third wave. Amidst the fourth wave, the crypto analyst predicts that the XRP price could rebound above $0.18 before the final wave 5 pushes XRP even further down. The final target is between $0.07 and $0.08, translating into a more than 80% crash from the current price level. These targets are corroborated by technical indicators on the chart. The MACD is trending below its signal line, highlighting bearish momentum. The RSI is near 45, suggesting a lack of strong buying pressure and potential for further decline. Ripple Ruling Could Start The Trend Reversal Adding context to the technical analysis is the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which the analyst notes is expected to conclude by July 2026. The outcome of the legal battle is anticipated to have significant implications for the XRP price. “Smart money sees buy targets 3 and 4 as attractive before the big utility pump from 2026 to 2030. Ripple Vs SEC started in 2020. XRP was classified as NOT a security in 2023. Ripple wins the case and XRP pumps hard 2026. Will you be patient?,” the crypto analyst concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $0.43448.

42407914,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Xi9,1720517353,"Drop in Bitcoin Mining Difficulty 'Comparable to FTX Collapse,' CryptoQuant Says","Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped significantly by 7.8% on June 5, 2024, reaching levels not seen since before the halving event in April. This marks the largest difficulty drop since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022.  One analyst said miners' daily revenues have plummeted from $78 million pre-halving to $26 million currently.  This downward adjustment in mining difficulty can benefit smaller miners and potentially lead to profits for mining farms.  One of the most important participants in the Bitcoin network may have a reason to rejoice in the coming weeks as power requirements to mine blocks fell 7.8% over the weekend.  Data tracked by Coinwarz shows Bitcoin’s mining difficulty slumped from 83.6 terahash per second (TH/s) to 79.50 TH/s on June 5, reaching levels previously seen in March, a month before the halving event in April. A terahash measures how many hashes – or a digital guess for a calculation – per second a mining device, pool, or network can generate.  Mining difficulty is adjusted every two weeks and can either surge upwards or pare back. This is because of Bitcoin’s inherent structure, which keeps miners in check by checking the speed of block generation, i.e., whether they are mining too fast or too slow.  That’s one of the largest difficulty drop since crypto exchange FTX collapsed in 2022, which sent bitcoin prices spiraling down more than 10% in a week, analysts at crypto data provider CryptoQuant noted.  ""Network hashrate has experienced a 7.8% drawdown, which is comparable to post FTX collapse on December 2022,"" CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Miners’ profitability has been hit as the daily revenues fell from $78 million pre-halving to $26 million currently.”  “Mining difficulty has been declining since early May following lower network hashrate as some miners turned off their equipment in response to lower profitability,” Moreno added.  Downward adjustments mean a proportional decrease in the network’s hashing power — or the amount of available power on the Bitcoin network. A drop can favor smaller miners and spell profits for farms that were closed due to being unable to keep up with costs.  Miners are entities that utilize extensive computing power to solve sophisticated encryptions and produce blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each block rewards miners 6.25 BTC, which they typically sell to fund or expand operations.  Miners were a major source of bitcoin selling pressure in June with over $1 billion worth of BTC sold over two weeks as prices ranged between the $65,000 and $70,000 levels. Selling pressure from defunct Mt. Gox and a German government entity has since roiled markets further – with BTC dropping briefly to as low as $53,500 last week.  CoinDesk previously reported that Bitcoin hashrate and difficulty might fall during the North American summer months as miners curtail some of their operations. The lower competition may provide some reprieve to miners who are already facing a profit squeeze due to the halving event.  Meanwhile, at current prices, only a few of the most popular mining machines remain profitable for users, creating a scenario that could mark a “local bottom” for BTC.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/09/drop-in-bitcoin-mining-difficulty-comparable-to-ftx-collapse-cryptoquant-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b5686ecbc02372f344a8692053ee3d3926c02fe-1420x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin and Ethereum slumped 10% for the month vs. the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, up 4% and 6%, respectively. In June, the Ethereum community solidified plans for its next major upgrade, Pectra. NEAR Protocol’s token investors suffered large losses this month, erasing much of the coin’s YTD outperformance. Digital assets dropped as trading volumes and volatility hit yearly lows. Despite weak prices, daily active addresses on Layer 1 blockchains hit a new high, and regulatory rulings favored Binance and potential ether ETPs. Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below. Digital assets slumped in June as trading volumes and volatility followed seasonal patterns and fell to year-to-date lows. The German and U.S. governments moved long-dormant bitcoin (about $500M) onto crypto exchanges, presumably for sale, ahead of a likely distribution of Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims to creditors as large as 142,000 bitcoin, worth about $9B at current prices. We also noticed a substantial pickup (+45% m/m) in Bitcoin miners' transfers to crypto exchanges, adding to the spot selling pressure, as U.S.-based miners accelerated their transition to AI and high-performance compute (HPC) with core mining economics suffering in the wake of the Bitcoin halving. Meanwhile, Ethereum's new pricing model is causing additional ETH inflation, which is a worrying change in the market structure. Bitcoin and Ethereum slumped 10% for the month vs. the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, up 4% and 6%, respectively. Bitcoin miners were the big winners in June (+15%), while small-caps (-25%), infrastructure leaders (-25%) and DeFi (-18%) lagged. Despite the weak price action, total daily active addresses of Layer 1 blockchains made a new all-time high in June at 11.7 million, bitcoin funding rates rebounded to 5%, and we observe a significant $10B in short liquidations possible should Bitcoin regain $74k. Also, at month-end, DC federal judge Amy Jackson dismissed charges against Binance for the secondary sales of unregistered securities. This ruling cited Judge Analisa Torres' 2023 ruling in the SEC's case against Ripple Labs. Coupled with the likely listing of spot ether ETPs (exchange-traded products), the SEC's initial hostility to proof-of-stake coins is being whittled away by the courts.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. In June, the Layer 1 blockchain we track collectively lost 11% of its market cap or around $237B in total value. Despite the price reaction, some fundamentals were surprisingly robust. On-chain average Daily Active Addresses ((DAA)) reached a new high at 11.7M, surpassing the previous high of 10.9M in May 2024. Layer 1 revenues rose (+20%) month-to-month. And though DEX volumes fell (-7.1%), stablecoins on-chain increased (+1.5%). TVL fell (-9.2%) but by less than the DeFi tokens themselves, which underperformed and, as a category, fell 18% (the majority of TVL in DeFi is ETH & more volatile crypto tokens). Upcoming Token Unlocks The current chief focus on the crypto ""navel-gazoooor"" is the large amount of upcoming token unlocks. This is a symptom of the greater phenomenon of crypto projects initially releasing a small part of their total supply of tokens. The typical justification, with a strong rationale for helping a project succeed, is that many projects hold tokens in reserve to incentivize community behavior far into the future. This strategy results in only limited amounts of tokens being released to the community during the initial phases of a project's launch. Additionally, projects stagger the release of tokens to both community members and investors because they want to decrease the selling pressure on price from those unlocked tokens being sold. As crypto market pricing is hardly efficient yet, the mechanical activity of selling large volumes of unlocked tokens into a market depresses prices with higher volatility, a vicious combination for any manager. The result is that projects often engage in tactics to ensure that tokens are not market-sold by participants. Most of the methods that projects employ to prevent selling revolve around promising incentives for ""locking"" tokens over long periods of time. These periods are sometimes four years long; the longer the lock, the greater the reward. This is believed to be justified because reducing sellable supply will allow price support to build while the project's revenues and credibility solidify over time. This practice, though common, is highly controversial. Many projects like Ethereum released most of their supply relatively quickly. Some market observers contend that the token supply games are simply a cynical ploy by crypto companies to build massive valuations driven by manipulative trading practices. These critics claim that the more unsavory projects partner with shady market makers to ""paint"" prices higher and that doing this is much easier if there is very little floating token supply to sell. The game, the critics claim, anchors crypto traders to artificially high prices that persist as team and investor tokens unlock, allowing the teams and investors to sell at higher prices than if token prices started low. Ammunition to these critics is ample as some crypto projects have seemingly engaged in this activity while allowing their team members and certain investors to have earlier unlocks than others. Additionally, all but the most sophisticated crypto investors cannot track these token unlocks, and often, the unlocks are not guaranteed by smart contracts but are guarded only by the honesty of individuals. Although a troubling practice, thankfully, such behavior is not super common. But there is enough of it to justify the compulsion of projects to detail their unlock schedules more accurately, how those schedules are enforced, and where token balances that will unlock sit (so they can be tracked). It would be even more helpful if investor balances were publicly flagged so that anyone could track their wallets to ensure the locked token holders keep their word. Additionally, everyone in crypto should understand the benefits those locked tokens receive during the locking period, such as voting power and even token inflation. In TradFi, such transparency is often enforced by a self-regulatory organization (SRO) at the behest of a regulator. Recently, the crypto markets have been sagging in part due to these token unlocks. Some participants have been zeroing in on the relatively dramatic number of tokens coming to market over the coming year. For example, in the period between June 17 and July 17, 2024, more than $740M in tokens will be unlocked. Many of these projects unlocking tokens do not have a substantial floating supply, and this deluge of tokens will depress prices. Some example projects unlocking include Aptos and Arbitrum, each of which will have around $85M and $80M in sell pressure stemming from these unlocks in the coming 30 days. Aptos, whose current token supply is 356M worth $2.5B, will increase its floating supply to 682M tokens by January 1, 2025. Current prices imply $2.3B of token supply that will materialize over the next 5 months. While most investors in a strong project like Aptos may not sell recklessly, the potential for that unlocked supply to be sold worries many and causes underperformance.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ethereum and Ethereum L2s Update Ethereum fell 11% in June, modestly outperforming most Layer 1 tokens. We have seen increasing amounts of activity migrate to Ethereum's Layer-2 blockchains (L2s). This is evidenced by Ethereum's declining share of DEX Volumes relative to its L2 blockchains. Though Ethereum's blockchain still holds most of DEX activity, Ethereum's scaling design intends to push more of its activity out to the peripheral Layer-2 blockchains. Ethereum's role in the future is to be a trusted layer where these L2 blockchains settle their transactions and thus gain from Ethereum's security. One component of this design is to accept data from the Layer-2 blockchains. Ethereum is engineered to host L2 data in a special layer called ""blob space."" Blob space was created due to an Ethereum software upgrade called EIP 4844 that enabled these batching transactions and priced blob space usage much cheaper than non-blob space transactions. As blob space fees are intended to become the majority of Ethereum's revenues, blob space has become an important tracking metric. This shift of activity off of Ethereum, alongside the creation of blob space, has decreased the fees that Ethereum generates. Blob space can be thought of as the compression of thousands of transactions into one - the posting of the blob to Ethereum. The result is that Ethereum revenues have declined (-69%) in the 75 days since the creation of blob space through EIP 4844, compared to the 75 days before. This has led to a dramatic 90% or more decrease in transaction fees across Ethereum and its L2s. The decline in fees has triggered renewed inflation in Ethereum's monetary system. Currently, around (+0.62%) is added to the supply of ETH each year due to network inflation. Prior to EIP 4844, ETH supply was declining around (-0.37%) annually due to the transaction burn (80% of fees) offsetting supply inflation. However, this renewed inflationary dynamic could be temporary, as Ethereum blob space activity began to surge at the end of June. Block space pricing has the same dynamic as Ethereum's regular transaction pricing. Ethereum targets 50% usage of its blockchain, with fees rising exponentially if usage exceeds this target. Similarly, Ethereum aims for 3 blobs per block. If more blobs are submitted, posting costs can increase rapidly by 12.5% per block, where the number of blobs consecutively exceeds the target level of 3 blobs. L2s can do many things to decrease the number of blobs they post, similar to how a company can manage its profit margins. However, as more L2s materialize and/or more activity happens on L2s, blob space pricing should still go up. Ethereum is just about creating the number of blocks needed to push pricing up exponentially. The Number of Blobs is Rising, but it Must Exceed 3 for ""Pricing Power"" Source: Dune @hildobby as of 6/27/2024. In June, the Ethereum community solidified plans for its next major upgrade, 'Pectra.' Key changes include enabling account abstraction and increasing the maximum staking per validator from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Account abstraction will significantly improve user experience by allowing developers to create more intuitive environments. This includes web-based wallets and applications that pay gas fees for users, simplifying many pain points for new blockchain users. The validator balance increase is more significant than many suppose and may even help the Ethereum scale. While Ethereum aims to be decentralized, the current network of more than 1M validators causes issues. It takes a long time for all these validators to see and respond to network changes like state updates (account balances and software changes). The upgrade to increase the staking limit per validator aims to consolidate multiple validators into one. This could result in a smaller network with 100-200k validators rather than 1m. Reducing the validator count may also pave the way for increasing Ethereum's transaction throughput by increasing block size or decreasing block time. This is because a smaller network, by validator count, should be able to process data more efficiently. Layer-2 Blockchains Have Grown Usership Massively Source: Artemis XYZ as of 6/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. In Ethereum Layer-2 Blockchain news, the trend of activity migrating to Ethereum continues. However, this has yet to translate into momentum for the token prices of Ethereum Layer-2 Blockchains due to inflation. For example, usership on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Mantle have been up 358%, 73%, and 260%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. While ETH price is up (+46%) YTD, the Layer-2 token prices of MNT, ARB, and OP have returned (+24%), (-53%), and (-55%) in that order. We attribute this dynamic to a few different factors. First, ETH has had ETP-related demand. However, if we track returns before the ETP announcement on May 20, ARB and OP still lagged ETH prince increases at (-44%) and (-39%) respectively versus ETH at (+31%). Though Mantle's MNT token outperformed ETH before the ETP announcement (+46%), Starkware's STRK token was also down relative to ETH with a YTD (incepted on Feb 20) of (-46%). Before the ETH ETP, many assumed that Layer-2 blockchain tokens would act as higher beta price bets on ETH would outperform ETH after an ETP announcement. Every L2's Fees Has Declined More than Ethereum's YTD Source: Artemis XYZ as of 6/28/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We theorize that the status of L2 blockchains' tokens, as well as L2s' higher degree of revenue decline than Ethereum, have caused a significant amount of the price deterioration. On the first point, it's important to remember that Layer-2 tokens are hard-to-value governance tokens. Nearly all L2 tokens have no economic role in the financial systems of L2 blockchains. Though this dynamic may change in the future, the result is that the economic value of most L2 tokens remains uncertain for now. More clarity on the financial implications of L2 tokens would catalyze outsized responses to those token prices, and we will be closely observing the progress. Regarding on-chain revenues, L2 revenues have fallen substantially more than Ethereum's revenues due to EIP 4844. This revenue underperformance has transpired despite more significant activity on L2s compared to Ethereum. With the exception of Base, which has no token (other than the COIN stock), every single L2 blockchain has lost revenue generation at a greater scale than Ethereum has since the beginning of the year and post-EIP 4844. Why has this occurred? It's because of the aforementioned EIP 4844, which lowered fees on Ethereum. Initially, many hypothesized that EIP 4844 would reduce prices so dramatically on L2s that lots of users and their money would relocate to Ethereum's L2s. The result would be that the increased activity, alongside reduced costs of posting data to Ethereum (through data blobs), would enable L2s to increase profit margins. Though some supposed that L2s would see decreased topline revenues because of lowered prices to users, they would become more profitable because they could increase their margins. The follow-through would cause the outsized performance of L2 tokens. What actually happened was that L2s, in price competition, reduced both their pricing and their margins on activity. At the same time, Ethereum saw renewed activity that helped its revenue generation decline less than the L2s. That renewed activity manifested as a result of cheaper fees on Ethereum spurred by EIP 4844. From a fundamental standpoint, we can attribute the price performance of ETH relative to its L2s not only to outside catalysts like the ETP but also to the decline in relative activity of the L2s. Finally, we also want to mention that L2 tokens suffer from the same previously mentioned issue with dilutionary supply coming to market. Arbitrum and Optimism have only unlocked 30% and 26% of the total supply. As many investors still holding those tokens may want to realize their gains, increases in floating tokens will likely translate into more significant selling pressure. Solana and Bitcoin L2s Update Outside of Ethereum, other Layer-2 narratives have been emerging. The Solana L2 Sonic, focused on gaming, recently announced a $12M raise. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin L2 narrative is beginning to solidify as Starkware announced $1M in prize money to teams that enable zero-knowledge proofs to be settled on Bitcoin. At the time of writing, more than 100 projects claimed to build Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions. For more details on how Bitcoin L2s work, please watch for our upcoming Bitcoin Price Target blog. Bitcoin TVL is Dominated by wBTC and Others Emerging Source: Defillama as of 6/24/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Another exciting development in June is Arweave's continued pivot to decentralized AI. Due to the launch of an AI coin called AO on Arweave, Arweave's TVL ($260) now exceeds that of NEAR ($213M) and Cardano ($241M). This activity stems from people bridging to utilize Arweave's AI protocol AO, which provides compute for AI projects like LLMs to run their logic on chain, within smart contracts. Another blockchain applying its blockchain to new use cases is NEAR, whose endeavor into Data Availability (DA) has led to the spinout of an internal project called Nuffle, which intends to provide the infrastructure for crypto projects to use NEAR as a DA layer. Nuffle was able to attract $13M in funding. In the Solana ecosystem, following the launch of Tiplink, a lightweight wallet and payment solution, Solana Labs announced ""Blinks,"" which are web links that allow anyone, even those without a crypto wallet, to send, receive and perform other actions on the Solana blockchain. For example, users create a wallet by clicking on a link, making trades, or sending coins. This promises to onboard more users to Solana because it insulates them from having to do complicated blockchain activities like connecting wallets or managing private keys. Users of Blinks click on a link and manage their crypto through the link. Solana also solved one of its key issues by releasing zk compression technology to compress its massive history. Measuring over 200TB, the Solana blockchain has become a massive, decentralized database that is too big for many of its nodes to handle. As Solana's high throughput ensures the future generation of more data, many observers feared Solana's blockchain data size would grow too cumbersome to manage. Solana's zk compression uses zero-knowledge technology to shrink the storage required for Solana's data. June's Notable Winner - TRX (+11%) Tron Fees Show Uptrend Over the Last 3 Years Source: Artemis XYZ as of 6/24/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. This month's price performance of TRX highlighted Tron's ability to attract and retain global users, especially in the APAC region. $USDT markets hit 24-hour trading volumes of $53B, surpassing Visa's Q1 average. P2P transfer volumes are climbing near record highs above $13B / day. Leading all blockchains in both metrics, Tron reached 2.1M DAUs and $59.25B USDT circulating on-chain. Only Ethereum comes close at $50.47B, followed third by Solana at $773M. This user activity has driven Tron to record monthly fees annualized at over $1.65B, passing 4-5% APY yields to stakers delegating TRX to Super Representatives (""SRs""). TON Price and Daily Active Addresses Show Significant YTD Increases - TON (+16%) Source: Artemis XYZ as of 6/24/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. TON coin stood out as one of this cycle's top performers this month, driven by success converting Telegram's user base of 930M into on-chain actors. This surge in activity coincides with high investor interest, as highlighted by Telegram founder Pavel Durov's hint of a potential IPO in a recent Financial Times interview, where he claimed a valuation of $30B+ for the platform. Additionally, Pantera Capital's strong endorsement in their May Letter titled ""TON, Our Largest Investment Ever"" invited potential investors to subscribe to a private round. The primary narrative driving activity on TON has been incentivized airdrops facilitated through ""clicker"" apps that encourage users to click buttons to increase their airdrop allocation. One example is NOTCOIN, whose spring airdrop maintains a ~$1.65B valuation. A newer entrant, Hamster Kombat, claims to have reached 200M players (~20%+ of Telegram users) as of June 24. However, this claim is not easily reconciled with daily active addresses. As of June 26, the network surpassed $500M in USDT supply just two months after rolling out support for Tether. TON DEX trading volumes hovered near all-time highs this month (see chart in NEAR report below), driven by heightened daily active addresses. As for the fundamental case for Telegram, the platform claims its generous 50:50 ad-revenue share for channels with 1000+ subscribers will drive user growth in key regions, including Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. June's Notable Laggard - NEAR (-33%) TON's DEX Trading Volumes Surpass NEAR Protocol's Source: Artemis XYZ as of 6/24/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. NEAR Protocol's token investors suffered large losses this month, erasing much of the coin's YTD outperformance. While daily active addresses and daily transactions remain near all-time highs, both upward trends appear to be plateauing. Further, the blockchain's daily fees saw a downward inflection beginning in early June, with 7 DMA fees down to $36k on Thursday from a peak of $46k on June 3rd (-21%). Though NEAR's Telegram wallet app 'HOT-Near' possesses more users than all of TON, TON has ~7x more DEX transaction volumes than NEAR. Additionally, Telegram's native Wallet Bot recently released new features, including USDT integration and Wallet Earn's. This may give TON's Telegram wallet an advantage over the HOT-Near Wallet. Such improvements roughly coincided with viral TON narratives like Notcoin's airdrop and other clicker games like 'Hamster Kombat,' ostensibly reaching hundreds of millions of users in weeks. It appears likely that Telegram's bullish news and the TON ecosystem's recent virality are siphoning user activity and capital from NEAR through superior distribution. Further, NEAR Protocol's thesis is primarily driven by the potential for AI & blockchain interplay, which has particularly suffered from recent bearishness. Other leading AI and AI-adjacent tokens, such as Bittensor (-34%), Render (-24%), and The Graph (-31%), also significantly underperformed this month as the AI narrative shifted to Bitcoin Miners (see our ChainCheck here) . NEAR's performance could bounce back if the blockchain improves in distributing itself to organic users and sees improvements in its exposure to AI developments.

The news was announced at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Brussels, Belgium, where the company plans to begin onboarding developers to use its new product.  According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, the Delegation Toolkit will allow for instant user onboarding without needing to interact with a traditional wallet, in addition to eliminating “user friction completely,” meaning no pop-ups or confirmations when switching between a decentralized application and wallet.  In addition, Consensys said that the toolkit is supposed to simplify smart contract development, and allow developers to reassign gas costs to others – aiming to make it possible for developers to determine that certain individuals will not have to pay any fees.  The Delegation Toolkit will be available for any chain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, “supported by a User Operation Bundler, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Linea, Optimism and Polygon,” Consensys said.  “The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit will allow seamless onboarding of users into a new generation of dynamic and nimble experiences, which benefit from the kinds of rich collaboration that can only come from a new paradigm of authorization and composability,” said Dan Finlay, co-founder of MetaMask, in the press release.

42407917,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7XvN,1720508393,Bitcoin ETF Traders Buy the Dip With Nearly $300M Inflows,"On Monday, the U.S.-listed spot ETFs witnessed nearly $300 million in new inflows.  Investors seem to be bargain-hunting as temporary supply overhangs weigh over BTC's price.  Spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded nearly $300 million in net inflows on Monday, marking their highest buying activity since early June when the cryptocurrency traded over $70,000.  SoSoValue data show that market leader BlackRock’s IBIT led buying activity with nearly $180 million in net inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC. Grayscale’s GBTC—infamous for its outflows—recorded over $25 million in purchases.  ETFs offered by Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Hashdex showed no inflow or outflow activity.  Strong inflows come as bitcoin faces significant selling pressure from various sources, such as repayments tied to defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and a German government entity moving hundreds of millions worth of BTC to exchanges in the past month.  As such, some investors may be viewing the selling pressure as a buying opportunity, investment firm CoinShares said in a Monday report.  “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling US$441m, with recent price weakness prompted by Mt Gox and the German Government selling pressure likely being seen as a buying opportunity,” CoinShares said. “However, volumes in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) remained relatively low at US$7.9 billion for the week, reflecting the typical seasonal pattern of lower volumes in the summer months.”  Traders largely expect July to be a generally bullish month for the crypto market as it has seen a medium return of 9% historically, with the trend expected to continue.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/09/bitcoin-etf-traders-buy-the-dip-with-nearly-300m-inflows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67c23bda71820180f6deeb73c745d9fdffdc0144-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407920,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga7Y8b,1720508388,"Bullish Bitcoin Drivers Remain in Play Despite Germany's Sales, Mt. Gox Reimbursements","Germany's BTC sales and Mt. Gox reimbursements weigh over BTC.  Major economies' expansionary phase, slowing inflation, and peak tech optimism on Wall Street suggest a positive outlook.  It may seem like turbulent times in the crypto market amid Germany's bitcoin {{BTC}} sales and fears about mass liquidations by defunct exchange Mt. Gox's creditors. However, looking past these supply overhangs reveals a promising outlook, buoyed by supportive macroeconomic factors and sustained risk-taking in traditional markets.  BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped over 17% to $57,200 in four weeks, causing a rout in meme coins, digital assets supposedly tied to artificial intelligence (AI), and other risky corners of the crypto market, CoinDesk data show.  The big picture, however, remains bullish, meaning once supply overhangs from Germany and Mt. Gox creditors run dry, the market could stage an impressive recovery.  G-7 in the expansion phase  Investors commonly exhibit a greater willingness to deploy money in risky, growth-sensitive assets like bitcoin and stocks during periods of global economic expansion.  The G-7, an informal group of advanced economies, is currently experiencing an expansionary phase of the business cycle amid elevated interest rates, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) composite leading indicator.  The indicator, gauging the short-term economic outlook for a group of major nations, has crossed above 100 and is rising, indicating above-trend growth and acceleration, according to TS Lombard.  CPI to boost Fed's confidence  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' report on the June consumer price index (CPI), due Thursday, is expected to show that the cost of living rose 3.1% over the year, slowing from May's 3.3% annual increase, according to a survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal.  The expected slowdown would imply continued progress toward the Fed's 2% target, strengthening the case for the central bank to begin reducing the benchmark borrowing costs this year.  Renewed rate cuts could further catalyze demand for risk assets, including bitcoin. Since early this year, weaker-than-expected CPI prints have galvanized inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, boosting the cryptocurrency's market value.  ""We forecast headline CPI rose by 0.1% m/m owing in part to another drop in energy prices. This would result in the y/y rate falling a tenth to 3.2% and the NSA index printing at 314.770. Meanwhile, we expect core CPI increased by 0.2% m/m,"" economists at BofA said in a July 5 note to clients.  ""Should the CPI report print in line with our expectations, we would maintain our expectations for the Fed to start its cutting cycle in December,"" economists added, saying a 0.2% m/m core CPI would lift the odds of an early rate cut.  Record tech optimism on Wall Street  The path of least resistance for bitcoin is on the higher side as Wall Street remains entrenched in a wave of tech optimism, as evidenced by the new record highs in the ratio between its tech-heavy Nasdaq index (NDX) and the broader S&P 500 (SPX).  Since early 2017, bitcoin has moved in lockstep with the NDX-to-SPX ratio, staging sharp rallies during periods of relative outperformance of technology stocks.  Besides, social media's concerns about a potential meltdown in the U.S. stocks, adding to downside pressures in other risk assets, may be unfounded as the equity market does not appear to be in a bubble.  ""Whenever U.S. margin debt increases, we hear calls of a bubble forming in the U.S. equity markets. However, unlike in previous bubble episodes (including 2020-21), margin debt is growing less than the equity market capitalization. Rather than being a driver of equity performance, it is likely a consequence. This is unsurprising given the current high level of interest rates, which is not conducive to leverage increases, TS Lombard said in the July month's note to clients.  ""Another indication that the U.S. equity market is not in a bubble territory is investor positioning, which is close to neutral in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures,"" Lombard added.  Gold has also held steady in recent, a sign the macro picture is supportive of assets with alternative investment appeal like bitcoin.  Lastly, past data show months after reward halving are bullish and characterized by double-digit price corrections. The Bitcoin blockchain underwent its fourth halving in April this year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/09/bullish-drivers-remain-in-play-despite-germanys-bitcoin-sales-and-mt-gox-reimbursements,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72b4aefe2e525485bcd72be071ac70cf6b576cce-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30678731,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628484,1720501232,"Massive Mt. Gox Bitcoin Shift Unlikely To Disrupt Prices, Says CryptoQuant CEO","Recent developments surrounding the repayment of creditors and investors of the defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, Mt. Gox, have sparked concerns about potential effects on Bitcoin’s price. As the market retraced over 20% from its three-month high above $70,000, the movement of 47,000 BTC to repay creditors has raised questions about the market’s stability. However, industry experts, including CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju and Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, have offered insights into this development, suggesting that the impact on BTC’s price may be less significant than initially feared. Internal Transfers, OTC, And Brokerage Services Examined Ki Young Ju, in an analysis shared on social media, outlined three possible scenarios for the BTC transactions related to creditor repayment. Firstly, an internal transfer could have taken place to increase security by changing wallets. Secondly, an over-the-counter (OTC) deal may have been executed specifically not to impact the market price. Related Reading: Is This Ethereum ICO Project To Blame For ETH’s Price Slump? In a third scenario, a brokerage service may have been used, possibly involving the sale of the BTC after it bypassed broker wallets and exchanges. Ju mentioned that 1.5K BTC went to Bitbank, Japan’s largest crypto exchange. Still, no significant increase in trading volume was observed, indicating that it may not significantly impact the market. According to Ju’s analysis: If scenario 3 applies, 94K BTC is available for sell-side liquidity, but selling this much BTC without on-chain movement is unlikely. If it’s OTC selling, we’re in the clear. Holding Bitcoin Over USD Payouts? Alex Thorn of Galaxy Digital offered additional insight into the Mt. Gox creditor dynamics and their potential impact on the market, noting that fewer coins may be distributed than originally anticipated, which could result in less selling pressure on Bitcoin than the market expects. Thorn noted that the majority of creditors are long-term Bitcoin enthusiasts with a “deep understanding” of the technology, for which he believes their desire to reclaim their coins rather than accept a USD-denominated payout indicates a strong preference for holding onto their Bitcoin, which would not contribute to an expected sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Crashes 5% To Lowest Level In 3 Months, What Happens Next? In addition, Thorn explained that the significant capital gains implications of selling BTC may discourage creditors from liquidating their holdings. Despite the relatively low recovery rate, Thorn believes the 140x appreciation since bankruptcy offers significant value to creditors who may choose to hold on to their coins and expect further price appreciation. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is being traded at $56,300. This reflects a decrease of over 1.5% within the past 24 hours and a decline of nearly 20% over the month. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how the Mt. Gox drama will unfold and how it will or will not affect the Bitcoin price after more than 10 years of waiting for creditors to receive their payments.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is Retesting Its 365-Day SMA Right Now As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio is retesting a level that has acted as an important psychological level in the past. The “MVRV ratio” here refers to a popular on-chain indicator that, in short, compares the value that the investors are holding (that is, the market cap) against what they used to purchase the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the investors can be considered to be in profit right now. Tops can become more likely to form the higher the ratio above this mark, as holders become increasingly tempted to harvest their gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Extreme Greed’ Is Almost Here: Price Bottom Now Close? On the other hand, the indicator being under the level implies the dominance of losses in the market. Bottoms can be probable in this zone, as sellers become exhausted here. Naturally, the MVRV ratio is exactly equal to 1 suggests the investors are holding profits and losses in equal parts, so the average holder could be assumed to be just breaking even on their investment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio, as well as its 365-day simple moving average (SMA), over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has been observing a decline since the price all-time high (ATH) set back in March. This trend is because BTC has been riding on bearish momentum since then. Investor profits, which had once ballooned to relatively high levels due to the rally, have taken a sizable hit because of the price drop. However, holders are still very much in gains, as the metric’s value is around 1.8 right now. The chart shows that this is around the same level that the indicator’s 365-day SMA has been floating around recently. Historically, this SMA has acted as an important level for the indicator, sometimes taking the role of support during bullish trends. The MVRV ratio crossing below this line has often meant a transition towards a bearish trend for Bitcoin. As such, this current retest between the indicator and the line can be significant for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Social Media Screams “Sell” As Bitcoin Crashes To $54,000: Buy Signal? It remains to be seen if this support level holds or if the metric will drop below it, potentially leading to an extended bearish period for BTC.

I delve deeper into the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF - a popular spot Bitcoin ETF managed by BlackRock. I present the value proposition of investing in the IBIT ETF and also the potential concerns. I explain my investment recommendations with respect to the Fund for different types of investors, and maintain a neutral stance with a 'Hold' rating. The recent introduction of multiple cryptocurrency ETFs has taken the investor space by storm, and the amount of money going into these funds is not negligible. On July 6th, of 2024, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded massive net inflows of $143.1m . This came after the price of Bitcoin dipped below a key support level of $54000. The token briefly fell below its 200-day EMA , and many investors and traders are looking to take advantage of these price movements. Among the many newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) stands out to me. Let's delve deeper. The Good IBIT ETF serves to be a performance indicator of Bitcoin - the largest cryptocurrency token in the world. The fund has net assets of over $18b, and many investors consider IBIT ETF to be a good investment vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin price movements without the hassle of setting up a cryptocurrency wallet. Personally, I do believe that the fund provides a strong value proposition. Management Under BlackRock Total Assets of Bitcoin ETFs (VettaFi) We see that IBIT's net assets are the highest when compared to other popular Bitcoin funds, triumphing its counterparts from Grayscale and Fidelity. The sheer size of the fund is a testament to the reputation of its manager - BlackRock, which brings me to the next point - the growth of BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETF holdings has grown tremendously, surpassing 38000 Bitcoins in early July. This is no surprise considering that BlackRock is the largest asset manager after all, with over $10 trillion in AUM, and it is clear that they are serious about providing retail investors exposure to cryptocurrency and blockchain investments. The strong backing of BlackRock is a key reason why many are subscribed to IBIT ETF compared to its other close competitors. Security and Convenience The convenience of investing directly into IBIT ETF, as opposed to purchasing Bitcoin directly, cannot be understated. However, it is the added safety of doing so that makes an investment into IBIT ETF potentially worthwhile. As the tokens are held securely by the trust, investors have less to worry about as compared to holding a wallet of their own, which is susceptible to hacks. Year-to-date, more than $1.38b worth of cryptocurrency tokens have been stolen by hackers, representing an increase of over 100% compared to the same time last year. While most may argue that the smaller, less regulated exchanges are the usual victims, the fact of the matter is that even the largest names in the crypto space are not immune to hacks. Even the renowned Binance exchange was hacked - with almost $600m in cryptocurrency tokens stolen by hackers. One can prevent such hacks by setting up a cold wallet, which is an offline hardware wallet. However, the sheer inconvenience of doing so results in many crypto investors settling for the less secure hot wallets online. Even lazier or less savvy people may simply leave their tokens in their preferred cryptocurrency exchange. IBIT ETF provides a way out from such security issues. While no wallet is completely immune from compromise, leaving the security matters to the folks managing the trust is often a safer option than doing it yourself, especially if one is new to the crypto space. Swerving Tax Reporting Complications Reporting your cryptocurrency transactions for tax reporting purposes is far from a simple process . Tax laws in this regard differ greatly from country to country, and the considerations are far more complex compared to usual capital gains taxes from investing in stocks and mutual funds. Exchanging one token for another, converting tokens to fiat and purchasing items with crypto may all lead to taxable events, and those who regularly trade or invest in cryptocurrency tokens for capital gains have to conform to these reporting standards. Such a process is far more convenient when investing directly into a fund like IBIT ETF. In this way, investors swerve tax reporting complications while still participating in the performance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin As An Inflation Hedge Fund advantages aside, many consider Bitcoin to be the next best inflation hedge, and I can understand why. The token itself has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, unlike other cryptocurrencies which may not impose such a limit. The whole point of the supply cap is to preserve the scarcity of Bitcoin, much like that of gold and precious metals. As such, holding Bitcoin is commonly seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation as trillions of dollars continue being funnelled into the money supply. IBIT ETF seeks to track the performance of Bitcoin, and does so pretty well. IBIT vs BTC Comparison (PortfoliosLab) The above chart shows a strong correlation of 0.77 between IBIT ETF and BTC-USD. There are periods of premiums and discounts relative to the price movement of BTC, but we see that over the past 6 months, the price trends of both instruments have been near identical. As such, one can consider an investment in IBIT ETF similar, though not completely identical, to holding Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. The Bad While the above are all solid reasons for investing in IBIT ETF, I do have a few concerns. Fees and Price Differentials Bitcoin ETF Fees (NerdWallet) We see from the above that IBIT ETF's expense fees are certainly not the most competitive, losing out to counterparts from Franklin Templeton, Bitwise and VanEck. One may make the argument that investing directly into the token instead removes the recurring fund expenses and also allows investors to participate in the actual price movement of Bitcoin, as opposed to that of a fund that closely correlates to it. Another point is that the correlation of 0.77 between IBIT ETF and BTC-USD, while decently strong, still leaves a little to be desired. Lack of Fundamentals A long unsolved problem with cryptocurrency as an investment is the lack of fundamentals. Usually, ETFs are comprised of equities, bonds or other traditional asset classes to either replicate an index or achieve a certain investment objective. These investment instruments can be evaluated for their intrinsic value, as they possess tangible underlying fundamentals. For example, one can easily use a discounted free cash flow model to calculate the fair price of a stock. The metrics used are obtained from the company's financial statements, and the assumptions and projections are based on the perceived value and growth of the company's products and services. However, these fundamentals become a lot more ambiguous when it comes to cryptocurrency. While it is true that we are seeing increased adoption of blockchain technology, and substantial fund inflows to popular digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is little to justify why the price of one Bitcoin needs to be worth over $50000. It's mostly sentiment and market forces at work here, and until today, Bitcoin remains more of a speculative investment or trading vehicle, as opposed to a real tangible asset whose value is grounded in fundamentals. Investing in IBIT ETF does not change the narrative, given that the fund has a near 100% allocation in Bitcoin. As such, it's difficult to comment on whether the token's value will trend upwards in the long run, or if the current price is overvalued, undervalued or just right. This is also why movements in Bitcoin prices are so violent and volatile as compared to other asset classes. For a risk-averse investor, this may not be ideal. Opportunity Cost Investing in a speculative ETF like IBIT ETF has significant opportunity cost, as the same amount could have been invested in a low-cost index fund like SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) which has years of proven historical returns, and is also rooted in tangible fundamentals of the 500 largest companies in the US stock market. For those looking to invest in the future of blockchain, the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ) may also be a more viable and less speculative alternative, as the fund is invested in companies with significant blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption, as opposed to the token itself. From a fundamental perspective, IBIT ETF pales in comparison to these options. The Bottom Line IBIT ETF is likely one of the best investment choices if you are looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, I do have my doubts with regard to Bitcoin itself as an investment. Risk-seeking investors can consider having a small proportion of their portfolio invested in such tokens, as there is every chance that their value may go up tenfold or even more in the future. However, this is more of a speculative bet than an investment decision grounded in fundamentals. As such, risk-averse investors may want to consider other investment instruments. Personally, it's tough for me to determine if Bitcoin is a 'Buy' or 'Sell' at its current valuation from a fundamental perspective. However, I do believe that having some skin in the game is not a bad idea - and investing a little into IBIT ETF is one of the best ways to do so. My overall neutral stance on IBIT ETF has led me to issue a rating of 'Hold'.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703042-ibit-etf-a-bitcoin-alternative-but-it-doesnt-change-the-narrative?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/30675562.jpeg

30674265,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628404,1720494015,"Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Could Crash To $44,000, Here’s Why","Veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to as low as $44,000. He predicted this could happen based on a technical indicator that paints a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. Why Bitcoin Could Drop To $44,000 Brandt predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $44,000 if the flagship crypto has completed a double top. A double top is a bearish pattern that indicates that BTC could witness a severe reversal to the downside, having hit two consecutive peaks and a moderate decline between them. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins Based on Brandt’s chart, the flagship crypto may have completed a double top. However, another analyst, JK, responded to Brandt’s post, noting that the depth of the top in Bitcoin is around 10% of its price. Based on this, JK suggested that it is unlikely that Bitcoin formed a double top since Richard Schabacker (one of the greatest analysts) said that 20% and not less is required for a true double top to form. Brandt seemed to agree with JK’s reasoning, suggesting that it was also possible that a double top hasn’t been completed and that Bitcoin could witness a bullish reversal from its current price range. Some other analysts also shared their thoughts in response to Brandt’s post. One of them, Colin, mentioned that he doesn’t think that was a double top for Bitcoin. Colin added that there was too much strength on these two bounces off the lower ranges and back into the channel to assume a double top. Instead, he believes that Bitcoin’s recent price action is currently an accumulation and not a distribution range. Based on Schabacker’s analysis, another analyst, Chartvist, also explained why it is unlikely that BTC has formed a double top. The analyst mentioned that the volume profile is not in line with the technical of a double top as there is usually a high volume for the first peak and a low volume for the second peak. How BTC Could Drop To $44,000 Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently provided insights into how Bitcoin could drop to the $40,000 range. He stated that Bitcoin dropping to the demand area at $53,000 could kickstart such a downtrend. However, BTC will need to fail to hold above $53,000 for the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $44,000 to become feasible. Related Reading: Finance CEO Raoul Pal Says Crypto Will Reach $100 Trillion Market Cap – Here’s When CrediBUILL Crypto is optimistic that BTC won’t drop to such levels. He noted that this was “the least likely to actually play out” among all the scenarios he had outlined for Bitcoin. Instead, he believes Bitcoin will likely reverse from its current price range. He predicts that the flagship crypto will rise to as high as $100,000 in the long term.

There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $57,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

BTC even climbed above the $57,500 level. However, it failed to continue higher above the $58,200 zone. A high was formed at $58,129 and the price started a fresh decline.

30672012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628472,1720490447,Expert Reveals 7 Top Solana Meme Coins To Watch Amid ETF Approval Hopes,"Solana-based meme coins have emerged as notable contenders in the crypto market, outperforming the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in recent months. With coins like Bonk Inu (BONK) soaring nearly 7,000% year-to-date, the potential approval of Solana ETFs filed by asset managers VanEck and 21Shares in the United States, is seen as a potential catalyst for these tokens, according to market expert Leshka. In a recent analysis, Leshka explained that Solana memes have become the dominant narrative of this market cycle, raising expectations for their potential growth following a potential Solana ETF market approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Top Solana Meme Coins To Watch Leshka started by depicting cat-based meme coin POPCAT, which has recorded a 55% price increase in the past two weeks. Currently trading at $0.448, POPCAT is the 4th largest meme coin on Solana with a market capitalization of $441 million. Leshka considers it one of the most relevant mid-cap memes on Solana, highlighting a “strong community” despite lacking intrinsic value. Related Reading: Is This Ethereum ICO Project To Blame For ETH’s Price Slump? Next, Leshka highlighted the MICHI token, another cat-based meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. According to the analyst, the upcoming launch of MichiSwap, Michi non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the Michi NFT Marketplace could catalyze further price increases for MICHI in the coming months. Bonk Inu, another meme coin that has gained significant attention in recent months, was also mentioned by the analyst, which has recorded a 20% price increase in the past fourteen days, currently trading at $0.00002413. Leshka highlighted how Bonk Inu, which originally supported the Solana community, has expanded its user base and integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-chain messaging protocols and NFT marketplaces as key to its growth prospects, positioning Bonk Inu as another meme coin with the potential for further gains. Political Meme Coins Moving on, Leshka spotlighted Dogwhifhat (WIF), currently the top Solana-based meme coin in the market cap, which has accumulated over $1.6 billion in record time. Leshka believes that Dogwhifhat “symbolizes progress in futuristic transactions” and is a beacon for “forward-thinking individuals.” Nonetheless, the token has recorded a steep price drop in the monthly time frame of nearly 40%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts July On A Bearish Note, Will CPI Data Change The Narrative This Week? Lastly, the analyst highlighted political memes based on the Solana ecosystem, specifically those related to US politicians, which have gained significant traction as the upcoming November elections approach. Leshka noted OBEMA, a meme coin featuring Michelle Obama, as a “risky play” lacking inherent value or anticipated financial gain. However, the analyst pointed out the potential for a 10x-20x return if Joe Biden were to leave the presidential race. Leshka also mentioned BODEN, a meme coin featuring Joe Biden. Although its popularity has waned, an “unexpected event” in the race for the White House could give it a final boost, especially if the president manages to win the election in November. Solana’s native token SOL was trading at $138.70 when writing, down over 13% monthly, but up 540% year-to-date.

Earlier this year, the project saw a wider integration with the messaging app and The Open Network (TON) blockchain. Its massive success sparked a discussion among investors about crypto and Web3 gaming. Some users consider that Notcoin has revolutionized marketing and gaming in Web3 and paved the way for the next wave of Play-to-Earn projects in the TON blockchain. Recently, the project unveiled the Telegram Gaming Accelerator in partnership with Helika Gaming. The collaboration aims to expand and open an accelerator for game developers “who will lead the wave of Telegram games.” Similarly, Notcoin announced that Notcoin Explore, the platform for launching Web3 projects in Telegram, was open. With over 200 projects already launched via Notcoin and over 22.5 million participants, the platform will be a “win-win case” for users and developers, the announcement stated. Users will discover Web3 projects and receive rewards with Notcoin Explore. Meanwhile, projects will have access to a “motivated audience” and be built with a “community-oriented model.” Seemingly, the news was well received by its community. Many TON enthusiasts consider the developments a bullish signal as Notcoin’s team is “building for the benefit” of the network.

Over the weekend, the token started to recover from last week’s retrace, going from trading at $0.0094 to hovering between the $0.015-$0.017 price range. According to CoinGecko data, NOT has outperformed the current crypto market and similar GameFi tokens by 21.5%. The token’s 80% jump sparked a bullish sentiment about NOT’s short-term and mid-term performance. Several market watchers highlighted Notcoin’s price action during the last three days. Altcoin Sherpa lamented missing the change to buy NOT after its retrace on Sunday night as it was “moving in lockstep and doing huge numbers the last few days.” NOT bounced “nicely” above the 100-day moving average (MA), as reported by VikingXBT. To the crypto investor, the token has a clear support at $0.016 and a resistance at $0.02, making it “look like a winner.” Crypto analyst World of Charts stated that NOT’s breakout from the descending channel was confirmed. The analyst expects NOT to move “towards 80%-90% bullish wave” and hit a new all-time high (ATH) above the $0.3 mark.

30667599,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628470,1720483233,"Will Bitcoin Bounce Back? Traders Place Their Bets on a Rocky Q4, Data Shows","So far, Bitcoin has seen significant volatility in the last trading session, hinting at frail investor sentiment. Earlier today, the asset soared to as high as $57,300. However, the asset now appears to have run out of steam after reaching this mark as it trades at $55,966, down by 1.6%. This surge in volatility is a sign that the market has become more fearful as traders watch several key technical levels. However, the latest data suggests a shift in trader patterns as more defensive strategies are sought. Analysts from the ETC Group report have noted a substantial increase in the open interest in Bitcoin options, pointing towards a strategic preference for downside protection. This is illustrated by the spike in implied volatility for short-dated options, indicative of more near-term price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts July On A Bearish Note, Will CPI Data Change The Narrative This Week? Insights from the Options Market: A Glimpse into Trader Sentiments The Bitcoin options trading market has given a glimpse of the current market mood. Recent data from Deribit show a put-call ratio—a metric that compares the trading volume of put options versus call options—higher than 1, indicating that the market is still bearish based on what traders are doing. This ratio indicates a higher volume of trades betting on or hedging against a further price drop. The fact that we are seeing such alignment in the market indicates a sizable segment of the market is bracing for the possibility of Bitcoin continuing its descent. ETC Group analysts agree with such a view, noting the peculiar term structure of volatility: higher implied volatilities in short-dated options versus longer-dated ones—a traditional characteristic of excessive bearishness on the market. The analysts particularly noted: Both the spike in put-call volume ratios as well as 1-month 25-delta option skew signalled a significant increase in demand for downside protection. BTC option implied volatilities have also increased slightly during the latest leg down. Implied volatilities of 1-month ATM Bitcoin options are currently at around 50.5% p.a. The term structure of volatility is also inverted now with short-dated options trading at significantly higher implied volatilities than longer-dated options. This tends to be a sign of overextended bearishness in the options market. Navigating Through Market Uncertainty These dynamics are being felt heavily in the market, with many prominent voices commenting on potential pathways for Bitcoin. Long-time trader Peter Brandt hints he expects Bitcoin to form a double top setup, a bearish flag implying price drawdowns as deep as even $44K. Brandt, however, also accepts that the construction might not meet all requirements of a technical pattern and allows for different price consequences. A more positive view comes from Timothy Peterson. He said that as Bitcoin can end July above $50,000, it has a “strong chance” of either hanging onto or even increasing in value into October.
