42386518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdk1,1618607987,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Near $62K, Recovers Slowly From Turkey Crypto Payment Ban; Dogecoin Jumps","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $61,822.06 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 2.62% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $60,033.53-$63,850.25 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s slowly recovering from the news of Turkey’s coming cryptocurrency payment ban, which caused the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization to drop to near $60,000 before U.S. markets opened on Friday. The ban would take effect on April 30.      “Today's weakness is mostly attributed to accelerated profit taking after news hit that Turkey bans crypto payments,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, told CoinDesk in an email. “The biggest fear for many crypto traders has always been that big governments might impose harsh restrictions on cryptocurrencies.”      The profit-taking behavior was also observed in the trading activity where the daily trading volume on eight spot exchanges tracked by CoinDesk went up from the prior day.      “The situation in Turkey is rather unique given the government is doing everything in their power to stabilize their currency,” Moya said. “Many on Wall Street believe that the lira is poised to fall over 10% in the short term, and that is forcing Turkey to impose capital controls and now also slow down liras going into bitcoin.”      Speaking on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" show on Friday, CoinDesk Global Macro Editor Emily Parker said: “Crypto cannot really be stopped. You can make it a lot harder to access, but no government has been able to successfully shut down crypto entirely.”    Ether and altcoins  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,433.00 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 2.48% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,306.59-$2,547.94 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Ether was moving in tandem with bitcoin Friday after logging a new record-high price above $2,500 a day ago in the wake of the Berlin hard fork upgrade implementation.      Meanwhile, the star of altcoins on Friday is dogecoin (DOGE), the meme token born as a joke in 2013.      At press time, dogecoin was changing hands at $0.35, up 160.67% in the past 24 hours.      DOGE’s trading volume is another sign of bullish sentiment around the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency, the most traded cryptocurrency on centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoCompare.      According to IntoTheBlock’s newsletter on Friday, the number of addresses holding dogecoin for less than a month reached a record high in February and continued to go up in both March and April.      The U.S.-based crypto exchange giant Coinbase, which went public this week, still has not listed dogecoin, despite the high demand.      ""With the WallStreetBets and GameStop saga setting a distinct anti-Wall Street tone among retail investors, DOGE, as an almost 'anti-crypto,' seems to have caught many imaginations,” Richard Delaney, senior content writer at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk, referring to the Reddit forum “Set in this context, heavy promotion from the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and an army of YouTube and TikTok influencers are fueling the current dogecoin mania.”      But as Du Jun, co-founder of another popular crypto exchange, Huobi, warned, there are risks around the beloved meme token. Despite the growing interest from new investors, DOGE holders are still highly concentrated within the top 10 addresses, which counts about 41.35% of all circulating dogecoin.

It was not immediately clear who won the prize but the person went by the username @PleasrDAO on OpenSea and on the Foundation platform, where the auction was held.

Meanwhile, rival Riot, one of the largest publicly traded miners in North America, mined 491 bitcoin in the same period, per Securities and Exchange Commission filings.      Blockcap’s haul follows the company’s $38 million funding round and its acquisition of 32,000 Bitmain ASICs, and Riot’s comes after the miner inked a deal for 49,000 ASICs from Bitmain in the beginning of April. Some of these mining machines are online but the bulk are not, as both Blockcap and Riot will continuing placing news ASICs online as these shipments are fulfilled throughout the year.      Publicly traded Marathon Patent Group, another mainstay on North America’s mining scene, pulled in 196 BTC in Q1 of this year.      Each of these companies have been buying up mining rigs in a race to expand as North American investor appetite for Bitcoin’s mining has never been greater.      These mining companies, along with others like Luxor and newcomer Gryphon, have grown significantly over the past year. The United States and Canada now share anywhere from 10%-15% of Bitcoin’s global hashrate, a trend that could continue with investment dollars pouring into North American mining firms.      “Blockcap has an aggressive growth strategy that is designed to create more jobs in the blockchain industry not just in the United States but also in our home state of Texas and our hometown of Austin,” Blockcap founder and Chairman Darin Feinstein said. “We believe there is ample room for all of us to expand together and in turn provide broader, sustained economic growth at the local, state and national levels.”      An important piece of this growing industry, ASIC manufacturing, just touched down on the continent in the last year with ePIC, an ASIC manufacturer fresh off a $7 million series A funding round.      “North America could be a mining powerhouse but three key pieces need to come together for that to happen,” Henry Quan, CEO of ASIC maker ePIC, said. “There’s a lot of cheap energy here, commercial miners and a favorable political climate, so that’s the first thing. Mining pools are another piece, which we have with Luxor and DCG. And now, we have the third piece with ePIC and ASIC manufacturing.” (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)

42386516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdhV,1618599892,These 3 Charts Explain the 'Coinbase Premium' on Its Stock Price,"The price of Coinbase's direct listing must be eye-popping for investors who watch equities closely but haven't spent a lot of time with crypto assets.      One equities fundamentals analyst, speaking on CoinDesk TV Thursday, estimated Coinbase's true value at approximately more like $50 per share. (Coinbase closed its first full day of trading at $328.)      There are three reasons why investors might be willing to pay a price that represents such a high premium over what Coinbase's fundamentals might seem to command. The first suggests the word ""exchange"" isn’t a good descriptor of Coinbase’s business. The second looks at Coinbase's growth. The third looks at Coinbase as a passive, diversified investment in crypto assets.    Coinbase is not an exchange    First, it's important to get away from comparing Coinbase to equities exchanges. Coinbase isn't an ""exchange,"" at least not in the sense that the word is used to describe the Nasdaq or the NYSE.      In addition to matching buy and sell orders, Coinbase and other crypto ""exchanges"" operate custodian and prime-brokerage businesses, serving a mixture of retail and institutional clients. Unlike the NYSE or the Nasdaq, these exchanges give retail users direct access to the order book. In the future – through decentralized finance (DeFi), staking and governance protocols – crypto exchanges like Coinbase can be expected to manage a growing portfolio of services related to lending, borrowing, fixed-income and even governance.      So, what’s a better analogy? I think it's fair to look at Coinbase as a neobank. But rather than offering a retail banking bundle of services on a new delivery mechanism, crypto exchanges like Coinbase are offering a big-bank bundle of services on a new financial paradigm.      Conveniently for this analogy, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, three of the biggest banks in existence, happened to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, the same day as Coinbase's listing.      The bar graphs don’t lie: When it comes to revenue, Coinbase's $1.8 billion in Q1 2021 is barely visible compared with that of the big banks. This is despite a market cap that, at times on its first day of trading, rivaled the smallest of these, Goldman, which is valued at around $117 billion.      But please don't read too much into this chart. It reminds me of something you often hear about hyped tech initial public offerings (IPO): ""They're not even profitable,"" people will say.      Nasdaq IPOs are not valued on profit or on revenue, they're valued on growth. They're bought based on an expectation of what will happen next year, not based on what happened last year.    On growth, Coinbase flips the narrative against the bulge bracket    The growth chart flips the Coinbase narrative. In this chart, it's Coinbase that looks like the giant while the big banks look diminutive. So even on growth alone you might give Coinbase a premium, keeping in mind, of course, that big growth on small dollars is still small dollars. Coinbase will have to sustain these growth rates for a long time before its revenue will compare to the bulge bracket.      To believe that it will, you have to believe Coinbase may be poised to ride a paradigm shift in finance. In that light, a valuation north of $60 billion begins to make more sense.    Demand for a diversified, passive crypto investment opportunity    Still, one question any investor should be asking is, will Coinbase simply track the price of bitcoin? In other words, why buy Coinbase when bitcoin is available? The answer is the crypto market tends to vacillate between cycles in which bitcoin is driving momentum and cycles in which alternative coins are driving momentum. Right now it's altcoin season, and some may see Coinbase as a way to spread their bet beyond bitcoin.      This chart shows Coinbase's revenue growth each quarter alongside bitcoin's quarterly returns. It's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but it gives a sense of how bitcoin and Coinbase, like bitcoin and altcoins, can trade momentum periods back and forth. There are quarters in which Coinbase revenue growth outpaces bitcoin's price appreciation and vice versa.      Coinbase's revenues come from a mix of bitcoin- and altcoin-related drivers. This makes Coinbase, as others have observed and the chart above proves, a diversified investment on the crypto space.      Diversified, passive opportunities in crypto are not common. But the category's volatility, complexity and sheer novelty make a passive approach a natural fit. Coinbase's premium is, in part, a signal of investors' desire for such opportunities.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/16/these-3-charts-explain-the-coinbase-premium-on-its-stock-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc44eed6469194473b04eca1ab248e3285c3a782-3313x1993.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Harvard Business School professor, made the remarks Friday at a bitcoin conference hosted by Texas A&M University's Mays Business School. He served on the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, before rotating off at the end of 2020.      ""Right now it's clear it's a store of value,"" Kaplan said of the largest cryptocurrency. ""It obviously moves a lot in value, which could keep it from spreading too far as a medium of exchange and wide adoption, but that can change.""      Lately, that movement has been up, in dollar terms. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has increased eightfold over the past year, to about $61,400 as of press time, for a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion.      A growing number of big investors, including legendary hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller, have said bitcoin might serve as an effective hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.      An alternative perspective would be that the U.S. dollar has lost nearly 90% of its value, when expressed in bitcoin terms.    ""This is an innovation, and it's not just bitcoin but the technology like blockchain and other technologies that go along with it,"" Kaplan.  The U.S. economy is ""not out of the woods yet,"" he said, adding that signs of inflation this year are due to supply and demand imbalances.

Structural forces such as tech-enabled disruptions and aging limit pricing power.""  When asked about China's plans to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Kaplan said that ""the China experiment is tied to the value of the underlying currency. In some cases, you could argue it's a way to monitor flows.""  A ""digital dollar will likely be tied to the value of the underlying currency,"" Kaplan said.

42386519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdil,1618597609,Money Reimagined: Can Coinbase Live on The Street?,"Years from now, we’ll talk about “the period before Coinbase’s listing” and “the period after it.”      The raucous arrival of the biggest crypto startup onto Wall Street Wednesday has unleashed an explosion of self-perpetuating interest in the crypto world. Pundits now expect wider adoption, unleashing capital and feeding even more new ideas into the crypto innovation machine. Already, as you’ll see in the “Relevant Reads” section of this week’s newsletter, the buzz is driving another buying frenzy across the crypto markets.      That Coinbase buzz sets the tone for both this week’s column – which looks at how the company’s status as a listed company could pose challenges to how easily it can innovate – and for the podcast. For the latter, Sheila Warren and I were joined on the day of Coinbase’s listing by Wall Street Journal reporter (and my co-author) Paul Vigna and CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson to discuss the myriad ways the Coinbase listing is going to challenge Wall Street and vice versa.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    The promise and peril of going public    Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing has unlocked tens of billions of dollars in new wealth for its founders and early investors, but the move comes with a catch: decision-making is now constrained by the higher public scrutiny and quarterly performance expectations all listed companies face.      Having just leapt into the ranks of the world’s 100 richest people, CEO Brian Armstrong no doubt believes that’s a price worth paying. He’s probably also looking at the renegade behavior of crypto-friendly CEOs at other public companies, such as Tesla’s Elon Musk and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, and concluding he still has plenty of room to maneuver.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But the real issue is that Wall Street’s regulatory and self-regulatory system of reporting and compliance – introduced over decades by both government and self-regulatory bodies to protect the interests of minority shareholders and the general public – is now broken. Relentless monetary expansion, which has indiscriminately boosted all stocks in dollar terms, has reinforced a pre-existing problem where executives are rewarded for short-term share price gains rather than for pursuing long-term growth.      When you represent an industry that challenges the status quo of centralized finance, it’s awkward to embrace a corporate system that’s enriching a few at the expense of the many.    A broken system    Executive pay is exhibit A in the failure of the stock market to align corporate actions with the wider interests of the economy and free markets, as the Wall Street Journal recently showed. Surveying 300 companies that had filed 2020 compensation data, it found median CEO pay soared to $13.7 million last year from $12.8 million in 2019, even as COVID-19 fostered the worst recession since the 1930s and millions of Americans lost their jobs, and despite companies responding to that situation by cutting executive packages. (See the chart in the section below.)      The reason for this anomaly is simple: the bulk of executive earnings is tied up in stocks and option grants. And thanks to the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented “quantitative easing” (QE) efforts to boost the value of financial assets, share prices skyrocketed last year, with the S&P 500 index gaining 16.26% to close the year at a record high. That performance had little to do with management decisions.      While the thinking was once that stock-based compensation would constructively align management interests with shareholders, a great deal of academic research in recent years has found real flaws in the approach. Both shareholders and employees are harmed by short-termism and the temptation to tap easy quarterly earnings results rather than invest in bigger gains over a longer period. In the case of Enron and other scandals, options-based compensation has even been blamed for encouraging fraud.      Yet, the model persists, in part because companies are fearful about retaining talent in a tight market for top-level management recruits.      Now, the QE phenomenon is entrenching it even further as it encourages CEOs to stay put, continue with the status quo and let the central bank-led price rally do its magic.      There is a sign of pushback from corporate boards, which are not happy about bumping CEOs up on the cap table when, by any other measure, they’re not actually performing very well. A number of companies face more pay reform this year, according to the WSJ report.      Coupled with the increasing power of ESG (environment-social-governance) compliance committees at investing institutions, which are already expressing concerns about Bitcoin’s carbon footprint and perhaps about Coinbase’s employee diversity record, the company is entering an environment where its policies and practices will be under greater scrutiny.      That’s nothing new, of course. All startups make this adjustment when they go public. But it poses especially interesting questions for Coinbase.    Public pressure    To be sure, Armstrong and Co. likely have more leeway than stodgy, established companies to undertake innovation and even to kill profitable business lines to make way for needed change.      Much like Musk and Saylor’s bitcoin holdings, his firm’s stash of crypto assets has become a hugely valuable buffer against volatility. And given that widespread crypto adoption is yet to happen among corporate and retail users in a $90 trillion global economy, there is surely plenty of room for even more growth than it is currently reporting. Also, unlike many fast-growth tech companies, Coinbase is already profitable.      That trifecta of advantages gives Coinbase’s management more freedom to ignore pressure from institutional shareholders that might otherwise demand changes in corporate strategy. What’s more, because no new money was raised in the Nasdaq listing – it was a direct listing, not an initial public offering – founders and early investors will retain a relatively high level of control over the company.      This is not to say there won’t be any pressure. The eyes of the world are on Coinbase now. And if earnings drop during a sustained down period in crypto markets, calls for change could grow.      For Coinbase, there’s the added pressure that innovation in the crypto industry is faster paced than just about anywhere. (And, ironically, as I wrote last week, its listing is creating opportunities for others to stoke that innovation fire.)      As decentralized exchanges – the alternative model to Coinbase’s central custodian approach – achieve scaling and user experience improvements, the privacy advantages and added capabilities for plugging into the decentralized finance (DeFi) zeitgeist might eventually prove hard for Coinbase to compete with. The company is going to need to be ready to innovate – it must think like Netflix, not Blockbuster.      There are reasons to believe Coinbase will be up to the challenge. It now has massive fundraising capability and an ever-growing war chest with which to make useful acquisitions. It can hire the smartest crypto guys in the room.      But going head to head with big, open-source, decentralized communities of unencumbered, genius crypto developers is harder to do when you’re constantly having to explain yourself to the Wall Street suits.    Off the charts: CEOs’ COVID windfall    To put that CEO pay increase into context, let’s compare two charts.      The first is lifted from the Wall Street Journal’s article on the topic. (With a credit going to WSJ’s own source on those numbers, MyLogIQ).      It shows that, apart from a dip in 2011, median CEO pay among the 300-strong sample of S&P 500 companies has increased sharply over the past decade. In fact, it has almost doubled since that dip in the first year. And, as mentioned above, it rose another 7% during last year’s recession.      The second chart is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED database. It shows 10 years of median weekly earnings for the U.S. economy reported on a quarterly basis. (We only have the first three quarters of data for 2020.)      Usually, economists address median wages in real, inflation-adjusted terms to capture the true purchasing power of workers. However, the CEO pay data was expressed in current dollars, so we used a similar non-adjusted number for this FRED chart.      The first takeaway is that, notwithstanding a modest acceleration in the last two years of the Trump Administration, wage earnings have grown much more slowly than CEO pay, rising 33% from third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of last year. (Based on a separate, inflation-adjusted dataset from FRED, the gain was just 12% in real terms.)      The other is that between the second quarter and third quarter of last year, in the midst of the recession, wages fell. The contrast with CEOs is stark. Wage earners don’t have the same exposure as wealthier people to stocks and other financial assets that were bolstered by the liquidity expansion – and they certainly don’t have their income determined by them.      Also, setting aside comparative percentage increases, consider the proportionality. Ideally we’d have superimposed annualized median wage numbers onto the CEO pay chart, but the tiny bars at the bottom would have been barely discernible.      Simplistic, knee-jerk apologies for this glaring inequity typically say, well, this is the market at work. CEO talent is clearly worth it. A better approach is to look at this through the lens of decentralization: This is a direct outcome of Wall Street’s central gatekeeping place in the U.S. economy, a centrality that creates massive distortions and misaligned incentives. In fact, it undermines the free market. This is what crypto, with its peer-to-peer value transfer system, was supposed to try to fix.    The conversation: The SEC gets a new chairman    The other big news Wednesday might seem tangential but was totally relevant to Coinbase’s listing: Gary Gensler’s confirmation as Securities and Exchange Commission chair.      The crypto community has keenly anticipated the arrival of Gensler, whose MIT blockchain teaching experience makes him the best-crypto-informed U.S. regulatory chief ever. People are hoping for clarity on outstanding matters such as a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the SEC’s position toward DeFi’s decentralized exchanges and some definitive guidance on tokens as securities.      The confirmation was expected but the commentary around it was telling for what it says about how many different vested interests are vying for Gensler’s attention.      Take this rather obligatory statement from the other SEC commissioners, published in two tweets by the SEC’s communications department.      What was interesting was the barrage of “XRP Army” replies calling on Gensler to drop the SEC’s lawsuit alleging Ripple sold XRP as an unlawful security. Wishful thinking, I’d say, given that in 2018 Gensler said he thought XRP was a “noncompliant security.”      Then there was this tweet from U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis from the blockchain-friendly state of Wyoming, who is a big proponent of U.S. regulatory agencies taking a more innovation-friendly approach toward the technology. She ties the argument back to a key concern of the Biden Administration: competing with China in technology, in this case in digital currencies.      Less polite was Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose comments are shown here via a tweet from CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De. Toomey voted against Gensler’s appointment, citing fears of a “social liberal agenda.” That may hint at a future battle as institutions involved in ESG investments look to the SEC to take a stance on accounting standards in that field.    Relevant reads: Crypto market revival    Riding on the Coinbase buzz, the entire crypto market burst to life this past week, with multiple tokens within the CoinDesk 20 hitting all-time highs and/or posting record- or near-record weekly gains.      Not everyone thinks that’s a good thing.    It began with bitcoin breaking through multi-week resistance to new all-time highs along with ether. As Omkar Godbole reported, this happened on the eve of Coinbase’s listing.   Bitcoin then took a breather but everything else suddenly slotted into what Brad Keoun and Muyao Shen described as another “altcoin season,” one that has pushed the entire crypto market capitalization to more than $2 trillion for the first time. It wasn’t just ether. It was tron. It was stellar. It was XRP, with the XRP Army buoyed by some favorable court rulings and by Ripple’s move to call on the SEC to abandon its lawsuit.  More fundamental was the gain in ether, which broke above $2,500 for the first time after the Ethereum network successfully integrated the Berlin hard fork package of upgrades aimed at addressing problems with soaring gas fees. Muyao Shen reports.  From a complicated technical Ethereum upgrade to yet another dogecoin buzz moment. The Shina Ibu meme coin hit yet another all-time high as the company behind Slim Jim – “social media’s favorite meat stick,” says CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson – pulled off an interesting symbiotic marketing relationship with the DOGE fandom.  By the end of the week, bitcoin had stalled but all the action was happening in these buzzy, sentiment-driven altcoins.

At the time of publication, Figures shared with CoinDesk show that the top 7 Bitcoin mining pools lost, on average, 16.5% of their hash rate as a result of the incident. Primitive Ventures partner Dovey Wan, who operates mining equipment in one of the regions, told CoinDesk the coal-fired plants are down after “a massive explosion under the plants.”      The coal plant shutdowns follow coal mine accidents in Shanxi, Xinjiang and Guizhou provinces, which collectively have left nearly a dozen dead and, in the case of the mine in Xinjian, 21 people trapped. Coal-abundant Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are popular spots for Chinese bitcoin miners in the autumn and winter, when the rains that usually supply cheap hydro energy in regions like Sichuan are low.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    The incident highlights how much of bitcoin mining is still confined to China, but given Bitcoin’s design, it should only cause minor delays for Bitcoin block times for the next couple of weeks (if at all).    Bitcoin mining profitability stable    Bitcoin’s hashrate is a lagging indicator that measures the collective energy input and work output of the network. The self-reported hashrate of all mining pools is currently around 128 exahashes per second, according to mining pool APIs, down from 165 exahashes for the Bitcoin network’s seven-day moving average.      Luxor Mining CFO Ethan Vera said the outages currently have “no effect on the profitability of miners,” but that we would see the ramifications of this event during Bitcoin’s next difficulty adjustment, which could happen later than expected on May 1, Vera said. He expects Bitcoin’s difficulty to drop in response to the slower block times the network will experience with these miners offline.      Hashrate is a metric for gauging the amount of power being used to mine bitcoin. Consequently, Bitcoin’s difficulty, a self-contained score that deems how easy or hard it is to mine bitcoin based on how much hashrate is on the network, hit another all-time high yesterday.      “Network difficulty adjusted yesterday, so the next adjustment is not scheduled for another 14 days,” Vera explained.      “If the hashrate [in Xinjiang] remains offline, it means we will find blocks less frequently than the target (every 10 min) and that will have some downward pressure on next difficulty adjustment. So it really depends on how long this outage lasts to determine how big of an impact it will have on mining profitability,” said Vera.      A miner who spoke to The Block estimated the mining farms in the region “should resume in about a week from now.”      Updated April 19, 2021, 14:04 UTC: This article was updated to clarify data regarding what percentage of hash rate from major mining pools went offline .",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/16/how-accidents-in-chinese-coal-mines-are-affecting-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/327a02e5e979ecd44ef2cd27be6012ad24444cbe-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386503,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdSP,1618596300,Dogecoin Is Not the Next Bitcoin – But Here Are the Similarities,"To those of us who have been in the industry for a long time, Dogecoin has always been an oddity: A project that has exceptional approachability and appeal to new users while lacking most of the characteristics that make cryptocurrencies useful or valuable.      Created in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the project was abandoned years ago by its founders and developers, if not its fans. Until recently, it was in such a weak state that it couldn’t even power its own blockchain infrastructure and in 2014 hitched its proverbial wagon to another early cryptocurrency called litecoin.      At the time, that seemed like a necessary move – there were questions about whether DOGE could survive at all. Then, yesterday, the top meme token eclipsed its patron chain.      For the moment at least, dogecoin is more than double the size of litecoin (and 330-year-old Barclays bank as well) when measured by market capitalization.      So what on Earth is happening here?    Money is what people make of it    A couple of years ago, I did a series of interviews with people in Iran, India, Singapore, Honduras, Nigeria and a couple of other places. I went in assuming that bitcoin would not be the token of choice because the transaction fees are, in many cases, higher than a day’s wage and just generally are out of whack with the value scales locally.      I learned that, although that was true, people still saw bitcoin as their best option, which created a self-reinforcing cycle, the implications of which we’re still watching play out today.      Those decisions are driven by a simple question: Of all the currencies to which I have access, which one is most likely to be useful to me?      For bitcoin, that utility comes in two flavors. One is predictability. People turn their local currencies into bitcoin because they are looking for a way to store value that’s disconnected from local political and economic realities. Everyone knows about bitcoin’s fixed token supply as well as its largely unchangeable monetary policy, making it out of reach for governments broadly.      The other reason, which may be even more important, is liquidity. People want to be sure that when they decide to sell there will always be someone there who wants to buy at the market price.      So, even though in local terms bitcoin can be viewed as quite expensive, it is the consensus option. People can and do choose to buy other tokens, but this “long tail” of crypto investing is incredibly, and increasingly, diverse as the number of tokens to pick from expands. They’re more speculative because there is little or no consensus. That could change but the so-called first mover advantage and the network effect that bitcoin carries with it has been incredibly powerful. To put it simply, bitcoin is so useful because it’s what everybody uses.    Why is dogecoin rising?    For most of this year, I’ve increasingly come to believe that dogecoin is acting like that now. Just as bitcoin is the consensus pick for people looking for “predictable moneyness” in their currency, dogecoin is looking like the consensus pick for people who want “meme-y wackiness” in their currency.      That certainly seems to be the case among the Elon Musks, Slim Jims and Mark Cubans of the world, not to mention a growing share of meme culture broadly.      See also: Dogecoin No Longer Pup After Tripling Past $50B, Exceeding UK Bank Barclays      This was highlighted on Conagra Brands’ corporate earnings call earlier this week. Conagra is not a hip company. It owns a formidable basket of old-world brands including Slim Jim (smoked meat sticks), Marie Callender's (a restaurant chain where I ate at once or twice in the 1990s) and Hunt's Tomatoes (my mother’s favorite) along with more than a dozen others.      But when it came time to talk about recent wins, Conagra’s CEO highlighted his team’s “dogecoin engagement strategy” as key. Dogecoin has helped double Slim Jim’s Twitter followers, boosting engagement by more than 500%. Sean Connolly, the CEO, credited the dogecoin community with “playing a large part” in delivering Slim Jim the ultimate win in Adweek’s March Madness-themed brand face-off earlier this month.      Doge has become the joke currency to beat. Everybody wants to be in on the joke, which pushes up the price, which makes the joke even bigger. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle. Sort of like bitcoin but for the luls.      Now, this could all end very badly: Lots of people buying DOGE at these prices don’t know the true story. As they say, easy come, easy go. But at least for now it sure looks like dogecoin is the gold standard of joke currencies, and maybe that’s just enough.

42386506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdUv,1618594499,ENS Is Minting NFTs of 23 Top Level Domains. Here’s What That Means,"The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has minted non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing 25 top-level domains owned by domain name system (DNS) company Uni Registry & Naming. These include domains such as “.hiphop,” “.click,” “.game,” and “.audio,” among a number of others.      Uni Registry & Naming (UNR) is auctioning off 23 of these top-level domains (TLDs). Winners will receive both the TLD and an NFT representing the ENS version. The NFT acts as part of the mechanism that easily allows TLD owners to hold control of their TLD on ENS.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    Top-level domains are the last segment of a domain name and are rarely sold. Perhaps the most popular example of a TLD is “.com” while in crypto, the TLD “.io” is highly sought after. Overall, there are only about 1,500 TLDs.      ENS allows Ethereum users to put “human readable names” in place of long wallet or service addresses, making it easier for individuals to transfer funds, use smart contracts or otherwise develop projects. ENS also allows owners to use it with TLDs you already hold. For example, if whoever owns “.xyz” on DNS can register it on ENS.      As Brantly Millegan, director of operations at ENS, describes it, “ENS is an Internet naming protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS names are mostly used to simplify receiving payments in any cryptocurrency and for decentralized websites, though they can store any arbitrary information. ENS is integrated in over 200 services, like Coinbase, Uniswap and the Brave browser.”      UNR says this is the first instance in which both a TLD and an NFT representing the ENS version are being auctioned. The NFTs were minted using the ERC-721 NFT standard.      The auction represents another interesting use case for NFTs that go beyond the massive popularity that digital artwork NFTs, for example, have experienced and show just one way that people are continuing to expand their use cases.    TLD and ENS and DNS and NFT, oh my!    If you don’t pay much attention to internet infrastructure, terms like DNS and TLD aren’t ones you think about every day, but they’re foundational to the way we navigate the web.      Milligan explains that a TLD acts like “real estate” on DNS, which is the naming system on which the whole internet works.      If a TLD is like real estate, then you can think of DNS as the town and TLDs as the neighborhoods. The owners of TLDs can lease houses out to individual sites.      The security company Cloudflare describes navigating DNS as the way “humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.”      When you visit a website online, you don’t type in the long string of numbers that makes up an IP address – you type in the domain name.      Similarly, an ENS is a blockchain-based extension of DNS that enables new things like crypto payments.      “DNS makes things like the web user-friendly. ENS makes things like crypto payments user-friendly,” said Milligan. “Don't like having to see, copy and paste, and otherwise interact with crypto addresses? ENS solves the problem.”      He says the bottom line is that it should be increasingly easier for people to use a traditional DNS name as their ENS name for crypto payments.    “Don't like .eth but want the benefits of ENS? Use a DNS name.”    Additionally, if someone owns a TLD they have the right to issue and sell second-level domains. Again, take “.com” as an example. If you have “example.com,” you are getting it from the company that owns and manages the .com TLD.    Benefits of owning a TLD on ENS    Miillegan said these NFTs represent control of an entire TLD on ENS.      “You'd become the owner of a TLD on both DNS and ENS,” said Millegan in a message. “Any DNS/TLD owner can claim their TLD on ENS. What is unique here is that an organization is auctioning off 23 DNS/TLDs and they've already claimed the ENS versions too, such that the winner of the auction will get both already ready to go.”    Read more: Cloudflare Unveils Gateway to Distributed Web With ENS, IPFS Integration    “This is an important step in bringing together the worlds of traditional DNS and blockchain-based ENS in a complementary way, in which owning a name on DNS automatically implies owning the same on ENS on the Ethereum blockchain, "" Millegan added.      “If they've ever wanted to own a TLD on DNS and ENS, this is their chance,” he said.    What the winner gets    An open auction for the NFTs, which closes on April 23, is currently up on NFT marketplace OpenSea. A pre-registered auction will follow on UNR’s platform from April 28 to April 30.      In a blog post announcing the auction, OpenSea compared TLDs to scarce assets like IP spectrum and internet fiber that are key to the functionality of the Internet.    Read more: It’s an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?    “Each TLD already generates its own subscription revenue. The future owners can not only use domains within their namespaces as they see fit, but also adjust their pricing models and monetize thousands of premium names and registry-owned inventory,” it continued.      The auction winner would receive ownership rights to the top-level domain asset; ownership rights to the NFT representing their TLD on ENS (and therefore essentially the ENS version of the TLD); control of the entire TLD namespace on DNS and ENS, including all current subscription revenue streams; and the ability to further develop and monetize their assets.",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | ENS,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/16/ens-is-minting-nfts-of-23-top-level-domains-heres-what-that-means,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfbf46a2f6f5fdaccce8efb5b94acac02b10f552-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Specifically, bitcoin does not compete effectively with fiat currencies because of its unstable price, said Alex Wong, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission created by Congress in October to evaluate the U.S.-China relationship.      During its hearing Thursday Wong made the comment after he asked an expert witness about the accuracy of Thiel’s recent claim that bitcoin would be a threat to the U.S. and that it would benefit Beijing.      “I think the characteristics that make bitcoin attractive make it not really competitive with fiat currencies because when you buy a bitcoin, you don’t really know it’s going to be twice as much or 20% less tomorrow,” Wong said. “It is extremely volatile.”      Yaya Fanusie, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and the expert witness in question, responded that the American entrepreneur’s concerns are “overblown.”      Fanusie said Thiel was referring to the fact that computing power to mine bitcoin is heavily concentrated in China, so the country could be able to hold and control bitcoin. In reality, he claimed, that would not be an issue due to the bitcoin network’s decentralized nature.      Read More: Are 51% Attacks a Real Threat to Bitcoin?      “If there were ever a case where there was so much national security leverage there or disadvantage, it’s not like additional mining couldn’t be built outside of China,” Fanusie said.      Thiel, the co-founder of digital payment giant PayPal, a bitcoin maximalist and early backer of Ethereum, has been critical of American tech companies such as Facebook and Google for their ties to China. He also co-founded the technology firm Palantir in 2004, whose clients include the CIA and FBI intelligence agencies, according to TechCrunch.      Bitcoin is not as effective for busting sanctions as it appears and stablecoins are more likely to compete with fiat currencies in the future, according to Wong.      “It is less likely they compete with the U.S. dollar than it is to countries that have limited access to regular dollars and use stablecoins as the substitute,” Wong said of stablecoins.

42386501,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdOd,1618591030,"Coinbase Misses Out on Dogecoin Listing as Meme Token Rallies 6,000%+ on Binance","Coinbase, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that went public this week with a direct listing of its shares on Nasdaq, is missing out on the latest frenzy whipping up gasps and chortles in digital asset markets: a ferocious rally in dogecoin that has pushed returns on the doggy-faced meme token to more than 6,000% for the year to date.      And it's not just the price inducing the saliva. DOGE, a digital token that was launched as a joke in 2013, has boasted an astonishingly high daily trading volume, exceeding even that of ether, the native token of the popular Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest cryptocurrency overall after bitcoin.      Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has not given any hints that it would list dogecoin. “Although DOGE is not available to trade, you can add it to your watchlist, read news and more with a Coinbase account,” according to a page on the exchange's website. Press officials with the company didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.      New shareholders of Coinbase might wonder, however, about the competitive disadvantage given that some of the exchange's biggest global rivals have listed DOGE and appear to be lapping up the sudden spike in trading.      According to the website CoinGecko, most of the trading volume in dogecoin in the past 24 hours has come from the big exchanges Binance, OKEx and Huobi.      ""OKEx listed DOGE back in 2019 after determining that there was robust public demand for the asset, despite the fact that it's a 'meme coin,'"" an OKEx press representative told CoinDesk. ""DOGE is one of the oldest crypto assets out there and has a strong community supporting it.""      A Binance representative declined to comment on why the exchange listed DOGE.      ""We really feel the passion from fans of blockchain and cryptocurrency towards dogecoin,"" Huobi co-founder Du Jun told CoinDesk, in a comment forwarded by a press representative via the messaging app WeChat. ""Dogecoin has evolved from a pure meme token to a very special pop culture phenomenon.""      The representative added a statement of caution, however, that dogecoin has historically held little appeal as a promising blockchain project.      ""We also want to warn our users that the project behind dogecoin almost has had zero technology breakthroughs, and the DOGE holders are highly concentrated,"" Du said. ""The top 10 dogecoin addresses hold about 41.35% of all circulating dogecoin. This means that a small number of the dogecoin investors have power over prices and investors should be cautious as they get into dogecoin.""      Some DOGE lovers have asked whether the token might get an even bigger price pump if it gets listed on Coinbase. Analysts for the cryptocurrency data firm Messari recently wrote that tokens experience an average 91% return in their first five days after a listing on the U.S. exchange.      ""WHAT IF coinbase were to add #dogecoin on 4/20???"" the Twitter user @yaybitcoin wrote Friday.      This isn't the first time posters across social media have questioned Coinbase's seeming unwillingness to make dogecoin trading available.      None other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has spoken adoringly of dogecoin, wrote on Twitter in March that he also wants Coinbase to allow the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency on its platform.      Dogecoin has also received endorsement from entrepreneurs including billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, which recently announced it would accept the token as payment for game tickets and merchandise.      As of press time, dogecoin was trading at $0.33, more than doubling in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20.      It's now the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, passing cardano, polkadot and uniswap, per Messari data.      Dogecoin's market capitalization, at roughly $43 billion, is on par with that of the giant U.K. bank Barclays, which traces its history back to the 18th century.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,DOGE | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/16/coinbase-misses-out-on-dogecoin-listing-as-meme-token-rallies-6000-on-binance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64a5092ca947b5628e6f6e6a265feef03b7355d6-1200x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386507,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdWB,1618590872,Examining the Split Reactions to the Coinbase Listing,"Coinbase on Wall Street is widely seen as validating bitcoin, but a lot of bitcoiners aren't feeling validated. Why are so many hardcore bitcoiners so disgruntled?      Well, as others have pointed out, Coinbase just isn’t all that punk rock. The cypherpunk movement from which Bitcoin sprang advocated for privacy and self-empowerment in face of meddling governments and corporations. A centralized exchange – even one responsible for onboarding tens of millions of people into the revolution – is just another intermediary. (And an expensive one at that: 97% of Coinbase's revenues come from transaction fees that are above industry averages.)    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “The fact that a company like Coinbase went public makes it clear that custodial solutions have product-market fit and, honestly, it’s sad,” perennial nomad and Bitcoin promoter Katie Ananina said in a direct message. If punks chant “Oy,” bitcoiners rally around “not your keys, not your coins,” a reminder that “radical ownership” only comes from taking possession of your money.      In a similar vein, Coinbase’s public listing solidifies the exchange’s place among the Silicon Valley and Wall Street set. For some, the exchange’s “mission-focused” attitude towards crypto adoption is an artifice. So, asking bitcoiners whether they like Coinbase is like asking crust-punks whether they like Johnny Rotten.      Prominent Bitcoin personality Brekkie von Bitcoin says he bought his first BTC from the exchange but thinks Coinbase “has lost the thread.” Perhaps most glaring is that the Silicon Valley-based company has signed surveillance contracts with the government. “They used to be revolutionary,” he said.      Then there’s the exchange’s poly-crypto approach to the industry. Von Bitcoin admits Coinbase was a needed agonist for bitcoin but it’s guilty of “promoting every altcoin under the sun.” New users might confuse various altcoins for cheaper versions of BTC, a sort of identity theft.      Nowhere is this more apparent than in Coinbase’s willingness to list bitcoin forks. Investor Stephen Cole went as far as saying “Coinbase attacked Bitcoin” by supporting competing, payments-friendly versions – “BitcoinXT. Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Cash.” – of the original cryptocurrency.      Some are turned off for less ideological reasons, namely Coinbase’s history of going down during market rallies and higher-than-average trading fees. Not to mention the perennial complaints of lackluster customer support.      Bitcoiners are a strong-willed, vocal bunch. But even their calls to blacklist the exchange might be drowned out by traders barking for the exchange to list dogecoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/16/examining-the-split-reactions-to-the-coinbase-listing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3ad97237dd225c07a64fdd87f3ba542d76c6a6a-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For comparison, Lloyds Banking Group has a market cap of $42 billion, Bank of New York is at $42 billion and Credit Agricole is at $43 billion.  DOGE has rallied nearly 160% in the past 24 hours and is trading around $0.37 at press time. It's climbed sixfold over the past week.  DOGE’s market cap has also surpassed bitcoin cash (BCH) and chainlink (LINK) and is now ranked as the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency, according to Messari.  On Thursday, the smoked meat stick vendor Slim Jim gave Dogecoin a shout-out on its earnings call after several DOGE snack memes populated social media.

In the past 24 hours, traders have bought more than 2,000 contracts of the $80,000 call option expiring on April 30, pushing the open interest to 8,476.6 contracts – the highest among the April expiry options listed on the dominant exchange Deribit, according to data tracking website Laevitas.  The tally has increased by 4,000 contracts in the past three weeks in a sign of continued demand for the bullish bet.  Theoretically, the $80,000 call represents a bet that bitcoin would settle above that level on the expiry date.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific period. A put option represents the right to sell.  Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not settled with an offsetting position.  The 80,000 strike call is also the most sought-after option across all maturities, with an open interest of over 15,000 contracts, of which 8,476 contracts are of April 30 expiry, as noted earlier, and over 3,000 will expire at the end of May.  The data is reflective of high price expectations for the next few weeks.  Bitcoin broke out above $60,000 on April 10, marking an end of multi-week price consolidation, and clocked record highs above $64,800 on Wednesday alongside the U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's debut on Nasdaq.

42406228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesuqA,1618570567,Bitcoin Price Drops as Turkey Bans Crypto Payments Amid Currency Crisis,"Billionaire investor Ray Dalio's fear of governments outlawing bitcoin to preserve their monopoly over currencies has come partly true in Turkey.      The currency crisis-riddled country announced a ban on cryptocurrencies as a means of payment early Friday, souring the mood in the bitcoin market. The ban is to take effect April 30.      ""It is considered that their use [crypto assets] in payments may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions due to the above-listed factors, and they include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments,"" the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey said in a press release titled the ""Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments.""      Bitcoin has come under pressure in the past few hours, falling from $63,000 to $60,700 to trade 3% lower on a 24-hour basis. The weakness is almost certainly due to Turkey's decision as it could set a bad precedent for other crisis-riddled countries struggling to protect their currencies. Morocco has already enacted such a ban and India is expected to introduce one shortly.      Dalio warned of coming government curbs last month. ""Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don’t want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control,"" the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, told Yahoo Finance.      Cryptocurrency proponents have long argued that bitcoin is a better means of payment than gold or fiat currencies because its supply is cut by half every four years via a programmed code known as mining reward halving. That puts bitcoin's monetary policy in stark contrast to inflationary policies adopted by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.      Citizens of countries facing high inflation and fiat currency crises, such as Turkey, have turned to bitcoin in the past few years, raising hopes of widespread adoption across the globe. Turkey's inflation topped 16% last week, and its currency, the lira, has depreciated by 10% this year, having dropped by 24% in 2020. The country sold almost 11.7 tons of gold in February, as reported by Arab News.      Readers should note that Turkey's latest ban does not stop Turkish citizens from trading cryptocurrencies. They can still buy bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. However, exchanges could face some complications due to the payments ban.

The price of bitcoin fell and is now at $60,868.91, down 2.69% in the last 24 hours.  According to a report by the official newspaper of the Turkish government and a press release by the central bank on Friday local time, Turkey has introduced the “Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments.” The trading of cryptocurrencies appears to be unaffected by the regulation.      The ban, which is set to go into effect on April 30, follows a similar move by Morocco and a possible coming prohibition in India. It's bound to confirm concerns on the part of some about the wisdom of investing in crypto due to the the possibility of such government prohibitions.      Banning cryptocurrency payments throughout the country comes as the Turkish lira has faced significant outside selling pressure. The currency plunged in foreign exchange markets following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s firing of the nation’s top central banker Naci Agbal in March. Many have turned to cryptocurrency as an alternative method of payment in order to circumvent the issues plaguing the lira.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Zip Co. co-founder Peter Gray said his company was looking to provide trading services through its native app in a bid to further engage its typically young consumers.      The co-founder did not specify when the offering would launch or whether services for stocks would be released before cryptocurrency. Instead, Gray suggested Zip would first roll out the services to its U.S. QuadPay unit totaling 3.8 million customers.      “We’re very keen [to] move on this feature and the U.S., in particular, might be further advanced than Australia,” said Gray who spoke to Dow Jones Newswires on Tuesday.      The co-founder said his company's plans were ""probably more related to crypto or the ability to buy and sell shares from the app rather than the ability to have a no-coupon savings account,"" per the report.      See also: Crypto.com Expanding Payment Card to Australia After Becoming Visa Principal Member      ""Buy now, pay later"" schemes are essentially the next generation of layaway offered by shopping retailers and outlet stores. The current scheme is extremely popular in Australia, offering consumers the ability to take home a product or elect a service with the option of paying for it over a set period with minimal interest.      Generally, $1,000 or less is provided to consumers, regardless of their credit rating. AfterPay, Zip's main rival, kicked off the new layaway model in the country beginning in 2015.
