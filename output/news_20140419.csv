42397562,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYYY,1397911896,"Bitcoin Regulation Roundup: Legislation, Liquidation and Rumor Mill","Regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrencies around the world are shifting. Hardly a day goes by without a central bank issuing a warning on the digital currency. However, it’s not all bad news – as some authorities are taking a much more positive approach.  In CoinDesk’s regulation roundup, Certified Public Accountant and ACFE Certified Fraud Examiner Jason Tyra examines the most significant digital currency news from the world’s regulators and law courts over the past two weeks.  Chinese banks stop handling bitcoin related business  The rumours are true: bitcoin related businesses with Chinese deposit accounts reported receiving verbal notices from their banks last week that transfers to exchanges would no longer be honoured, causing bitcoin prices on exchanges worldwide to plunge to their lowest levels in more than six months. Though the move was obviously centrally directed, the People’s Bank of China has yet to make an official announcement, over a week later.  Curiously, the People’s Bank of China announced on 11th April that it would not seek a ban on bitcoin.  China’s government and central bank have been ambivalent about bitcoin from the beginning, resulting in periodic rumours of an impending ban. The spread of cryptocurrency among Chinese users has often been cited as the driving force behind bitcoin’s dramatic rise during the latter half of 2013. The Chinese government, on the other hand, is believed to see bitcoin as a threat to capital controls, while claiming that restrictions are necessary to protect Chinese banks from the risk posed by bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s price rebounded above $500 in the week following announcement of the Chinese restrictions. Nevertheless, at least two Chinese exchanges suggested that they might consider moving to other countries if regulatory action made their businesses unsustainable.  Brazil to tax bitcoin investors, not users  Following the lead of the US Internal Revenue Service, the Brazilian tax authority has declared that bitcoin sales are subject to capital gains taxes, but set a 35,000 real (approximately $16,000) per transaction exemption. As a result, the proverbial cup of coffee purchased with bitcoins in that country will not be considered a taxable event.  Brazil’s announcement makes the country one of the most bitcoin friendly in the world. Brazilian bitcoiners mostly welcomed the announcement, which makes bitcoin a realistic alternative to the dollar for those who prefer not to transact in the real.  The country’s currency has fluctuated in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, in response to monetary policies meant to stimulate demand, that have been implemented and then rolled back by the United States and other nations. As recently as last summer, the mere suggestion that the US Federal Reserve would taper its bond buying campaign in the near future touched off a punishing round of inflation for Brazilian consumers as foreign investors.  US Congressman seeks currency treatment for bitcoin  Texas Congressman Steve Stockman announced that he will introduce legislation designating bitcoin as legal tender and directing the IRS to treat it as currency, rather than property. In the United States, the term 'legal tender' applies to any payment method which can be used and must be accepted to extinguish a debt.  Several US states have considered or enacted legislation in recent years identifying gold or other commodities as legal tender. However, these have mostly been symbolic gestures intended to protest inflationary policies at the federal level. Congressman Stockman’s proposal is believed to mark the first time that a nation state has considered a law to officially recognize bitcoin.  Due to rules governing Congressional lawmaking, the likelihood that Stockman’s legislation will make it to the floor for a vote is considered exceptionally low.  Mt. Gox to liquidate  A Japanese bankruptcy judge denied Mt Gox’s petition for reorganization, leaving the company no choice but to enter liquidation. Citing the plan, the judge described it as “unlikely to be successful”. The court also pointed out that Mt. Gox’s management team, led by CEO Mark Karpeles, lacks the confidence of customers and other creditors.  Karpeles’ troubles seem to be multiplying in the United States as well. The bankruptcy judge handling Mt. Gox’s US bankruptcy case suggested that the company may be denied certain key protections if its CEO failed to appear for hearings. FinCEN has also subpoenaed Karpeles, who asked for more time to obtain an attorney before responding.  Though Karpeles has not been charged with any crime or arrested, either in Japan or the United States, this week’s indictment of Charlie Shrem is unlikely to be a source of comfort as to the likelihood of being taken into custody if he enters the US.  Canadian Senate continues bitcoin study  A Canadian Senate panel heard from a selection of bitcoin stakeholders, including the Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance, and others, as it kicked off an 18-month study of whether and how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Testimony on 9th April included a demonstration of a bitcoin ATM and a bitcoin-denominated purchase – of cupcakes – to help lawmakers understand how bitcoins are used in transactions.

42397567,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYdT,1397901458,Bitcoin Offers Monetising Solutions for Online Publishers,"Nick Chowdrey is a business and technology writer and proud digital native. Currently based in Brighton, UK, he is a technical writer at Crunch Accounting and co-founder of Brighton-based bitcoin community Bitcoin Brighton. Here, he explores how bitcoin can play a part in the business of online content.      Making money from online content is hard work. A variety of different models and tactics have been tried down the years, but a solid solution is yet to be found. Could bitcoin be the answer everyone is looking for?    Before the Internet age it cost a lot of money and resources to publish content. Newspaper publishers, for example, have to pay for the paper, the printing press and the distribution. In contrast, the web provides publishers with a relatively inexpensive – if not free – platform, with very low production costs.  The result is lots and lots of free content, which is great for consumers, but bad news for content professionals because it makes it difficult to make any money.  Monetising online content  Advertising is one of the ways that digital publishers have tried to make money from their product, but it requires the site to get a viral amount of hits before the option becomes a viable one. Not only does this stifle competition, it clutters up sites with unwanted and often intrusive commercials.  Another option is the content wall. This allows users to access free content for a limited amount of time before requiring a paid subscription. Sites that do this currently are the Daily Telegraph, The New York Times and The Sun – each with varying success. The Sun lost 62% of its traffic after adopting its paywall. On the other hand, The New York Times reports that its own rakes in $150 million a year.  The paywall model is increasingly popular, but there are still serious limitations. It clearly doesn’t work for every audience, which limits the amount of content publishers that can use it.  The main issue with this model is that web users consume content in a very disjointed way – being more likely to flit between all kinds of sites than loyally stick to just one or two. To many web users, a blanket subscription to a whole site may seem like a waste of money, especially when so much content is available for free elsewhere.  Bitcoin vs fiat paywalls  This is where bitcoin comes in. Micropayments offer an option much better suited to the way content is consumed in the online world, giving users the option to pay a very small amount for individual items, rather than a large amount for a whole box of content.  Micropayments have previously not been an option for online publishers for many reasons. Paying by debit or credit card requires the user to enter all their payment information to verify their identity, creating a barrier to entry that easily dissuades the fickle Internet user. Payment networks dealing in traditional currency also charge substantial transaction fees, making multiple, small payments an impractical option.  Conversely, bitcoin allows users to make instant, virtually fee-less, international micropayments with a single click of the mouse. Some companies are already coming up with solutions for online publishers: using BitWallhttp://www.bitwall.io/, for example, you can implement a bitcoin paywall on your site with just a few simple lines of code.  This option was recently trialled by the Chicago Sun-Times, proving that big media companies are already showing interest, if not yet considering implementing such a solution.  Tipping and the bitcoin community  The question is: will users change their behaviour to engage with this idea? If you think of the process more like tipping, there’s no reason why not. People are happy to tip in person using actual cash, so why would they not do the same online using bitcoin, which is comparable to digital cash – especially when the process is as easy as clicking a ‘like’ button?  Indeed, there’s already evidence of the cryptocurrency community being very generous with micropayments and donations. The culture of tipping on the bitcoin subreddit has led to startup ChangeTip's developing platform for bitcoin tipping on Twitter, Github and soon, even Facebook – lest we forget the infamous Jamaican bobsleigh team fundraiser by the dogecoin community.  If publishers can find a source of revenue better than advertising, there could be a shift away from producing content solely for hits and shares, and back towards a focus on quality. It would perhaps reduce the amount of intrusive banner ads as well.  Whether or not the idea catches on relies on a number of factors, including how much more widely adopted bitcoin becomes, how bitcoin paywalls affect site traffic and how much investment goes into startups like BitWall. The foundations, at least, are laid – and as an online content professional myself, I’m certainly counting on a shakeup.
