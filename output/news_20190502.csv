The Redmond, Washington-based software firm will support Quorum, JPM's private enterprise version of ethereum, through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, the firms said. They will look to support adoption of the network through their new partnership, after signing a memorandum of understanding.  As a result, Quorum ""will become the first distributed ledger platform available through [the] Azure Blockchain Service, enabling J.P. Morgan and Microsoft customers to build and scale blockchain networks in the cloud,"" the companies said in a press release.  A spokesperson for New York-based JPM said via email that ""Microsoft will drive preference to the Quorum stack for Blockchain applications built on Azure."" JPM will also build its own first-party applications for the service.  Umar Farooq, JPM's global head of blockchain, said in a statement that Quorum has been successful over the four years it has been operational, with organizations worldwide using the technology.  Now, ""Azure will bring unique strengths to enterprise clients using Quorum,"" he said.  JPMCoin and the Xbox  Quorum will be used to support both JPM and Microsoft's blockchain programs, as well as the bank's Interbank Information Network, its internal cryptocurrency JPMCoin and royalty payment points for the Xbox gaming platform.  Through the partnership, both firms will try to address enterprise, developer and vendor needs for building on blockchain applications using Azure's cloud servers.  Microsoft will also provide support for the network's users, including engineering support.  The move will make Quorum more easily available to customers through the Azure platform, said Microsoft executive vice president of business development Peggy Johnson in a statement. She added:  ""As digital transformation extends beyond the walls of an individual organization, companies need solutions that enable them to securely share their business processes and data.""  Thursday's move raise the question of whether the bank will still spin Quorum off into its own self-funded entity. Rumors first emerged in March 2018 that JPM would let Quorum launch as an independent platform, largely due to its own success.  JPMorgan is ""still exploring options"" for a possible spinoff, sources familiar with the bank's thinking said Thursday.

42430452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtDph,1556831844,DAI Stablecoin's Stability Fee Nears 20% After Latest MakerDAO Vote,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have now voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 19.5 percent.    __________    The dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI is still trading below one dollar but is now considered to be in a ""stable"" position.  From 0.5 percent to now 16.5 percent, the Stability Fee has been increased 33 fold over the past three months. Now, MakerDAO token holders have again voted to increase fees by another 3 percent to sit at 19.5 percent.  According to meeting minutes published on Reddit, COO of the MakerDAO Foundation Steven Becker highlighted during today's governance and risk call:  ""In using the Stability Fee, progress has been made. The peg is stable, just a few percentage [points] below where it needs to be.""  Since February, token holders behind the primary lending platform for DAI issuance – MakerDAO – has been increasing what is called the ""Stability Fee"" in efforts to make DAI loans more expensive. In doing so, the aim is to retract market supply of DAI and push DAI price up to dollar valuation.  The outcome of this week's vote according to head of community development Richard Brown was ""a neck and neck race"" between 2 and 3 percent. Starting Friday, a secondary vote will be held to execute this increase into the programmatic lending system.  Taking a step back, MakerDAO is the most popular decentralized finance (DeFi) application in the cryptocurrency space to date, according to crypto analytics platform DeFi Pulse. It holds over $300 million worth of ether, with the second most popular DeFI application – crypto lending application Compound – only holding about $33 million.  Soon, MakerDAO will also hold millions worth of other cryptocurrencies outside of ether through an ambitious upgrade to introduce what is called ""multi-collateral DAI."" For now, the stablecoin DAI is solely backed by native ethereum cryptocurrency, ether, and has a fixed supply cap of 100 million.  Meeting details  Given a persisting imbalance in DAI supply and demand, certain community members have advocated in the past that the supply cap on DAI be reduced as an additional measure to the Stability Fee increases.  However, as stated by Vishesh Choudhry of the MakerDAO Foundation Risk Team, consecutive Stability Fee increases do seem to be having a measurable impact on DAI price which presently sits between $0.97 and $0.98.  “What we’ve really seen is that as we’ve increased the Stability Fee over the past few weeks, the DAI price has stabilized a bit,” said Choudhry during today’s call. “There has been a lot going on with [ether] and with Tether so as always take everything with a grain of salt but I think that’s a positive indicator that what we’re doing actually has an impact.”  Cyrus Younessi – risk management lead at the MakerDAO Foundation – agreed saying that it seemed like “we’re headed in the right direction” and that perhaps more consideration should now be given over when to halt Stability Fee increases.  Younessi asked:  ""When do we know the peg has been fixed? What kind of indicators are we looking for?...What's the amount of time we're comfortable observing DAI trade around $1.00 before we consider corresponding [Stability Fee] changes?""

42430445,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtDdh,1556824811,U.S. DOJ Moves to Detain Defendant in Crypto 'Shadow Banking' Case,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to detain Reginald Fowler until his trial for operating an unlicensed money transmission business which may have processed funds for the Bitfinex crypto exchange.  In a court filing Wednesday – which was shared online but is not yet available on the government's Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system – first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange and assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino detail concerns that Fowler may flee the country if he is not held in custody, citing his ""disregard"" for the FBI's investigation last year.  Moreover, because ""this scheme involves a staggering amount of money,"" the U.S. government believes that Fowler may be able to avoid prosecution by accessing funds around the world.  ""The government, through email search warrants, has obtained a document entitled 'Master US Workbook,' which details the financial operations of the scheme as of January 2019,"" the filing says, adding:  ""This workbook indicates that the scheme had received over $740 million in 2018 alone. It lists approximately sixty different bank accounts, held at both domestic and international banks, with a combined account balance of over $345 million as of January 2019. Notably, this workbook indicates that approximately $50 million is held in domestic accounts, with the rest located abroad.""  Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission service earlier this week by the U.S Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  Alongside an associate, Tel Aviv-based Ravid Yosef, Fowler is alleged to have provided cryptocurrency exchanges with banking services illicitly and may be an operator of Crypto Capital, the payment processor at the heart of the Bitfinex/Tether scandal.  Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) investigation may be one reason why Crypto Capital's funds were frozen, which in turn hampered Bitfinex's ability to process its customers' withdrawals.  It was Bitfinex's loss of access to some $850 million through Crypto Capital which resulted in its taking out a $625 million loan from Tether, the stablecoin issuer it is closely affiliated with.  The filing appears to confirm this, noting that ""recent public reporting, which is corroborated in part through interviews conducted in the course of this investigation, indicates that companies associated with defendant have failed to return $851 million to a client of defendant's shadow bank.""  Other crimes  Fowler may have also been involved in other crimes, the filing said. Roughly $14,000 in counterfeit bills – largely $100 bills – were recovered from Fowler's office, indicating that he may have been involved in producing counterfeit money.  ""Thus, it may be that this case is only one of multiple criminal and legal proceedings facing defendant,"" the filing says.

42430446,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtDbh,1556818272,Code For Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake Blockchain to Be Finalized Next Month,"Code for ethereum's highly-anticipated proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain is on course to be finalized as early as sometime next month.  In a bi-weekly call between ethereum developers, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said that code specifications for the first phase of ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake network were ""on track"" to be finalized by June 30. Such specifications are effectively blueprints for developers looking to work on ethereum's next-generation blockchain.  ""I've been continuing to fine comb Phase Zero in preparation for the spec freeze which we're targeting for the 30th of June,"" Drake remarked on the call. ""We're still very much on track. Still, [code] simplifications are coming through which is great and the process of fine combing is also for finding final bugs.""  Ethereum has been inching toward a major upgrade, dubbed ethereum 2.0, which would radically change the how the $17 billion network creates blocks and verifies transactions. As explained by founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin in a recent interview at ethereum conference ETHCapetown, ethereum 2.0 has ""two major flagship components.""  ""One is Casper, which is our proof-of-stake algorithm which replaces mining...with something that we consider to be much more efficient,"" Buterin said at the time. ""The second part is sharding which is this massive scalability improvement which happens because you don't need every computer in the network to process every transaction in the network any more.  Buterin added that with sharding, he anticipates a ""1,000 factor increase in scalability"" to the network. However, sharding will only come in the later two phases of ethereum 2.0 roll-out. The first phase – dubbed Phase Zero – strictly launches ethereum's new proof-of-stake blockchain.  The road to 'beacon chain' launch  Called the ""Beacon Chain,"" Phase Zero will activate a new block validation system in which validators – instead of miners – stake tokens on the network and vote on different block proposals.  As stated by ethereum developer Ben Edgington in a past blog post, the beacon chain will fulfill a number of roles including: managing validators and their stakes; organising validators into committees to vote on the proposed blocks; applying the consensus rules; applying rewards and penalties to validators; and more.  Rewards for validators in this new system are calculated based on how many tokens are staked, as well as, the overall number of staked tokens on the network. Buterin recently proposed an increase to validator reward issuance in the ethereum 2.0 system that will have to be finalized for Phase Zero execution.  ""By the end of Phase Two, it's a complete system,"" Buterin explained during his interview. ""But for Phase Zero and Phase One, it's still useful for some things. Currently, Phase Zero is very close to completion.""  And once completed, as Drake said today:  ""One of the things that might be possible when we do a spec freeze – thanks to all these simplifications both cosmetic and substantive – is that we might be able to fit the state transition function of Phase Zero in 512 lines of code...All of ethereum 2.0 in terms of state transaction function including both the Beacon Chain and the shards might fit into 1,000 lines of code which is amazing.""  Drake offered the caveat that there are ""a few black boxes"" that have yet to be figured out with ethereum 2.0 designs. Still, many ethereum 2.0 implementors are eager to get testing for Phase Zero underway.  To this point, Joseph Delong – senior software engineer at Consensys – highlighted that an in-person meting between various ethereum 2.0 implementation teams would be held in New York on May 16.

42430441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtDXh,1556809231,22% of Institutional Investors Have Some Digital Asset Exposure: Fidelity,"Institutional investors are increasingly open to finding a place for digital assets in their portfolios, suggests new research.  A survey conducted by Fidelity Investments and published Thursday found that, already, around 22 percent of investors have some exposure to digital assets, while 40 percent say they are open to taking the plunge in the next five years. Of those that have exposure, most investments were made in the last three years.  Aimed to gain an understanding of how institutions, financial advisors and investors perceive digital assets generally and as part of an investment portfolio, the survey also found that over half (57 percent) prefer to invest in digital assets directly, while 72 percent favor investment products that hold digital assets. Fifty-seven percent said they'd prefer to buy investment products that hold digital asset firms.  For the research, the company said it polled over 400 U.S. institutional investors, including pensions, family offices, crypto and traditional hedge funds and financial advisors, as well as endowments and foundations.  “We’ve seen a maturation of interest in digital assets from early adopters, like crypto hedge funds, to traditional institutional investors like family offices and endowments,” said Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital AssetsSM, a provider of institutional custody and trading services for digital assets.  Jessop continued:  “More institutional investors are engaging with digital assets, either directly or through service providers, as the potential impact of blockchain technology on financial markets – new and old – becomes more readily apparent.”  Regarding the appeal of digital assets to investors, the survey further found that the ""characteristics"" of digital assets had the widest appeal, with 74–80 percent citing that option. Just under half (47 percent), meanwhile, said digital assets appealed as an innovative technology, and 46 percent pointed to a low correlation to other assets.  On the negative side, price volatility, lack of regulatory clarity and a lack of fundamentals were seen as obstacles to investment.  “Price volatility, which was a primary concern of survey respondents, may dampen as the underlying custody, trading and financing infrastructure continues to develop in a direction that traditional market participants are familiar with.” Jessop said.

Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), said during the company's Q1 earnings call that the ongoing bear market has been ""helpful"" for Bakkt, which was initially scheduled to launch last December, then delayed to January, then again indefinitely.  ""It’s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency [market] went into what they call a winter, [because] it took some of the heat off the timetable to launch,"" Sprecher said, adding that this was just one benefit.  Another benefit is that many crypto startups' valuations have declined, creating buying opportunities for Bakkt, he said, explaining:  ""We’ve actually been looking at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn’t have been available to us if the market was really hot, because the valuations were really hot.""  Indeed, on Monday Bakkt announced it had acquired Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC), which is developing a crypto-asset storage platform. (The price was not disclosed.)  That being said, the industry is continuing to mature, and Bakkt is working to help it do so, Sprecher said. The company has brought on a number of engineers through its recent acquisitions (Bakkt has also acquired some assets, including personnel, from Rosenthal Collins Group, an independent futures commission merchant).  ""There's a lot of interest still in this market,"" he said.  Regulatory questions  One of the primary causes for Bakkt's delays are regulatory in nature – specifically, it is widely believed that the firm's plan to custody bitcoin itself under federal supervision and settle contracts through its parent firm's clearinghouse have placed it in a regulatory gray area.  While Sprecher did not specifically address what the holdups were, he did note that regulators are still trying to understand the asset class and how to regulate it.  ""You can’t really get into the true institutional markets that we serve without being highly regulated and highly trusted so the juice is worth the squeeze,"" he said, adding:  ""It’s going well now, there were a lot of things that had to get sorted out with jurisdiction and custody and … banks and those issues that in my mind need to be resolved before adoption of the asset class and we’ve been at the forefront of [this].""  The bear market has helped in this sense as well, by giving both regulators and legislators in the U.S. some additional time to determine how they might eventually regulate this space, Sprecher said.  Sprecher did not address how much ICE has spent on Bakkt to date, though Scott Hill, chief financial officer at ICE, previously said that the firm planned to invest between $20 and $25 million in 2019. This figure comes on top of $182 million Bakkt raised from investors.

Nikhil Rathi told CNBC in an interview published Thursday that the LSE has noticed several “interesting” ideas from rival stock exchanges and will see which ones “gain market traction” before making any moves in the space itself.  Other stock exchanges have been more proactive with the technology to date. The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is notably rebuilding its ageing CHESS settlement system with help from distributed ledger startup Digital Asset.  Further, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) recently started allowing the listing of tokenized bonds, securities and funds. While Switzerland’s top stock exchange, SIX, also aims to launch a blockchain platform to speed up trading later this year.  Other stock exchanges, including in Jamaica, Thailand and Spain, have also announced initiatives around blockchain and digital assets.  Perhaps hinting at areas in which the LSE might already be eyeing the tech, Rathi told CNBC:  “You can certainly see distributed ledger technology having an application in the issuance process. I can see that technology being used in settlement too.”  Early this year, LSE Group led a $20 million seed funding round for capital markets blockchain startup Nivaura. Rathi also joined the startup's board at the time.  Nivaura aims to automate the entire life cycle for the issuance of financial instruments – bonds, equities, derivatives – using blockchain technology. LSE Group and Nivaura have also worked together on the issuance of tokenized securities as part of the regulatory sandbox program of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  In a related effort last month, blockchain startup 20|30 raised £3 million ($3.93 million) in a sale of tokenized shares in a test environment on a LSE Group-operated platform.  For now, though, the stock exchange appears appears in no rush to make any direct use of the technology.

The exchange has just partnered with blockchain analytics startup Elliptic to boost its compliance and security capabilities, Elliptic announced Thursday. The new partnership – the third relating to compliance in the last two months – will help Binance combat money laundering as it grows into new jurisdictions, the exchange’s chief compliance officer Samuel Lim said.  Elliptic's software helps identify potential transactions linked to illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing, and is claimed to have monitored risks for transactions worth “several trillion dollars.”  Last month, Binance also partnered with blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace to enhance its anti-money laundering processes like tracing the source of on-chain funds and matching user identities to problematic wallet addresses.  The exchange also works with IdentityMind on know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, thanks to a deal signed in March, as well as with Chainalysis, Refinitiv (formerly the financial risk division of Thomson Reuters) and the Blockchain Transparency Institute.  Binance was recently identified as having a “high” regulatory risk based on “exposure to anonymous activity” by reg-tech startup Coinfirm. The exchange’s KYC processes were also said to be “the industry’s least rigorous,” according to a Bloomberg report last year.  Since then, the exchange has been addressing that perceived shortfall in procedures.  “We are very serious about improving our compliance standards. We will continue to build our [compliance] team, continue to re-invest in the compliance space,” Lim told CoinDesk last month, adding:  “Compliance is always a quest, you are always on a journey to improve your compliance.”  Binance image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/02/binances-compliance-drive-continues-with-new-elliptic-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd29f8b1caacdbd67c36f3a33425f5151e510ff7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430463,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMtE7h,1556798439,Diamond Standard Launches Blockchain-Powered Token Backed by Real Gems,"As a store of value, diamonds have their advantages over gold. They're small, portable, and easy to grade. But, even though they pack in more value per ounce, diamonds are much harder to standardize into a form of exchange.  Now a company called Diamond Standard believes it has solved that problem by combining a hardware solution with a blockchain twist. How does it work? Gold is often traded in standardized ""bars."" Diamond Standard is aiming to do the same with diamonds.  Diamond Standard sells sets of diamonds in coin-sized discs or credit-card-shaped bars, with each grouping worth exactly as much as other groupings assembled the same way. The Diamond Standard Coin and the Diamond Standard Bar are worth about $10,000 and $100,000 each, respectively.  ""We created a diamond commodity by grouping sets of diamonds in a fair and transparent way,"" said Diamond Standard CEO Cormac Kinney of his encased gems. ""The sets are fungible, and the diamonds are independently certified.""  The new product, Kinney said, ""only became possible with the blockchain, providing a permanent public record for each commodity's diamond geological contents and provenance, and to enable remote auditing and transactions.""  On-chain diamonds  Investors use gold as a store of value and a hedge against other assets. Diamond Standard is betting that investors will find diamonds useful in a similar way once standardization and fungibility are introduced.  “Diamonds are a valuable natural resource, but unusable by institutional investors,"" Kinney said.  By sealing them together, registering each one and tracking their provenance using a blockchain, the company says it has created a way trade diamonds at the speed of cryptocurrency. Owners can store their diamonds in secure vaults and audit them remotely. This allows users to trade the bars on the Diamond Standard exchange without needing to take the risk of carrying them.  That said, users can hold the Diamond Standard bars personally if they want but Kinney foresees that being a small part of the market. Additionally, he expects more than one diamonds-only exchange-traded fund (ETF) to launch with Diamond Standard bars as the underlying asset.  To enhance custody, the company will also make hardware that enables custodians to offer continuous auditability of their holdings over the internet.  Diamond Standard seems to have passed due diligence by a few investors. According to its founder, the year-old startup has more than $10 million in funding, with backing from a variety of investors, including Jamie Dinan, founder of York Capital Management, and Glen Kacher, founder of Light Street Capital.  As Bitcarbon tokens are purchased on Diamond Standard's new exchange, the company purchases diamonds and creates the bars, using computer analysis to create groupings of precisely equal value. Thanks to an NFC chip implanted in each bar and a QR code, owners can track Bitcarbon trades and ownership with a smartphone.  Bitcarbon's base protocol is EOS although Diamond Standard reports that its wallet has multichain functionality so transactions can run across multiple major protocols. At launch, the company will base Bitcarbon on ethereum as an ERC-20 token.  The new exchange applied to be regulated with the Bermuda Monetary Authority.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42430442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8hh,1556797212,3 Price Hurdles That Could Complicate a Bitcoin Rally to $6K,"View  Bitcoin is looking north, having closed above the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) on April 30. Forcing a quick rally to $6,000, however, may be difficult for the bulls, as a number of key resistance levels are lined up in the $5,400–$5,900 range.  The short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is holding above the 30-day MA at $5,199. Bitcoin, however, risks falling back to that level in the next 24-hours, according to the short duration charts.  A close below the 30-day MA would boost the odds of a head-and-shoulders breakdown and a slide to the 50-day moving average, currently at $4,736.  Bitcoin (BTC) is on the offensive, having defended key support, but a rally to $6,000 faces a number of resistance hurdles lined up in the $5,400–$5,900 range.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell more than 5 percent to $5,000 on April 25 after the New York Attorney General's office alleged that Bitfinex had lost $850 million and used a secret loan from affiliated firm Tether to hide the loss.  The price pullback, however, was short-lived. BTC again bounced up from the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) resistance on April 30 and is currently trading at $5,350 on Bitstamp.  Additionally, BTC closed last month above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving averages (EMA), solidifying the long-term bullish breakout, as discussed yesterday.  As a result, a consensus seems to have built in the market place that BTC will likely see a quick rise to $6,000 in the short-term.  While the outlook is indeed bullish, a sharp rally to $6,000 may not be so smooth with the following levels possibly offering stiff resistance.  Resistance 1: 50-week MA at $5,414  BTC is again closing on the (bearish) 50-week moving average (MA), currently at $5,414, which proved a tough nut to crack last week.  At the time, prices had risen to a five-month high of $5,627, but they ended the week well below the 50-week MA. Bitcoin's failure to hold onto gains isn't surprising as the average is still trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  It is often observed that averages serve as resistance if they are biased bearish (sloping downwards). A sustained breakout is more often seen once the average begins to flatten out.  It's worth noting that rejection at the 50-week MA in July and August 2015 almost ended up killing the nascent bull market, as discussed last week.  Another failure to close above the 50-week MA could trigger profit taking, leading a deeper drop below $5,000.  Resistance 2: June 2018 bottom at $5,780  Bitcoin could face stiff resistance at $5,780, the level at which BTC's sell-off from May 2018 highs near $10,000 bottomed out at the end of June. A bounce from $5,780 was followed by a more than 40 percent rally to $8,500 by July 24, further highlighting the importance of the price level.  As a result, the former support could now act as a stiff resistance, more so, as the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the November highs to December lows – one of the widely-tracked Fibonacci ratios – is located at nearby at $5,811.  Resistance 3: August 2018 bottom at $5,880  Again, $5,880 is a former support-turned-resistance. It marks the low of the long-tailed candle created on Aug. 14, 2018, that aborted the sell-off from July highs. Similarly, the candle ended up fueling a significant price bounce to $7,411 (Sept. 4 high).  So, it seems safe to say that the road to $6,000 is packed with stiff resistance levels. Traders should watch out for signs of bullish exhaustion (candlestick patterns like doji, bearish engulfing, etc.) near the key hurdles, which could mark price pullbacks.  As for the next 24-hours, the focus remains on the 30-day moving average (MA), currently $5,199.  Daily and hourly chart  The chart shows (above left), the latest bounce from the 30-day MA is accompanied by falling volumes. Further, the hourly chart (right) is showing a bearish divergence of the Chaikin money flow indicator.  As a result, a fall back to $5,199 (30-day MA) looks likely. A close below that level would put the focus back on the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, confirmed last week. In that case, BTC would likely drop below $5,030, confirming a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern and slide toward the 50-day MA, currently at $4,736.  The head-and-shoulders breakdown, however, would remain elusive if prices break above $5,466 (April 10 high), validating the recent bounce from the 30-day MA. In that case, April's high of $5,627 could come into play.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

For the effort, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CBIC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Scotiabank, Toronto–Dominion (TD) Bank and Desjardins Group have integrated with a mobile app called Verified.Me, developed by SecureKey Technologies.  SecureKey announced the news Wednesday, explaining that the app – available for both iOS and Android – is built on IBM Blockchain, which in turn is based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.2. It will further be interoperable with Hyperledger Indy projects – a distributed ledger system designed for decentralized identity solutions.  Peter Tilton, senior vice president of digital at RBC, said:  “Security and trust are two expectations that consumers have when it comes to their personal information and digital identity. Creating seamless and convenient experiences that consumers have come to expect, based on these imperatives of security and trust, are fundamental to meeting their evolving digital needs.”  Sun Life Financial has also signed on as the first North American insurer on the service, SecureKey said, adding that two other banks – BMO Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada – will also use the product soon.  “We are entering a new era in which Canadians can clearly and confidently assert when, why and with whom their digital identity assets are shared,” said Katie Greenberg, vice president for digital products and retail payments at Scotiabank.  Verified.Me is a joint initiative between various government agencies and companies, including the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate, credit rating agency Equifax and EnStream, a joint venture of Canadian telecoms firms.

The Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) jointly announced Thursday that the successful trial – the first of its kind between two central banks – showed “great potential to increase efficiencies and reduce risks for cross-border payments.""  The effort saw BoC and MAS linking up their respective blockchain projects, Jasper and Ubin, which are built on two different blockchain networks: R3’s Corda and JPMorgan's Quorum, respectively. The two networks were connected using a technique called hashed time-locked contracts and allowed direct Payment versus Payment (PvP) settlement without the use of an intermediary.  Lending tech support for the project were Accenture and JPMorgan, which assisted development of the Canadian project on Corda and the Singapore project on Quorum, respectively.  Scott Hendry, Bank of Canada’s senior special director for financial technology, said:  “The world of cross-border payments is complicated and expensive: our exploratory journey into the use of DLT [distributed ledger technology] to try to reduce some of the costs and improve traceability of these payments has yielded many lessons.”  Jasper  and Ubin have been in progress since as far back as 2016 as part of efforts to increase the efficiency of banking payments.  “The successful outcome of the Jasper-Ubin project is a big milestone for the modernization of cross-border, cross-currency transactions,” said Accenture’s managing director and global blockchain lead, David Treat  The two central banks have also jointly published a report describing the different design options to enable such settlement systems and stating:  ""A fragmented world, with differing standards, processes, norms, and regulations is the key challenge in cross-border payments today. DLT could offer an easier and faster path towards adoption than a centralized approach because it can leave the different jurisdictions involved in control of their portion of the network while allowing for tight integration with the rest of the network.""  However, they added that the Jasper-Ubin project is experimental in nature and whether the two will eventually use blockchain technology for ""high-value"" cross-border payments ""remains to be seen.""  The BoC and MAS further called on other central banks, financial institutions and tech firms to join the initiative in making cross-border payments ""cheaper, faster and safer.""

42430460,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Ph,1556784049,When Tether Warnings Are Marketing Tools,"""We’re in a scary place, because if Tether’s pretty systematically embedded in the crypto market infrastructure, trading on several tokens might fall.”  Usually, such talk, premised on the assumption that much of the cryptocurrency market is dependent on the dollar-pegged token known as tether or USDT, might sound like clear-eyed realism (to hardened skeptics) or FUD (to true believers).  But coming from Nelson Chen, it's part of a marketing pitch.  Chen, you see, is part of the team behind the Neutral Dollar, a stablecoin built on a basket of other stablecoins (dai, TrueUSD, the Paxos Standard and USD Coin) that is expected to launch later this month. So the New York Attorney General's recent allegations casting further doubt on the dollar backing of USDT, the leading stablecoin, have given him and other rival issuers an opportunity to highlight how their own offerings are different.  ""We’ve already been doing that and the news that happened right now just made it more real that these conversations can maybe turn into something,"" Chen said. ""Exchanges were looking into stablecoins already.""  Also making hay of the situation is Chad Cascarilla, CEO of Paxos, creator of the Paxos Standard token, who agreed the news underscores the opportunity for other stablecoin providers.  ""Now there's this non-backing issue that has bedeviled Bitfinex and Tether and I think everyone has to step back,"" he said. ""When we look at the size of the opportunity ... we actually look at the opportunity and say 'hey, this is enormous.'""  Paxos had already been discussing its stablecoin with exchanges and other startups for some time, Cascarilla said, but is ""doing that even more loudly now.""  He added:  ""We’re going to spend a lot of time talking to people outside the crypto world, in payments [etc] saying let’s change the way value moves.""  Differentiating factors  The New York Attorney General's (NYAG) office claims that Tether, the company behind the self-named USDT stablecoin, may have lent nearly $1 billion to crypto exchange Bitfinex to cover up the latter's loss of $850 million.  The office announced Thursday that it was seeking documents from Bitfinex and Tether detailing their plan to have the exchange ""borrow"" as much as $900 million from the stablecoin issuer, after Bitfinex apparently lost access to $850 million held by currency converter Crypto Capital Corp.  According to a statement published later by Bitfinex, Crypto Capital has told the exchange that its funds were seized by authorities in the U.S., Poland and Portugal (though Bitfinex's lawyers previously told the NYAG's office that they do not believe this story).  On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two individuals on bank fraud charges, claiming they provided services to Global Trading Solutions, a corporate entity said to be tied to Crypto Capital.  The exchange is telling its shareholders it will need a few weeks to unfreeze the funds.  The crypto markets shed $10 billion in the hours after the news first came out, with millions going toward USDT competitors.  While stablecoin issuers are taking advantage of the Tether news to promote their own cryptocurrencies as viable alternates to USDT, the latter is, curiously enough, still trading near its peg; according to data from crypto exchange Kraken, the token traded near $0.98 all day Monday.  Several stablecoin purveyors were quick to assert that unlike Tether, they had no conflicts of interest with operating their stablecoins. (Tether and Bitfinex are both operated by iFinex, which may mean that the former is not independent and may not have been able to refuse what appears to be a terrible trade.)  Cascarilla told CoinDesk that ""having a regulated stablecoin is very important to the stability of the system,"" while TrustToken co-founder Rafael Cosman explained that a third-party trust company is responsible for holding user funds in escrow.  ""This gives TrueUSD token holders the strongest possible legal protections, as the true beneficial owners of the TrueUSD escrow funds,"" Cosman said.  Cosman added that regular attestations (which TrustToken, Paxos, Centre, and Gemini, among others, provide) are another step that stablecoin issuers can take to build up trust with users. (Tether has famously failed to produce an audit, which it promised to do more than a year ago; the closest it has gotten are two attestations, neither by an audit firm; one by Deltec Bank & Trust, which confirmed that it had nearly $2 billion in assets last November and another by law firm Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan last June).  Stablecoin issuers need to commit to standards, however, Cosman said, concluding:  ""Building trust with traders is not only important for running a successful stablecoin company, it is critical to the future growth of the cryptocurrency industry.""

42430432,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMt8Jh,1556781042,Bitcoin Can't Fix Venezuela: I Should Know,"Today marks a week since I left my home in Venezuela.  So, here I am, watching the news since 6 a.m., haven’t separated from my phone all day. I'm worried about my loved ones, wondering if I could have done more before leaving, but knowing I had to leave anyway.  I left everything I knew behind, but I also fled an escalating crisis that jeopardized my income as a remote worker in the crypto space, where I’ve been now for years.  For the Venezuelans using cryptocurrency as a tool to survive the economic consequences of a brutal socialist dictatorship, receiving support from the international community has been vital to the reformation process. The trouble is that this attention has quickly deteriorated into a double-edged sword: a trend.  In the last few years, Venezuela has become a favorite pop culture reference in crypto, where bystanders – usually from a privileged background and perspective – spout their ill-wisdom about Venezuelan socialism, economy and migration.  This situation is particularly common in crypto. People armed with good intentions and misinformation about how Venezuela’s economy works – or better said, how it doesn’t work – spread their confusion and often diminish an extremely painful experience being shared by millions of Venezuelans.  So let me, as someone who used bitcoin to survive in Venezuela, clear up the misconceptions: Bitcoin can’t fix the situation in Venezuela.  There are no official statistics of how many crypto wallets there are in Venezuela. There’s no way to know how many each person owns. What it is very clear is that beyond a couple of businesses that accept this form of payment and a few trusted exchange platforms online, there are no services for crypto users available in the country.  No ATMs. No prepaid debit cards. Just assumptions.  The fallacy that bitcoin could “save” a country’s whole economy assumes the country meets all the requirements for mainstream adoption. Just to start, there would be needed widespread computer and financial literacy, reliable electricity infrastructure, stable internet service and an economy that not only allows the majority of citizens to count on a device to keep their digital wallets but also the safe migration from fiat money to digital money.  As we can see, the fact that Venezuela serves as a use case for bitcoin does not mean that it currently has the circumstances for broad cryptocurrency adoption.  The hyperinflation has stepped all over the Bolivar, as it also impacts US dollar-based prices that rise on a daily basis. So using bitcoin to get dollars, which is what many Venezuelans currently do, is still problematic and vulnerable to inflation issues.  There’s also the mining. Venezuela is famous for its off-the-charts rates of bitcoin transactions and mining activity. But the reality is that having access to cryptocurrency is limited to earning freelance income, trading and mining, which unless you are wealthy enough to own your own mining farm, isn't a feasible option for most Venezuelans.  The crypto misconception  Foreign initiatives to help Venezuelans have instead revealed widespread ignorance about the actual problems that Venezuelans face.  Working personally as a contact for the crypto charity GiveCrypto, owned by Coinbase, during 2018, I found a common problem in this initiative that others have followed: the gigantic misinterpretation of how to help from outside.  In the case of GiveCrypto, the goal was unreachable from the start: to feed 300 people with $100 in bitcoin. That’s 33 cents per person. To anyone with an understanding of the economic situation of the country, hyperinflation wouldn’t be this underestimated. Sadly, it’s quite commonplace.  And this isn’t an isolated case of donations given without much of strategy based on reality.  Crypto donations are very popular nowadays, like in the case of AirTM, which has just announced that will be teaming up with MakerDao on its goal to raise $1 million to distribute between its users in Venezuela, with a goal of giving away $10 to each aid recipient. (Such a small amount doesn’t serve as savings or investment, as it easily vanishes for a week’s worth of expenses.)  Despite all the international efforts to distribute crypto in Venezuela, so far there aren’t any solutions able to make a sustainable and adequate difference beyond what a similar dollar donation could have achieved. The important thing for these foreign brands appears to be just cramming a blockchain-shaped peg into any hole.  Silver lining  Despite this situation, outsider opinions don’t determine the actual impact of crypto adoption for Venezuelans.  It’s true that cryptocurrency is very useful for a specific range of activities that support survival, as an income for freelancers, as a form of remittance for families to receive U.S. dollars at minimum commission, and – when the internet and electricity allow it – for those with an extra income who mine from their GPUs or miners.  I do believe that bitcoin has the capacity to influence Venezuela’s financial landscape in a positive way. As cash loses its value, citizens are pushed toward digital money and eventually, that money could include cryptocurrencies.  While we are in this process, Venezuelans must stop being seen as a punchline for misleading arguments about the benefits of bitcoin. The country situation has shown the many phases of an economic crisis, and there are invaluable lessons that we have learned that give a whole new twist to our view on financial solutions.  That said, the crypto industry needs to stop viewing Venezuela as a testing ground for wild ideas and start viewing us as what we really are: irreplaceable partners in the financial revolution.
