42419136,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDveH,1699487900,U.S. House's Spending Bill Aims to Hamstring SEC's Gensler Amid His Crypto Crackdown,"As the U.S. House of Representatives weighs legislation on next year's spending, a provision was added on Wednesday that would deprive funding from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions against crypto businesses.  The move ‚Äì authored by Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), one of the industry's closest allies on Capitol Hill ‚Äì was targeted at SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who Emmer criticized Wednesday as trying to steer the crypto industry with enforcement actions rather than policy.  The House appropriations bill ‚Äì known as Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2024 ‚Äì was revised by several amendments on Wednesday, including this one from Emmer. It was among more than 100 amendments proposed for the bill, and members approved it in a voice vote.  ""My amendment prohibits the SEC from using funds for enforcement activities related to digital asset transactions until Congress passes legislation that gives the SEC jurisdiction over this asset class,"" said Emmer, who was briefly considered by his colleagues recently for the House speaker role, in his floor statement on the amendment. ""This will keep Chair Gensler ‚Äì who has proven himself to be ineffective and incompetent ‚Äì in check while Congress continues working to give this industry a chance to grow and develop right here in the United States.""  Of course, any House appropriations package must also be backed by the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats more closely aligned with Gensler. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and some others actively cheer Gensler's use of enforcement actions against crypto firms.  ""Now the Senate must continue working towards a common sense, bipartisan solution that allows blockchain technology to thrive while protecting American consumers and investors,"" said former Reps. David McIntosh and Tim Ryan, who are co-chairs of the Blockchain Innovation Project and said they aided in Emmer's amendment.  The Congress is currently heading toward another budget impasse when the government's current, temporary funding is depleted by Nov. 17. While a short-term solution was agreed to previously, then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was fired by his GOP colleagues and replaced with a new speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson (F-La.), who voted against that budget extension.  Gensler said Wednesday that his agency has pursued as many as 150 actions against crypto firms.  ""I'm really proud of that,"" he said at the DC Fintech Week event in Washington.

The 99% decline in the SHIB burn rate raises concerns over the involvement of the community and whether burning SHIB tokens has lost its appeal. SHIB Burn Rate Declines 99.35% Shibburn data on Wednesday, November 8, shows a 99.35% decline in the Shiba Inu burn rate in the last 24 hours. The burning of Shiba Inu tokens is an effort to drastically reduce the supply but interest seems to be waning, especially since the burn seems to have no effect on the price.

42419129,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDvW1,1699482031,U.S. Bill Proposes Outlawing Government Use of China-Made Blockchains and Tether's USDT,"U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday barring federal government officials from doing business with China-based blockchain firms, marking Washington's latest show of suspicion toward Chinese ties in the cryptocurrency industry, according to a statement from the sponsors.  The bill also explicitly blocks U.S. government officials from transacting with iFinex, the parent company of Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT.  The Creating Legal Accountability for Rogue Innovators and Technology (CLARITY) Act, co-led by U.S. Representatives Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) and Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), would outlaw government officials from transacting with Chinese crypto companies, in addition to cutting off government employees' use of China-based blockchains, or the networks that undergird crypto trading platforms.  Neither of the bill's authors is among U.S. House of Representatives leadership or holds prominent positions on committees. Other, more senior lawmakers are already pressing a number of crypto bills, some of which also deal with security issues. A few of the efforts have the approval of full House committees and are further along in the process, so it's unlikely a new measure will jump in front of them in line.  The aim of this latest legislation is to ensure the nation's ""foreign adversaries ‚Ä¶ do not have a backdoor to access critical national security intelligence and Americans' private information,"" the lawmakers said in a statement.  ""Within the next decade, every American will have sensitive, private data stored using blockchain technology, [so] China's heavy investment in this infrastructure poses a colossal national security and data privacy problem,"" Nunn, a freshman member who joined the House this year, said on Wednesday.  The bill also bans officials from transacting with The Spartan Network, The Conflux Network, and Red Date Technology Co., the architect behind China's national blockchain project and its central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital yuan.  Red Date responded to the bill, adding that the BSN Spartan Network was for traditional IT, not crypto. The firm also welcomed U.S. agencies to peruse their source code for any further details.  ""The BSN Spartan Network is completely open source and we welcome agencies from the US or any government to review the source code and make their own conclusions about the technology. The Singapore-based BSN Foundation, with members from the USA, Europe, and Asia, governs the Spartan Network, which is completely separate from the BSN Networks in Mainland China,"" the firm said in a statement.  The legislation also directs the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence to develop a plan to ""prevent the risks posed by China's and other foreign adversaries' development of [blockchain] technologies.""  The proposed restrictions come after lawmakers this summer instituted a security-driven ban on government employees' use of TikTok, a popular social media app with Chinese roots. The push came after a former employee of TikTok parent company ByteDance alleged in court filings earlier this year that the Chinese Communist Party utilized a secret ""backdoor"" in its popular social media platform to monitor Hong Kong-based activists' locations and messages in 2018.

We think the probability is also lessened as the Bitcoin code is completely open source, so anyone from large companies to independent software engineers can view and test it. We also note that if another bug is discovered, it is likely that those with vested interest and large holdings of bitcoin and equipment (miners, etc.) will be incentivized to work together to quickly fix it. Nevertheless, we do think this is a criticism that is worthy of consideration and investors should assign a non-zero chance to the possibility of a severe enough bug in the core Bitcoin network that could cause its value to decline, possibly precipitously.""

19951416,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559751,1699480827,"Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Will Take Off In One Week, Here‚Äôs The Target","Crypto analyst and enthusiast Will Taylor, known as Cryptoinsightuk on social media, recently released his latest XRP price prediction and analysis. XRP‚Äôs price recently reached $0.73 for the first time since June, fueled by whales increasing their spot trading activity amidst a consolidation from the entire crypto market. This rally briefly pushed XRP to the fourth spot in terms of market cap, overtaking BNB. XRP has since returned to the fifth spot, lost some of this gain, and consolidated in the past 24 hours to trade in a range between $0.70 and $0.66. On-chain data still points to a continued bull run in the short term, as the crypto maintains resilience in the face of market pressures. According to Taylor, the XRP price is set to blast off in just seven days. Current XRP Price Levels and Recent Market Performance The analyst took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to give his prediction about XRP, one of the many bullish predictions the crypto has received since it was deemed not a security by a US federal judge. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Go On $600 Million Buying Spree That Could Trigger Run To $0.4 The price of XRP has been on a steady climb from $0.483 since October 13, and according to crypto analyst Will Taylor, it‚Äôs poised to skyrocket even higher within one week. He made this prediction by analyzing XRP‚Äôs current price action using the Fibonacci Retracement indicator. Although XRP traded at $0.73 on Monday, October 6, it retraced 9.5% to $0.66 on Tuesday, October 7, and is now trading at $0.69 at the time of writing. $XRP blast off in T-7 days. Today we have seen a bit of a retracement for $XRP. We ran into key Fibonacci Retracement levels, this is normal. Indicators were massively over cooked. I‚Äôm unsure how deep this pull back will be. I wouldn‚Äôt be unhappy about a bounce from here, or‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/eDEt1Mgh9l ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) November 7, 2023 Using the retracement indicators, Cryptoinsightuk showed that XRP retraced from 0.618 to 0.5 Fibonacci levels while using August 14th‚Äôs price of $0.4232 as the base level for the indicator. This correction, in his opinion, is perfectly typical given that indicators revealed XRP was quite overbought at the time. Additionally, there is a possibility that XRP will go to a lower price, which would turn the prior resistance level at $0.62 into a support. Related Reading: XRP News: Ripple CEO Teases Major Announcements At Swell Event On the other hand, the XRP price is still exhibiting signs of a continuing bull run, and it has continued to increase by 16% in a 7-day timeframe. According to Cryptoinsightuk, XRP will really get going once it clears the 0.618, 0.702, and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels. In a previous post, the analyst predicted that when this blast-off happens, the XRP price will rally more than 1,400% to reach $10 at least. ‚ÄúIf we get this price action and history repeats, it would put $XRP price between $10-14 dollars within 4/5 weeks.‚Äù XRP‚Äôs price growth has largely been suppressed in recent years by the SEC lawsuit.

The miner reported a third-quarter earnings of $0.35 per share versus analyst estimate of a loss of $0.11 per share, according to FactSet data. Third quarter revenue was $97.8million compared to an estimate of $99.6 million.  Marathon produced 3,490 bitcoins during the third quarter, up from 2,926 in Q2 and 616 in Q3 one year ago. The company sold 66% of the bitcoin produced last quarter to pay for operating costs, according to the statement.  The firm also said it sees 2023 bitcoin mining power, or hash rate, to reach 26 exahashes per second (EH/s) and expects to grow its hash rate by about 30% in 2024. If the company manages to hit the guidance for this year, it will become the largest publicly traded mining company in terms of hashrate.  Core Scientific (CORZQ), a miner expecting to emerge from bankruptcy in the fourth quarter, has about 22 EH/s mining power.

The SEC pushed back against Binance and Binance.US's motion to dismiss the suit it brought earlier this summer, saying the motion relies on ""distorted"" and ""tortured"" interpretations of both federal law and precedents. The SEC first sued Binance in June, a day before suing Coinbase, arguing both companies offered unregistered securities to the investing public (the Binance suit included some other allegations).  Binance, Binance.US and Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao argued in a motion to dismiss that the SEC was overreaching from its mandate and that it hadn't ""plausibly alleged"" actual securities law violations.  In Wednesday's filing, the SEC said Binance's argument would ""dismantle decades of foundational precedent upon which the nation‚Äôs securities laws operate,"" instead creating a new ""rigid framework"" that did not have a basis in either case precedent or existing law.  Binance's sale of the BNB token during an initial coin offering as a fundraising mechanism violated securities law, as did its sale of Binance USD (BUSD) as an investment contract, the SEC alleged.  Similarly, staking and earn programs also violated federal securities laws, the agency argued.  The SEC also pushed back against an argument that its lawsuit violated the ""Major Questions Doctrine,"" a recent Supreme Court ruling that's quickly become a favorite of crypto companies facing litigation from the federal regulator.

LINK and MATIC gained 10%, most among large-cap altcoins.  Bitcoin's ""Santa Claus rally"" could start any moment amid accommodating macro picture, Matrixport said.  Bitcoin [BTC] was closing in on the $36,000 key level Wednesday as bulls and bears continued their tug of war at that key level.  After quickly giving back a chunk of its short squeeze-related gains on Tuesday, bitcoin took another shot at the $36,000 level early Wednesday afternoon on what appeared to be a renewed bout of spot ETF optimism. At press time, the crypto had again pulled back to just above $35,500, up just modestly over the past 24 hours.  Ethereum scaling network Polygon's native crypto [MATIC] and oracle network Chainlink's token [LINK] lead gains in altcoins, surging 10%-11% over the same time period.  LINK attracted steady institutional buy flows over the past week, institution-focused trading platform FalconX noted Wednesday. MATIC perhaps benefitted from an early Wednesday news that network developer firm Polygon Labs will work with Near Foundation on a zero-knowledge tech-powered tool for blockchain interoperability. The token is now up roughly 27% since late October's smart contract activation of the upcoming POL ecosystem token, part of a comprehensive network upgrade called Polygon 2.0.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a broad basket of nearly 200 digital assets, was up 0.3% during the day.  Bitcoin (BTC) price could break out on declining inflation  Crypto investment services firm Matrixport noted in a Wednesday report that bitcoin's breakout above $36,000 is ""imminent,"" fueled by consistent BTC purchases during U.S. trading hours. This is coupled with a more accommodating macroeconomic environment for risk assets, with dovish Federal Reserve messaging, retreating bond yields and the U.S. Treasury Department slowing the pace of long-term debt issuance, the firm added.

42419142,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxCH,1699478375,Arbitrum Voters Polarized Over 'Research' Pitch With $2M Price Tag,"Cost is ""more than I pay for Harvard lawyers,"" one commenter wrote.  Based on early results of ""temperature check"" vote, opinions are pretty evenly divided.  The episode offers a fresh example of how blockchain pioneers are struggling to iron out the nettlesome challenge of decentralized governance.  In March, Arbitrum, the biggest layer-2 blockchain network atop Ethereum with about $2 billion of deposits, pushed to decentralize its governance ‚Äì distributing tokens to holders who would get a say in deciding the project's strategy and tactics with votes, via a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" known as Arbitrum DAO.  But a new proposal to professionalize the project's research efforts ‚Äì by allocating more than $2 million worth of digital tokens to an ""Arbitrum Coalition"" proposed by the research arm of Blockworks, a crypto media firm ‚Äì is polarizing the community and generating complaints over the cost and potential conflicts of interest.  Currently, the project's research is contributed and aggregated in a community forum, mostly by volunteers.  But the coalition proposal has been met with discord in these forums, with the debate hitting on a key tension at the core of all DAOs: how to reconcile ""decentralized"" decision-making with the need for expert guidance.  A key complaint is that there could be conflicts of interest among members of the research coalition. The professional contributors would include Blockworks Research; Gauntlet, a crypto-centric risk and financial advisory firm; and Trail of Bits, a cybersecurity company. An additional organization will be elected to serve as a ""DAO Advocate"" and act as a ""referee between the DAO and the coalition"" under the proposal.  ""Having the same parties review and provide opinions on proposals, cover those proposals publicly via Media Networks, vote on proposals, review the security concerns of a proposal, and then execute the Arbitrum network upgrades is fundamentally lacking separation of powers,"" wrote one commenter. The person added that proposed members of the coalition also comprise a large percentage of overall ARB votes.  The proposal also struck a nerve with some community members who took issue with the proposed cost of the new venture: $2 million for a year-long trial run.  A ""temperature check"" poll on the proposal started on Nov. 3 and ends Nov. 10; the informal tally will help determine whether the proposal should be taken to an official Arbitrum DAO vote. While some large DAO voters still have yet to weigh in, the proposal is currently set to pass its simple-majority threshold, albeit by a thin margin: 52% have voted in favor of the coalition's funding and 46% against it.  Arbitrum DAO  Arbitrum switched to a DAO-based governance structure in March when it first launched the ARB token and established the Arbitrum Foundation ‚Äì a non-profit tasked with supporting the development of the Arbitrum network, which helps facilitate faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum.  The guiding role of a DAO like Arbitrum's is to allow a widely distributed community of people ‚Äì in this case, Arbitrum's ARB token-holders ‚Äì to decide how a protocol is developed and governed.  While Arbitrum's shift to decentralized governance has been official for more than six months, the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs (the firm that built Arbitrum) continue to play a crucial role in the ecosystem. Their outsized influence can be viewed as a necessary byproduct of how DAOs work: It can be hard to coordinate across a far-flung group of DAO members with varying levels of engagement and expertise.  ""Arbitrum‚Äôs impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can‚Äôt rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation,"" Blockworks Research wrote in its proposal.  The research coalition was pitched by Blockworks Research as a way to ""accelerate"" decision-making on Arbitrum ‚Äì offloading certain research and diligence responsibilities to a trusted group of expert stakeholders. The coalition described in the proposal is also supposed to help balance power further in favor of the DAO.  Arbitrum Community Responds  In authoring the proposal, Blockworks Research wrote that it was motivated by the fact that the Arbitrum Forum ""includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally."" (Disclaimer: Blockworks competes with CoinDesk in the crypto media and events space.)  In response to a forum comment around concerns that the new coalition could act as a ""centralizing force,"" Blockworks Research responded that ""The Coalition does not intend to influence or persuade community members to vote in any direction,"" adding that the goal would be to ""provide objective tools and reports to help delegates and community members make more informed decisions more efficiently.""  The company specified in the proposal that members of the coalition could be removed or changed after serving a 12-month term.  The projected yearly cost for the research coalition would total $2.2 million worth of ARB, Arbitrum‚Äôs native token ‚Äì funds that would come directly out of the Arbitrum DAO treasury. Some of the more heated debate on the proposal was around how these funds would be allocated.  'More than I pay for Harvard lawyers'  According to a proposed breakdown of costs, Trail of Bits would receive $800,000 for an engineer to review proposals for 32 weeks over the course of a year. Gauntlet, meanwhile, requested $327,000 for ""15 quantitative researcher weeks,"" and Blockworks requested $780,000 ""for a minimum 13 analyst weeks per quarter.""  ""Can the organizations involved demonstrate their time is worth $650-$1500/ hour?"" wrote one commenter on Arbitrum's governance forum. ""That seems exorbitant ‚Ä¶ as in 'more than I pay for Harvard lawyers' exorbitant, literally.""  As to concerns around this proposed payment plan, Blockworks Research analyst Sam Martin told CoinDesk via email that Blockworks ""specifically proposed a not-to-exceed price to eliminate the possibility of overspend on the DAO,"" adding that ""the DAO will have our entire team at its disposal which spans in expertise with a wide array of skills.""  ""Our commitment to the DAO and seeing it succeed is rather obvious at this point through our unpaid contributions made thus far,"" Martin said in the email.",NEGATIVE,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/08/arbitrum-voters-polarized-over-research-pitch-with-2m-price-tag,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7213529b64306c22f1498b258903ff562fbba7-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19949747,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559696,1699477256,"Solana (SOL) Continues To Register Notable Gains Daily, Is $50 the Target?","Solana opened this month on high momentum, consistently posting notable gains over the past few days. SOL scored a weekly high of $45.36 on November 1 before receding. But after a brief decline to the $40 price level, the bulls have regained momentum, intent on pushing closer to $50 this time. But it remains to see if SOL bulls have enough momentum to rally that high. SOL Bucks All Odds As It Vies For Higher Highs Despite the high volatility in the altcoin market, Solana (SOL) has refused to back down. The Ethereum killer has continued its uptrend in the past two weeks, making it one of the top-gaining cryptocurrencies today. SOL graces the top gainers‚Äô list as the fifth-highest gainer in today‚Äôs trading session. Solana is trading at $43.23, with over 3% price increase in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Defensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023 Solana Bulls have continued to fight off significant sell pressure caused by FTX-related transfers.¬†The crypto exchange is selling millions of crypto assets to pay its debts to customers as it seeks a fresh start. Reports revealed that the court approved FTX to sell $3 billion worth of crypto assets frozen on the exchange since last year. On-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that the defunct crypto exchange FTX owns millions of SOL coins. According to Spot on Chain‚Äôs latest updates, FTX and Alameda have transferred approximately $223 million worth of Solana coins to exchanges. However, these large inflows of Solana in the market didn‚Äôt cause a decline. Instead, SOL‚Äôs price entered a rising channel, initiating an uptrend. The most significant upturn was when the crypto breached the critical resistance at $22 in mid-October. SOL has been unstoppable since then, crossing the $30 price mark and rising above $40, a position it has maintained in the last few days. Solana‚Äôs price is now over 86% higher than its past month‚Äôs value, with a 9.70% seven-day price increase, according to CoinMarketCap data. SOL Market Outlook As It Flips Over A Multi-month Trendline As depicted on the chart below, SOL has broken from a multi-month trendline channel, flipping a significant resistance level at $27.58 to support.¬†The $27 price level is the new trendline pivot as it forms a new channel. If SOL manages to remain above the $42 price level, given the ongoing bullish momentum, the next target price is $46.83. Maintaining this level could facilitate more rallies to $50 in the coming days. But buyers have to apply more pressure to remain in control. However, if the bears fail to maintain the $42 price, SOL could decline to $39 and subsequently to $31.43 if the bears mount more pressure. Meanwhile, SOL continues to live up to its alias, the Ethereum Killer. An update from on-chain data provider Kaiko shows that SOL has outperformed Ethereum since September. Related Reading: Market Makers Bet Big On Bitcoin Price Surge: Expert The increase in the SOL/ETH ratio since September confirms this assumption. The SOL/ETH ratio has climbed from 0.011 to nearly 0.025 and is now back to the pre-FTX collapse levels.

42419155,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxPh,1699476688,U.S. SEC Said to Open Talks with Grayscale on Spot Bitcoin ETF Push,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened talks with Grayscale Investments on the details of the company's application to convert its trust product GBTC to a spot bitcoin exchange traded product (ETF), according to a person familiar with the back-and-forth, which could have momentous implications for the crypto industry.  An SEC approval of one or more ETF applications is keenly awaited by the sector, which sees that moment as a milestone that could ease everyday investors' path into digital assets. Grayscale has been in contact with both the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets and the Division of Corporation Finance since winning its court fight, said the person, who requested anonymity because the talks remain private.  Both SEC divisions would have a role in shaping and approving the firm's ETF application. Grayscale and CoinDesk are part of the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.  Grayscale has long had a relationship with the SEC due to its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but when it sought to launch an ETF that would carry direct crypto assets, the agency denied it. A U.S. federal court battle ensued that ended with a panel of judges finding the SEC was ""arbitrary and capricious"" in its rejection, and the court ordered the agency to erase its denial. The court decision was finalized last month, putting the application back in front of the regulator.  ""Right now we're just laser-focused on constructively reengaging with Trading and Markets,"" said Craig Salm, Grayscale's chief legal officer, though he didn't expand on the details of that interaction.  ""There are still things that have to be worked through,"" Salm said in an interview, also noting that others among the applicants for bitcoin ETFs ‚Äì a group that includes financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity ‚Äì seem to be making progress in SEC talks with their own registrations. ""Overall, it's been good engagement, and it's a matter of when, not a matter of if anymore.""  An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the new talks.  When pressed two weeks ago about what his agency will do next with Grayscale's application and the others, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he wouldn't answer while the commission waits for its staff to recommend a course of action. Meanwhile, he published a video earlier on Wednesday spotlighting the work of the agency's corporation-finance arm ‚Äì dealing with ""rapidly evolving technology and business models"" ‚Äì that will be central to Grayscale's application.

Fishing For New All-Time Highs In XRP XRP is among a few major cryptocurrencies that failed to set a new all-time high in 2021 above its 2018 peak. The lack of strength three years following the still-standing price record could be due to the fact 2018 capped off a 50,000% surge. When that surge back then happened, it occurred just as the 3-month Fisher Transform flipped bullish. That was the first instance of the Fisher Transform crossing bullish and it triggered alongside a breakout from a downtrend line. Related Reading: XRP Price Historical Data Suggests Substantial Q4 Rally Possible The second Fisher Transform 3M signal crossed bullish from much lower, but failed to produce the same substantial upside as the first crossover. Now the crossover is back and it is happening at levels that match the first epic rally. Could the third-time be the charm and produce another rally similar to the first crossover? XRP to over $6? | SRPUSD on TradingView.com The Possible Target Of The Triangle Thrust Considering the law of diminishing returns, the probability of another 50,000% rally is extremely low. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean something special couldn‚Äôt be on the way. XRP is also breaking out from a downtrend line and triangle pattern on the 3M timescale. The target of this pattern based on the measure rule is an 850% rally, if the price objective is met. This realistically puts XRP at a minimum of $6. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 and Beyond Breaching the previous all-time high from 2018 could cause any really to pick up even more steam, potentially overshooting the pattern-based price objective. Triangles are typical of a wave 4 according to Elliott Wave Principle, and only appear before the final move in a sequence. Although this pattern is bullish for XRP, after the next major rally and new all-time high, things could get ugly. Crypto might be headed for longer duration bear market.

The duo, known by their Negentropic handle on the social media platform X, have shared some compelling perspectives that shed light on the current dynamics of the BTC market. Bitcoin‚Äôs market demand has outpaced its supply, a clear sign of robust positive momentum. In just one day, a whopping 700,000 new BTC addresses joined the network. This expansion is considered one of the most reliable indicators for price predictions.

They emphasized the remarkable influx of a staggering 700,000 new BTC addresses within a single day, highlighting this expansion as one of the most promising indicators for BTC price predictions. As the number of BTC coins in circulation decreases, the co-founders anticipate an upward pressure on buying bids, potentially driving the BTC price even higher. As of now, the current price of BTC, according to CoinGecko, stands at $35,255, with a 2.0% gain in the last 24 hours and a 2.7% increase over the past week. Source: Glassnode Unpredictable Shifts In Market Dynamics A closer look at the current state of the BTC market reveals a dynamic landscape where buyers are expected to embrace a proactive approach, potentially entering the market without waiting for significant dips. The co-founders‚Äô analysis suggests that the rapid pace at which BTC is evolving has created an environment where investors are compelled to make timely decisions, leading to an intensified buying spree and consequent upward pressure on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs valuation. The recent surge in the utilization of Bitcoin futures and options has captured the attention of both the media and seasoned investors. Glassnode‚Äôs Happel and Allemann speculate that this increasing demand for leverage is primarily fueled by investors‚Äô anticipation of two highly bullish catalysts slated for 2024. Related Reading: Defensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023 Bitcoin currently trading at $35K level today.

Secondly, the prospect of the Bitcoin halving event has emerged as another powerful incentive, drawing the attention of investors who anticipate a subsequent scarcity-driven price surge. As the BTC market continues to evolve and capture the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, the observations and insights shared by Glassnode‚Äôs co-founders serve as valuable signposts, guiding market participants through the intricate maze of cryptocurrency investments and market dynamics. The latest developments in the world of Bitcoin point to a market in which demand is outstripping supply, potentially setting the stage for a bullish run.

Halving To Trigger Parabolic Rally Crypto analyst TradingShot posted another eye-catching prediction on the TradingView website, putting the Bitcoin price as high as $200,000. The analysis focuses on the Bitcoin Vortex bullish cross as well as the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW) bottoms to gauge when BTC might go on its next parabolic rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Climbs Above $0.075 To 3-Month High, But Metrics Show It‚Äôs Far From Done TradingShot explains that a parabolic rally for the cryptocurrency often starts after a Halving Event. Now, a BTC halving event takes place roughly every four years and it‚Äôs an event in which the block rewards for miners are cut down in half, thereby reducing the rate at which new coins are being brought into circulation. The crypto analyst‚Äôs prediction in this instance uses the next Bitcoin halving event which is expected to take place sometime in Q2 2024. As the analyst explains, this is an event that ‚Äústarts the (final and most aggressive) Parabolic Rally sequence of the Bull Cycle.‚Äù Source: Tradingview.com One other important event that happens after the halving takes place is the BBW which bottoms once the halving is completed. This often marks the end of a short downtrend, and ‚Äúmay have as a Support a (dotted) Lower Lows trend-line,‚Äù as TradingShot explains. When Will Bitcoin Cross $200,000 The expectation for the BBW to bottom out in early 2024 carries the basis for a Bitcoin parabolic rally above $200,000. Once it does this, there is only a short timeframe that the crypto analyst sees before the asset is able to reach this level. A Bullish Cross formation as has been the case historically, is expected to trigger ‚Äúa long-term sequence of straight green candles (Parabolic Rally) straight to the Bull Cycle‚Äôs peak.‚Äù This marks the beginning of the bull market. Related Reading: Why Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood Picks Bitcoin Over Cash And Gold TradingShot explains that if this happens, then the Bullish Cross would appear on the 2-Month (2M) candle. This will put the timeframe in the vicinity of January 2024. If this analysis is correct, then BTC could be only a few months away from making a new all-time high. At the upper band of this parabolic rally, Bitcoin sits above $650,000. Given that BTC is currently trading just above $35,300, it would mean an over 1,700% rally.

42419165,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxUr,1699467954,The Protocol: Kraken Awakens ‚Äì as Ethereum L2 Candidate,"Everybody's doing it ‚Äì launching new layer-2 blockchains atop Ethereum to provide a venue for cheap and easy transactions. This week brought the news (thanks to this scoop from our Margaux Nijkerk) that the crypto exchange Kraken may be considering its own layer-2 network, just months after rival Coinbase launched a layer-2, Base. Details below.  We're also covering more job cuts in the blockchain industry as crypto winter drags on and token issuance slumps, even as digital-asset markets start to price in signs of green shoots. PLUS: Postscript on Celestia's TIA airdrop, $37 million of fundraisings and a Q&A with Tegan Kline, CEO of Edge & Node, the primary developer behind the dominant blockchain-indexing protocol, The Graph, sometimes referred to as the ""Google of Web3.""  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  LAYER 2'S LAYER ON: One of this year's dominant blockchain trends has been the rush by technologists to launch new ""layer 2"" networks that can process transactions cheaper and faster than the primary (and sometimes congested) Ethereum network. And many of the developer teams behind the projects are competing to land new companies and clients who might use their technology to spin up even more layer-2 networks, including several projects that surfaced just this week. CoinDesk reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that the crypto exchange Kraken is in talks with Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation about possibly using their technology to create a new layer-2 network ‚Äì and has even posted a job description for a ""senior cryptography engineer"" who might work on the effort. Such a push would follow rival crypto exchange Coinbase's move a few months ago to launch its own layer-2 network, Base. Another new arrival is Nil Foundation's own rollup, which would combine zero-knowledge cryptography with another scaling technique known as sharding.  CELESTIA POSTSCRIPT: Rarely are blockchain projects alone in the pursuit of hot new ideas. That's true of the au courant rush by various efforts to provide ""modular"" solutions for handling the various tasks of a blockchain, including the job of ""data availability,"" which involves managing growing reams of data and efficiently providing it to users or applications when requested. The data-availability network Celestia dominated the headlines last week, especially with the buzzy airdrop of TIA tokens garnering interest from crypto traders. This week, a rival project, Avail, announced a new incentive program on a test network to encourage early adopters to ""battle-test our code base."" And Near Foundation, hosting an annual conference this week in Lisbon for the layer-1 blockchain NEAR Protocol, announced its own plans to offer a data-availability network for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite the interest from solutions providers, early usage of Celestia appears to be modest so far. Galaxy Research's Christine Kim wrote in a newsletter on Nov. 3: ""Now that Celestia has launched, the true value of the protocol will come from the rollup ecosystem that is created over the next few months and years on top of Celestia. The adoption of the rollups built on top of Celestia will dictate the revenue and long-term success of the protocol, and ultimately, prove (or disprove) the blockchain modularity thesis. ""  MAWR JOB CUTS, PART 2: Crypto markets may have turned up recently, but many blockchains startups are still struggling, with more job cuts piling up in addition to those previously announced. Over the past week, grim news came from the NFT trading platform OpenSea, used to trade collections including Bored Apes and Pudgy Penguins. CEO Devin Finzer announced that the company was ""saying goodbye"" to teammates in an effort to ""build a new foundation."" (Decrypt reported that the move may have affected as much as 50% of staff.) Separately, Emin G√ºn Sirer, CEO of Ava Labs, the primary developer behind the Avalanche blockchain, posted on X that the company had made a ""reduction in force"" amounting to 12% of the company, part of a move to ""capture the speed and energy of a small, nimble team.""

(Link)  New Cryptocurrencies Getting Created at Slowest Pace in 3 Years, CertiK Data Shows  Just as green shoots are appearing in crypto markets, a new data set has emerged showing just how dramatically the pace of blockchain development slowed recently.  The amount of new token creation dropped during the third quarter to the lowest since at least the start of 2021, according to blockchain smart-contract auditor CertiK. The company created the data set by using the list of tokens added each quarter to the tracking website CoinMarketCap, and then stripping out so-called memecoins that serve no ostensible purpose but to provide yuks and a vessel for speculation.  The dropoff in new tokens might be explained by the deepening of crypto winter during the last quarter: ""No one wants to list a token when there there is a lack of risk-taking,"" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at the independent investment-research firm FundStrat. Another explanation could be that the crypto industry is getting more mature. ""There are more legitimate projects out there now, so the battle for that incremental liquidity is tougher,"" Farrell said. ""The bar for launching a token is higher.""

Bitcoin toppled Ethereum in NFT sales volume on Wednesday, per CryptoSlam data.  Bitcoin fees surged to the highest level since the meme coin mania this past May amid the resurgence of Bitcoin-linked non-fungible tokens (NFT), known as Ordinals.  At $6.84 on Wednesday, average transaction fees for using the Bitcoin blockchain are now up roughly 970% from a low of $0.64 touched in August, BitInfoCharts data shows.  The surge is driven by increasing minting of Ordinals, with nearly 1.9 million inscriptions uploaded to the blockchain over the past two weeks, digital asset management firm 21Shares pointed out in a report Wednesday.  Bitcoin became the top blockchain by NFT sales volume (excluding wash trading) in the past 24 hours, toppling Ethereum, CryptoSlam data shows.  Ordinals ‚Äì a protocol that allows users to store NFTs on Bitcoin ‚Äì saw a spike in demand this spring during a short-lived meme token craze and drove fees to almost 2-year highs. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, listed Ordinals' token ORDI earlier this week and it almost doubled in price before giving up some of its gains Wednesday.

Solana Has Enjoyed Sharp Bullish Momentum During The Past Month Since the start of Bitcoin‚Äôs rally towards the $35,000 level, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has been having a good time. Among the assets, Solana has particularly stood out, as its returns have been one of the highest. During the last 30 days, SOL has observed an exceptional rally of more than 84%, leading to its price surpassing the $43 mark. The chart below shows how the asset‚Äôs trajectory has looked like during this period. The value of the coin seems to have been rapidly going up in recent weeks | Source: SOLUSD on TradingView From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that Solana had managed to rise as high as $47 at the start of the month, but the coin registered a bit of a pullback soon after. The asset has since recovered 9% from these local lows, although it‚Äôs yet to make a full retrace. However, momentum appears to be building for the coin, as it has grown by 3% during the past day. Related Reading: Chainlink Has Massive Resistance Ahead, Will The Rally End Soon? In this sharp rally during the past month, Solana also improved its standing in the cryptocurrency sector, as it claimed the 7th position on the market cap list. Looks like SOL has a market cap of $24.4 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap Naturally, as with any rally, profit-taking can be something to look out for, as it can lead towards a local top formation. It would appear that a whale may be attempting to do precisely that. SOL Whale Has Deposited A Large Amount To Binance Today According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large transaction has been spotted on the Solana blockchain during the past day. This transfer saw 249,999 SOL move across the network, worth approximately $10.8 million when the transaction was executed. Given the large amount involved, it‚Äôs likely that a whale entity was behind it. Generally, transactions can be something to watch, as they can sometimes have noticeable effects on the market, how the price would be affected by the move of a whale naturally depends on what they intended to do with it. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Tight Zone: Why A Rally Will Happen If DOGE Clears $0.076 In the current case, the transfer moved from an unknown wallet (likely the whale‚Äôs address) to a wallet attached to a central platform: the Binance exchange. One of the main reasons an investor might transfer their coins from their self-custodial wallet to one of these central entities is for selling purposes, so it‚Äôs possible that the whale wanted to sell here and harvest the profits they would have amassed in the latest rally. The cryptocurrency price could end up feeling some resistance shortly if selling was indeed the goal in the mind of this whale.

19943346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559689,1699462813,Dogecoin In Tight Zone: Why A Rally Will Happen If DOGE Clears $0.076,"An analyst has explained how the next major Dogecoin resistance hurdle would be at $0.084 if the memecoin manages to clear $0.076. Dogecoin Is Currently Sandwiched Between Major Support And Resistance Levels In a new post on X, analyst Ali has discussed what the on-chain support and resistance levels are looking like for Dogecoin right now. A price level is said to be an on-chain support or resistance level on the basis of whether a large number of investors share their cost basis at it or not. ‚ÄúCost basis‚Äù here naturally refers to the average price at which a holder acquired their DOGE. When the spot price is below the cost basis of an investor, they are naturally in a state of loss, while it being above implies they are enjoying positive returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Be Headed Towards 20%+ Decline Based On This Pattern The below chart shows what the distribution of Dogecoin investors looks like currently on the basis of the price range that their cost basis lies. Looks like the current price levels are surrounded by major investor blocks | Source: @ali_charts on X For any investor, their cost basis is an important psychological level and they may be prone to making some moves whenever the spot price retests it. Thus, if a large number of holders share their cost basis close together inside a particular range, the market could potentially see a sizeable reaction when the asset‚Äôs price ventures into the range. Generally, whenever this retest happens from above (that is, the investors had been in profits before this), the meme coin‚Äôs price could feel some degree of support. The reason behind this is that the holders may tend to believe that if this same level had been profitable earlier, it might be so again in the future, so they participate in some accumulation. The opposite is the case whenever the Dogecoin price retests the cost basis of a large amount of investors from below. These investors would be tempted to exit at their break-even so the cryptocurrency could face resistance. From the above graph, it‚Äôs visible that the DOGE levels above and below the current price both host the acquisition points of a large number of addresses. In particular, the $0.071 to $0.073 range has the cost basis of almost 200,000 holders, while the $0.074 to $0.076 range has 124,000 addresses. Related Reading: Chainlink Has Massive Resistance Ahead, Will The Rally End Soon? ‚ÄúNote that support outstrips resistance in strength, hinting at the potential for an upward breakout,‚Äù says Ali. If Dogecoin can manage to clear this range of significant resistance off the back of this strong support, the next price level where it will face a hurdle would be around $0.084. The in-between levels all have a relatively low amount of investors, so at least in theory, the memecoin shouldn‚Äôt have too hard a time mowing through them. Especially considering that, once the $0.076 level is through, the block that‚Äôs providing resistance right now would turn into a support boundary. DOGE Price Dogecoin is currently battling against the resistance offered by the aforementioned range as its price is floating around $0.075.

42419160,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxTp,1699461900,DeFi‚Äôs Next Frontier: The Untapped Potential of On-chain Structured Products,"Globally, asset management is a huge industry, with a large percentage of assets in each nation being held in ETFs, index funds and other passive vehicles. In Europe, ‚Ç¨28.4 trillion of assets are managed by the industry, of which 20% are held in passive strategies, about half in exchange traded products and half in index funds. All told, passively-held assets under management have doubled since 2015, with around one fifth of European retail investors holding such products. Analysts predict that by 2027 ETFs will account for 24% of total assets in Europe, up from 12% in 2022. In the world of decentralized finance and digital assets, some commentators see the on-chain structured product market as analogous, but this sector has yet to capture much market share. on-chain structured products make up 0.07% of the crypto market overall currently, with a combined TVL of $2.46 billion across protocols. In comparison, the DeFi market is $48.29 billion and the total crypto market is $1.18 trillion.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Nevertheless, over the last several years, on-chain structured products ‚Äî that is, index tokens and strategy tokens ‚Äî have shown the kind of promise that led to these types of products‚Äô dominance in traditional markets. In 2020, the on-chain structured product market saw 20 projects launching (including nine projects that launched during what would come to be known as DeFi Summer). Yearn, Compound and the Index Coop all started offering such products during this period. At the height of the 2021 bull market, Index Coop‚Äôs on-chain structured products captured over $550 million in TVL.  In total, 47 projects have launched in the on-chain structured product space since 2016, with the majority of projects offering index or yield-earning products. Of those, 37 are still operational. At the Index Coop, we‚Äôre bullish on the long term promise of on-chain structured products because of their advantages in transparency, security, accessibility, automation and liquidity. Regrettably, the sector has been hampered by regulatory ambiguity, as well as nascent technology and market infrastructure. That said, some encouraging signs have emerged recently. If, as seems likely, BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF and Grayscale‚Äôs spot Ethereum ETFs are approved in the U.S. that would represent a major step forward for the on-chain structured product sector.  As digital asset markets mature, we expect to see more growth on the on-chain structured product market, especially as correlations reduce across digital assets. Currently high correlation across digital assets means that different assets move together, reducing the value of a diversification strategy. As digital assets become less correlated, diversification will become more attractive proposition. Additionally improvements in UX and cross chain infrastructure could contribute to growth in our space. Long-term, we expect on-chain products to prevail because of their unique advantages, enabling underlying tokens to reach wider audiences.

42419151,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxMb,1699461900,Why an Ether Staking Rate Will Increase Crypto Adoption,"Ethereum‚Äôs conversion to proof-of-stake not only created the foundation for the liquid staking ecosystem, it delivered a native crypto rate to finance that can serve as a critical piece of market structure. The staking rate ‚Äì measuring the total income that stakers receive for validating Ethereum transactions ‚Äì has immediate applicability in DeFi, centralized digital asset finance and traditional finance. This has fueled market demand for an ether staking rate for benchmarking, research and risk transfer.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Benchmarking  Mass adoption and integration of digital assets in investment portfolios is critically important to the future of the digital assets industry. While many investors will make their first allocation in Bitcoin, the investment case for Ethereum is likely to attract interest as a next step. Not only does ETH have history and scale; it now has an integrated yield.  As staking becomes better understood, investors will demand that yield rate be more predictable. Moreover, they will pit providers ‚Äì LSTs, funds, ETPs, CEXes, futures contracts ‚Äì against each other to hunt for the best return. Benchmarking these returns provides a yardstick for investors, and allows providers to show the alpha they are able to deliver.  Research  What is ETH‚Äôs staking rate exactly?  It is a floating rate comprising two parts: rewards for consensus layer duties and priority transaction fees. The former is determined by Ethereum‚Äôs simple ‚Äúmonetary policy‚Äù which adjusts rewards based on the aggregate amount of ETH that is staked ‚Äì a single-objective, security-based policy. The latter is determined by demand for the Ethereum network, which tends to rise when new information or opportunities enter the system.  How does this compare to rates in traditional finance? Consensus rewards are paid to help secure ‚Äì but not finance ‚Äì the network. They are determined by a stated policy, like a central bank rate, but not subject to political influence or economic interpretation. They are crystal clear and reasonably predictable.  Priority transaction fees ‚Äì those paid to validators after base fees are burned ‚Äì are less predictable and subject to spikes when network demand rises. This demand-spread widens when demand for Ethereum causes users to pay extra gas to get transactions on the blockchain faster.  Should we (and if so, how) compare this rate to U.S. Treasuries or SOFR? They are clearly not direct analogues, given the different profiles of their funding bases. However, there are similar opportunity-cost dynamics. For instance, we‚Äôve seen a shrinking of the validator queue as the staking rate has declined relative to available fiat rates. Should demand for the rate be adjusted by ether‚Äôs forward-looking inflation/deflation status? Should it be implied in ether futures contracts or the OTC forward market?  The calculation of a standardized and independently-calculated rate, along with access to its components, can provide analysts with information to help understand Ethereum better, both internally and in comparison to other money markets. (Note: CESR‚Ñ¢, the composite ether staking rate, which is administered by CoinFund and calculated and published by CoinDesk Indices does just that.)  Risk transfer  Ethereum validators stake 32 ETH, and get a variable stream of rewards. Future rewards can be hard to predict. This yield volatility is not optimal when evaluating a validator‚Äôs financial performance with measures like its Sharpe ratio.  What if the validator could swap its future staking yield for a fixed rate, and what rate would it accept to enter that transaction?  This is the genesis of a fixed vs floating swap market, and the birth of a forward curve for the ETH staking rate. Speculators may also want to gain exposure to the future rate, expressing views on network demand, volatility or macro events. OTC dealers and DeFi protocols can create such marketplaces, whose contracts must settle into an independently calculated, well understood value.  This embryonic but scalable market is an important addition to the idea set for crypto derivatives markets because it goes beyond serving investors and lenders and addresses a new use case: corporate finance.  Conclusion  Expanding the users and use cases for Ethereum‚Äôs staking rate will help improve network security, invite new investment interest in ether, and create new bridges from digital assets to traditional finance. This fueled the inspiration to create CESR‚Ñ¢, the composite ether staking rate.

He added that according to his estimation, there is an ""absolute minimum"" of 886,000 ETH ($1.67 billion) lost forever.  L√µhmus' plight highlights the danger for crypto users that their assets can be permanently lost should they not be able to remember the details needed to access their wallets.

19941774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559733,1699459252,Ethereum Failed Transactions: You Won‚Äôt Believe How Much Users Have Lost,"The Ethereum network has usually been criticized for the number of failed transactions that occur on it and how it leads to users losing their money as a result of this. This onslaught was recently renewed after a figure in the crypto community showed the staggering amount that has been lost from failed transactions. ETH Users Lose Over 100,000 To Failed Transactions In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the Marketing and Communications Director of Blockstream, Fernando Nikoliƒá, shared a screenshot that showed that Ethereum users had lost over $100,000 due to failed transactions. Interestingly, the $100,000 value happened to be only for the top 10 transactions in the screenshot, with Nikoliƒá noting that there were other ones. Related Reading: XRP News: Ripple CEO Teases Major Announcements At Swell Event From the screenshot, one can see how a particular user lost over $38,000 in gas fees from a single transaction. The second user on the list lost over $17,000 in gas fees, with others on the list also losing thousands of dollars in gas fees despite the fact that the transaction failed. Usually, gas fees paid on the Ethereum network are gone forever, irrespective of whether the transactions succeed or fail. Noteworthily, eight out of the transactions from the screenshot occurred back in May during the period of the frenzy around the meme coin PEPE, which caused an unusual surge in traffic on the Ethereum network. Failed transactions are known to occur rampantly during such periods because a surge in activity on the network leads to a significant increase in gas fees, with some users falling short of the required gas fee (at the point of executing their trade) needed to process a transaction, which causes it to fail. ETH price steady at $1,880 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Coordinated Attack On Ethereum? In his post, Nikoliƒá referred to the failed transactions on the Ethereum network as ‚Äúhot garbage.‚Äù Although his post could just be about a concerned member of the crypto community calling out the network, it bears mentioning that he happens to be the second Bitcoin maximalist calling out the network in the space of a week. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) 50-Week EMA Flashes Bullish, Is $0.45 On The Way? Another Bitcoin maximalist, Bit Paine, had earlier suggested that the network was a scam. The crypto pundit hinted that the Ethereum network has helped facilitate the creation of several ‚Äúdigital penny‚Äù stocks, which he also referred to as unregistered securities. However, both statements could be unrelated and simply two astute members of the Bitcoin community, showing why they believe Bitcoin remains supreme. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading above $1,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42419146,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxGP,1699458636,"UK‚Äôs Tough Crypto Regulator FCA Won‚Äôt Go Easy on Stablecoins, Official Says","U.K. regulators published plans to regulate stablecoins on Monday.  The FCA, which will oversee stablecoin issuers alongside the Bank of England, is setting tough standards for firms, an official told CoinDesk.  The U.K.‚Äôs financial watchdog won‚Äôt deviate from its usual tough stance on crypto when regulating stablecoins under proposed rules, an official told CoinDesk.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Monday published a discussion paper with proposals for a stablecoin regime. Though the country‚Äôs Conservative government has said it wants the U.K. to be a crypto hub and has managed to push through legislation that lets stablecoins be regulated as a means of payment, the FCA has been a strict regulator and it will do most of the supervision work involving the broader crypto sector.  ""Ultimately, we'll set the standards,"" Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, told CoinDesk. ""Those that meet the standards will be admitted and those that don't meet the standards won't get through and we won't apologize for those high standards.‚Äù  Long said officials have seen stablecoins used to launder money, as well as poor practices among issuers and issues with de-pegging, where the cryptocurrency loses its par with the asset it‚Äôs pegged to. One such de-pegging in 2022 caused devastation in crypto markets and made regulators worry about contagion and damage to broader financial systems.  ‚ÄúWe've seen lots of things that we're really concerned about and at the end of the day, the person this actually affects is the customer,"" Long said.  The regime  The FCA's proposed stablecoin regime will require prospective stablecoin issuers in the U.K. to apply for authorization. Issuers can proceed only if they can prove they meet various requirements such as ensuring their crypto maintains a stable value and they can keep accurate records that ensure a firm holds ""the correct amount of regulated stablecoin backing assets for a consumer,"" the discussion paper said.  To regulate stablecoins in the country, the FCA will work with the Bank of England, Long explained.  The BOE also released a discussion paper on Monday containing its own plans to be the primary regulator for stablecoins backed by the British pound that are in wide use ‚Äì and have the ability to threaten financial stability should they collapse.  ""We will have to come together because [under dual regulation] we are looking at [business] conduct and [the BOE is] looking at bank and prudential,"" Long said.  The FCA will be observing the market and will be on the lookout for the emergence of wide-use ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù stablecoins, Long said. He added the two regulators plan on setting out a formal agreement on what their roles will look like.  What‚Äôs next  The FCA is seeking comments on the proposals it laid out in Monday‚Äôs discussion paper. It will engage with the industry via roundtables and other discussions to gather feedback, Long said.  ""There are a number of different ways that we can approach the problem and working with industry helps us ensure that we create our high standards, avoiding money laundering, but also supporting innovation,"" he explained.

42419141,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxBF,1699456982,Access to DeFi Opportunities Is Under Threat From Within. Automation Can Help,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine‚Äôs Trading Week, sponsored by CME. Kristi P√µldsam is the co-founder of Sommelier, an automation platform for digital assets.  Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, has a problem.  We set out with the aim of making finance transparent, non-custodial and most importantly widely accessible. While we've seen promising use cases of cryptocurrencies in countries battling inflation, among those sending cross-border remittances, enabling basic payments is a far cry from achieving the true democratization of DeFi.  What we have witnessed in the world of DeFi is a rapidly shrinking set of actors reaping the lion's share of the benefits. To illustrate this, consider the case of Uniswap. V1 of the protocol set a level playing field for people looking to generate returns on their capital through providing liquidity for swaps on the platform.  Liquidity providers (LPs) simply deposited assets, and the AMM (automated market maker) supplied that liquidity across the full range of possible prices at which the assets in the pool could be traded.  However, there was a problem: LPs were consistently losing money due to impermanent loss. This called for a revamp of the AMM design, leading to the emergence of Uniswap V3. In this latest iteration, LPs can provide liquidity within specific price ranges, known as ""ticks.""  While this innovation enables more precise market-making, it comes at a cost: LPing on Uniswap V3 is now a complex endeavor demanding extensive expertise and time commitment. Consequently, only a handful of professionals dominate the majority of the platform's trading volume.  We have to create a layer on top of DeFi ‚Äúprimitives‚Äù like Uniswap (for trading), Aave (for lending), dYdX (for perpetual swaps).  This tension between efficient market creation and a concentration of profits in the hands of a select few poses a challenge. While we aimed to build DeFi protocols that promote widespread adoption and align incentives, we find ourselves mirroring the traditional finance system if only a handful of experts reap the benefits of these intricate systems.  Having spent nearly a decade working on Wall Street, I saw this pattern unfolding from a mile away. Fortunately, although the trend toward complexity favoring a select group is inevitable, restricted access to these opportunities is not.  The solution lies in automation. We have to create a layer on top of DeFi ‚Äúprimitives‚Äù like Uniswap (for trading), Aave (for lending), dYdX (for perpetual swaps), and so on. This layer should automate intricate processes such as managing concentrated liquidity positions, allowing users to deposit their capital and gain exposure to potentially profitable activities with ease.  See also: The Next Generation of Automated Settlement | Opinion  What does that automation layer look like in practice? Vaults. Over the past year, we've witnessed the proliferation of ERC-4626 vaults on Ethereum and various layer 2 solutions. These vaults range from simply holding a portfolio with a basket of assets to actively managing LP positions, taking on leverage, and executing arbitrage trades.  The most exceptional vaults achieve all this while ensuring that users maintain sole custody of their assets.  In the end, there might still be only a handful of actors directly interfacing with DeFi primitives. However, when these actors are vaults rather than private entities, the landscape transforms. Instead of private market makers monopolizing LP profits on decentralized exchanges, vaults can assume the same role while distributing those profits to a broad base of depositors in the vault.  This is the crucial automation layer that DeFi desperately needs. To steer DeFi back on course and realize the ideals of self-custody, transparency and accessibility, this is the path forward.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Kristi P√µldsam,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/08/access-to-defi-opportunities-is-under-threat-from-within-automation-can-help,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb2f88265cdb09ae4e207c26234a55258fc942a6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19940072,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559697,1699455603,"Shiba Inu Price Eyes Key Resistance, Poised For November Surge","As November unfolds, the Shiba Inu price action hangs in the balance, with technical analysis revealing a battleground of resistance and support levels that could determine the direction of the meme coin in the coming weeks. However, the bullish indicators are currently strong and could point to a continuation of the rally in the short term. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Weekly Chart The SHIB/USD weekly chart illustrates a dynamic struggle between bullish and bearish forces. A quadruple bottom pattern, evident at support levels labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, demonstrates a consistent rebound within a two-week timeframe. This pattern signifies a resolute defense by the bulls, offering a signal that indicates a solid base in the range of $0.000006 to $0.000007. In contrast, the descending triangle pattern poses a bearish threat. The flat support line at $0.00000715 and the sloping blue trend line connecting lower highs depict a narrowing field for the bulls, suggesting a potential decrease in buying momentum. The volume profile supports this, with notable declines accompanying the touches of the descending trend line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Surge In Whale Activity, Will This Affect SHIB? After rising above the 20-week EMA (red line), SHIB is facing the 0.236 Fib level at $0.00000878. Overcoming this resistance is pivotal for SHIB to assert bullish dominance and attempt to break the descending trend line just above $0.00000900. A successful breach could see the price aim for the 50-week EMA at $0.0000985 and subsequently the 0.382 Fib level at $0.00001051, a move that would signify a substantial reversal from the prevailing downtrend in the long-term price chart. Notably, the EMAs on the weekly chart indicate a still bearish sentiment with the longer-term moving averages positioned above the shorter-term ones, hinting at a sustained bearish trend. However, the recent price uptick could indicate an early sign of a shift in momentum if sustained. Daily Chart Insights The daily chart offers a more granular view of SHIB‚Äôs recent price action. The 20-day EMA has crossed above the 50 and 100-day EMAs, a bullish sign that could foresee further upside. The daily RSI is also on an uptrend, which aligns with the current bullish narrative, suggesting there is room for upward movement in November. However, a recent rejection at the 0.382 Fib level ($0.00000844) and a slip below the 200-day EMA ($0.00000836) at the beginning of the week introduced caution into the bullish case. The 200-day EMA, a critical long-term indicator of momentum, has historically acted as a decisive pivot point for SHIB. Related Reading: Self-Authentication System Of Shiba Inu Has Technical Issues, Developer Reveals The price fluctuation around this line and subsequent tests of the descending trend line underscore its significance. A breach above the 200-day EMA could signal the start of a rally, potentially propelling SHIB by an estimated 13% towards the overhead resistance posed by the descending trend line. Currently, SHIB is trading slightly below the 200-EMA. Remarkably, SHIB attacked the trend line of the ascending triangle (blue line) pattern in the weekly chart each time it surpassed the 200-day EMA. Notable is also that this always happened within one week. Thus, the 200-day EMA seems to be the most crucial resistance in the short term. If Shiba Inu breaks above the indicator, the price could rally approximately 13% to the blue trend line of the ascending triangle pattern. Afterward, the Shiba Inu price could then make its ninth attempt in the last 15 months to break out of the gigantic triangle pattern. This will be another make-or-break moment for SHIB, either massive bullish momentum is unleashed or the Shiba Inu price could fall again toward the neckline of the descending triangle at $0.00000715.

42419153,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxNd,1699455600,'Almost All of DeFi Uses the Graph' ‚Äì Q&A With Edge & Node CEO Tegan Kline,"The Graph, a project that says it's sometimes called the Google of Web3, has come out with a new roadmap, outlining new features the network will add as it characterizes itself as the leader of ""indexing"" data from blockchains.  Tegan Kline, the CEO of Edge & Node, and a speaker at Consensus 2024, the initial company developing The Graph, caught up with CoinDesk to give us an update on what The Graph is up to.  Highlights of the interview:  ""We will need a data availability layer in The Graph‚Äôs ecosystem.""  ""Almost all of DeFi uses The Graph.""  ""There's really no decentralized competitor today. The biggest competition is people that are splitting it up in-house in a centralized way.""  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Q: Tell us a little bit about The Graph?  A: The Graph organizes data in a decentralized way. So you could think of what Google does for the traditional web and organizing data so they can easily search it, The Graph does that but instead of there just being one company that can own and control and change the data, or potentially even just pretend that the data doesn't exist, The Graph Network has over 200 Google-like companies that are independent all around the world, that are organizing data and serving that data like indexing and querying. Indexing is just organizing data. And then querying is like pinging the data or searching the data.  So The Graph was the first to index data in the blockchain space. We started with the hosted service and now we have the decentralized network that's been operating for almost three years, and there's over 1,000 applications on the network today.  Q: Can you go into more detail about how indexing works?  A: Different blockchains have data on them, but the data is not organized. And so before The Graph, there was really little usage on Ethereum, and Ethereum was the main blockchain that people were needing data from back at that time.  With The Graph, we organize that data, that's on Ethereum, so developers and dapps can easily access that data, and so then applications can load quickly.  Q: Data availability ‚Äì that seems to be a big topic of conversation in the Ethereum ecosystem lately ‚Äì is that also needed for a protocol like The Graph?  A: We will need a data availability layer in The Graph‚Äôs ecosystem. You can kind of think of the Web3 stack as having multiple pieces. You have the blockchain at the bottom, and then one layer is the data availability layer, one layer is the indexing, and then the applications live on top of that stack. The Graph is a different part of the stack.  Q: How does The Graph compare and contrast with protocols like Chainlink ‚Äì Chainlink‚Äôs oracle is feeding data into blockchains and you (The Graph) are feeding data off of blockchains onto websites?  A: Yeah, it‚Äôs a great comparison.  So Chainlink is bringing data onto the blockchain and The Graph is organizing public data that's on the blockchain. So for example, we have a partnership with Chainlink and we can organize oracle data.  As an example because Chainlink, the oracle is putting that data on-chain, they're verifying it, and then The Graph is able to organize that data.  So Chainlink has all the data in the world, putting that on-chain. We have the on-chain data, taking that to the rest of the world. And we believe over time, more and more data will be on-chain.  Q: Who are you indexing that data for? Who are your customers?  A: There's so many different examples. So for example, an NFT marketplace.  So Art Blocks leverages The Graph to organize data for their NFT marketplace: seeing how many NFT's were sold and how many are in the collection, what's the price? That's an example of that data is all pulled from The Graph.  The data is on the blockchain when it comes to on-chain transactions, and so those on-chain transactions, you want to be able to pull those in real time, and you have to organize the data in an efficient way.  So applications are able to outsource this indexing to The Graph network, so they just can focus on building really amazing applications.  It's the same as you would use a Comcast, as opposed to building out your own telecom line in your house. Same with The Graph: you're outsourcing that to The Graph network, so you don't have to think about it and you can just build really amazing applications.  Almost all of DeFi uses The Graph. For example Uniswap, to see the prices of the tokens, all of that data is pulled using the Graph network.  Q: Who are your competitors? Who do you bucket yourself with and what projects are most similar to The Graph?  A: The Graph was the first to ever provide indexing for the Web3 space. There's really no decentralized competitor today. The biggest competition is people that are splitting it up in-house in a centralized way.  Q: So where is all this going? Is The Graph going to be alone in this?  A: One of the great things about The Graph is we are blockchain agnostic. We support 40 chains right now between the hosted service and the network. So that's been really nice, just not because crypto tends to get a bit tribal.  And so it's nice that we can kind of unite the ecosystems together. But I'm really excited about the future. You know, I think we've already proven we've proven the monetary policy side of crypto right with bitcoin and the need for a sound monetary system in my opinion we have but where you know where the opportunity is, and where I'm really excited about is the Web3 side because we have to build out this decentralized open-source permissionless technology.  And, we work on data, right? And we've created a new incentive system around data so that no one company can own and control that data. And really, it's about giving public data back to individuals and not having control of it as a company.  I think with crypto and Web3, we're creating a movement that is free, it's self-sovereign, and we have to make sure the Web3 stack is fully decentralized. Otherwise, there's really no point in doing what we're doing. It‚Äôs not going to be forced on anyone but I think giving people an option away from the centralized world is a really great, great thing.  Q: There‚Äôs the Graph, Edge & Node, and a foundation? How does that all differ?  A: Edge & Node is the initial team behind The Graph; we developed the protocol. The foundation launched the protocol. And now there are seven core developers that are building and contributing to the development of The Graph protocol.  One of the examples is Messari, they're a core developer. And they build subgraphs, which are the open API's that applications use. They standardize that data so that large institutions can leverage that standardized data.

42419152,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDxHR,1699452618,Can Bank-Backed Exchanges Solve Crypto Trading‚Äôs Trust Problem?,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine‚Äôs Trading Week, sponsored by CME. Dr. Bo Bai is the executive chairman and co-founder of MetaComp and the MVGX exchange.  Last week, a jury of 12 found former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried guilty on all seven fraud-related charges, bringing to a close months of industry navel-gazing. Following 2022‚Äôs slew of collapses and scandals, all owing to poor risk management, governance and oversight, the very fabric of the crypto industry has changed, leaving many to contemplate its future as a new cast of characters comes to the fore.  New, but also not so new: the very financial institutions that crypto initially sought to distance itself from now occupy the headlines. Financial giant Franklin Templeton fueled the flames for the tokenized real-world assets when it launched a tokenized money-market fund earlier this year while others, including Deutsche Bank and HSBC have signaled intent or have launched blockchain-based financial products in the market.  The rules of engagement are changing. ""Institutional-grade"" is the new norm. Investors are now more interested in tokenized equivalents of existing products than the previous allure of mechanisms such as yield farming, staking and more. Decentralized finance (DeFi), frankly, seems all but pass√©. So for those of us in the trading space, what does that actually mean?  Redefining institutional-grade  Previously, the concept of institutional-grade was a matter of product, rather than infrastructure ‚Äî be it spot or margin trading capabilities, or even new contract types not previously seen for digital assets such as perpetual futures. After last year, it‚Äôs come to stand for something a little more pragmatic: safety.  In a post-FTX climate, the tides turned. Whether institutional or retail, it is now less about returns, guaranteed or otherwise, and more about whether an entity can be trusted. This is somewhat counterintuitive in an industry underpinned by blockchain, a technology that upholds trustlessness as a core tenet.  See also: Code vs. Values: The Crypto Twist on 'Trust' | Opinion  For bank-backed exchanges, trust is what draws in clients ‚Äî trust in the brand, but also the existing regulatory and compliance frameworks associated with the exchange to their affiliations with financial institutions. This is, in reality, the only legitimate difference from other centralized exchanges operating with the same licenses on the same turf.  In countries where there is a clear regulatory regime in place for digital asset trading ‚Äî such as the United Kingdom or Singapore ‚Äî the virtue of being bank-backed is but another foot in the compliance door.  This is especially apparent with regard to custody. The intensifying debate about the segregation of customer and corporate funds among exchanges hit a fever pitch this year, leading to increased scrutiny, especially among institutional clients assessing the safest trading venues. In fact, 90% of surveyed institutional investors trust TradFi firms more to keep custody of their digital assets. More often than not, these custody solutions are already fundamentally separate by design from their brokerage counterparts.  See also: Franklin Templeton CEO: The Future of the Crypto Industry Is Regulated  Standard Chartered Bank, for example, launched Zodia Custody, an institution-focused digital asset custodian, backed by SBI and Northern Trust. Its sister company, an institutional digital asset trading and brokerage venue, Zodia Markets, is a fully independent company with a different shareholding structure.  Within a robust regulatory regime, there are pathways to offering safe and trusted digital asset trading services via banks  Distinguished by its non-custodial trading capabilities, institutional customers choose from a network of trusted custodians where to hold their assets.  Knowing your customer  While bank-backed exchanges are meeting evolving demands and expectations of new customer segments in crypto, the reality is that they serve the needs of a limited few. From a variety of perspectives, they are not offering anything new in terms of products or accessibility.  Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest bank DBS, is among the few financial institutions that have launched their own digital asset exchanges. However, it operates solely on a member-based structure, with participation limited to financial institutions, corporate accredited investors and professional market makers.  Individual investors can only trade on DBS‚Äôs exchange via a member entity, such as the bank‚Äôs private banking unit. Restrictions aside, its popularity has grown. Earlier this year, its BTC trading volumes were up by 80%, according to a bank statement.  Naturally, what has made DBS‚Äô model so successful is the unique paradigm under which it operates, in a city-state that has long favored private-public sector dialogue. Within a robust regulatory regime, there are pathways to offering safe and trusted digital asset trading services via banks.  Leveraging limitations  Earlier this summer, EDX Markets made waves when it launched in the United States, making it the closest thing to a bank-backed exchange state-side. Backed by financial heavyweights such as Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, it looked to bridge the gap between financial institutions and digital asset natives.  Despite the mounting regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the past year, the emergence of EDX Markets served as a bright spot amid all the enforcement actions that have taken place in the past year.  See also: Crypto Exchange Backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Launches  But until the dynamic shifts such that these bank-backed venues are in a position to accept retail players, my hunch is that the market will stay as is. These developments are less about operational choices and more to do with overcoming regulatory roadblocks.  Now, more than ever before, safety and trust are integral to crypto. However, purely leaning on the reputation of the traditional banking industry shouldn‚Äôt be the only solution. Blockchain is inherently the right technology to build a financial system that is less reliant on the morality and management of individuals, and we‚Äôre slowly seeing its benefits reemerge as the dust settles after a tumultuous year of industry scrutiny.  Exchanges built for crypto-native investors still have the edge over the latecomers. And if we‚Äôre all after a similar slice of the pie, the banks will need to get in line.

The landmark MiCA framework focuses heavily on supervising stablecoin issuers. It sets strict reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers and restricts the circulation of foreign currency-denominated stablecoins in the EU.  The EBA consultations published Wednesday ‚Äì which form part of the third batch of policy products under MiCA ‚Äì follow calls from the banking authority for stablecoin issuers to anticipate MiCA rules set to apply in December next year. The guidelines cover a range of requirements, including regular liquidity stress testing for large stablecoin issuers, and capital and liquidity requirements for stablecoin reserve assets.  ""Through recovery planning, issuers of ART [asset-referenced token] or EMT [e-money token] should prepare in advance to face adverse scenarios that may impact their ability to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the reserve of assets,"" the watchdog said.  CoinDesk reported in June that the EBA was planning extra rules for stablecoin issuers that have bank asset reserves. The EBA consultations confirmed it will supervise stablecoins classified as ""significant"" and must have own funds equal to 3% of their reserve rather than the usual 2%.  Guidelines in the consultations package include criteria to be used for ""deciding 'the most relevant' custodians of the reserve of assets, trading platforms, payment service providers providing payment services in relation to the significant EMTs and crypto-assets service providers providing custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of clients"" as well as conditions under which ARTs and EMTs could be considered as widely used in a member state ""for the purpose of determining the composition of a supervisory college"" under MiCA.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance has released a self-custody Web3 wallet that can be used to interact with the DeFi ecosystem. Users are required to use the Binance app to create a wallet, with the app serving as the venue for activities such as staking, lending and borrowing. The wallet will also use multiparty computation (MPC), which involves a private key being broken into three parts of which the wallet owner controls two, as a means of removing the need to memorize seed phrases. The new wallet appears to compete with TrustWallet, which the exchange bought in 2018. TrustWallet's native token (TWT) fell following Binance's announcement. TWT had experienced a positive week prior to this, thanks in part to Binance listing TWT futures on its exchange, which saw volume increase from around $80 million to $476 million on Monday.  HSBC said it plans to start a custody service of tokenized securities for institutional clients alongside Swiss crypto custodian Metaco. The service is set to go live in 2024 and will complement HSBC's existing platform for digital asset issuance and its recent tokenized physical gold offering, the bank said. HSBC pointed out that the service will not pertain to cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Tokenization, the process of issuing and trading real-world assets on blockchains, is one of the most prominent ways in which major financial institutions are becoming involved in the digital asset industry. Boston Consulting Group estimated last year that tokenization could become a $16 trillion industry by 2030.  Grayscale's investment product linked to Chainlink's LINK token is trading at a 200% premium to spot prices, which suggests institutional demand. The Grayscale Chainlink Trust (GLNK) closed at $39 on Monday compared with $21 on Oct. 31. Each GLNK share holds just $12 worth of LINK, making it nearly three times pricier than the actual value of held assets. The product has historically traded at a premium of over 20%. While premiums have reached as much as 150% on two separate occasions since the product's launch in May last year, Monday's is its highest ever. LINK tokens themselves have surged over 76% in the last month.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the spread between Deribit's ETH DVOL and BTC DVOL indices. DVOL represents options-implied expectations for price turbulence over 30 days.  The spread has narrowed to -0.6 from -11.6 on Oct. 23, a sign investor focus has shifted from market leader bitcoin to ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies.

19937671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559708,1699448409,"MATIC Propels Over $0.75, Is $1 Possible?","Amid the bullish trend circling the cryptocurrency market due to the recently concluded Uptober rally, Polygon‚Äôs native crypto MATIC has recently gained traction recording a 50% increase in price surge in the last 20 days. MATIC Experiences Price Growth The recently concluded Uptober (October) which is believed to be a month of green (gains) saw some cryptocurrencies performing significantly great. Many altcoins experienced price surges during the past month, and one of the notable altcoins that benefited from this is MATIC. The crypto asset recently went past the crucial $0.75 mark sparking momentum toward reaching the significant $1 mark. However, if the token is fortunate enough to sustain its current pace, it might reach the $1 mark by the end of 2023. Related Reading: Polygon‚Äôs POL Upgrade Live On Ethereum Mainnet, MATIC To $1? MATIC reaching the coveted $1 mark is expected to happen if the token manages to surpass $0.85 in November. Meanwhile, a reverse below $0.75 will bring the MATIC price down to $0.55, if buyers are unable to maintain their lead at $0.60. MATIC‚Äôs¬†Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have also experienced a significant breakout over the recent weeks. The price of MATIC experienced a price surpassing the crucial $0.75 barrier after the crypto‚Äôs 200-day EMA breakout. MATIC surpassing a 200-day EMA puts it on its way to potentially reaching the $1 mark by the end of the year. This is because, in the Polygon chart, a golden crossover opportunity appears when the 50-day and 200-day EMAs are crossed above. While the 50-day EMA‚Äôs upward trend suggests that a golden crossover could take place, the bull run cutting across the 200-day EMA may also suggest a reversal movement. However, the crypto asset has managed to sustain its upward trajectory since it surpassed the 200-day EMA. Significance Of The Crypto‚Äôs Market Currently, the token‚Äôs price is sitting at $0.77, indicating an 8% daily increase in price with a 24-hour trading volume of $489,605,430. The token market is standing robust, ranking 13 in the cryptocurrency market with a market cap of $7 billion. MATIC has a significant market presence and a circulating supply of 9.24 billion MATIC, which buttresses its long-term technical score and puts it above 48% of all cryptocurrencies in service. Related Reading: MATIC Price Rally Threatened As Whales Deposit Millions Of Tokens To Exchanges One significant aspect of the surge in MATIC‚Äôs price is that the token experienced a 33% year-to-date (YTD) decline in September. Consequently, the crypto recovered from this within a month. In addition, the token‚Äôs strong bullish candles and rising volumes hint at a continuation of an upward trajectory. As a result of this, buyers have a good chance of maintaining their lead at the current price of MATIC. So far, MATIC has experienced a 50% increase in the last 20 days, putting it in a profitable position following the 33% year-to-date decline in September. With the current bullish continuation, the token presents more profits in the future.

19936067,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559675,1699444817,Cardano Whales Go On $600 Million Buying Spree That Could Trigger Run To $0.4,"Cardano (ADA) is one of the tokens currently in the limelight as many projects do well in the ‚ÄòAtcoin Season‚Äô as Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance cools off. The token has rallied in recent days, and one of the reasons for this resurgence has been revealed. Cardano Whales Are Accumulating In a post on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock noted that investors‚Äô confidence in the Cardano token grew in October as ADA whales and investors accumulated 1.89 billion ADA during that period. This translates to over $600 million invested in ADA tokens. Related Reading: XRP News: Ripple CEO Teases Major Announcements At Swell Event Interestingly, the decision by these big holders already seems to be paying off as the majority of this accumulation is said to have taken place between the price range of $0.249 and $0.271. These big holders could be accumulating for the long term rather than moving to realize their profits as soon as possible, and these could sustain a price rally to $0.4. Back in August, the market intelligence platform Santiment highlighted the fact Cardano was seeing its highest level in accumulation dating back to September 2022, as ‚Äúwhales and sharks‚Äù who were holding between 100,000 and 10 million ADA tokens had accumulated $116.1 million in ADA since May 21st. However, the sentiment toward Cardano seemed to turn bearish in September, as data from Santiment revealed that these Cardano whales had sold or redistributed about 1.02 billion ADA during a certain period in the month. Can ADA Hit $0.4? It remains to be seen whether this accumulation phase could trigger a run to $0.40. There is, however, no doubt that these whales dumping their tokens in a bid to realize profits would significantly affect Cardano‚Äôs resurgence. Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had mentioned while providing a technical analysis that Cardano‚Äôs current run could see it peak at $0.40 while almost ruling out the possibility of the token hitting the $0.45 price target before a retracement happens. Related Reading: Dogecoin Climbs Above $0.075 To 3-Month High, But Metrics Show It‚Äôs Far From Done Speaking of a possible retracement, Gambardello stated that ADA could drop to around $0.29 and $0.30 based on the moving average structure. Another crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, also echoed this prediction as he mentioned in an X post that the TD Sequential presents a sell signal on the ADA daily chart with a possible correction to the $0.30 support level. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.35, up by over 1%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42392097,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0nn7,1699444800,"New Cryptocurrencies Getting Created at Slowest Pace in 3 Years, CertiK Data Shows","Just as green shoots are appearing in crypto markets, a new data set has emerged showing just how dramatically the pace of blockchain development slowed recently.  The amount of new token creation dropped during the third quarter to the lowest since at least the start of 2021, according to blockchain smart-contract auditor CertiK. The company created the data set by using the list of tokens added each quarter to the tracking website CoinMarketCap, and then stripping out so-called memecoins that serve no ostensible purpose but to provide yuks and a vessel for speculation.  Some 293 new tokens were added in the third quarter, down from 366 in the second quarter and 449 in the year-earlier period, according to the data. During the height of the bull market in cryptocurrencies in the fourth quarter of 2021, some 1,261 new tokens were created.  The numbers are consistent with separate reports illustrating the depths of so-called crypto winter. A report last month from the digital-asset firm Galaxy noted that venture-capital funding for crypto and blockchain projects slid last quarter to the lowest since late 2020.  ""It may still be a sign of crypto winter where everyone has paused developing and launching, waiting for the arrival of spring,"" said Ronghui Gu, CertiK's co-founder, who is also an assistant professor of computer science at Columbia University in New York.  Decline in liquidity  Several blockchain projects have had to cut staff, with NFT marketplace OpenSea being the latest to do so, announcinga 50% reduction on Nov. 3, with the CEO writing in a post on X that the company was ""building a new foundation.""  ""It's probably partially due the general decline in liquidity in the industry,"" said Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at the independent investment-research firm FundStrat. ""No one wants to list a token when there there is a lack of risk-taking.""  But the price of bitcoin staged a powerful rally in October, and major altcoins have also been on the rise, fueling speculation that the worst of the market malaise might be over.  Last week, funds for investing in cryptocurrencies attracted some $767 million of fresh money, marking the best six-week stretch since the 2021 bull market.  The recent drop in token listings may reflect, to some degree, a maturation of the crypto industry, FundStrat's Farrell said.  ""There are more legitimate projects out there now, so the battle for that incremental liquidity is tougher,"" he said. ""The bar for launching a token is higher.""  Some would-be issuers may have been deterred by the risk of running afoul of regulators ‚Äì a heedfulness that may not have existed in prior eras of the 14-year-old crypto industry.  ""The regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has discouraged many projects from launching tokens,"" Farrell said.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/07/new-cryptocurrencies-getting-created-at-slowest-pace-in-3-years-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/109f10549685ec9988bea837c93d20c5657e3d42-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

19934346,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559699,1699441247,Exploring The Resurgence Of BNB: Unveiling The Force Behind Renewed Interest,"Binance Coin (BNB) has experienced a notable resurgence in the last few weeks, sparking a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market. With its versatile applications and growing popularity, BNB has captured the attention of influential investors, leading to a surge in on-chain activities that have stirred the digital asset community. The latest developments surrounding BNB reveal intriguing movements within the crypto space, particularly with the recent actions of a prominent whale investor. Related Reading: Defensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023 Whale‚Äôs Strategic BNB Acquisition And Deployment According to a recent report shared by Lookonchain, a significant whale recently acquired a substantial amount of BNB, totaling 22,319 coins valued at a staggering $5.6 million. In an unexpected move, the whale swiftly withdrew the acquired BNB from the Binance exchange over the course of the last three days. Rather than holding the assets, the whale strategically injected these tokens into liquidity pools on both Biswap and PancakeSwap, aiming to generate additional revenue through trading fees. The #BinanceBlockchainWeek is coming soon! The price of $BNB has increased by 10% in the past week. A whale withdrew 22,319 $BNB($5.6M) from #Binance in the past 3 days and provided liquidity on #Biswap and #PancakeSwap to earn trading fees.https://t.co/dQTc7OUNp2 pic.twitter.com/GIzxVT9mvF ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 6, 2023 The implications of this large-scale BNB movement have been manifold, triggering notable fluctuations in the coin‚Äôs price and market positioning. At the time of reporting, BNB is trading at $245, experiencing a minor dip of 2.2% in the last 24 hours. However, this dip comes amidst a significant seven-day rise of nearly 10%, indicating the ongoing dynamic nature of BNB‚Äôs value within the market. While these fluctuations are not uncommon within the volatile crypto sphere, the recent whale activity has certainly played a pivotal role in shaping BNB‚Äôs current trajectory. Related Reading: Analyzing ADA Solid 25% Gain: Signs Point To Cardano Rally Ahead BNB market cap currently at $37.414 billion on the 24-hour chart at TradingView.com Market Impact: BNB‚Äôs Price Volatility The significance of the whale‚Äôs strategic investment and subsequent actions on Biswap and PancakeSwap cannot be understated. By adding a substantial amount of BNB to the liquidity pools, the whale has effectively contributed to the overall liquidity and trading volume of these platforms, potentially enhancing the overall ecosystem for BNB and other associated tokens. This move not only demonstrates the growing confidence in BNB‚Äôs potential but also highlights the increasingly diverse strategies that influential investors are employing within the cryptocurrency landscape. BNB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Amidst these developments, BNB recently faced a temporary setback as XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, briefly surpassed BNB in terms of market capitalization, relegating BNB to the fifth position. However, the setback proved to be short-lived as Binance Coin swiftly reclaimed its fourth spot from XRP, underscoring its resilience and enduring appeal within the competitive cryptocurrency market. With growing investor interest and strategic maneuvers shaping its trajectory, BNB‚Äôs chart in the coming months is poised to be a compelling narrative within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

""Whether in wholesale form ‚Äì as a type of digital central bank reserve ‚Äì or retail form ‚Äì as a digital banknote ‚Äì it is increasingly clear, at least to me, that these new forms of money will sit at the core of the future financial system,"" Carstens said in a speech at a conference on CBDCs in Basel, Switzerland on Wednesday.  Under the group's recommendation, central banks around the world are exploring issuing digital versions of sovereign currencies. But monetary authorities will have only a limited role to play in the issuance of CBDCs compared with the private sector, according to Carstens.  ""Most customer-facing services will remain in the private sector's remit,"" Carstens said. ""Cyber resilience among these institutions will also be crucial to maintaining trust in the system as a whole ... And this activity does not need to be done by individual organizations in isolation ‚Äì we can share knowledge. In fact, collaboration between the private and public sectors is key to manage existing and emerging cyber threats,"" he said.  Carstens pointed to security challenges in operating CBDC systems but said that, in order to succeed, ""it will be crucial not to ignore other design objectives,"" such as maintaining an appropriate level of privacy, especially in retail CBDCs.  ""Central banks know that they have a responsibility not only to keep pace with the digital age, but to lead innovation to ensure that it serves the public good,"" Carstens said.  He recently called on countries to set up relevant legislation to support CBDC issuance.

Together, the platforms will form a complete digital asset offering for institutional clients, the bank said.  Banks and financial institutions are bringing a range of real-world assets (RWA) onto blockchains, both private ledgers and public networks like Ethereum, in a process known as tokenization. Last month, regulators in Singapore, Japan, the U.K. and Switzerland said they will test tokenization for fixed income, foreign exchange and asset management products.  HSBC pointed out its custody plans, for now, involve ‚Äútokenized securities issued on third-party platforms, e.g., private and/ or public blockchain compatible tokenized bonds or tokenized structured products (not for custody of cryptocurrencies or stablecoins).‚Äù  In September, CoinDesk reported HSBC was working with Fireblocks, another custody technology firm.

19931499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559676,1699435455,Defensive Moves: XRP Bulls Firmly Shield $0.66 Before Ripple Swell 2023,"XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, has been making headlines in recent trading sessions as it grapples with a critical support level and the challenges of overbought territory. Despite its struggles, XRP has managed to maintain its position above the $0.66 support level, reflecting its resilience in the face of market pressures. Overbought territory refers to a situation where an asset‚Äôs price has risen to such an extent that it is considered overvalued in the short term. This often leads to a correction or a pullback in the price as traders take profits or sell off their positions. In the case of XRP, it has entered this overbought zone, which is typically indicated by technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rising above 70. While this may sound like a warning sign, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that XRP is ripe for selling. Related Reading: Analyzing ADA Solid 25% Gain: Signs Point To Cardano Rally Ahead Challenges Amid Attempts At Breakout Recent attempts by XRP to break out above the pivotal $0.66 level have been met with resistance, leading to retracements. This echoes the challenges faced by the broader cryptocurrency market, where price surges are often followed by corrections. However, XRP managed to break through the $0.60 barrier last week, driven by buying pressure from retail traders.

Many are pondering whether Ripple will make significant announcements during the event, such as an initial public offering or strategic partnerships. The anticipation surrounding the event has had a positive impact on XRP‚Äôs valuation, witnessing a 14% increase in its market value. Analyzing XRP Status The current price of XRP, as reported by CoinGecko, stands at $0.676542, with a 2.3% dip in the last 24 hours but a notable seven-day rally of 15%. This upward momentum is indicative of the optimism surrounding Ripple and XRP‚Äôs future prospects. XRP price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko The Ripple Swell event is expected to address critical industry themes, highlighting new partnerships and company milestones. Its timing, coinciding with the conclusion of DC Fintech Week, ensures that Ripple‚Äôs updates will reach an audience deeply engaged in fintech discussions. Additionally, Ripple‚Äôs recent legal battles and the subsequent increase in the value of XRP add to the positive narrative for Ripple‚Äôs presentations at the Swell event. XRP market cap currently at $36.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cautionary Signal Despite the overbought condition signaled by the RSI, XRP‚Äôs reluctance to cross below the 70 level should be viewed as a cautionary signal rather than a reason to sell. It indicates that there is still potential for upside movement in the payments token. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase? If sidelined investors enter the market, XRP‚Äôs price could continue to rise, potentially pushing it above the $0.69 resistance level. XRP remains in a precarious position in overbought territory, but the crypto community‚Äôs optimism and the upcoming Ripple Swell event contribute to a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs future.

19929544,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559658,1699431342,Market Makers Bet Big On Bitcoin Price Surge: Expert,"In a series of insightful observations, Adam Cochran, a renowned expert in the field of cryptocurrency and founder of Cinneamhain Ventures, recently shared his analysis on the relationship between Bitcoin price movements and US Treasury auctions. Cochran‚Äôs comments, primarily disseminated viaX (formerly known as Twitter), offer a unique perspective on an emerging trend in the market, particularly in relation to traditional financial instruments. Bitcoin Price Rises After Each Treasury Auction Cochran notes a distinct pattern: ‚ÄúSome big market maker seems to really care about real rates vs Bitcoin (I guess in anticipation of ETF buyers?). Every time you get a good auction on US treasuries, you‚Äôve got about 5 min before BTC takes a leg up.‚Äù This observation suggests a correlation between the outcomes of USTreasury auctions and subsequent movements in Bitcoin prices. The essence of Cochran‚Äôs theory revolves around the concept of real interest rates and their inverse relationship with Bitcoin. Real rates refer to the interest rates adjusted for inflation. In traditional finance, these rates significantly influence investment decisions across various asset classes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Targets $46,000 As DXY Receives Kiss Of Death Cochran posits that a successful US Treasury auction, which typically indicates lower yields (and hence lower real rates), is quickly followed by a spike in Bitcoin prices. This trend, according to Cochran, is indicative of a market maker betting on large funds allocating to Bitcoin as a hedge against real rates. This relationship becomes particularly significant in light of discussions around Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to Bloomberg experts, there is a 90% chance of a spot Bitcoin ETF receiving approval by the end of the year. One of the reasons for this is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been actively communicating with applicants such as BlackRock and Fidelity in recent weeks, as a result of which amendments to the application have been submitted. The increasing seriousness of these conversations seems to have amplified the correlation, as noted by Cochran: ‚ÄúSomeone is making the bet that large funds will allocate to Bitcoin as a counter to real rates which would be huge.‚Äù Related Reading: Altcoins Market Share Versus Bitcoin At A 4 Month High: What‚Äôs The Trigger? Furthermore, Cochran highlights the impact of Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements on the broader financial market: ‚ÄúThe BTC momentum on any upswing is pretty clear, it‚Äôll suck a lot of momentum out of other parts of the market, because its current catalysts are just on another scale.‚Äù Backtest For The Theory Still Pending In response to an inquiry about backtesting this theory, Cochran admitted the lack of long-term data but emphasized the recent nature of this trend: ‚ÄúHrm, someone probably has that data? I‚Äôve just been monitoring manually, and the correlation has only been the past few weeks to month, since the ETF convo got serious, so a long dated backtest wouldn‚Äôt hold.‚Äù This acknowledgment points to the nascent stage of this observed correlation. Nevertheless, Cochran‚Äôs insights offer a compelling narrative linking traditional financial markets with Bitcoin. As the conversation around Bitcoin ETFs gains momentum, these observations could become increasingly relevant, offering valuable insights for investors. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $35,278.

42392098,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0o2V,1699430462,Investment Adviser Two Prime Sees $2B in Demand for Bitcoin-Backed Loans,"Cryptocurrencies appear to have staying power, Federal Reserve‚Äôs Chairman Jerome Powell said in June. Perhaps truer words have never been spoken, as the market value of all cryptocurrencies has doubled to $1.3 trillion this year, recovering from last year‚Äôs crash.  More impressive is the renewed interest in centralized crypto-collateralized finance after last year‚Äôs controversial collapse of industry giants BlockFi, Celsius, and others.  ‚ÄúSince the soft launch of our lending offering on Sept. 13, we‚Äôve been surprised by how much demand there is for crypto-secured loans,‚Äù Alexander Blume, managing partner at SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, told CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúWe have seen about $2 billion in demand for bitcoin-secured loans since we started offering them in September,‚Äù Blume said.  Crypto-collateralized lending is an arrangement where a borrower pledges bitcoin [BTC], ether [ETH], or other digital assets as security and primarily draws the loan in the form of fiat currencies. In case a debt goes bad, the lender usually, as the contractual authority, liquidates the pledged crypto asset to recover the amount loaned.  The loans are typically overcollateralized, meaning the value of the collateral is far greater than the loan‚Äôs value. It ensures the lender has some cushion to protect against losses from a potential decline in the value of the collateral asset.  Crypto-backed fiat loans are preferred during bullish market trends as rising prices boost the value of the collateral while the borrower deploys the fiat loan to purchase other cryptocurrencies or buy mining equipment, usually denominated in U.S. dollars.  The arrangement allows miners or investors to keep their crypto holdings while sourcing additional fiat money to fund operations and yield-generating strategies.  CeFi platforms like BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager saw tremendous growth during the 2020-21 bull runs before last year's crypto market crash exposed the lack of proper risk prevention measures at these lending giants. At its peak, Celsius had over $20 billion worth of assets under management and more than 1.7 million users.  The three firms declared bankruptcy last year, freezing depositors‚Äô accounts and their ability to withdraw their money. The episode drew the ire of U.S. regulators.  ""After the fall of Genesis, BlockFi, Celsius, and others, a major gap in the market emerged for responsibly managed secured loans for institutions. Two Prime is well-positioned to fill it,"" Blume said, adding that we are focused on institutional borrowers.  About 85% of the fiat loans extended by Two Prime so far are collateralized by bitcoin, while the rest are secured by ether and other larger alternative cryptocurrencies.  Interest rates vary based on loan-to-value ratio, duration and size, but generally range from 5% to 12%, Blume said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/08/investment-advisor-two-prime-sees-2b-in-demand-for-bitcoin-backed-loans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14e5c4264253d8fca4cb90af94d65bbae516af8e-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token is currently trading at $1.49, dropping 7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  The wallet was acquired by Binance in 2018 in a deal that included a mixture of cash, Binance stock and a portion of BNB tokens, according to TechCrunch. The value of BNB in July 2018 was $14.80, now trading at $244.  Trust Wallet is a product that lets users store and use cryptocurrencies across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Binance's newly unveiled wallet is very similar; it will work across 30 different blockchains and can be used for staking, lending and borrowing.  One difference, however, is that the new wallet is only accessible via the platform‚Äôs native app, which could be restrictive to users who don't have or don‚Äôt want to sign up for a Binance exchange account.  TWT token experienced a positive week before Binance‚Äôs release, rising by more than 60% since last Wednesday.

The new product, which will work across 30 blockchain networks, was announced at the Binance Blockchain Week conference in Istanbul.  ""Web3 wallets represent more than just storing digital assets; they are an integral part of the Web3 framework, empowering individuals with the ability for self-sovereign finance,"" CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao said.  Binance's Web3 wallet will compete with the likes of MetaMask and Trust Wallet, the latter of which was acquired by Binance in 2018. Binance listed a futures market for TrustWallet's native token [TWT] earlier this week. The TWT price slid after the announcement, taking the 24-hour change to a 7% drop.  The new wallet uses Trust Wallet's Wallet as a Service (WaaS) technology, also announced today. That product is intended to shorten the development time for companies looking to introduce Web3 wallets by offering a range of services including asset management and cross-chain transfers.  Other competing centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase and OKX, also have Web3 wallets.  Users can create a wallet through Binance's mobile app, which will also serve as the venue for DeFi activities like staking, lending and borrowing. A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk that users are required to complete KYC to access the wallet.  Web3 wallets are common targets for hackers and exploiters, as once a private key is obtained by a hacker, all funds can be irreversibly drained.  Binance hopes to remedy that with multi-party computation (MPC), which removes the need for users to memorize seed phrases without compromising the benefits of security and self-custody. MPC involves a private key being broken up into three parts called key shares, with two of the three key shares being controlled by the wallet owner.  ""Ultimately, our priority is to ensure users can explore Web3 with us within a user-friendly and protected environment,‚Äù CZ added.  UPDATE (Nov. 8, 10:00 UTC): Adds TWT token price in fourth paragraph.  UPDATE (Nov. 8, 14:45 UTC): Adds Trust Wallet's Wallet as a Service technology in fifth paragraph.

19922130,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559632,1699416048,Coinbase Driving Solana Bull Run: Will SOL 2X To $80?,"Solana (SOL) is one of the top performers, looking at price action in the weekly chart. According to¬†Kaiko, SOL‚Äôs net buying, measured via cumulative volume delta (CVD), has been led by Coinbase, one of the most active cryptocurrency exchanges in the past few trading weeks. To illustrate, since October 18, the blockchain analytics platform notes that 2.2 million SOL have been purchased, an indicator of rising demand as the broader crypto market thaws. Coinbase Leading The Solana Buying Wave At over 2.2 million SOL purchased, Coinbase leads the wave of buying pressure. However, closely behind, Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by client count, follows. There are around 2 million SOL bought through Binance from October 18, highlighting the role of the exchange in funneling liquidity to SOL. Even so, specific drivers forcing users to opt for Coinbase over Binance couldn‚Äôt be laid out. Related Reading: Dogecoin Climbs Above $0.075 To 3-Month High, But Metrics Show It‚Äôs Far From Done While at it, there is rising demand for SOL on Kraken. Even so, demand for SOL has been fizzling on Bybit, Upbit, and OKX over the same period. It couldn‚Äôt be ascertained why the trajectory on these exchanges has been trending lower. However, what‚Äôs clear is that all of these exchanges allow derivatives trading of multiple assets, including SOL. When writing on November 7, SOL is a top-10 coin by market cap. Perched at seventh in the leaderboard, Solana has flipped Cardano, Dogecoin, and Tron, cementing its position considering the over $7 billion gap between the seventh and eighth projects in the market cap ranking. The CVD measures the difference between buying and selling volume over a period. The tool can be used to identify trends. When rising, the uptrend might continue while a falling CVD points otherwise. SOL Trending At New 2023 Highs: Will The Uptrend Continue? At spot levels, SOL is also changing hands at around $43, trending at around 2023 highs after breaking above the resistance level at $32 in late October. The uptrend could continue, considering the surging interest Solana continues to garner. This may push the coin 2X to $80, a critical resistance, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the weekly chart. This demand is primarily because of improving investor confidence and Solana Labs‚Äô decision to roll out new features and strike strategic partnerships, pulling more capital to SOL. Rising CVD could suggest that institutions might be eying SOL, aiming to ride the uptrend.

Three new blockchain-based payments corridors will open between Onafriq users in Africa and customers of PayAngel in the U.K., Pyypl in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Zazi Transfer in Australia, according to an announcement Wednesday at Swell, Ripple‚Äôs annual conference, in Dubai.  ‚ÄúOnafriq is a major payment player in Africa that serves 400 million mobile wallets,‚Äù said Monica Long, president at Ripple, in an interview. ‚ÄúWe are excited about this because it also contributes to Ripple payments being able to cover 90% of FX markets.‚Äù  Ripple has become a mascot of resistance within the crypto industry for standing up to, and partially prevailing against, what is largely regarded as a heavy-handed and reactionary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Meanwhile, the price of XRP spiked this week, fueled by the approval of the token by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, as well as Ripple‚Äôs involvement in a central bank digital currency (CBDC) project with National Bank of Georgia (NBG). XRP, an open source project used by Ripple, acts as a bridge between two fiat currencies to facilitate faster and more efficient cross-border payments.  In addition, Ripple announced various product enhancements and license updates, including a focus on payments between enterprises and smaller businesses. Ripple has been steadily building up its collection of licenses, including money transmitter licenses in the U.S. and an institutional payments license in Singapore, with recent filings in the U.K. and EU.  ‚ÄúOur set of licenses means we can serve a bigger market,‚Äù Long said. ‚ÄúPreviously, we only served licensed financial institutions and now we're able to serve enterprises and SMEs.

BTC struggled again and is now correcting lower toward the $35,200 support. Bitcoin again failed to clear the key $36,000 resistance zone. The price is trading above $35,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a major contracting triangle with resistance near $35,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is correcting gains and might find support near $35,200 or $35,000. Bitcoin Price Faces Uphill Task Bitcoin price remained stable above the $34,000 support zone. BTC attempted a fresh increase above the $35,250 resistance zone. There was a break above a major contracting triangle with resistance near $35,000 on the hourly chart. It even cleared the $35,500 resistance, but the bears were active near the $36,000 zone. A high was formed near $35,900 and the price is again moving lower. There was a move below the $35,500 level. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $34,560 swing low to the $35,900 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $35,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It seems to be approaching the $35,200 support or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $34,560 swing low to the $35,900 high. If it stays above $35,200, there might be a fresh increase. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $35,560 level. The next key resistance could be near $35,900 or the recent high. The main resistance is still near $36,000. A clear move above the $36,000 resistance might open the doors for a move toward the $37,000 resistance. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance could be $37,500, above which the price could rise toward $38,000. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $38,800 level. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $35,560 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $35,200 low. The next major support is near the $35,000 zone or the 100 hourly SMA. If there is a move below $35,000, there is a risk of more downsides. In the stated case, the price could revisit the $34,000 support level in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

19920552,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559625,1699412404,Bitcoin Throne Shaken? XRP And Emerging Tokens Steal The Spotlight,"According to a recent Bloomberg report, the crypto market is experiencing a significant rally, with speculative demand expanding beyond the revival of Bitcoin (BTC). In November, gauges tracking the performance of the bottom half and mid-tier tokens in MarketVector‚Äôs index of the largest 100 digital assets surged by 16% and 14%, respectively. This surpasses the broader market‚Äôs 4% gain and Bitcoin‚Äôs modest 1% rise. As a result, BTC‚Äôs dominance in the $1.38 trillion crypto market has decreased to around 49%, down from its peak of 51.5% in October, as per CoinGecko data. This decline is often perceived as a sign of growing risk appetite among digital asset investors. Optimism Spreads Beyond Bitcoin Richard Galvin, co-founder at Digital Asset Capital Management, noted that this rally is ‚Äúmore extensive and sustained‚Äù than any price action seen since January. Galvin mentioned to Bloomberg that in an environment still ‚Äúrelatively thin‚Äù in terms of liquidity, substantial upward movements are being witnessed. Bitcoin experienced a notable 28% surge last month, the largest since January, driven by expectations of the first US Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) securing approval for direct investment in the token. Related Reading: Analyzing ADA Solid 25% Gain: Signs Point To Cardano Rally Ahead Per the report, the general sense of optimism has extended beyond Bitcoin, fueled by speculations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) has concluded its interest-rate hikes. Furthermore, according to Bloomberg, the crypto rally is spreading to other areas, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), encompassing blockchain projects facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. Interest rates to borrow stablecoins on major DeFi lender Aave have exceeded 10%, indicating investors‚Äô willingness to pay higher costs to fund trading positions. XRP Strength Shines Amid Ripple‚Äôs Legal Battle Among ‚Äúsmaller tokens,‚Äù XRP demonstrated strength in November by recording a 14% increase. This surge can be attributed to Ripple‚Äôs recent partial legal victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit raised questions regarding whether XRP should be classified as a security falling under the regulatory purview of the SEC. As a result, XRP is currently trading at $0.6699, experiencing a notable decline of over 5% in the past 24 hours after failing to consolidate above current levels. Nonetheless, the token has generated significant profits, evidenced by its 11.4% surge over the past seven days. Related Reading: Self-Authentication System Of Shiba Inu Has Technical Issues, Developer Reveals Moreover, speculation regarding a potential settlement of the SEC lawsuit has been fueled by an upcoming November 9 deadline for a briefing schedule on remedies for pending issues in the case. While Bitcoin has experienced a significant rebound this year, with a 111% increase following the crypto rout in 2022, it is currently trading at 34,800, consolidating above this key level with sideways price action and a slight surge in the past seven days of 1%. Overall, the crypto market is experiencing a broader rally beyond Bitcoin, with its peers gaining momentum and decentralized finance gaining traction. Positive developments for Ripple have contributed to the surge in XRP, while Bitcoin‚Äôs rebound and growing investor sentiment indicate a potential shift in the overall market dynamics.

19918813,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559636,1699408847,Altcoins Market Share Versus Bitcoin At A 4 Month High: What‚Äôs The Trigger?,"Looking at Kaiko‚Äôs data¬†shared¬†on November 7 by Dessislava Ianeva, a Research Analyst at the blockchain analyst firm, it is evident that altcoins market share versus Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising in the past four months, reaching a 4-month high, the highest level since July 2023. The surge in market share can be attributed to multiple factors but primarily because of the upswing in Bitcoin prices, improving sentiment across the crypto market, and project-related developments that have attracted capital over the past few trading months. Altcoins Market Share Rising Versus Bitcoin Kaiko notes that the altcoins market share of the top 30 altcoins stands at 44%, an improvement over the past few trading months. This is a notable expansion considering that altcoin prices, including those of leading coins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the rest posted sharp losses in 2022. Even though prices continued falling, losses were contained in 2023 but remain lower from 2021 peaks when asset prices surged to record lows. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) 50-Week EMA Flashes Bullish, Is $0.45 On The Way? Despite altcoins gnawing more market share from Bitcoin, the most valuable coin continues to enjoy multiple advantages, especially from a regulatory standpoint. For instance, the coin has been endorsed by regulators in the United States, Europe, and Canada. In this line, complex derivatives products, including Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) and futures, are already listed in Canada, the United States, and some European countries. The spike at the end of July was partly because of the increasing confidence across crypto that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve the first Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This confidence follows BlackRock‚Äôs decision to submit its Bitcoin ETF application. Due to their track record, market analysts elevated the odds of the strict agency to authorize the first spot in Bitcoin ETF. Why Are Altcoins Like Ethereum, XRP, And Solana Rallying? Presently, the upward momentum in Bitcoin has been shrinking but remains at around 2023 high on improving market sentiment. The slowdown in the uptrend coincides with rapidly shifting investor patterns, especially in Solana, XRP, and Ethereum. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Be Headed Towards 20%+ Decline Based On This Pattern To illustrate, the SEC‚Äôs decision to approve the launch of the Ethereum Futures product led to more interest in the project, directly supporting ETH prices. At the same time, Solana has been edging higher, even reversing post-FTX losses despite action by FTX estate managers. There is more on-chain activity on Solana. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity on XRP has seen Ripple double down, striking more partners.

Amid these high-interest levels, market analysts warn that Bitcoin may see a 20% price correction. Analysts Weigh In On Market Implications The surge in open interest has been linked to a substantial increase in derivatives market activity. Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro hinted at the potential market shifts, noting a significant addition to open interest, which could indicate impending ‚Äúfireworks‚Äù in the market. Almost 10k BTC (~$350MM USD) in open interest added today. Fireworks soon. ‚Äî tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) November 7, 2023 With more than $16 billion in open interest recorded currently, according to data from CoinGlass, the market is witnessing noticeable fluctuations that could spell out more significant changes in Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation. Related Reading: Crypto Forecast: Analyst Predicts ‚ÄòSanta Claus Squeeze‚Äô May Deliver Year-End Gains So far, analysts are keenly observing these fluctuations, interpreting them as signals for future market movements. James Van Straten from CryptoSlate pointed out the record open interest in the CME exchange, often ‚Äúpreferred by institutional investors.‚Äù The analyst noted: The CME exchange, preferred by institutional investors, has achieved a new record in open interest, with 105,380 BTC contracts open, valued at $3.68 billion. Binance has edged past this figure with open interest of approximately 113,500 BTC. With Binance‚Äôs open interest slightly surpassing the CME‚Äôs figures, Van Straten suggests that this trend could indicate a growing interest in Bitcoin futures, which may reflect a ‚Äúpositive shift‚Äù in market sentiment or a strategic move by investors to adopt ‚Äúprotective strategies.‚Äù The implications of this rising open interest, however, are not universally seen as positive. J. A. Maartunn from CryptoQuant cautioned that such high open interest levels have historically preceded price drawdowns of at least 20% for Bitcoin. This pattern, he argues, warrants ‚Äúsignificant attention‚Äù as it could indicate an upcoming price correction. Bitcoin Latest Price Action The current trajectory of Bitcoin‚Äôs market performance has been discussed among analysts, particularly in light of the recent surge in open interest. Despite this interest, Bitcoin has experienced a slight pullback from its recent growth spurt. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Tide: Could ASIC Miner Values Signal An Approaching Crypto Surge?

Meanwhile, over the last week, Bitcoin‚Äôs growth has been modest, charting a 1.4% increase, while the bi-weekly figures show a slightly 3.1% rise. This corrective movement in Bitcoin‚Äôs price is mirrored by a notable drop in its daily trading volume, which has fallen sharply from last week‚Äôs high of $21 billion to a current figure of just $3.8 billion within the past day.

When zooming out, recent data shows the massive rally experienced by cryptocurrencies over the past few months and the sector‚Äôs potential for additional gains.

Over the previous week, BTC recorded a 2% profit, while the altcoins market trends much higher, retaining more gains. Bitcoin‚Äôs 110% Year-To-Date Leap Signals A New Era BTC? According to a report from Bitfinex, This year has marked a significant milestone for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have shown remarkable growth, leaving traditional assets like gold behind. Bitcoin has soared by 93% and Ethereum by 3%, indicating a solid performance correlation that has remained consistently tight. BTC, in particular, has enjoyed the spotlight with its first-mover advantage, earning the moniker of ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô and garnering broad institutional support. While these digital assets reach new heights, traditional stock indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ are navigating through a correction phase. This contrast hints at a shifting investment landscape, with cryptocurrencies emerging as a dominant force capable of outperforming established markets, the report suggested. As seen in the chart below, data hints at the Bitcoin price outperforming other assets and Gold ‚Äúplaying catch up‚Äù with a 0.8 correlation with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin‚Äôs price rally of over 110 percent since the start of the year signals a ‚Äútransition‚Äù for holders from unrealized losses to profits. Typically, such surges lead to market consolidation or sharp pullbacks. Yet, the current trend of declining Coin Days Destroyed, a metric used to gauge market activity and sentiment, suggests that long-term investors remain steadfast, the chart below shows. The lack of movement in wallets containing significant Bitcoin sums further points to a bullish outlook or a defensive strategy against economic uncertainties. Amidst this crypto resilience, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest decision to maintain interest rates between 5.25 and 5.50 percent reflects a cautious but non-restrictive economic approach, the report claims. Crypto Stands Firm In Economic Uncertainty Despite the Fed‚Äôs updated, confident view of the U.S. economy, the manufacturing sector experienced a downturn in October, mainly due to strikes in the automotive industry. This suggests a significant impact of labor disputes on the sector. The broader U.S. economy is feeling the effects, with a slowdown in job creation and the slowest wage growth since mid-2021, indicating a shift in labor market conditions. This data supports a continuation of the current bullish trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase?
