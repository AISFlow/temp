42427014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyazh,1471639163,Bitcoin Ponzi Schemer Hints at Dealings With Mt Gox CEO,"Convicted Ponzi scheme operator Trendon Shavers is now insinuating the major unidentified debtor cited in his defense against the SEC may have been Mark Karpeles, CEO of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  The claims, while veiled, stem from a new interview for the popular industry podcast Bitcoin Uncensoredhttps://soundcloud.com/bitcoinuncensored, in which Shavers faced questions about the history of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), an investment operation later deemed a Ponzi scheme in multiple court litigations. Investors lost as much as 700,000 BTC through the scheme, which collapsed in late 2012.  In a court deposition  , Shavers claimed that BTCST's largest debtor, who was unidentified in public records, defaulted on a 202,000 BTC loan, thereby triggering the capital shortfall that accelerated its demise. However, he would go on to admit that ""he has no proof at all of the lending activities he supposedly undertook for BTCST"", including the major borrower.  Where does Karpeles factor into this? During the interview, Shavers references the debtor as someone connected to ""a very, very big exchange"" but stopped short of identifying the figure.  When pressed by co-hosts Chris DeRose and Joshua Unseth, he said the person was a ""very well-known"" exchange operator.  When asked if the debtor ""[has] black hair and a cat"" (a reference to both Karpeles’ physical appearance and his cat Tibanne), Shavers began to laugh, and jokingly asked, ""Does he speak Japanese?""  At that point, Jason Seibert, Shavers’ attorney, taking part in the interview, intervened. He went on to say that ""this is one of the things he can’t talk about"".  Seibert declined to comment for this story when reached.  Claims scrutinized  That Karpeles would seek a massive loan seems plausible given that Mt Gox’s money problems predate its collapse by as many as three years.  A 2015 report  from security firm WizSec posited that Mt Gox’s bitcoin holdings were far below its estimated liabilities for much of the period between 2011 and 2014. Further, The Daily Beast reported in May that the exchange was short by as much as 80,000 bitcoins by the time that Karpeles purchased it in mid-2011.  Yet, observers have sharply questioned Shavers' suggestion that a major loan default was behind the BTCST collapse.  When reached for comment, WizSec said that there’s no evidence that a major loan was issued in the period claimed by Shavers.  ""There are no single transactions anywhere near that size on the blockchain for that time period,” the firm said, adding:  ""Shavers' wallet, as best it can be reconstructed, only shows a steady exponentially growing sequence of receives and sends, peaking in July/August 2012, as would be expected from the frantic end of a ponzi scheme.""  While it's tempting to suggest that the funds could represent the 200,000 BTC discovered after the exchange’s collapse, WizSec was equally dismissive.  ""To be clear, there is absolutely no connection between the 202,000 BTC now held by the Mt Gox trustee and Trendon Shavers,"" the company said.  Doubling down  When pressed on the claims, Shavers is said to have claimed that the loan was issued by way of a coin mixer or tumbler, a process which obscures the transactive origin of bitcoins by mingling them with other funds.  According to WizSec, this could be true if the funds were distributed in small amounts or if they were collected into an account separate from the known BTCST addresses.  But that second hypothetical would only be valid if Shavers actually possessed the 202,000 BTC he claimed to have loaned, which WizSec doubted the veracity of in comments.  ""There's no convincing evidence that Shavers ever even had 202,000 at any single point in time in the first place,"" the firm said.  Complicating matters is that the alleged personal loan was perhaps unrelated to any funds held on the exchange at the time of its demise.  An analysis of known claimants in the ongoing Mt Gox lawsuit reveals that Shavers is not listed as ever having registered a claim to any lost funds. A list of known claimants spans 1,422 Excel pages.  Listen to the full Bitcoin Uncensored podcast here. Listener discretion advised.  This story was co-written by Pete Rizzo.

42427004,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyahh,1471629333,Japanese Banks Plan Blockchain Currency Exchange,"A group of Japanese financial institutions is looking to create a blockchain-based platform they could leverage to cut costs on domestic and foreign exchange services.  Announced today  , initial members include the Bank of Yokohama and SBI Sumishin Net Bank. Those involved in the effort will work with distributed ledger tech startup Ripple to develop the platform.  SBI Holdings, which owns SBI Sumishin Net Bank and has invested in startups working with the technology in the past, said in a statement that as many as 15 banks are expected to take part in the initiative when it formally launches in October.  The company said:  ""While the Bank of Yokohama and SBI Sumishin Net Bank have been implementing various FinTech initiatives at an accelerated pace, the consortium will begin to consider new types of payment and settlement services that utilize blockchain technology, starting from October 2016.""  By the time the platform is ready for launch in March 2017, organizers hope to have as many as 30 banks using the new technology.  SBI Holdings, along with a subsidiary launched in partnership with Ripple, will spearhead the project, according to statements.  While it's unclear at this time if other Japanese banks will join the group, the country's finance industry has shown strong interest in the technology.  Rumors  of a bank-issued digital currency have dogged Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) for months, and the bank, one of Japan's largest, announced in April that it is working with blockchain startup Chain on a proof-of-concept.  Further, Japan has seen the emergence of working groups in the past year dedicated to use cases focused on finance.

42427012,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyavh,1471624083,Ethereum Classic is Starting to Mobilize,"Ethereum's original blockchain just won't die.  The result of a hard fork of the ethereum network in July, the blockchain has not only survived, but it's evolving into a competing version of the decentralized application platform. Now, supporters of the platform are beginning to mobilize.  As part of this drive, supporters of ethereum classic held their first formal meetup in London this week in what some supporters see as a launching pad for the newly created community.  Overall, the meetup sought to provide an overview of the project's goals, and the financial and legal implications of the network hard fork. Speakers included Simon Taylor, blockchain research director at 11:FS; and Nishant Bhaskar, an executive at Lloyds Banking Group.  The meetup began with comments from lead organizer Arvicco, who noted how its supporters don't want to support a system that was involved in what they view as a ""long train of abuses"".  He said in a statement:  ""Only those communities that clearly define their values and stick to them, come hell or high water, will be successful in the world of free and voluntary cooperation without coercion.""  A slideshow presentation from the event shows the team was also keen to draw a roadmap for how the project intends to progress.  This will include porting ethereum clients to ethereum classic, supporting the launch of new network tools and exploring how its developers could create a consensus structure that would set it apart from ethereum's planned proof-of-stake system.  Perhaps most notable was a cameo from bitcoin investor and ethereum miner Chandler Guo. Best known for threatening ethereum classic with his mining capacity just a month ago, he said in an announcement he is now ready to go 100% ETC.  ""I made a mistake before,"" Guo said about his initial decision to support the decision to hard fork ethereum. He later called for Chinese ethereum supporters to support ethereum classic.  ""This is not a joke. This is a revolution. This is freedom. God bless ethereum classic,"" Guo said.  Organizers said upcoming ethereum classic meetups will be held in Zurich, Shanghai, Melbourne and Toronto.  View the full slideshow from the event here.  Alyssa Hertig contributed reporting.

42427017,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyb7h,1471619725,California Lawmaker: Bitcoin Thefts Show Industry Regulation Needed,"The state assemblyman behind efforts to regulate digital currency businesses in California cited the $65m hack of Bitfinex this week as evidence of the need for tighter industry controls.  In a statement issued following his state's decision to temporarily shelve further regulatory deliberations this year, he said that more time was needed to strike a balance between giving virtual currency businesses a firm foundation and ensuring consumers are protected.  Assemblyman Matt Dababneh said in the statement:  ""Today, a user of virtual currency has no protection from loss, and businesses that use, transmit or store virtual currency live in an ecosystem of regulatory uncertainty. Potential harm to consumers is not some remote possibility, but has already happened.""  Dababneh first proposed the bill last year shortly after becoming chairman of the state’s Banking and Finance Committee, and a revised version was once again introduced this year amid resistance from industry advocates.  In remarks, Dababneh credited conversations with ""virtual currency experts, consumer organizations"" as a deciding factor in the determination to suspend the proposed legislation until January of next year.  California’s regulatory effort follows New York's implementation of the so-called BitLicense, its controversial industry-specific licensing regime. That law, introduced in 2015, has been blamed for the departure of some digital currency startups from the state.  Overall, Dababneh sought to position the delayed bill as part of his state’s efforts to take a leadership position in the industry.  He concluded:  ""Unfortunately, the current bill in print does not meet the objectives to create a lasting regulatory framework that protects consumers and allows this industry to thrive in our state.""

42427013,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyaxh,1471614365,Bank of England Seeks Digital Currency Research Lead,"The Bank of England is on the hunt for an economist to spearhead its research into a central bank-issued digital currency.  According to the job listing, the research lead would play a driving role in its bid to issue a digitized, blockchain-based version of the UK pound – an idea the Bank of England has been exploring since as early as last year.  Tthe central bank is looking for someone to lead the effort and examine whether ""universal access"" to this kind of electronic money would be ""desirable"" for users.  The listing explains:  ""The job holder will be responsible for owning the research agenda, conducting their own research and galvanizing research on these questions by experts inside the Bank and in academia. The job holder will also be responsible for drawing conclusions from the research on the impact of a CBDC on monetary and financial stability and making policy recommendations to Governors.""  But there are also signs that search is taking longer than perhaps expected. As Bloomberg notes, the UK central bank previously listed this position over the summer, suggesting either a dearth of quality candidates or a high standard for research hires.  However, the Bank of England may have time on its side.

42399269,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijQy,1471608326,"No, the EBA's Bitcoin Regulation Proposals Aren't All Bad","Jacek Czarnecki is an attorney at Warsaw-based law firm Wardynski & Partners, where he specializes in areas including FinTech, digital currencies and blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Czarnecki discusses recent proposals for EU digital currency regulation, arguing suggestions made by the European Banking Authority are more positive than they initially appeared.  The European Commission's proposal to regulate digital currency exchanges and custodial wallets has a bit of a bad rep.  Announced in July  , the executive branch of the European Union is advising that wallet providers be brought under the scope of its anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorist financing (CTF) regulations, and doing so has raised many controversies.  Perhaps most notable have been the European Commission's proposed definition of ""virtual currencies"" and its alleged proposal to build a database of users. Both have stoked concerns in the industry.  New topics can be expected to emerge in the course of legislative process, but the most recent voice to complicate the discussion is the European Banking Authority (EBA). The regulatory agency recently published its opinion on the proposal, and some its suggestions haven't been greeted favorably.  In the past, the EBA has issued a warning to consumers on risks related to digital currencies and a formal opinion on how it believes regulation should be approached.  It's perhaps the latter document that bears revisiting, as it was here that the EBA proposed bringing select digital currency businesses under the AML and CTF rules, an idea now embraced by the Commission.  EBA knows the matter  What is worth noting is that, despite the criticisms for the organization, the EBA has its finger on the pulse.  What’s more, its comments reveal an understanding of the issues related to digital currency. This is evidenced in EBA’s finding that the use of the word ""currency"" suggests an analogy with existing fiat currencies, which might not be always the case.  It thus seems that EBA is aware that some tokens developed on blockchains do not necessarily have monetary nature. As I argued in a previous piece, this is one of the problems with the definition of ""virtual currency"" proposed by the European Commission.  I am not going to argue that all EBA proposals are all praiseworthy.  However, in my opinion they can make the European Commission's proposal a better regulation – for EU member states, affected firms and the whole EU digital currency and blockchain industry.  Longer transposition period  First of all, the EBA advocated more time for member states to implement, and authorities and market players to apply, new regulations.  According to the European Commission’s proposal, new regulations should be implemented by the EU member states by 1st January 2017.  Less than four months is simply not enough to finish the legislative procedures at both the EU and state level, and comply by the firms with the new regulations. This proposal should be much welcomed.  On regulatory frameworks for digital currencies, the EBA also wants digital currency to remain outside the PSD2 (EU's new payment services regulation), an idea that is absolutely worth supporting.  PSD2 would not be appropriate to govern digital assets based on public blockchains other than those of purely monetary applications.  As I mentioned, the EBA has suggested that it is aware of the emergence of other digital assets based on blockchain technology, and that this makes application of payment services laws inappropriate.  Proposal clarification  In fact, much of the EBA's opinion is devoted to pointing out unclear parts of the European Commission' proposal.  For example, the EBA wants the status of digital currency businesses to be clarified, and it is proposing to define in the AMLD the subjective scope of the proposed new regulations (that is, not only what is regulated, but also who). This is good for the industry, because it could bring further clarification as to who is regulated.  Did EBA propose state-by- state registration? Contrary to what has been already written, the EBA is not advocating for this approach.  It is the European Commission who proposed to require member states to ensure that exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers are licensed or registered in the proposed new wording of Article 47(1).  On the contrary, it is EBA that has noted that this might be a problem.  The EBA made it perfectly clear that it is aware that there are no passporting rights under the AMLD, and that such requirement might result in a state-by-state registration regime.  The EBA also suggested that a new sectoral financial directive devoted only to digital currency issues (that might include a passporting regime) would not necessarily be a good idea.  Therefore, it is not clear what regime the Commission does envision in its ""licensing or registration"" proposal.  The EBA's statement reads:  ""Take a decision whether either a licensing or a registration regime is most suitable and conducive to the aim of deterring terrorist financing across the EU or, should this not be achievable, at least provide clarity about the features that a national registration or authorization regime should have.""  The EBA is thus not advocating registration or licensing in each member state, but simply wants the Commission to clarify its vague proposal to impose mandatory registration or licensing.  In conclusion, the EBA proposal should not be criticized in advance, as it is in many respects better that the Commission’s proposal.  The legislative process in the EU is underway and each sensible voice, including those of EU institutions like EBA, is needed.
