42425230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvUPh,1387656608,Chinese Bitcoin Exchange OKCoin Accused of Faking Trading Data,"OKCoin, once the second largest mainland China-based bitcoin exchange (after BTC China) according to volume, has been accused of faking its trading volume data.  The website stopped taking new deposits in the aftermath of the Chinese central bank implementing a ban disallowing banks and third-party payment services from working with bitcoin exchanges, leaving traders temporarily unable to charge their fiat currency accounts or cash out on some exchanges.  In the days following rumours of the ban, while traders panic-sold their bitcoin holdings and would-be buyers were barred from making deposits into their accounts, many were surprised to find that the trading volume on OKCoin remained unrealistically high.  The exchange rates, despite plunging, maintained levels on a par with other exchanges such as Huobi.com, which circumvented the ban by allowing traders to charge their accounts by transferring money to its CEO’s personal bank account.  The concern was first raised by someone under the pseudonym Shi Diaomao, a self-proclaimed bitcoin arbitrageur who makes profit by buying and selling BTC on different platforms to exploit the exchange rate gap.  [post-quote]  In his article posted on 20th December on Xueqiu, one of China’s most popular investors' social media platforms, Shi claims that in a two-hour period on 19th December, OKCoin’s data indicates that over 30,000 BTC changed hands.  However, by comparing the number with the tally of selling and buying orders that were displayed separately, Shi concluded that the real transaction volume could be as low as one tenth of what the company purported to exchange.  Shi said after noticing the discrepancy, he immediately contacted the website’s customer service rep, who failed to provide a plausible explanation and later became unresponsive on Xueqiu.  During the process of communication, Shi saw that the displayed volume suddenly plunged, which reinforced his suspicion that the website had previously faked its trading volume and was correcting it now that it was in danger of being caught red-handed.  In an online audio interview, Shi said that he would not call OKCoin out and accuse it of manipulating the exchange rate, but he cautioned traders against the exchange, claiming that it “plays both the player as well as the referee”.  In response, Star Xu (Xu Mingxing), CEO of OKCoin who is also believed to be one of the largest bitcoin holders in China, issued a very brief explanation, in which he attributed the discrepancy to the company allowing large traders to trade through its API rather than the webpage interface – an explanation, if true, that may be somewhat hypocritical given that only a couple days ago Xu wrote a statement criticizing the use of “high-frequency trading software”.  Many perceive Xu’s explanation as a cover-up, among them, some Chinese bitcoin celebrities such as Li Xiaolai and Zhao Letian who posted on Sina Weibo agreeing that OKCoin’s data was problematic.  Zhao Letian’s posting states:  “The two graphs show the market depth of BTC China and OKCoin. Despite the great difference of market depths, their trading volumes are very close, which can only mean that one is cheating. The reason that I stopped going to OKCoin is that it is very hard for me to buy more than 1000 BTC [at one time].”  Users also question OKCoin’s claim that it is the world’s largest litecoin exchange.  One posting published on 19th December on Sina Weibo says:  “The daily transaction of litecoin [on OKCoin] yesterday has reached an unprecedented nine million, but there are only a total of 20 million in existence. How can I ever believe it?”  Xu Mingxing was previously scheduled to host a Q&A session on Xueqiu on 20th December, but it has since been cancelled.  As of 2:52 PM CST, 21st December, the daily trading volume displayed on OKCoin is 4,215.52 BTC, which has shrunk dramatically from its previous level of tens of thousands per day.

42425216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvU3h,1387647428,Bitcoin Exchange Startup Bex.io Recieves $525k in Funding,"Bitcoin exchanges are the gateway between fiat and digital currency. Vancouver-based Bex.io has received venture funding in order to advance its own ideals on how to build them.  The company, which has built a bitcoin exchange platform, has received $525,000 in venture capital to fund its operations. The round was funded by CrossPacific Capital Partners, with participation from Brian Cartmell and HootSuite Founder Ryan Holmes. Plug and Play and Boast Capital also contributed financing recently.  Founder Yurii Rashkovskii told an audience in London in July that Bex.io plans to “help bitcoin business entrepreneurs manage the technical side of the operation so they don’t need to worry about it”.  Focusing on bitcoin regulatory issues may ultimately be a better use of an exchange’s time than building an entire system from scratch. Governments in various jurisdictions have differing opinions on what bitcoin might means within a particular regulatory framework.  For example, in the United States the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an anti-money laundering unit of the US Department of Treasury, recently sent out “industry outreach” letters regarding anti-money laundering practices. The purpose of this was to encourage bitcoin businesses to register with FinCEN and uphold basic money transmitter responsibilities such as record keeping.  Bex.io’s business plan is similar to that of Robocoin, a bitcoin ATM manufacturer. That company is working with partners in local jurisdictions who can navigate specific regulatory issues that might crop up.  One of Bex.io's founders, Jesse Heaslip, previously told CoinDesk that security and performance would be key metrics that the company would focus on. The Bex.io platform is built for the datasets that a burgeoning exchange could encounter. Prevention of distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) via third-party penetration testing is an important part of keeping the company's platform secure.  The Plug and Play technology incubator in particular has plans for a total of ten investments in bitcoin-related startups over the course of 2014. Eleven bitcoin startups pitched for funding at Plug and Play’s Sunnyvale, California facility in early December.  Marc van der Chijs of Cross Pacific Capital Partners, and co-founder of online video sharing site Tudou.com, has been appointed to company’s Board of Directors.  Bex.io is currently in a limited beta, and invites can be requested from the company’s website.

42425213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvTvh,1387586970,Overstock.com CEO Unveils More Details About Bitcoin Adoption,"Overstock.com  revealed more details of its forthcoming bitcoin adoption on Friday as Patrick Byrne, CEO of the online retail giant, told CoinDesk about the company’s timeline to roll out the digital currency.  The company has not yet chosen a third-party payment processor to manage its bitcoin payments, Byrne said, but added that this will happen in the next two weeks. Nothing will happen immediately after that, he added. Instead, the company will begin taking bitcoin payments in June or July.  “We’ll probably be working with the third parties. There are a few different ones that are interested in our business. It makes sense to work with them rather than developing it from scratch,” Byrne said.  Byrne cited cost as a key driver for the bitcoin move. “You’re getting rid of the interchange fees. We’re paying credit card companies around 2%. For a company whose margin is 1%, picking up 2% on that is quite attractive.”  But his reasons are also ideological. Byrne, a renowned libertarian, re-emphasized his “pro-freedom” stance, taking a poke at the US dollar in the process.  A pro-freedom stance  “In an ideal world we’d go back to gold so you’d have a monetary system based on something that government mandarins can’t expand at the stroke of a pen,” he said. “We’re not going to go back to gold, but bitcoin shares that virtue. It is mathematically if not physically constrained.”  While governments can’t expand bitcoin’s quantity with the stroke of a pen, they can apparently do a lot to squeeze its value. The digital currency has been highly volatile of late, jumping from under $100 in value in August to as high as $1147 on the Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) earlier this month. Following statements from the Chinese government last week, it lost more than half its value from that peak.  Byrne waved away this news. “Political influence like that has a lot of effect on it now. It will have less of an effect as adoption gets broader, and it will be less prone to the whims of government bureaucrats,” he said.  However, as a publicly listed company, Overstock.com is mandated to protect the interests of its shareholders and manage risk.  Byrne didn't have a set goal for the proportion of revenues that he expected to come from bitcoins. As a rough estimate, he suggested that 1% would be reasonable. Based on that figure, bitcoin sales would have accounted for roughly $30,000 per day on average in 2012. Byrne confirmed that the firm would either hedge its position in bitcoin, or simply close it out into US dollars at the end of each day.  Overstock.com will be among the first of the larger retailers in the US to take the plunge and accept bitcoin. This foregrounds it in a traditionally conservative industry, said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of digital payments company Circle Internet Financial.  “In general, medium to large retailers, including online, are relatively conservative about new payment methods,” Allaire said. “For example, it was only just ten years ago that McDonalds starting accepting credit card payments.”  Challenges to consider  One of the biggest challenges facing publicly listed companies like Overstock.com that want to accept bitcoin could be accounting for its value if it doesn't settle in fiat at the end of each day, continued the former co-founder of Allaire Corporation.  The Internal Revenue Service has not issued any significant guidance on the tax treatment for decentralized digital currencies, he pointed out. “This will hold back a lot of companies from accepting bitcoin as a payment. This is particularly the case if a retailer or e-commerce company actually receives and holds the bitcoin, versus just leveraging a payment processor who contracts with the retailer to pay them in local currency.”  In November's US Senate hearings FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said that she had been in dialogue with the IRS and anticipated guidance on virtual currencies from the agency.
