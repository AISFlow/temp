42425131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrLh,1385159418,China Central Bank Official: People Should be Free to Use Bitcoin Exchanges,"Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, this week mentioned bitcoin in comments that have sparked optimism in the country’s bitcoin business community.  Speaking in Chinese at an economic forum, Mr Yi made statements to the effect that it would be impossible for China’s central bank to recognize bitcoin as a legal, legitimate financial instrument “in the near future”. But perhaps more significantly, he added that people should be free to buy and sell bitcoins on exchanges with no interference from the central bank, and that he would personally look at the digital currency with a long-term perspective.  While the New York Times’ Sinosphere blog reported Mr Yi’s comments as a ""cautious nod"" to digital currency, sources in China itself were more excited by what they saw as a sign the Chinese government would not make any move to restrict bitcoin commerce. The reference to a long-term view also raised hope there would be some kind of more official endorsement at a later point.  “The fact he made any comment at all is significant,” said Bobby Lee, CEO and co-founder of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, BTC China. He added:  “It means, in the near term anyway, China’s central bank won’t give bitcoin any official legal status. But the key point here is ‘near-term’. Given his position, of course his statements need to be conservative. Anything else would be too much of an official statement.”  Lee saw particular significance in Mr Yi’s reference to people being allowed to buy and sell bitcoins on exchanges.  ""He's the most knowledgable person in the Chinese government making comments about bitcoin today. To me, that's a strong endorsement for the future potential of bitcoin in China. I am optimistic about bitcoin's role in the future,” he said.  BTC China this week continued its record of having the world’s highest bitcoin value. As bitcoin peaked at around $900 on Mt. Gox in ordinary trading on 19th November, it passed CNY 7,000, or $1,100, on BTC China. At the time of writing, it sits around CNY 4,969 (around $815).  Curiously, Mr Yi’s comments did not cause any dramatic increase in bitcoin value in China. This could be attributed to a persistent lack of knowledge about bitcoin in the Chinese general public, or the comments were taken as ambiguous by those not watching digital currencies closely.  As other governments hold cautious inquiries and continue to speak of digital currencies in terms of ‘threat’ and ‘risk’ before considering benefits, even indirectly positive comments from other parts of the world show that digital currency is a global phenomenon. Most officials in the world’s advanced economies have remained silent on the sidelines, while private banks have even unilaterally shut down accounts belonging to businesses and individuals with bitcoin connections.  [post-quote]  Shortly before the start of US Senate hearings into digital currencies last week, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also provoked hope with a letter stating the Federal Reserve “does not necessarily have authority to directly supervise or regulate these innovations or the entities that provide them to the market”.  He also said digital currencies “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system”.  As a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, Mr Yi Gang sits in the upper echelons of China’s financial administration. He reports directly to the governor and his comments have considerable gravity for regulators.  There is also little doubt Mr Yi has followed bitcoin’s progress both in China and abroad, and is aware of China’s recent dominance in trading activity and value.  It’s of interest to note he obtained his Ph.D in economics from the University of Illinois, and was an associate professor with tenure at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) before returning to his native China. He has published numerous academic papers in English and is likely China’s highest-ranking scholar on foreign currencies and exchange.  Over the past year, China has become both a hub for bitcoin startup activity and also mining, given the large concentration of semiconductor manufacturers in Guangdong Province. Another sign of official endorsement of digital currencies came with CCTV2’s documentary on bitcoin earlier this year.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/22/china-central-bank-official-people-should-be-free-to-use-bitcoin-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a61fff733013ffa3676390612d4339dd025de36-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrNh,1385146742,Does Canada View Bitcoin as Currency?,"My name is Matt Burgoyne and I'm an associate at Canadian legal firm McLeod Law. I'm involved with Canadian and international counsel in the developing area of virtual currency law, specifically including bitcoin currency.  Does Canada consider bitcoin to be a real sovereign ""currency"" or simply a commodity? This question is particularly relevant given various bitcoin related news stories that have involved Canadian companies in recent weeks.  First, as most have no doubt heard, there is at least one bitcoin ATM operating in a Vancouver coffee shop, and according to a Vancouver Sun article dated 9th November, $100,000 of Canadian currency was traded through the machine in a single week.  Bitcoiniacs, the operators of the ATM, have publicly stated that several other Canadian cities can expect to host to similar types of bitcoin ATMs in the coming months.  [post-quote]  Alix Resources Corp a Canadian mining company, also confirmed that it will be paying the accounts of at least one of its contractors, Ridge Resources Ltd, in bitcoin.  I would imagine the question of whether the Canadian government considers bitcoin to be a currency or commodity has at least touched the corporate minds of Bitcoiniacs, Alix Resources and Ridge Resources and the minds of their legal and tax advisors.  The Canadian government has finally come out with some official guidance on bitcoin.  According to a fact sheet published in early November 2013 by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Canada’s equivalent to the IRS in the United States and the HMRC in the UK , bitcoin is referred to as “virtual money” and an example of “digital currency”.  However, in the same paper the CRA distinguished bitcoin from “traditional currency” and so we can infer that at least one branch of the Canadian government does not view bitcoin as currency in the traditional sense but instead views it as a barter good and should be taxed as such.  A competitor  In a piece entitled Working Paper 2013-38 - Some Economics of Private Digital Currency published in mid-November, which does not appear to be targeted at a general audience, given the reference to numerous complex math derivative-type equations which don’t even relate to bitcoin, the Bank of Canada proclaimed that bitcoin is a “fully convertible, pure digital currency [that] is explicitly designed to compete with state currencies”.  I would disagree with the latter statement that bitcoin is designed to compete with state currencies; while bitcoin is disruptive, I would not categorize it as deliberately competitive.  Rather, I see statements such as these to be further evidence that certain governments view bitcoin as a form of barter good as opposed to legitimate form of currency.  Is this a good thing? In my view it may not demonstrate to the world that Canada is being as progressive towards bitcoin as some other countries have been.  In the writer’s respectful opinion, the Canadian publications referenced above unfortunately do not give Canadian companies, or the general public for that matter, any guidance on Canada’s position on bitcoin, legal or otherwise (except for the friendly reminder from the CRA that our bitcoins will be taxed).  It would be beneficial for Canadian businesses and the general public to get some kind of readable, clear and ‘user friendly’ direction from the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), Canada’s bitcoin ‘police force’ as to their official position on bitcoin.  I assume that FINTRAC is monitoring the situation surrounding bitcoin closely and the lack, as of the date of this publication, of the production of a broad based public statement could mean two things:  (1) that FINTRAC is “taking in” all of the recent developments in bitcoin and are thoughtfully considering both the good and the bad; and  (2) that FINTAC will ultimately come out with a reasoned, well thought out approach (similar to the position Germany has taken, for example) rather than a issue a 'knee jerk' response.

42425136,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrTh,1385145042,Bitcoin Used to Support Human Rights in Sri Lanka,"A human rights organisation that works in Sri Lanka is now accepting bitcoin donations to protect the identities of supporters.  The Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice, a London-based NGO that campaigns for “justice, human rights and reconciliation” in Sri Lanka, began taking bitcoin donations this week.  So far, the NGO has received just over 1 BTC in donations.  “There is a very real fear within Sri Lanka of retaliation by government forces if you are seen as working closely with international human rights organisations,” said Fred Carver, the organisation’s campaigns director.  Bitcoin allows would-be supporters to donate to the campaign anonymously and without fear of retribution, as long as they don’t leave any links between their bitcoin and real-life identities. Carver said:  “We use PayPal for most of our donations and we have had people on several occasions refuse to donate, or sent us cash instead, because they were concerned that, were they to be known to be a donor to the campaign, it could cause trouble for family in Sri Lanka.""  Following the end of the 30-year Sri Lankan civil war in 2009, the government has come under significant criticism for human rights abuses against the rebel Tamil Tigers.  Estimates for the number of civilians killed in the final phase of the war, when the government had the Tamils cornered on a narrow strip of coast in the north-east of the country, are as high as 40,000.  A number of Channel 4 investigations  have laid bare the actions of the government in winning the war and last week UK Prime Minister David Cameron was criticised for attending the Commonwealth Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital.  The Sri Lankan government has been accused by some of crimes against humanity. Carver said:  “I had been looking for something like bitcoin since an incident about three years ago when a potential partnership in Sri Lanka fell apart because there was no way in which money could be transferred between us without the state-owned Sri Lankan central bank throwing up all kinds of obstacles.""  In 2012, bitcoin came on to his radar and although it wouldn’t have bypassed the auditing issues they previously faced, “it did occur to me that bitcoin could solve other problems, particularly those faced by individual givers”.  He admits that he does not expect there to be a massive demand to donate via bitcoin, but says they are offering donors a more anonymous way of contributing funds “out of principle”.  “The point is that now a technologically savvy donor from Sri Lanka could donate to us without fear, if they so chose,” says Carver.  The NGO is yet to develop a strategy for converting the bitcoins into fiat currency, but is likely to convert them into pounds.  “We will cross that bridge when we come to it,” says Carver.

42425146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrlh,1385142640,Bitcoin: here to stay but not immune from terrible ideas,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 22nd November 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Bitcoin’s hearing aid  If you want to pick a date when bitcoin came to stay, you could do a lot worse than 18th November, 2013. Coming just ahead of the US Senate congressional hearing into bitcoin regulation, the head of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said in a letter that – with the usual reservations and cautions – it had legitimate uses.  In fact, the whole hearing is a landmark. While there were plenty of negative vibes, they were distributed equally – yes, bitcoin is a wayward puppy that’s proving hard to discipline, but with the rest of the world much more willing to adopt the mutt than is the US banking system, the fear of shutting it out was stronger than caution about what it might do on the carpet. In other words: it’s going to grow up into something worthwhile, so what can America do for the best?  There was also an undertone of urgency. An old joke is that Internet years are like dog years – enough happens in one year on the Internet for seven years in the real world. The bitcoin puppy’s year seems equivalent to seven Internet years: last week, John Law was fretting about excessive upside volatility provoking increased cyber-attacks; this week saw double helpings of both. That sense of something out of control permeated the hearings, with questions being filtered in via reddit and speakers complaining about the general incoherent chaos of the discussion.  But nobody said no. Nobody said ""resist this evil with all our might"". Perhaps it’s the ever-increasing banging on the door from investors and inventors wanting to get on with the job, perhaps it’s the Chinese scooping the stuff up as fast as they can.  Perhaps it’s the rising tide of realisation that, even if bitcoin itself crashes and burns, the basic technology is being taken seriously by everyone who’s smart enough to understand it and new uses for it are being proposed daily.  Whether this sense of reluctant acceptance was behind the latest growth spurt - followed by a mini-crash, followed by more growth - is impossible to tell. The market is so illiquid that a few big players can drive it where they like, and the sentiment of the broad masses matters not a jot, not at the moment.  What happens next? Bitcoin will be regulated, certainly, but probably in a way that’s flavoured by the realisation that shutting down its special nature, even if possible, would not do anyone any favours. A balance will be struck in the hope that bankers stop being so darn miserable. They say that they dislike the irresponsibility of the stuff, but really sense that it’s got the potential to disrupt their world without providing adequate compensation.    Well, that’s too bad. The rest of the world has had to go through all that with the Internet, and the banks can’t live in a pre-Internet world of fat margins from locked-down, tightly controlled channels forever. Sooner or later, one of their number will break and decide it wants to be the First National Bank of Bitcoin - or, if they’re smart, something even better - and then you won’t be able to breathe for the dust they raise.      Based on this week’s hearings, the US Government won’t provide them with excuses for too long.    Chinese take-away    One new use for bitcoin technology is hinted at in an intriguing blog in the Financial Times. It’s heavy on economic jargon, but don’t let that put you off.      The gist is that people aren’t investing in China even though the opportunity’s there, because of conflict of interest - the government isn’t playing fair, and that soaks up a lot of confidence people have that they’ll see returns if they put their money into the country.      How can you tell? Well, the Chinese themselves are buying a lot of bitcoin, even though they’re paying more for it than the rest of us. In other words, the bitcoin mechanism is providing a unique channel into the true value of the Chinese currency, which is being kept artificially high by the government: Chinese investors don’t trust it, and so will move their money out. Bitcoin bypasses the regulated markets, and gets the love.      The FT goes on to discuss what this says about general attitudes to controlling agencies and their tendencies to not play fair - but at this point, you really should go and read it yourself.      John Law is even more fascinated by the way bitcoin is infiltrating the mainstream thinking into global money than he is by the technology. Capitalism itself is very prone to people not playing fair once they get into a position of well-funded power, which - if you’re being particularly apocalyptic - can provoke the sort of adjustment that involves people throwing bricks through windows or missiles at cities.      The idea of bitcoin-like systems having the potential to replace the sort of controlling authority that can be captured by special interests is gaining traction, and not necessarily with the extreme kill-the-government libertarian flavour that has left a bad taste in the mouths of those who think somebody’s still got to build the hospitals.      Politics is the art of compromise, after all, and if the unstoppable channel of bitcoin-like systems gets rid of some of the blocks that have scuppered compromise between the rich and powerful and the increasingly disgruntled rest of us, it may be healthier for all.    The five worst uses of bitcoin - in just seven days    Ready? Let’s go.    5. Be an extra-strength violent bigot - by bitcoin!    Yes, you can buy bullets with bitcoin now, from an outfit known as JiHawg. John Law will not grace it with a link, because it is a rancid exercise in xenophobia: these bullets, you see, are impregnated with pork, in order to be especially abhorrent to the sort of people that the principals behind this noxious idea wish great harm.      John Law doubts that this is more than a bad joke perpetrated by wingnuts: after all, shooting people is in general more than enough of an insult. He will just point out that such ideas never end well, and move on swiftly.    4. Buy a chunk of a free-for-all paradise - with bitcoin!    Oh, the siren call of investing in paradise. Shunt your bitcoin stash over to Galt’s Gulch in Chile and be a part of a libertarian community untrammelled by tiresome laws.      What can go wrong? For a start, it’s in Chile - which is a wonderful place and all, but happens to be a sovereign nation replete with laws and regulations and no more likely to let a bunch of incomers do what they like than anywhere else.      Also, it’s named after the hero of Atlas Shrugged, a fantasy novel with about as much connection to reality as Lord of the Rings, but infinitely nastier. John Law will just point out that such ideas never end well, and move on swiftly.    3. Hijack your customers’ computers - for bitcoin!    This was never going to end well either. It seemed like such a good idea at the time - push out a revision of your gaming software to your clients that injects a secret bitcoin mining algorithm, and sit back while the results flood in.      This is based on the assumption that people who are nerdy enough to create expensive gaming computers and use obscure software won’t notice that the machines sit there soaking up power at full tilt when nothing is supposed to be going on.      Come on, lads, these geeks spend their lives tinkering with their hotrods. The inevitable court case came to an end this week, with E-Sports Entertainment copping a $1m headline fine.    2. Kill someone famous - through bitcoin!  Oh, lordy, the fantasists are thick on the ground this week. Assassination Market claims to be offering death-as-a-service (DAAS) over the cloud: chip in enough bitcoin donations, and members of an illustrious list will be offed for the good of us all.  Among the almost-infinite number of reasons why this is a worse use for your digital dosh than funding a mission to Uranus to hunt yetis is the small fact that it would cost a lot more than the price of a Mercedes to off Obama. At least Silk Road actually got people stoned.  1. Have your poo checked by randoms - using bitcoin!  So, so aptly number one, CoinMD is a new service for the health-conscious. What can you do with it? For example, upload a picture of your poo to the Internet, get medical advice on its appearance from anonymous strangers, and if you think it’s worth it, don’t spend a penny - send them some bitcoin.  Wired Magazine warns wisely  against taking medical advice from strangers - let alone paying them to discuss your droppings - but John Law thinks its true crime is a lack of imagination. The name alone: why not call it Stool Pigeon? Turd Opinion? Captain’s Log? Research in Motions?  Or, if you will, shitcoin. And that’s quite enough of that.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/22/bitcoin-here-to-stay-but-not-immune-from-terrible-ideas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c7026db5e663fabcac9aa8566eb2e7bce3166b7-1152x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425139,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrbh,1385139554,Bitstamp Shows Higher Bitcoin Price Than Mt. Gox,"The price of bitcoin on Bitstamp has increased to above the level listed on Mt. Gox.  Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox is notorious for showing a much higher USD bitcoin price than its competitors, but this has changed over the past 12 hours.  At around 05:30 GMT today, Bitstamp recorded a price of $717.98, compared with $714 on Mt. Gox.  Mt. Gox then overtook for the next nine hours, but the Bitstamp price has been almost consistently higher since around 14:15 GMT.  Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič described this occurrence as ""weird"" and suggested it could be to do with the problems his company's site has experienced over recent days.  ""I guess [it's] because of the banking issues, which caused a backlog of deposits to pile, and they were [then] all processed at once,"" he said.  Earlier in the week, Bitstamp experienced problems with the banking software it uses. Kodrič said the issue related to the company’s transaction log.  ""We were missing bank transaction log from Friday. Also sending transfers out was disrupted, but it now works,"" he explained.  The site was then down for a large part of Tuesday (19th November), due to what Kodrič believed was a DDoS attack. It has since transpired that it was not a DDoS attack, but a ""network issue"".  The company has upgraded its server capabilities and ordered additional servers to triple the power of the network, which will be delivered on Monday.  ""We have been DDoS-ed today and yesterday. But it did not interrupt our service,"" Kodrič told CoinDesk today.  The rise of Bitstamp  Bitstamp has a largely reliable and trusted profile, with founder Kodrič being a publicly available, widely known and vocal member of the bitcoin community.  As well as being a member of the Bitcoin Foundation, he is also a founding member of the recently formed Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA), the self-regulating organisation formed by Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck and others.  Bitstamp was created in 2011 by Kodric and Damijan Merlak, trading initially in Slovenia before starting to operate in the UK in April 2013. Kodric said economic and political tensions made Slovenia a difficult place to be an entrepreneur.  The company still banks in Slovenia with Italian-owned bank Unicredit, which Kodric says is largely unaffected by Slovenian politics and is a reliable banking partner that they’ve had no problems with thus far.  [post-quote]  After finishing Economics School, Kodrič continued his studies at The Faculty of Organizational Science in Kranj where he studied Organization and Management of Information Systems.  At the age of 19, he dropped out to start his first company, doing IT consultancy and reselling computer hardware. Three years later he discovered bitcoin mining through Damjian Merlak.  The two looked at the possibilities and thought about mining, but since neither of them had a solid technical background in hardware, they both decided that it would be too risky a field to enter, as the pace of technology was moving so fast that they figured they wouldn’t be able to keep up.  Kodrič said he thought about starting a mining pool, before hitting on the idea of building a ""second exchange"".  ""The only real exchange back then was Mt. Gox, which was not ideal for Europeans since most of us wanted to send money via SEPA but trade in USD because it had better liquidity. We wanted something to appeal to a European audience,"" he said.  Bitstamp is focused on the European market, and even though the company itself trades in USD to concentrate liquidity, SEPA transfers cost as little as €0.90, making it an attractive way to get money into the exchange from a European bank account.  In addition, transfers can often take as little as 12 hours to go from the bank to the exchange, making it a relatively quick, convenient and cheap way to buy bitcoins in bulk.  Security measures  When queried about how Bitstamp is positioned for security in the wild-west of bitcoin exchanges and online wallets, especially in light of the recent spate of thefts, Kodric says he believes insurance companies will see lots of opportunities in future, but at the moment the idea of insurance works against the principles of bitcoin.  He says Bitstamp approached the FCA when incorporating in the UK, asking for advice, but it only responded that bitcoin could not be classed as a currency, and therefore it could not regulate the new exchange.  As a result, Bitstamp has taken steps to self-regulate and says that it follows a set of best practices involving know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering policies, which effectively mean it treats bitcoin as money.  Kodric points out that less than 1% of the company's bitcoins are kept in a hot wallet, with the remainder in cold storage. However, though he's quick to point out that the bitcoins stored with Bitstamp are safe, he does note that he believes the point of bitcoin is for people to be their own bank, saying that it is in fact a liability for Bitstamp to keep coins in cold storage.  “We don’t charge for safekeeping bitcoins” he explains, in addition to which he says:  ""Bitcoin is truly 'The People’s money, by the people, of the people and for the people'. I think education is really important. For the first time people have the option to look after their money entirely on their own. They don’t need to rely on any bank or exchange anymore.”  According to Kodric, his company is also working on a mobile platform, so customers will be able to trade on Bitstamp using their smartphones within the next couple of weeks.  His colleagues have also just updated their servers and switched to Incapsula to protect them from DDoS attacks, and last month they did $200m dollars-worth of trade.  Bitcoin popularity  Kodric estimates that there are about two million people engaged in the bitcoin economy right now and says the scene is still a very friendly and co-operative place, noting that most of the early adopters are working hard to get their message out to the public.  “If each one of these two million people who currently use bitcoin just tell one friend about it and explain how it works to one person, the size of the economy would double overnight,"" he added.  That said, when asked to account for the recent change in price he is philosophical:  ""We’re no longer dependent on a single exchange. We see a lot of diversification, with no single point of failure. This boosts investor confidence in the bitcoin economy.""  Like many bitcoin entrepreneurs and market observers, he also believes the demise of Silk Road had a positive impact on investors who felt that the notorious website was giving bitcoin a bad name.  In his eyes, the most important factor affecting the price in recent weeks was the report that Chinese state TV had shown an open-minded and relatively even-handed documentary about bitcoin, which opened Chinese eyes to the potential of the new currency. He says this was one factor that a lot of people missed when accounting for the recent price bubble.  When it comes to bitcoin and the economic crisis, he points out that ""people don’t realize the problem, until they see a solution"". ""Bitcoin for me, was that solution. I think we are on solid and very fruitful ground,"" he added.  When asked what he thinks about the suggestion that bitcoin is the perfect tool for money launderers, he said: “Bitcoin is the worst thing right now to launder money in. Everyone has an extra pair of eyes monitoring them for suspicious activities. We do not want to deal with any suspicious parties.""  In September, Bitstamp started to insist that account holders verify their identity with copies of their passports and an official record of their home address as part of their effort to self-regulate in case the authorities came knocking.  Bitstamp is currently the third largest bitcoin exchange in the world, behind BTC China and Mt. Gox in terms of BTC volume transacted.  Article co-authored by Richard Boase and Emily Spaven.

He also said that he believes the price is ultimately going to settle higher than it currently stands today.  The price of a Virgin Galactic flight at present stands at $250,000, equivalent to 342 bitcoins at the current Bitcoin Price Index.  In the beginning  Branson, who now has an estimated net worth of $4.6bn, started his business career at the tender age of 16, when he set up a magazine called The Student, which advertised popular music records.  He set up a mail-order record business in 1970, opening a chain of record stores two years later. Over the next decade, the Virgin brand grew rapidly with the creation of Virgin Atlantic and the expansion of Virgin Records.  The 1990s saw the entrepreneur launch a number of other ventures, including Virgin Mobile and Virgin Trains. It was in 1992 that he sold Virgin records to Thorn EMI for a reported $1bn.  Back in February this year, Branson invested in black cab app Hailo, which enables people to hail taxis in 16 cities across the world using their smartphones.  Branson has also invested in payment startups Square and Clinkle, and believes that the days of carrying physical cash could soon be over:  ""Sometime in the future, innovative payment models such as Square, Clinkle and Bitcoin will become serious challengers to traditional banks, which will spur more competition and give customers even more options.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/22/virgin-galactic-accepts-bitcoin-for-space-travel-says-billionaire-entrepreneur-sir-richard-branson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0374db670958d57a516a642ce53b528fd1ccac46-604x401.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the 29-year-old's bail hearing yesterday (21st November), defence lawyer Joshua Dratel proposed a bail package of over $1m, pledged by Ulbricht's friends and family.  However, after hearing from a Manhattan federal prosecutor, who argued that Ulbricht would try to flee the US, Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox decided to turn down the bail request.  Assistant US attorney Serrin Turner also claimed Ulbricht, who is alleged to have gone by the online alias of Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR), might present a danger to society. He substantiated this by telling Fox that Ulbricht had transacted with at least two hitmen in an attempt to have six people murdered.  Murder for hire  The original criminal complaint against Ulbricht stated that he had paid to have two people murdered – one person who was attempting to blackmail him after learning the identities of thousands of Silk Road users, and another who Ulbricht allegedly feared would hand his details to the FBI.  “DPR’s communications reveal that he has taken it upon himself to police threats to the site from scammers and extortionists, and has demonstrated a willingness to use violence in doing so,"" the affidavit read.  In yesterday's hearing, Turner claimed Ulbricht had also paid $500,000 in bitcoins for the murder of an associate of the blackmailer, plus three people who lived with him.  Turner then took the opportunity to quash claims that Ulbricht had no involvement with Silk Road by revealing that federal agents found a diary detailing the creation of the deep-web marketplace when they were analysing a laptop seized from Ulbricht.  ""The evidence in the government's view is absolutely overwhelming against the defendant,"" Turner said at the hearing.  Legal defence fund  Supporters of Ulbricht have set up a donation page to raise money for his legal defence fund. The Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense fund aims to raise $500,000. To date, $2,370 has been raised, but there are 29 days left for people to donate.  The fund describes its goal as being to ""provide Ross with what every American citizen is promised: a fair trial"". It goes on to state:  ""In the USA we are presumed innocent until proven guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt. We firmly believe in Ross’ innocence and are working hard with the best legal team to prove it. But this is a complex, ground breaking case – and will be a very expensive one.""  The donations will be used solely to pay attorneys’ legal fees, ancillary legal fees, and fund-related banking and accounting expenses.

42376732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6clGJ,1385122608,I Bought Subway With Bitcoin and It Was Awesome,"Editor’s note: Andrew Torba, a bitcoin fan, recently visited a Subway in the US and blogged about the experience. We thought his story about completing a real-world bitcoin transaction captured the thrill of using the emerging technology for the first time.  Subway may have had similar feelings, as it since sent a tweet to its 1.6 million followers about the transaction, but this tweet has since been deleted.  “Bitcoin can’t be used to buy anything” they said  I’m a huge fan of bitcoin. For those of you who don’t know, bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is disrupting the way we exchange money on a global level. I’ve been following bitcoin for about six months now, but up until six weeks ago I never really dove in and learned what this mystical new digital currency actually was.  After spending a countless number of hours researching, I ended up buying some bitcoin while it was still under $200. The more I understood, the more fascinated and passionate I became with the digital currency that was quickly gaining popularity around the world.  On 12th November I was excited to learn that one of the first business establishments in the United States to accept bitcoin was located in my own backyard.  I knew I had to make the 45-minute drive to be one of the first people to complete a real-world transaction with bitcoin.  On a whim, my good friend and professional photographer Christopher Nash and I made the trip to Allentown, PA – home of the first Subway in the United States to accept bitcoin as a payment option. During the ride we spoke about the unbelievable potential bitcoin had to completely revolutionize global commerce and finance, which only heightened the anticipation to make our first purchase.  We pulled up to the small Subway shop on Hamilton Boulevard and proceeded to geek out at the sight of the bitcoin sign on the front door.“Bitcoin accepted here.” We wondered how many people walked by this sign on a daily basis and had no idea that they were stepping into history. After making a slight scene in front of the store and following some odd looks from employees and customers, we made our way to the counter and placed our order.  While our sandwiches were being made we bombarded the employees with questions. They were cool about it and happy to help. I asked how many people had come in this past week to make a purchase with bitcoin.  The employees looked at each other and told us that between them they have had well over one hundred bitcoin enthusiasts stop in during their short shifts alone. “Some told us they traveled four hours, and all they only bought a few cookies.” A wise investment, not only because Subway’s cookies are amazing; but also because next month the bitcoin they spent on food could well be worth double the value.  That being said, transactions will be the backbone of bitcoin’s future. If you really want to support bitcoin’s long-term success, you need support bitcoin businesses by making purchases. Unfortunately due to the current volatility of bitcoin over the past year, many are choosing to sit on their investment and watch it rise and fall in value.  Once our subs were made the employee took out an iPad and opened Coinbase. She punched our total in the register and then in the iPad, which immediately generated a custom QR code linked to the store’s Coinbase account which was preloaded with our exact total calculated. I took out my iPhone, opened my Coinbase app, and scanned the QR code. Instantly the total popped up on my screen and gave me the option to leave a note about my purchase. ""Subway"" seemed appropriate.[post-quote]  I hit send and within seconds she received confirmation on the iPad that her account had received the bitcoin. It took no longer than a credit card transaction, and it didn’t require my signature.  Thankfully the business owner and I had the Coinbase app installed before Apple unexpectedly removed the app from the App Store less than a month after it was launched. This could be a blockade to bitcoin adoption in the US, hopefully Coinbase can get this issue resolved with Apple immediately.  Perhaps after the recent positive Senate hearings, Apple will have a change of heart. Bitcoin surged this week to a new high of over $700 after US agencies told a Senate committee that bitcoin is a “legal means of exchange.” However, it’s important to note that adoption in China is also a major force behind this spike in value.  After we finished our subs, we knew we had to make another purchase. This time we opted for the cookies and even recorded a short Vine of the transaction.  Chris and I weren’t as keen with our bitcoin purchase, but mainly because we were hungry. Ironically I forgot to bring any cash with me, luckily Chris had enough to pay the tolls on the Turnpike.  Overall the experience was remarkable. A great story to tell the grandkids someday. Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that bitcoin is an exciting new technology that will undoubtably change the world.  I am proud to say I played a small part of history in the making.

42376713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ckwB,1385116863,Will Cryptoauction Become the 'New eBay of Bitcoin'?,"Irish company Cryptoauction is aiming to become the new eBay of bitcoin.  The company is due to launch on 30th November under the helmsmanship of entrepreneur Daryl Cusack.  He believes that, since the closure of Bitmit.net, the field is wide open for a new bitcoin-based auction marketplace.  Cusack will present a talk on decentralised corporate models ""in order to achieve a people-not-profit corporate outlook"". He will explain how Cryptoauction’s trustless model fits in with concepts from game theory that incentivise trusting relationships between users without the need for third party mediation.  He said:    “There’s no way to eliminate bad actors entirely. The best we can do is mitigate the risk by incentivising trust amongst users. We employ an innovative mechanism to discourage improper use of the site whereby those with good reputations are rewarded financially and those with bad reputations are penalised.      We’re trying to create a system where the users create the best possible outcomes for themselves without the need for a trusted third party. When you take that variable out of the equation you end up with a purer vision of user to user interaction.""    Users will be able to post one listing a day for free, and can post subsequent listings for 2.9% + €0.10 each (capped at €95) – a measure designed to stop spammers from listing endless junk items. Each auction will last between one and 14 days.  Sellers, whose identities are always protected, can choose to hold a regular auction where the item can sell for any price, or they can opt for a fixed-price auction, with or without a ‘buy it now’ price. They also have the chance to choose which cryptocurrency they prefer to sell for, bitcoin, litecoin or primecoin, when they register.  “We’ll be moderating the items that are posted and do periodic reviews for inappropriate items, items in bad taste, illegal items and so on, so you won’t find drugs there,"" Cusack stated.  To mitigate against a 'bad actor' not sending funds to the seller, Cryptoauction has integrated an automatic settlement feature, which Cusack says will resolve any disputes by ""comparing the relative karma of each of the transactors"".  The aim is to judge buyers and sellers on their reputations in a user review system, effectively creating a 'wall' around good buyers and sellers, protecting them from those who are less reputable.  Cusack said building trust among a distributed network of users is a ""chicken and egg situation"", but he hopes it will catch on as trust flows into the system organically.  “Users with high ratings will benefit when the escrowed funds are in dispute, as they’ll be awarded equally to users with an approval rating above 80%,"" he explained.  According to Cusack, the company uses a dynamic system, so if a user's reputation starts going down, their rewards will too. He explained:    ""There’s a weighted review system over a fixed number of reviews that ensures, over time, good sellers will develop good reputations.      We also have a cancellation system where ... once the funds are held in escrow, the buyer cannot cancel it but the seller can, and we employ a messaging system for buyers and sellers to work out their differences if need be. It’s an off-block chain escrow system too.""    Cryptoauction has registered multiple domain names in different locales around the world to cater to different national markets, and, if the idea takes off, it will push out in new directions.  When asked about the site's security measures, Cusack said the company has made every attempt to keep as few bitcoins online as possible. However, he says there’s always an element of risk, so the user has to exercise due diligence. Cryptoauction has also tried to minimise the amount of time each user’s funds are held, he explained.  ""We use cloud flare to avoid going offline during a DDoS, and we’re registered in Ireland, under the Business Names Act, as an Irish company and under Irish law, and we intend to work with the Bitcoin Foundation and DATA to ensure that we meet best practices for handling cryptocurrency,"" Cusack added.  In terms of Cryptoauction’s profitability, the company claims to be taking a cut of 1% on each sale, plus a $0.10 fee to avoid creating dust on the block chain, but their take is capped at 75 euros per transaction and there’s an minimum user account activation fee of 0.0001 BTC per account, to cover any transaction fees the user incurs.  The company has taken tax advice on using cryptocurrency and has spoken to Elizabeth Ploshay of the Bitcoin Foundation to ask for guidance. However, crypto-currency has yet to be recognised by the Irish Government as legal tender, so the firm will be paying its taxes in euros.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Richard Boase,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/22/will-cryptoauction-become-the-new-ebay-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abeb449f6e3fab12f44832d3a972756b17c2ad3b-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6clCX,1385079448,Bitcoin Black Friday Entices Merchants to Accept Bitcoin for Holiday Deals,"Black Friday, a popular shopping phenomenon in the United States that occurs the day after Thanksgiving, is getting a bitcoin-related promotion.  The effort, dubbed Bitcoin Black Friday, aims to list the best deals for anyone paying with bitcoin.  Existing bitcoin merchants can sign up now, but they are also hoping to entice new merchants to accept bitcoin. Signing up is free.  ""Bitcoin Black Friday is simply a way to help BTC consumers, help BTC merchants,"" founder Jon Holmquist told CoinDesk.  Holmquist thinks that bitcoin's distributed, peer-to-peer nature makes it a bit difficult to promote for things like shopping and payments.  ""It is very hard to attract bitcoin consumers. Also, it is very hard to find merchants to spend your bitcoins at,"" he said.  Black Friday is not a national holiday in the United States, but since Thanksgiving falls on the last Thursday in November, many workers have that day off, which can make it an ideal time for Christmas shopping.  To take advantage of the increased footfall, many US chains open their stores earlier than normal. Both brick and mortar retailers and online sites have special deals.  Wal-Mart, for example, is selling a 32"" inch flat screen television for $98 on Black Friday.  Even though you could potentially use a Wal-Mart gift card from eGifter, customers can't buy that TV directly with bitcoin. That's something Holmquist hopes Bitcoin Black Friday will help with in terms of awareness and virtual currency adoption. Merchants are a key aspect of this.  ""Because of the lack of fees associated with bitcoin payments, merchants can offer much better deals than they can using conventional payment methods,"" he said.  The outlook for the 2013 holiday shopping season is expected to be weak, and forecasts are such that retail revenues will be similar to 2009 levels, a time when the global financial crisis was in full swing.  [post-quote]  And although the recent increase in bitcoin value has enriched many enthusiasts, Holmquist isn't sure that translates into more people spending bitcoin. It's the merchants that need to accept it in order for BTC to gain legitimacy as a choice for purchasing good and services.  ""Any increase in price will make bitcoin consumers richer, but I don't think it really affects merchants that much,"" he said.  Companies like Gyft as well as Bees Brothers are just a few of the bitcoin merchants that will be participating in Bitcoin Black Friday 2013.  Bitcoin merchants interested in being included should sign up on the Bitcoin Black Friday website, so they can offer a BTC-based deal for shoppers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/22/bitcoin-black-friday-entices-merchants-to-accept-bitcoin-for-holiday-deals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/048a1e47537875c20fe2b76c9c981bb180ee0e9e-592x414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
