42404046,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDzu,1582156375,Bitcoin Slides Back Below $10K Amid Quick Bearish Sell-Off,"Bitcoin has dipped back below the psychological area of support near the $10,000 level amid a 20-minute sell-off that took the markets by surprise.      At around 21:30 UTC on Feb. 19, the price of bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 4.5 percent from $10,086 to $9,610, according to CoinDesk’s BPI data, despite the technical signs appearing to favor the bulls.      On exchanges like Bitstamp and Coinbase, prices dropped to as low as $9,280 before quickly being snatched up by opportunistic buyers looking to capitalize on the fall. BTC is now changing hands at around $9,719.      “I’m a long holder and even I’m shook,” said BTC investor and podcast host Brad Mills in a recent tweet.      “That usually means too much exposure,” he added.      Indeed, the sell-off caught many traders unawares as the price of BTC shed much of the gains achieved over the last few days, with BTC’s price rising out of a prior area of resistance near $9,483 on Feb. 17 to above $10,000 a day later.      So far sellers are intent on keeping prices below hourly resistances near $9,793. That will be a telling sign should prices remain below that level in the coming days, towards the end of the weekly closing session on Feb. 24.      Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto analyst at Ark Invest, said in a recent tweet that today marks BTC’s fifth-largest hourly price drop in history.      “The only other time we've seen a greater dollar price drop is at the December 2017 peak,” Elmandjra said.      Other notable cryptocurrencies are also down, with the likes of XRP (XRP), ether (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) down between 5.5 and 8.1 percent over a 24-hour period. Tezos, on the other hand, is still trending up 5.46 percent on a 24-hour basis and one of the only crypto in the top 20 to still be in the green, Messari data shows.      UPDATE (Feb. 20, 00:25 UTC): Co-founder and managing partner at Kenetic, Jehan Chu, told CoinDesk that ""today’s sell-off was nothing more than short-term profit-taking in a market gaining steam.

42404034,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDo6,1582153203,OpenNode Finds Way for Retailers to Turn Fiat Payments Into Bitcoin (Using Apple Pay),"The bitcoin payments startup OpenNode just gained access to Apple Pay, according to the startup’s head of marketing, Ryan Flowers.      This could be a boon for the small subset of merchants who want to hold bitcoin, because it allows people to spend dollars through their regular fintech accounts yet still have those dollars exchanged to bitcoin for the merchant to receive.      The customer’s fiat payment goes through OpenNode’s partner, Wyre, converting to bitcoin (BTC) and depositing in the merchant’s wallet. Merchants can sign up to be part of the private feature release, currently in beta, before it goes live across the platform in a few months.      “They [shoppers] put the card information into the widget that OpenNode is using, in some cases the card information may already be stored, for example with your Apple Pay,” said Jack Jia, Wyre’s director of institutional sales. “So all the user does is click the ‘Buy with Apple Pay’ button” to make a purchase with fiat that the merchant receives as bitcoin.      The same back-end rails that offer indirect access to Apple Pay accounts, which both OpenNode and Wyre declined to name, also work for most debit cards. Now shoppers can spend fiat at online stores and choose for the merchant to receive bitcoin. This assumes shoppers are willing to take a few extra seconds to benefit the merchant, rather than checking out without the bitcoin button. So this might only suit merchants with a devoted customer base.      “Our merchants keep some, or most, of their payments in bitcoin. Merchants want exposure to bitcoin,” OpenNode CEO Afnan Rahman said of the 5,000 merchants registered with the startup so far. “This year a lot of luxury goods businesses are signing up.”      OpenNode’s Flowers said shoppers are reluctant to spend bitcoin because of the volatility, but demand among merchants for receiving the cryptocurrency hasn’t dwindled. In particular, Rahman said the company has seen the most uptick in 2020 from merchants in India, South Korea, Japan and China.      He said OpenNode processes “a couple million” dollars worth of bitcoin a month for such diehard merchants. The startup will initially deploy the Apple Pay feature with less than a dozen merchant testers.      “We’re rolling it out slowly to make sure the rate of chargebacks isn’t high,” Flowers said, describing contested payments credit-card companies return to consumers.      By this time next year, Wyre and OpenNode hope to complement this feature with a “full-suite treasury management tool for merchants,” Jia said. By relying on Wyre, which has a money transmitter license, OpenNode will offer merchants a bitcoin savings account where they can earn interest and pay out invoices. Jia said this would be “offering the same functions as a bank,” with the option to cash out bitcoin to a personal wallet.      “We’re not looking at revenue right now as much as building up infrastructure,” Jia said, referencing debit cards and Apple Pay. “These are all layers on top of the banking system, so connecting those networks to the bitcoin network through infrastructure is more important right now.”      Apple didn’t offer any comments by press time.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/19/opennode-finds-way-for-retailers-to-turn-fiat-payments-into-bitcoin-using-apple-pay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51cf92ff491a521bd8ef7bb2622f9d2488707ef0-1360x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDn7,1582152905,US Court Tells Telegram and SEC to Focus on 'Economic Realities' of Gram Token Sale,"A U.S. federal judge says the SEC shouldn't get hung up on ""labels"" in determining whether messaging platform Telegram conducted an illegal securities offering.      In his first public remarks on the case, Judge P. Kevin Castel of the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York began Wednesday's hearing with an opening statement that urged both parties to consider the ""economic realities"" of the $1.7 billion token sale while recognizing that ""disclaimers don't control"" how the court views the asset.      Castel also asked about Telegram’s economic justification for locking up the first round of purchase agreements, whether the gram tokens sold in the first round had utility, if the TON blockchain would be able to operate at launch and what would happen if Telegram’s executives disappeared to the British Virgin Islands – where Telegram is currently domiciled – at launch.      Telegram’s attorney assured the judge the 36 validators on Telegram’s testnet blockchain showed there was sufficient interest in the blockchain from the “decentralized community.” The Securities and Exchange Commission, by contrast, focused on Telegram’s alleged legal violations, pointing to how the company’s sales to accredited investors were not done according to Reg D standards.      The SEC is alleging Telegram violated federal securities laws with its token sale. An attorney with the agency argued Wednesday the two token sales to private investors should be viewed as a public offering, saying the company did not sufficiently restrict initial gram purchasers from reselling grams on a secondary market.      “We submit that this is the next step in a public offering in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act,” said SEC senior trial attorney Jorge Tenreiro.      At the beginning of the status conference hearing, Telegram submitted additional documents from the deposition of former Telegram chief investment advisor John Hyman and materials from foreign countries, and Judge Castel closed the evidentiary record.      Tenreiro argued grams were sold with no utility to investors who had no interest in crypto outside of speculation. The SEC attorney pointed to investor memos that claimed returns in the double and triple digits, calling the transaction a “straightforward capital raise.”      Judge Castel likened Telegram’s gram sale to gold, saying a seller would not ask individuals if they were interested in gold before selling the precious metal, on which investors often speculate.      Tenreiro said that, unlike gold, Telegram’s first round of grams were locked up for more than a year after the private sale. Telegram had not provided a reasonable justification for the lockup, creating the conditions for initial purchasers to resell their presale tokens and create a secondary market, Tenreiro further alleged. This made initial purchasers “akin to underwriters” without registration, which Telegram is responsible for because the company put in no restrictions on reselling, he added.      When Castel pointed out that Telegram had included a restriction on reselling grams pre-launch in its purchase agreements with investors, Tenreiro said the company was taking investors at their word instead of ensuring no resale. Tenreiro asked the court to join the SEC in stopping an “ongoing violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.”      Telegram lawyer Alexander Drylewski argued that the SEC’s Howey Test does not apply to digital assets unless those assets are offered with a promise of managerial oversight that will increase their value over time. This means that when the TON blockchain launches, grams will no longer be securities, Drylewski said.      He added that the Reg D exemption should apply to Telegram’s presale of grams to private investors because Telegram had investors agree to confirm with the company they had not sold grams on a secondary market before the launch of the TON blockchain. He added that Telegram could not be responsible for investors who made secondary market deals without the company’s knowledge.      Castel reserved judgment on the preliminary injunction and assured Telegram’s lawyer Drylewski there would be a judgment in the case before April 30, when gram investors expect to see the TON blockchain launched. Telegram consented to prolonging the preliminary injunction after Castel explained that not consenting would mean the court would make a decision immediately.

42404055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhE1s,1582152604,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi 'Flash Loan' Attack,"There’s now a case study for how DeFi can go awry.      bZx, the eighth-largest decentralized finance project according to DeFi Pulse, suffered two attacks last weekend following the introduction of “flash loans,” a new DeFi feature that limits a trader’s risk while improving the upside.      Led by CEO Tom Bean, the bZx team was attending ETHDenver, a major ethereum conference in Colorado’s capital, on Friday when an unknown attacker drained about $350,000 worth of ether (ETH) from Fulcrum, the startup’s lending platform. As a post-mortem from the firm describes, the attacker took advantage of pricing data and a bug within the bZx protocol’s code to secure the payout.    bZx quickly shut down Fulcrum using a decidedly non-decentralized master key. Users and analysts saw an update hit GitHubhttps://github.com/bZxNetwork/bZx-monorepo/commit/7cfebd9e289d1f7ee541d5a7556e3f679fa216af, the code repository, that supposedly locked down endangered funds.    Trading resumed over the weekend with the firm announcing its intention to contain the damage in a variety of ways, including liquidating collateral to pay a now-uncovered loan, building an insurance fund and spreading losses across platform users. Despite the shocking incident, traders who had deposited money on bZx will barely feel the effects of the attack.      But that wasn’t the end of it. On Tuesday, Feb. 18, attackers hit bZx again, netting $633,000.      While the amounts of money lost are still relatively small for the world of cryptocurrency, the attacks demonstrate DeFi’s move into the big leagues and the attention it will now receive from manipulators and thieves.      If all this has been making your head spin, you’re in good company. Blockchain technology was complicated and abstract enough before people started building lending and trading services on top of it.      For the perplexed, CoinDesk offers the following explainer of the bZx hack and its broader lessons.    The new frontier    As the name implies, DeFi, or decentralized finance, aspires to one day offer a democratized alternative to the legacy financial system, where individuals can obtain credit on a peer-to-peer basis without relying on banks or other middlemen. For now, though, it’s a playground for traders – and a rough one at that.      Since the participants don’t know each other, DeFi lending is all based on collateral. Digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) are notoriously volatile. To deal with this, DeFi lending applications such as MakerDAO let you borrow only 75 percent of your available collateral.      If the price of your asset begins to drop against the market, the smart contract underpinning the DeFi application will sell your asset at a certain spot price in order to protect the parties who loaned you money against your asset. Think of a pawnbroker who will only advance you $225 for an electric guitar worth $300.      The DeFi ecosystem also includes decentralized exchanges (DEX), where traders swap crypto assets without a central authority’s permission, their orders executed algorithmically on the ethereum blockchain.      Trading on-chain limits the range of assets involved to those that run on ethereum (native currency ether and various flavors of ERC tokens). But it allows sophisticated users to do some interesting tricks, as we’ll see shortly.      For a DeFi credit market to run properly, lenders must know the value of the collateral, so they need pricing information. This is data often gathered from crypto exchanges. In bZx’s case, the source was Kyber, a DEX.      The trouble is, crypto exchanges’ price information is all over the place.      Take as a loose example the spot-value differences between the top five exchanges by 24-hour volume for the most liquid digital asset, bitcoin:      Spot prices are often very different from one another because no single venue owns a crypto trade pairing product, said Sergey Nazarov, CEO of Chainlink, a crypto price data firm. Unlike in the traditional markets, where trading of, say, Apple shares happens only on Nasdaq, in crypto most anyone with the technical know-how can spin up an exchange on their laptop – in fact, that’s how the first exchanges started. Aggregating prices across such a fragmented market is a Herculean task, Nazarov said.      As in other financial markets, the wide discrepancy in prices also creates opportunities for traders to make money. Enter flash loans.      Too much information? For a simpler explanation, listen to our Markets Daily podcast.    Flash loans    Flash loans are a further innovation on top of DeFi and ethereum, the blockchain most often associated with the concept of “programmable money.” The product was first released by DeFi protocol Aave this January and then by bZx on Feb. 10.      In short, flash loans allow traders to take out uncollateralized loans to increase the payout of a singular trade. Returning to the pawnshop analogy, you can borrow the cash without surrendering your guitar.      Why would any lender agree to this, especially in a market where participants are anonymous? Because as the name implies, flash loans are paid back quickly – in the same transaction in which they are taken out.      Who would borrow money just to pay it back immediately? Clever arbitrageurs, that’s who.      As we’ve seen, different crypto markets have different prices for a given digital asset. A user can turn a quick profit by borrowing funds; buying low on one market; selling high on the other market; repaying the loan; and pocketing the profit. Again, this is all done within the same on-chain transaction, since the markets are DEXs often running on ethereum. The arbitrageur just had to code all the steps into the same computer program, known as a smart contract.      To boot, flash loans are nearly risk-free, at least for the borrower. Since the ethereum network settles transactions atomically, meaning all transactions on a book execute or none do, a trader who cannot pay back his loan with his trade loses nothing.      Why? Because the transaction never occurs.      As Aave writes, all transactions, from the loan to the trade, take place at once on the network. If the network sees that a flash loan would not be instantly repaid, it will refuse every transaction associated with it, in effect canceling the whole thing. No harm, no foul.      If it goes through, however, everything is executed at the same time, resulting in a successful trade. The lender collects a small fee, the trader is richer. Everybody wins.      If only it were so simple.    The attack    As bZx’s weekend woes showed, flash loans can be dangerous when combined with buggy code, janky price feeds or both.      Instead of just buying low and selling high, the attacker or attackers used the borrowed funds to manipulate markets that were unusually vulnerable to it. In both attacks, bZx got the short end of the stick.      In the first attack, for example, through a complex web of transactions, the attacker pumped and then dumped WBTC (“wrapped bitcoin,” an ethereum token backed by actual bitcoin) on a DEX called Uniswap; took profits in ether; repaid the flash loan -- and stiffed bzX on another loan related to the WBTC pumping.      “The magic under the hood is the fact how the Uniswap WBTC/ETH was manipulated up to 61.4 for profit,” according to an analysis by blockchain security firm PeckShield. “The WBTC/ETH price was even pumped up to 109.8 when the normal market price was at only around 38. In other words, there is an intentional huge price slippage triggered for exploitation.”      In this attack, a poorly set-up price feed certainly did not help, but the blame falls on the code, PeckShield CEO Jiang Xuxian told CoinDesk. Where a security wire should have been tripped as the price got out of whack, it failed to go off, Xuxian said.      The second attack came down to bad price data, specifically from DeFi network Kyber, bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner told CoinDesk. This time, the attacker focused on Synthetix USD (SUSD), a dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Synthetix Network.      The attacker borrowed 7,500 ether on bZx then pumped the value of SUSD on Kyber by swapping ether for SUSD. The purchase of so much SUSD caused the price to jump 2.5x the prevailing market rate of $1, writes PeckShield.      The attacker then took advantage of bZx’s dependency on Kyber for pricing data, putting up the SUSD as collateral for a large sum of ether on bZx; in fact, 2,000 more ether than the same amount of SUSD would have normally purchased on an open market.      After paying back the flash loan, the attacker reneged on paying back the under collateralized SUSD/ETH loan just taken out on bZx, resulting in a tidy 2,378 ETH profit and bZx holding buttons.    Lessons for DeFi    For smaller exchanges such as bZx, and DeFi in general, the pairing of innovative financial features like flash loans with systematic reliance on bad pricing data is exposing exchanges to new attacks, said Chainlink’s Nazarov.      “Do not use [a] single specific exchange as a price feed,” Nazarov said, “If it becomes thinly traded, people look at and they say, ‘Okay, this is how I'm building a product against this market or against that piece of data.’”      In fact, the specific attack against bZx was described months before it occurred by white-hat hacker Samczsun in a detailed blog post. As Samczun wrote at the time, hypothesizing an exploit involving bZx, the ethereum token known as DAI and another decentralized exchanges called DDEX:      “By relying on an on-chain decentralized price oracle without validating the rates returned, DDEX and bZx were susceptible to atomic price manipulation. This would have resulted in the loss of liquid ETH in the ETH/DAI market for DDEX, and loss of all liquid funds in bZx.”      Nazarov said the issue is not specific to bZx, but many exchanges within DeFi which rely upon a few on-chain pricing APIs. His firm is now working with bZx on addressing the issue, he added.      Kistner acknowledged the bZx team believed the oracle problems were considered fixed after Samczsun’s disclosures and even had the code independently audited. As Tuesday’s attack showed, the problems were not fixed.      “It's terrible to have consulted with security professionals but then be made a laughingstock when you follow their advice,” Kistner said.      As Nazarov pointed out, you can have all the auditors in the world greenlighting your code, but if it is based on poor data such as on-chain pricing, failure is inevitable.      “The technical risk here is not just about contract code. The code can be fantastic and audited as much as you want. But what’s going on is that you're creating new functionality which creates new surface areas which need to be secured,” Nazarov said.      Nazarov said the attacks, although unfortunate, are a lesson for DeFi in general. Pricing data is “a well-known architectural issue” that needs to be addressed, he said. “If you're building an app that's going to hold client funds, the fact that it's automated is great, but it doesn't mean that your work from a security point of view is done because the contract goes on ethereum.”      At bZx, the team has turned its attention toward securing the network. Kistner said trading will resume again shortly using Chainlink oracles for pricing, although no new users will be onboarded. For the future, Kistner said bZx will look at replicating the infrastructure of MakerDAO, the largest DeFi provider.      “When we are done revamping our internal processes, we want to set a standard for both security and transparency,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/19/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-defi-flash-loan-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb16f5529d344bb3684e739e3312072241133c48-1500x1248.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 62-year-old resident of Southern California will face a minimum of 10 years in prison, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).      As part of his plea agreement, Chen admitted to running and promoting U.S. Fine Investment Arts (USFIA), an Arcadia, Calif., company that peddled investors its “Gemcoin” digital currency, backed by gemstones that did not actually exist.      The multi-level-marketing scheme attracted 70,000 victims worldwide in its two years of operation for a total haul of $147 million, according to the DOJ.      According to the DOJ, part of Chen's plea acknowledges he reported income of $138,000 in 2014, far less than the $4.8 million he actually took in that year.      “Mr. Chen lured victim investors around the globe by creating a mirage made of fashionable cryptocurrency features and dynamic marketing tactics,” said Paul Delacourt, the assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Los Angeles Field Office, in the DOJ statement.

42404048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhE0t,1582144927,"On-Chain Activity Suggests Bitcoin Price Volatility Will Continue, Thanks to 'Whales'","Bitcoin's (BTC) price volatility spiked in January and could further increase over the near term because “whales” have surfaced.      The cryptocurrency’s annualized volatility grew roughly eight percentage points in January to a three-month high of 58.2 percent, according to Kraken’s monthly report.      Volatility rose as bitcoin’s price rallied from lows near $6,850 on Jan. 3 to a three-month high of $9,570 on Jan. 31. The cryptocurrency closed out January with 30 percent gains, registering its best January performance since 2013.      With the price rally, whales - those buyers of large numbers of coins - seem to have woken from their long slumber. The number of whale addresses – ones with balances ranging from 1K BTC to 10k BTC – ticked higher in the second half of January, as noted by Kraken’s researchers.      The number of whale addresses increased from 2,000 to 2,030, marking a transition to an “accumulation” phase from the “wait and see” phase seen in the last four months of 2019.      Historically, that transition has injected volatility into the bitcoin market. For instance, whales began accumulating coins in September 2018 and entered wait-and-watch mode in early 2019. Meanwhile, the annualized volatility bottomed out below 20 percent by mid-November and skyrocketed to 100 percent by the end of December.      On similar lines, the spike in price volatility in the second quarter of 2019 was preceded by accumulation by large wallets.      The peculiar behavior could be associated with whales having the resources to affect the market with large orders.      “During the accumulation phase, whales eat into market liquidity,” Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEOofCRUXPay and CoinSwitch.co told CoinDesk. “That affects the supply-demand ratio and causes volatility to re-enter the market.”      Sudden price swings have been observed during whales’ accumulation period. The cryptocurrency’s sharp rise from $4,100 to $5,100, seen on April 2, 2019, was reportedly caused by an order worth about $100 million spread across three exchanges.      Whale action has also led to big price sell-offs in the past; a bitcoin flash crash from $12,600 to $12,100 in less than 15 minutes on July 9, 2019, was triggered by a massive sell order of 6,500 BTC on cryptocurrency exchange Binance.      Singhal added that HODLers – addresses with balances ranging from 10 BTC to 100 BTC – also influence liquidity and volatility. According to historical data, volatility tends to rise once the 10 to 100 BTC cohort concludes accumulation.      As the growth in the number of addresses with 10 to 100 BTC topped out in November 2018, volatility kicked in and rose sharply from 20 percent to 100 percent. A similar divergence between the two metrics was seen during the four months to mid-July 2019.      Currently, the 10 to 100 BTC cohort is in the accumulation phase, having bottomed out in November. The number of addresses have increased from 135,000 to 137,500 over the past three months.      ""Family offices, high-net-worth individuals and proprietary trading accounts have been building BTC positions continuously in the 10 to 100 range. It's a sign of growing adoption of bitcoin as an investment,"" Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist/director at VanEck/MVIS, told CoinDesk.      If HODLers exit the accumulation phase and whales continue to snap up coins over the coming weeks, the demand supply-imbalance could worsen, resulting in a big jump in volatility.      “The problem, however, is that it is difficult to predict how long these periods of accumulation for HODLers will last,” said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data.      The ongoing accumulation by HODLers could last at least for a few more weeks, with the cryptocurrency set to undergo mining reward halving in three months.      The rewards per block mined on bitcoin’s blockchain will be reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC at some point in May. Essentially, miners would have fewer bitcoins to sell after May, and that could lead to a supply deficit.      In the past, markets have priced in the impending supply cut by rallying to a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of reward halving, but on a date before the event.      Thus, if history were to repeat itself, bitcoin could rise above the June 2019 high of $13,880 before May. With such strong bullish expectations dominating the market sentiment, HODLers are unlikely to end accumulation anytime soon.      However, that does not necessarily mean volatility would crash, as whales are also likely to continue accumulating coins ahead of the reward halving.      “If the whales shift to accumulating bitcoin while HODLers are still within their current phase, it would suggest an additional increase in demand for BTC at near the same as the mining supply is scheduled to be cut in half in early May,” Abendschein told CoinDesk. “This imbalance has the potential to not only see a spike in volatility, but also in price.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/19/on-chain-activity-suggests-bitcoin-price-volatility-will-continue-thanks-to-whales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3300c1fd6cdb271a72103aa00669c444a7fe1c90-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhDuz,1582142621,EU Official: We Can't Regulate Libra Without More Details,"The European Union is still trying to figure out what to do about Libra, according to a memo released Tuesday by European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis.      The indecisiveness stems from a lack of actionable information. Specifically, Libra “lacks detail,” according to Dombrovskis.      Despite repeatedly asking the Facebook-launched Libra Association for information about its payments ecosystem and eponymous stablecoin, the Commission – the EU's executive branch – has yet to determine what, exactly, Libra is.      “As Libra is still a project, and thereby a moving target, the information provided remains insufficient for determining the precise nature of Libra and, by extension, its relation with existing EU law,"" he said.      But he said the Commission wants to “act swiftly” in creating regulations for Libra, stablecoins and other EU crypto-asset projects. This reaffirms the Commission’s Dec. 5, 2019, declaration that it will police stablecoins and their “risk” to financial stability.      Libra faced regulatory backlash after it was announced last year, with lawmakers and agencies worldwide calling for a halt to its development until the Facebook-led project could be scrutinized.      Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the Libra Association, which formed its own governing council with 20 companies in mid-October, will wait until regulators are comfortable before launching.      Zuckerberg said in testimony before a U.S. congressional committee last year that Facebook would withdraw from the project if the association chooses to launch before securing regulatory approvals.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/19/eu-official-we-cant-regulate-libra-without-more-details,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdfb939054754610510b07dfab1305ddc147b53d-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389703,6g2ONgYkIGZ4vn5QXmgICq,1582138200,The Flash Loan Attacks Explained (for Everybody),"Today we're breaking down the flash loan attacks that rocked the DeFi community in a way even your grandpa can understand, presented in both audio and full-text format below.      For early access before our regular noon Eastern time releases, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica or RSS.      Full transcript:      John: The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to fast money… Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and thousands of others like them take just minutes or even seconds to send across the street or to the other side of the world. The technology has been described as cash with wings, and it’s not a bad way to think about it.       But last week, as we walked the floor at ETHDenver, an annual gathering of ethereum fans, that speed became a liability. Sophisticated attackers took advantage of that speed to steal nearly a million dollars in less than a second.       Hello, and welcome to CoinDesk Explains, an occasional series where we break down the complex world of cryptocurrency. I’m John Biggs...       Adam: ...and I’m Adam B. Levine. We’ve both been following this technology for way too many years, but this latest incident is pretty fascinating by any standard. On today’s show we’ll break down The flash loan attacks that rocked the DeFi community and, depending on whom you ask, either demonstrated fundamental flaws in the world of “DeFi, or simply show how early we are in this technology.       John: Okay, if you’re new to the sector or haven’t been paying that much attention to ethereum you’re probably wondering, “What is DeFi, and what are flash loans?” This story is really about flash loans, but before we get there, let’s talk about Decentralized Finance, better known as DeFi.       Adam: So John, think back to when you were a poor college student, to that time you pawned your electric guitar.       John: I’ll never admit that I did this, but for the sake of argument let’s say I went down to Uncle Sams’ Pawn Shop in Columbus, Ohio, at the age of 18. On Thursday. At, like, 11 a.m. So the guitar was worth about $300 but the pawn shop only gave me $150 in exchange for it.       Adam: So why did you sell it to a pawn shop?       John: Well, in this case I didn’t actually sell it. When you pawn something you’re basically taking out a loan and using the pawned item, the guitar in my case. That’s collateral for that loan.       Adam: In the world of High Finance, I think we’d call that securing the loan. What was your thinking there?       John: If I sold my guitar outright, I'd need to buy a new one, but I didn’t want a new one. To get my guitar back I just had to wait for my next paycheck to roll around and then pay back the $150 they’d given me, plus a bit of interest, and boom - I’d solved my short-term cash crunch without selling anything at all.       Adam: So for you that felt like a good deal because even though you weren’t getting the full value of your guitar, you also weren’t really selling it. You could get it back, as long as you honored the terms of the loan and paid it back.       John: Yeah, it was a good deal for me, but it was also a good deal for the pawn shop. If I pay the loan back, they make money off the interest. They gave me $150 for the guitar, but I paid $200 to get it back. So the loan cost me $50. That was some crazy expensive money.       Adam: But if you hadn’t paid it back, the pawn shop basically doubles their money, so long as they can sell your guitar for the $300 it was worth. You keep the $150 they loaned you, but you’re out your guitar. Not exactly a winning scenario, but that’s sort of a worst-case, the loan turns into you effectively selling it on the cheap.       John: Are we really going to talk more about my years as a poor college student? I can’t be held responsible for my actions when sleep-deprived.       Adam: No, we’re just about done here. The point is that DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, usually works a lot like a pawn shop, but on the internet. Instead of using your guitar as collateral, you use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether or an almost unlimited supply of smaller tokens that can be created by, literally, anybody, and for just about any purpose.       John: So if I want to take out a DeFi loan, I give them cryptocurrency collateral that’s worth more than whatever I want to do.       Adam: Yeah, that’s right. And you’d do it for basically the same reason as you’d take a loan in a pawn shop: You have something, in this case cryptocurrency tokens, which you don’t want to sell but which you do want to get some money out of for one reason or another.       John: And instead of using a pawn shop, I’m using a smart contract.       Adam: Exactly. We’re not going to get into smart contracts right now, just think about them like computer programs that run on a blockchain, but yes. So DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, usually works like a pawn shop giving a loan. You give them a thing more valuable than the loan you want to take to hold as collateral in case you don’t pay back the loan. That seems like a pretty safe system: heads I win, tails you lose and I also win. So what happened in Denver?       John: Flash loans!       Adam: What’s a flash loan?       John: OK, this one is a little weird but it’s a really, really quick loan that doesn’t require me to put up any collateral.       Adam: So they just give you money? What happens if you don’t return it? This sounds like my kind of loan.       John: That’s the thing, they won’t give you the loan unless you pay it back at exactly the same time they give it to you.       Adam: Wait… What?       John: I know… I know… So, you remember how at the beginning I said that cryptocurrency is fast, like really really fast.       Adam: Yeah?       John: Well, with a lot of careful planning it’s actually possible with cryptocurrency and DeFi to use one of these flash loans to take advantage of trading opportunities, the imbalances between different marketplaces, to make money and pay back the loan, almost instantly.       Adam: That sounds crazy. Can one get a job taking free loans and making money instantly without providing collateral? I may have picked the wrong career!      John: Well, sure, but at this point, DeFi and flash loans are still in the experimental, early stage and really the only people playing in that sandbox are developers and wannabe Wall Street types. For normal people this stuff might eventually change the way we think about money, or at least loans. But for now that seems a long way off.       Adam: OK, but wait, when we started talking about this you said that flash loans caused almost a million dollars worth of losses for the folks lending money. Why would anyone lend money without collateral if they can lose money doing it?       John: In theory, they shouldn't have been able to lose that money. With flash loans, the whole idea is that you only get the loan if you can prove that you’ll pay it back at basically the same time. Cryptocurrency, DeFi, and Flash Loans all rely on a blockchain, which is simply a long list of all the actions and transactions that have happened. It’s maintained independently by thousands of individual computers run by enthusiasts and companies. The great thing about a blockchain is that because there are so many computers keeping track, it’s almost impossible to lose data or for a person, company or even government to change that record.       Adam: Sobasically, they can’t rewrite history, and that’s a good thing because it means that people on the internet who don’t trust each other can still have their computers work together to create a history that we can all trust.       John: Yeah, because even if I might want to change the record to give myself a cool thousand bucks, you’re probably not going to think that’s very fair. There’s only one of me who wants that to be true, and thousands of people like you who think it's probably more important that the record is accurate.       Adam: So what happened?       John: Step one: I get a flash loan in a cryptocurrency called ether and use some of it to buy a lot of dollar-pegged stablecoin that should be worth one dollar each.       Adam: Right. And a dollar-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that’s supposed to be equal to, or be pegged to, the value of a dollar. So in theory it should always be worth a dollar.       John: That’s right, but Step two: I know that the lender gets pricing data from only one source. That source was called Kyber, but let’s call him Bob. Bob’s just one guy, and I use some of the crypto I borrowed with the flash loan, some ether, to buy a huge amount of his tokens that are supposed to be worth a dollar, but because i’m being clever, I’m willing to pay a lot more than a dollar if it makes my lender think that the price of dollar-pegged stablecoins are now worth two dollars each.       Adam: OK.       John: Step three: I take the stablecoins that should be worth a dollar, but which look like they’re worth two dollars now because I’ve been pushing up Bob’s price, to take another flash loan where the lender thinks he’s being paid back in full, but is actually accepting just half of what I owe him since he thinks the money I’m paying him with, the not-so-stable-coin, is only temporarily worth $2.       Adam: So by pushing up the price of the stablecoin temporarily to double its value and then paying back the loan with it, you only need to pay back half of what you owe.       John: That’s right, and all of this happens basically instantly. While that’s not the whole story, I think at this point you can see how this attack not only worked but was pretty wildly profitable for whoever pulled it off.       Adam: So is DeFi dead?       John: No, of course not. This is a new technology, but more than that it’s a whole new way to think about finance, who gets it, who gives it and what you can do with it.       Adam: Nobody knew an attack like this was possible because until last week it’d never happened.       John: Yeah, and it’s important to mention that while this attack basically stole money from a flash loan provider, there was nothing about the flash loan that really failed. DeFi in general, at least for now, is sort of a Rube Goldberg machine with unrelated projects strung together to make things work. The Kyber Network, or Bob as we’ve been calling him, isn’t really related to the flash loan project at all, but he was who the flash loan people thought would be the most reliable way for them to keep track of different token prices.      Adam: So were they wrong?       John: At least for now, getting accurate pricing information like you’d need to do flash loans is really difficult. That’s probably a temporary problem, but for now as we see here it’s a big one.       Adam: What I’m hearing is now is an excellent time to take out a flash loan and stuff some money in Bob’s pocket, for great profit?       John: Probably not. Usually attacks like this only work once because now that we understand it’s possible, it’s a lot easier to protect against it. But it’s not to say this stuff is safe yet, we just don’t know what the next attack could look like until someone pulls it off.       Adam: Well, John, I guess we’re sticking to our day jobs then.       John: At least for now *echoey evil genius laughter*       Adam: You’ve been listening to CoinDesk Explains: Flash Loan Attacks, we’d love to hear what you think - Send an email to podcasts@coindesk.com to lavish us with praise, complain about our inaccuracies...        John: ...or offer us boatloads of sweet, sweet money, which we’ll use to bribe Bob before paying you back instantly. We’re definitely good for it.       Adam: See you next time!

42383319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v9Ov,1582132867,Financial Services: The Coming Cataclysm,"Alex Tapscott is a venture capital investor, co-author (with Don Tapscott) of ""Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies is Changing the World"" and co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute in Toronto. The following excerpt, written by Alex Tapscott, is from his new book ""Financial Services Revolution.""      Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrencies should surprise no student of technology. After all, the digital revolution has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, except banking. Financial intermediaries depend more or less on pre-internet technologies. Libra is simply the latest innovation to punch holes in the old model, establishing the battle lines for the future of our digital economy.      The stakes are high: The next era of commerce, economic activity and money is uncertain. Computer scientists are rewiring the economic power grid, and software engineers are re-coding the order of human affairs, exposing our lack of understanding of fundamental concepts like privacy, free speech and the role of large corporations in our lives. As the digital landlords of this new economy – Facebook, Google and others – challenge the supremacy of big banks, decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) force us to confront our understanding of money, value, and the fortress of regulations erected around these concepts, originally to protect those who used the system, and now to preserve the status quo. This is ultimately a struggle for control, as many parties – totalitarian governments in China and elsewhere, legacy financial institutions, big social media companies and other digital conglomerates, technology upstarts and other stakeholders – vie for even greater influence.      Human beings have become increasingly comfortable with software and technology replacing human actors in many industries and many facets of daily life. Finance is the largest, most consequential and thus far most immovable industry of them all. The legacy banking system, digital conglomerates like Facebook, free and open cryptocurrency platforms such as bitcoin and, of course, governments are heading inexorably for a collision of historic proportions. The crash will be cataclysmic. Prepare for impact.    Crypto assets and open finance    “They say that software is eating the world. Soon, tokens will be eating the world,” said Tyler Winklevoss. He’s right. Blockchain is the first native digital for value: We can use it to program virtually every asset under the sun. In the latest edition of ""Blockchain Revolution,"" we provided a taxonomy of these assets to help the reader understand their many differences. They were cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, Zcash, litecoin), platform tokens (ether, ATOMs, EOS), utility tokens (Augur’s REP), securities tokens (theDAO, Munchee’s MUN, Vocean’s crypto bond), natural asset tokens (carbon, water, air), crypto collectibles, stablecoins, and crypto fiat currencies (the Petro, China’s forthcoming crypto yuan).      In this section, we are going to focus on digitization of existing financial assets in the form of securities tokens and fiat-backed stablecoins. This is the world of open finance, which differs from decentralized finance, which we discuss later. Open finance refers to the opening of traditionally closed, analog and proprietary systems to blockchain and digital assets. Open finance will prove to be an opportunity and challenge for incumbents, regulators and market actors everywhere.      Consider equities. The global “stock market” is really a loosely knitted patchwork of local and regional exchanges, banks, broker dealers, custodians, clearinghouses, regulators, asset managers, fund administrators and other market participants and intermediaries. Though order books and market making are largely digitized, the underlying function of how these different parties actually clear, settle, custody and register ownership of assets is antiquated.      Blythe Masters, former managing director of J.P. Morgan, the investment bank, and former CEO of Digital Asset, told us:    Bear in mind that financial infrastructures have not evolved in decades. The front end has evolved but not the back end. It’s been an arms race in technology investment oriented toward speeding up transaction execution so that, nowadays, competitive advantages are measured in nanoseconds.    She was referring to high-frequency trading: “The irony is that post-trade infrastructure hasn’t really evolved at all.” Blockchain holds the potential to reduce radically the cost, complexity and friction in markets by allowing market participants to connect, clear and settle peer to peer instantaneously.      0x, an open protocol that enables P2P exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain, is a pioneer in this regard. Though not all the assets traded on this exchange are financial, some are. So far, 0x has conducted over 713,000 transactions worth $750 million [as of 9/2019]. As underlying platforms like Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, EOS,and others scale, so, too, will the capacity of the applications and financial business use cases that employ them. tZERO, a subsidiary of publicly traded Overstock, has made great strides in this area as well. In the summer of 2019, Overstock announced that shareholders of the publicly traded company would receive dividends as a digital token listed on tZERO. Patrick Byrne, former CEO of Overstock, said of the move, “Five years ago, we set out to create a parallel universe: a legal, blockchain-based capital market. We’ve succeeded.” Byrne has reasons to be optimistic that this parallel universe of digital assets will create challenges and opportunities for new entrants and incumbents alike.      Securities tokens not only reduce friction, cost, and complexity. They also enable broader participation in capital markets, because they lower barriers and they allow us to imagine building liquid marketplaces for a wide variety of assets, from real estate to private equity and venture capital (VC). Greater transparency, market depth, and liquidity should improve price, access, and the overall healthy functioning of markets.      Not all assets will work as tokens. But we see tokenization working when several conditions are satisfied:      1. Is there an established or untapped demand for an asset?      2. Do people or institutions want to buy the asset but can’t currently?      3. Are there high barriers to transferability or liquidity in an asset?      4. Are transaction costs high, spread too wide or are other barriers so prohibitive that market participants choose to avoid the asset class altogether?      5. Is blockchain required to digitize the asset — that is, the asset simply isn’t workable in a traditional system?      6. Is the industry highly consolidated or highly fragmented?      If the answer is yes to a majority of these questions, then the asset is a likely candidate for securities tokens, and a highly fragmented market should make experimentation or innovation easier. Tokenized equity, debt and real estate already exist. We may eventually see tokenized sports teams, music catalogues, wine portfolios, fine art and event tickets, to name a few. Securities tokens may help improve access to wealth creation for average people by lowering barriers to entry and expanding investment options.      This opportunity is not without challenges: it lacks technology, business, market and regulatory infrastructure. Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, believes that securities regulators “took the idea of the rich get richer and … wrote it into law. They took the best performing assets with the best returns and put them behind a firewall.” He was referring to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, which limited many investment opportunities to high-net-worth individuals. He called it a “violation of the American dream.” If these kinds of investment opportunities remain limited to the richest of the rich, then we haven’t really democratized the benefits of blockchain-based financial innovation.    The lines defining “financial services” will begin to blur as everything becomes an asset and everyone becomes a market participant.    Consider Props. Props is a native digital token created by the popular video application YouNow, though it can work inside any application. YouNow was granted special authorization by the SEC to do a Regulation A offering of its token, approved in July, and already launched. Think of Props as stock options for the gig economy, for people like Uber drivers, homeowners who let their houses on Airbnb, or content creators. On YouNow, these people can earn money by sharing something on the platform. Otherwise, they can’t participate directly in the value creation from the growth of currently popular platforms such as Uber or Airbnb. Similarly, Uber drivers may get paid for completing a ride, but they don’t get a piece of the $75 billion that Uber is worth. The so-called “sharing economy” is really an “aggregation economy,” where powerful platforms capture most of the value, and contributors get the crumbs.      With Props, contributors to platforms like YouNow, and soon perhaps Uber, Airbnb and others, can get paid for their contributions and earn Props tokens. The supply of Props is finite and grows at a predictable rate, and so the more apps using the native token, and the more people earning and holding them, the higher the value of Props. Any application can plug into the Props application programming interface (API) and allow contributors to start earning real value in Props. Founders and investors will no longer be the sole beneficiaries of platform growth. In the context of financial services, we can view Props both as a new payment rail for organizing contributors in a network and as an incentive mechanism, like equity, for staying on the platform and adding value to it. Already, 200,000 people are using Props on YouNow with 100,000 Props transactions per day. The plan is to add more apps as time goes on. As Props becomes ubiquitous, other applications may be compelled to offer it to contributors—and, voilà, a new digital economy is born.      This new cornucopia of digital tokens will need common standards, with groups like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) helping to lead the charge. Marley Gray of Microsoft, who is a key contributor to the EEA’s Token Alliance, told us that common standards “remove the obstacles for defining assets. Blockchain should be just like using the payments network today. People should just use it.” He added, “You don’t need to understand the blockchain to use tokens. Let’s get to the point where we are actually driving business value. Let’s abstract this, make it common. Commoditizing tokens so any industry or company can create them.”      If different assets exist inside of silos that don’t speak to one another, then tokenization will have limited impact. Only through common standards and interoperability can tokenization reach its full potential. Fiat-backed stablecoins, such as Tether, USDC, and Libra are other examples of open finance. Not all stablecoins are backed dollar for dollar by reserves; and some, such as DAI created by MakerDao, exist entirely in the crypto asset world. Already, stablecoins have exploded in value, and for good reason. They offer an easy way to move value peer to peer instantaneously at a fraction of the cost of traditional payment systems like Venmo. Consider the findings of TradeBlock, a provider of digital currency trading tools for institutional investors:      [T]he aggregate total on-chain transfer volume across the largest stablecoins has now surpassed Venmo’s total payment volume. … [F]ees associated with sending stablecoins across the Ethereum network were dwarfed by merchant fees and fees from associated Venmo services. Across the five largest ERC-20 tokens, customers spent just $827,000 in Ethereum network fees to transfer more than $37 billion. Over this same period, fees and fees on associated services paid to Venmo are expected to reach $150 million.      Given this explosive growth, Facebook, Walmart and JPMorgan – and perhaps Google and Amazon – are including stablecoins in their growth plans.      Cameron Winkelvoss said, “We are going to see many companies issuing coins,” adding that “a company like Facebook with its size and stature is very encouraging in validating the general idea of better and new payment rails powered by crypto. Whether it’s Libra or not [that succeeds], time will tell.” Consider Amazon: “You can pretty much get a package anywhere in the world. What you can’t do is get paid for that product. Amazon Coin could create the ability to extend the payment system to the edges of the earth.” No doubt, Libra is but the opening volley in this new competition among the world’s tech behemoths.      Pompliano believes Libra is a positive development but that it is also good for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He said, “It’s the token density theory. If you set up a restaurant across the street from another restaurant, traffic at both restaurants typically goes up. Everyone’s foot traffic increases as you add density. So with each legitimate crypto that gets created and gets added it increases the overall value proposition of bitcoin.” Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, summed it up simply by saying Libra will act as a “lead blocker” for other crypto assets.      Not everyone is so optimistic about corporate coins. “I’m not afraid of nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks. The only thing I’m afraid of is Facebook’s cryptocurrency,” said Ethan Buchman, co-creator of Cosmos. “Facebook perfected digital colonialism. While the early colonialist companies enslaved bodies, Facebook enslaves minds. This will be [its] historical legacy.” With Facebook settling with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for $5 billion and with the SEC for $100 million while getting grilled by lawmakers, its road to launch Libra will be a hard one, and Facebook’s leaders will need to earn back the trust of those they let down. That’s a daunting challenge.      Still, the technology has its own momentum, which makes it unlikely at this point to be derailed. Financial markets – from stocks to bonds and everything in between – will be unrecognizable. Incumbents that bet big on blockchain will survive this coming revolution.    Financialization and digitization of everything    If land was the most important asset of the agrarian age, and oil was the most important asset of the industrial age, then data is the most important asset of the digital age. Information is the foundation of our digital economy and the lifeblood of some of the world’s largest and most profitable companies, such as Facebook and Google. Consider the reordering of the world’s most valuable companies over the last 20 years (see below). In this period, data has replaced oil as the main driver of business value in the world, and information behemoths have displaced the industrial giants.      We create all this data, yet we don’t own it – the digital landlords do. This is problematic because it means we can’t use that data to better organize our lives, we can’t monetize it, and it can fall into the wrong hands.      Information is one example of an asset that has had no open, transparent marketplace where stakeholders can discover price or exchange its value. This is part of a much broader problem that the digital age has exacerbated. Many assets have been outside market forces and susceptible to overuse or capture by large intermediaries. Like water, air or the oceans, powerful companies exploit the data and, in turn, the people who created it.      In a major research report for the Blockchain Research Institute, technology theorist [and CoinDesk's very own] Michael Casey suggested that tokenization and digital scarcity brought about by crypto assets represents a solution:    Blockchain technology, and the cryptocurrencies, tokens and other digital assets that it has engendered, may be moving us toward a model of programmable money that incorporates an automated internal governance of common resources and encourages collaboration among communities. Digital scarcity, when applied to these tokens treats our increasingly digitized world differently from the pre-digital one. It raises the possibility that our money may itself become the tool for achieving common outcomes.  Developers of new decentralized applications are tokenizing all manner of resources – electricity and bandwidth for example, but also human qualities such as audience attention for online content or fact checkers honestly. … Once a community associates scarce tokens with rights to these resources, it can develop controls over token usage that help manage public goods. It’s dynamic money whose role extends beyond that of a unit of exchange, money that’s a direct tool for achieving community objectives.    In his report, Casey lays out a new taxonomy for these tokens and suggests at least five different types: media, identity, honesty, decentralized computing and the environment.      The potential is very significant for these tokens to enable new economies around assets that were either previously in the commons (such as the environment) or captured asymmetrically (such as our identities) by a few large technology intermediaries. Moreover, we can tokenize everything of value to ensure creators receive fair compensation. Now, individuals can capture the value from the data they produce in their online selves, choosing to keep it private or provide informed consent for its use, making money in the process. Individual artists can receive fair payment for the music they create as their songs roam the Internet collecting royalties. People can enter agreements enforced by smart contracts and verified by oracles in prediction markets. These capabilities will no doubt spread from the trivial (sports betting) to more meaningful markets like derivatives markets.      The lines defining “financial services” will begin to blur as everything becomes an asset and everyone becomes a market participant.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alex Tapscott,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/19/financial-services-the-coming-cataclysm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9dc5172280d42b84a20c561729fa645b1112409-1200x738.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulator announced Wednesday that under the settlement Enigma will refund ""harmed investors"" using a claims process, register its tokens as securities with the SEC, file reports to the agency and pay a further $500,000 as a penalty. Enigma sold ENG tokens in 2017, which the SEC said are securities.      Engima did not qualify for an exemption from securities registration requirements, according to the SEC.      According to a blog post, Engima will set up the claims process in the near future.      In a statement sent to CoinDesk, Enigma CEO Guy Zyskind said the settlement ""is the culmination of an extended series of discussions with the SEC.""

Announced Tuesday alongside JSE’s launch of a tokenized Initial Public Offering (IPO) platform, Blockstation’s new tool, called the Smart Listing Accelerator Process (SLAP), is designed to streamline the filing of required regulatory disclosures and prospectuses, said CTO and co-founder Jai Waterman.      Waterman said SLAP “lowers the barrier to entry” for companies that want security token offerings (STOs) but do not know how to sift through the corresponding paperwork.      The companies may not realize how many disclosure requirements the JSE – and its regulator, the Financial Services Commission – have to inform the public about an investment’s risks.      “Full disclosure needs to be there in order to make sure that these investors know what they’re getting in to, and that they’re protected,” said Waterman.      Every potential risk has to be laid out in the company’s prospectus. SLAP helps companies do so with a veritable “library” of business risk factors – far more than any one capital-seeking company could guess to include, according to Waterman.      “There’s hundreds of risks that people are not necessarily thinking of,” he said. “When you see that huge library, you're like, ‘oh you know what, that kind of applies to us.’ So you can take that concept and make it specific to your business.”      Building out their filings on SLAP, companies can tailor their prospectus and have a lawyer review the result. Once the filings are finished the companies can submit directly to JSE and FSC.      Four companies have already begun the regulatory filing process with SLAP, Waterman said.      The new service is the latest advancement in JSE and Blockstation’s digital asset partnership.

Content-sharing platform Contents Protocol announced Wednesday that following numerous attempts to turn its business into a success, the firm is closing down and refunding investors as much as $7.5 million-worth of the ether (ETH) raised in its initial coin offering (ICO).      ""We inform you that due to continued regulatory uncertainties in cryptocurrency and lack of business prospects, we have decided to end our project,"" reads an announcement that has replaced Contents Protocol's website.      Contents Protocol was a relative latecomer to the ICO boom, only completing its crowd sale in December 2018. It was created as a subsidiary of WATCHA Play, a popular Korean streaming service, and was designed to incentivize content sharing by effectively rewarding users who rated and reviewed films and TV featured on the platform with its native CPT token.      ""The main thing that the blockchain allows us to do is ... compensate a new participant [users] who really provide free marketing for the content,"" said John Kim, Contents Protocol's global business developer, in an interview with Ran NeuNer for CNBC, back in May 2018.      The project aimed to become profitable by processing and analyzing sharing data, which could subsequently be sold back to content providers to inform them on which movies and TV series should be featured on their platforms.      But in Wednesday's announcement, Contents Protocol complained that few consumers wanted to use the platform because of the ""negative perception toward cryptocurrency, price volatility and complex user experience.""      The company said anti-crypto attitudes were unlikely to improve in the short term, and would impact how digital assets would be regulated in the future. Without a strong user base, it also made it difficult to encourage other content providers to provide data for the platform, limiting any possible insights that could be subsequently sold back to platforms.      Contents Protocol raised 29,333 ETH ($8.1 million) in its private and public ICOs in 2018. All remaining assets, worth approximately $7.5 million, have now been converted back into ether and will be distributed to investors who have requested refunds.      CPT token holders will also be able to exchange them at a rate of one token for $0.002 worth of ether. All CPT collected will be destroyed when the company enters the liquidation process, the company said.      According to Contents Protocol's asset records, around 3,800 ETH was exchanged into $1.45 million to fund business operations. Although some of the funds were converted into bitcoin (BTC), the vast majority of assets remained in ether throughout the company's lifetime.

She is also an investor in early stage startups with Slow Ventures.      Where are the users?      This is the big question facing the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology world. For some, it is the elephant in the room. For others, it is the tantalizing puzzle waiting to be solved. For everyone, it is a matter of survival.      A couple of years ago, I wrote a bit about how I conceive of the blockchain technology stack. The stack breaks down into three layers: products, platforms and protocols.    Products serve end users  Platforms serve product developers  Protocols serve platform & product developers    Products include assets like cryptocurrencies and tokens as well as the applications they enable, such as games and marketplaces. Platforms are developer environments and middleware layers that allow those assets and applications to be built and run. Protocols are the underlying networks and their associated rules.      I also wrote, a couple of years ago, about how demand, and therefore value, flows from end users, through products and eventually back to the platforms and protocols that underlie them. I called this dynamic “top-down demand.”      At the time that I wrote all of this, in the fall of 2017, at the peak of initial coin offering fever, I was imploring the market to pay closer attention to fundamentals. I hoped founders, developers and creators would pause in their quest for optimization for optimization’s sake (invariably building a better, faster, more secure ethereum) and instead think from first principles about who might actually want such a thing. I wished for the market to place greater focus on end users as opposed to chanting the old Steve Ballmer reprise: “Developers! Developers! Developers!”      I am writing about all of this now because I think, in a way, I was wrong. At a minimum, I think that as an industry we have overcorrected. Two years ago I would have told you the industry needed to focus on end consumers. Today I see this with more nuance.      Outside of the weird, wonderful world of cryptocurrency, startups tend to fall into one of a few categories when it comes to go-to-market strategy. They can be B2C (businesses selling directly to consumers), B2B (businesses selling to other businesses or enterprises), or they can be B2B2C. As you may have surmised, B2B2C businesses sell their products to other businesses that in turn pass the product on to their customers. Importantly, B2B2C companies are in the business of acquiring those end users.    We must not only build products people want but also build platforms developers need to get there.    OpenTable is a great example of this. OpenTable started out much as it exists today: a platform for restaurant-goers to make reservations. Quickly, however, the OpenTable team realized the restaurants did not have the pieces in place to enable this. The restaurants were still taking reservations over the phone and noting them down using pens and clipboards. So OpenTable built out a digital CRM and table management system, selling restaurants the infrastructure they needed to get online. Once they had a critical mass of restaurants on the platform, they could close the loop by once more providing a reservation-booking product to end consumers.      I think the blockchain industry can take some lessons from OpenTable. As I rethink the products, platforms and protocols framework, I see parallels to B2B2C businesses. What we need is not, as I advocated for at the time, a greater focus on end consumers. As I look around today, all I see in the cryptocurrency world are strong hypotheses about what end-consumers might want: open access to investment products, freely transferable gaming assets, immutable digital memory, certifiably-scarce digital goods. What is missing is the infrastructure that enables these products.      Users are generally the sign that product-market fit has been achieved. The challenge of the blockchain world lies not only in reaching product-market fit, but also in achieving protocol-market fit. For this, we must not only build products people want but also build platforms developers need to get there. It’s not all about the wants and needs of end users. It’s also about the wants and needs of the developers and dreamers who will get us there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/19/dont-obsess-over-crypto-end-users-we-still-need-developers-to-build-the-back-end,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96c48f3a344d61792862b758bd5e3ca4125e549f-1542x910.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v99p,1582113600,UK Crypto Exchange Coinfloor Launches ‘No BS’ Service for Bitcoin Beginners,"U.K-based crypto exchange Coinfloor, which made news last year by delisting ethereum to focus solely on bitcoin, is launching a simplified buying service.      Going live next month, Coinfloor, the longest-running crypto exchange in the U.K., is providing an “Auto Buy” service aimed at bitcoin (BTC) newbies and hodlers alike, as opposed to sophisticated trading types.      It’s all part of Coinfloor’s “no BS” approach to crypto, said CEO Obi Nwosu, who wants to educate new users as well as offer full transparency in the form of monthly proof-of-custody audits of all the coins held on the platform.      “There are maybe 5 percent of people who are either trading professionals or who like to speculate – for them high-volatility trading is fine. But we want to make the exchange for the other 95 percent who don't want their currency to be volatile. Our idea is to try and make buying bitcoins boring,” said Nwosu.      Coinfloor’s Auto Buy uses dollar-cost averaging so that users who might be queasy about bitcoin volatility can buy small amounts on a regular basis over the long term. These purchases once set up are done via bank transfer using the U.K.’s Faster Payments system.      Nwosu said it comes down to advising people to start with amounts as little as £10 (US$13) per week “buying bitcoin regularly in the background at an amount that’s very comfortable for them.”      “If you are going to do it, you are going to want to do it with an asset that has the longest track record of growth and the highest likelihood of growth in the future, and that’s bitcoin,” said Nwosu.      Coinfloor is proud of its bitcoin audit service, which the exchange has been releasing every month for some six years now. It consists of a time-stamped and transparent list of all the balances being held for pseudonymous customers.      A number of large crypto exchanges agreed to provide crypto solvency audits following the notorious collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, but none of them kept to it, Nwosu said.      Pointing to this week’s FCoin debacle, Nwosu asked why exchanges are not providing proof of custody.      FCoin ""was insolvent. Maybe for over a year.

42383310,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v9VD,1582110000,Bitcoin Bulls Back in the Driver's Seat as Price Crosses $10K,"View  Bitcoin jumped above back $10,000 on Tuesday, reinstating the bullish trend and opening the doors for further gains toward $10,500.  The bull case would strengthen with a descending channel breakout on the four-hour chart.  A strong rejection at the channel hurdle could yield a re-test of the former resistance-turned-support at $9,825.    Bitcoin (BTC) returned into the five-figure zone on Wednesday, reviving the bullish case and putting recent highs near $10,500 back on the radar.      At press time, bitcoin is trading at $10,139, representing a 4.48 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      However, the top cryptocurrency by market value was looking weak 24 hours ago, having breached the 2020 rising trendline support at $9,700. The subsequent sell-off, however, ran into bids near $9,600, following which prices charted a near 90-degree rise to $10,290 during the U.S. trading session.      Tuesday’s spike marked an end of the pullback from recent highs near $10,500 and validated the positive shift in the long-term sentiment highlighted by the golden crossover – the bull cross of the 50- and 200-day averages.      As a result, bigger gains could be in the offing in the short term, more so as the price of gold, a classic safe haven asset, is again rising.      The yellow metal jumped 1.32 percent on Tuesday – its biggest single-day gain since Jan. 3 – on haven demand amid losses in the U.S. stock markets. Investors shunned risk after Apple warned it does not expect to meet its March quarter revenue guidance due to the coronavirus outbreak's effect on suppliers in China.      Bitcoin has increasingly moved in tandem with gold so far this year. Its one-month correlation with gold strengthened to 0.70 in January from December’s -0.12, according to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken’s January volatility report.      Gold is currently trading above $1,600 per ounce and appears on track to test the six-year high of $1,611 reached on Jan. 8.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped 5 percent on Tuesday, keeping the 2020 rising trendline support intact and confirming another bullish higher low at $9,467 (Feb. 17 low) – a sign of continuation of the rally from January lows near $6,850.      Additionally, prices closed well above $10,050 – the high of Sunday’s “doji” candle – confirming a bullish breakout from a period of indecisive price action.      With the bulls back in the driver’s seat, a re-test of the recent high of $10,500 looks likely.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin is still trading in an expanding descending channel on the four-hour chart. A breakout looks likely as the relative strength index has already violated the descending trendline and is pointing north.    Bearish scenario    If the cryptocurrency again finds acceptance under $10,000, prices may revisit the former hurdle-turned-support of $9,825 (marked by arrow) on the hourly chart (above left).      A violation there would shift the focus to the neckline support of the potential head-and-shoulders pattern on the four-hour line chart. At press time, the key support is located at 9,584. A break lower could discourage buyers, leading to a deeper slide toward $9,000.

42383311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v9QB,1582106400,Policymakers Shouldn't Fear Digital Money: So Far It's Maintaining the Dollar's Status,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      On May 9, 2019, Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), member of the House Financial Services Committee, made an impassioned speech about cryptocurrency. In his speech, the mask typically worn by policymakers slipped: his words betrayed the threat cryptocurrencies pose to the state.      Sherman said:    An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance and transactions. Clearing through the N.Y. Fed is critical for major oil and other transactions, and it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us, to put us in a position where the most significant sanctions we have on Iran, for example, would become irrelevant.    But does cryptocurrency really pose a threat to America’s monetary dominance? I’d like to propose an alternative. Far from compromising the dollar’s mighty advantage internationally, cryptocurrency, and the infrastructure built to support it, may well entrench its position. To assess this possibility, one must understand cases where the dollar has already infiltrated foreign countries. This is commonly called ""dollarization.""      Dollarization refers to the process of adopting a foreign currency (typically but, confusingly, not always, the U.S. dollar) in lieu of a local sovereign currency. It happens both in an informal, bottom-up way and a top-down manner, when the local central bank capitulates and adopts the dollar as legal tender. The bottom-up model occurs in a spontaneous manner as citizens flee a depreciating local currency and adopt the dollar, even when dollar holdings might be criminalized or where capital controls exist. In some cases, this kicks off a feedback loop, further depreciating the local currency and forcing the hand of the central bank which capitulates and officially adopts the dollar standard. The monetary economist Lawrence White calls this dolarización popular.      The Ecuador dollarization phenomenon in 1999-2000 is a prime example of individuals freely making economic choices that overpowered their local government monopoly.      In White’s words:    The dollarization of Ecuador was not chosen by policymakers. It was chosen by the people. It grew from free choices people made between dollars and sucres. The people preferred a relatively sound money to a clearly unsound money. By their actions to dollarize themselves, they dislodged the rapidly depreciating sucre and spontaneously established a de facto U.S. dollar standard.    Currently, several countries have entirely abandoned monetary discretion and outsourced this task to the U.S. The largest among these, the so-called fully dollarized states, include Ecuador, Panama, El Salvador, the British Virgin Islands and a smattering of other mostly island nations. However, many countries are also soft-dollarized; that is, dollars widely circulate in the economy as a preferred form of hard money. Soft dollarized countries may have a soft or crawling peg relative to the dollar or may not treat it as legal tender at all; regardless it has widespread usage due to its desirable properties. Countries in this category include Venezuela, Argentina, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Somalia, Uruguay, Zimbabwe and many others.      In these countries, dollars are understood as a superior form of money and active measures are made to import and retain them. Indeed, visitors to Costa Rica will know that it’s common to pay for goods on the street with dollars and receive change in the local currency, the colón. This is essentially the inverse of Gresham’s law. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Thiers’ law – the idea that, when given the choice, transactors will generally prefer to receive a harder rather than a softer currency.      Dollarization events generally follow specific catalysts: In Ecuador, users adopted the dollar in response to the devaluation of the sucre following a banking crisis, and the government ultimately capitulated. Cambodia’s effective dollar economy was kick-started by the flow of capital into the country after the U.N. intervened in 1992 following the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, virtually the entirety of eastern Europe, the Baltics, the Caucasuses and central Asia dollarized in a partial way, with the dollar penetrating 20 to 30 percent of the money supply in these regions in 1993, and growing to the 30 to 40 percent range in 2001 (Havrylyshyn 2003). In the wake of political and monetary collapse in Venezuela, the country is now at least 50 percent dollarized. Panama officially dollarized in 1904 when it seceded from Colombia and the U.S. began its decade-long canal building project in the country. Generally, ready access to dollars and a trade relationship with the U.S. is a necessary condition for successful dollarization, which explains why so many dollarized countries are in Latin America or states with current or prior U.S. influence.      Opinions differ on the track record of dollarization. Free market economists tend to like it and the International Monetary Fund and Bank for International Settlements tend not to. Key data points show its success as a policy, however. The Misery Index, popularized by economist Steve Hanke, combines interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and GDP growth rates to derive a unified economic quality of life score. Venezuela and Argentina top the global misery index thanks to ruinous inflation (Venezuela has held that ignominious title for four straight years); Brazil is fourth worldwide. Their local neighbors Panama, Ecuador and El Salvador (all dollarized) rank best – i.e., least miserable – for Latin America, and fall in the middle of the pack globally.      There is good evidence that abandoning an inflationary currency and establishing a dollar standard tends to index local inflation to the (generally low) U.S. rate, increase foreign domestic investment (thanks to an elimination of exchange risk) and increase local lending and financial sector activity. Hanke describes dollarization as a means to import property rights and rule of law from better-governed countries (with the implication that devaluation is an unfair confiscation from savers). Perhaps most importantly, it entirely eliminates monetary discretion from the hands of the government, forcing them to rely solely on fiscal policy. Irresponsible monetary policy and reckless spending is normally the reason countries are forced to dollarize, after all. This monetary straitjacket is part of the reason governments often rebel against the policy, only adopting it in dire circumstances.      Today, the dollar accounts for about 60 percent of foreign exchange reserves globally and denominates about 70 percent of international trade, even in cases where neither counterparty is U.S.-based. Money doesn’t just possess network effects, money is a network. Dollarizing tends to reduce frictions in international trade as transactions no longer require a forex component. Despite its apparent benefits, however, dollarization is no panacea. Through the banking system, the state still ultimately exerts control over depositors.      Zimbabwe is an indicative case study. In response to hyperinflation, the government officially dollarized in January 2009 – but following this decision, U.S. dollars became virtually absent from the transactional economy. The reason? According to American Institute for Economic Research, the Zimbabwe government essentially confiscated dollars in bank accounts by forcing commercial banks to swap dollar deposits for “Zimbabwe bonds.” After ATMs and banks stopped dispensing cash, a mismatch between these electronic pseudo-dollars and the value of physical dollar banknotes developed. These unbacked bond-dollars ended up trading at a discount to par.    ""For people working in the formal economy – accountants, retail workers, engineers and so on – everyone now uses electronic dollars, which are simply represented by numbers in a bank account. These electronic dollars are worth about half what a U.S. dollar is worth on the street, according to local observers.""American Institute for Economic Research    Argentina’s pseudo-dollarization in the early 1990s is another telling example. As Steve Hanke documents, Argentina’s pledge to peg the peso to the dollar ended up being a ploy to confiscate deposits from savers:      ""Under the convertibility system, which was established on April 1, 1991, the government made an explicit redemption pledge. Each person who owned an Argentine peso was guaranteed the right to convert a peso for a U.S. dollar. […] When the Convertibility Law was revoked by decree on January 6, 2002, the peso was devalued, the peso was allowed to float and the redemption pledge was rendered null and void. In consequence, the government confiscated $17.8 billion of central bank reserves that had been the property of people who held pesos at the time of the devaluation.""    Enter stablecoins    So historically, the potential for confiscation of dollar deposits in the banking system by capricious governments has interfered with dollarization. Since holding cash is risky and difficult, depositors rely on banks. But if banks are a confiscation vector, merely dollarizing doesn’t do savers any good. Interestingly, the crypto world may well offer a solution in the form of cryptographic, dollar-denominated bearer assets.      These are commonly referred to as “stablecoins”: crypto-assets serving as an IOU representing a dollar in a bank account (with a convertibility promise). They freely circulate on public ledgers and are generally unconstrained. They can be sent without restriction to a digital wallet in just the same manner as bitcoin (BTC). And importantly, stablecoins represent a base monetary asset which can be directly held by an end user, rather than a financial institution on their behalf.      The insurgent crop of stablecoins represent a possible vector for a crypto-dollarization phenomenon. Piggybacking on the infrastructure built to support public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum – and circulating on those protocols themselves – stablecoins have achieved apparent critical mass. According to Coin Metrics, the largest stablecoin, Tether, has a monetary base of $4.5 billion and an annualized on-chain transaction volume of around $200 billion. That’s a monetary velocity of about 44 – meaning each unit of Tether changes hands, on average, 44 times in a given year. This compares to velocity figures of about five for bitcoin, 6.2 for ethereum, and 5.5 for M1 Money Stock in the U.S. While this is a rough science, it’s quite apparent that stablecoins are used in a transactional manner while their non-fiat-denominated cryptocurrency counterparts turn over less frequently.    Far from compromising the dollar’s mighty advantage internationally, cryptocurrency, and the infrastructure built to support it, may well entrench its position.    The growth of bitcoin, and subsequently other monetary protocols like ethereum, has also funded, as a side effect, a global industry of exchanges, hardware and software wallets, and financial services, which stablecoins are now leveraging to reach a mass market audience. New keyless setups mean that users no longer need to write down a 24-word seed phrase or a private key, they can simply control their wealth with biometrics and a smartphone. The emergence of hundreds of local exchanges and ""fiat on ramps"" means crypto assets are ubiquitously available, even in frontier markets. And the budding crypto-financial ecosystem gives users a reason to transact with and hold these assets.      Now, stablecoins rely for the most part on trusted issuers and administrators who must hold dollars in a bank account somewhere. This counterparty risk accompanies all of the dollar-backed coins, and may ultimately be their undoing. But these are private banks, generally outside the jurisdiction of states that may object to their issuance of private money. Regulators may also realize, to their horror, that the interior of the stablecoin transactional graph is mostly un-surveilled, as JP Koning has pointed out. Issuers appear to be following an informal don’t ask (users), don’t tell (regulators) policy. This could prove unsustainable.      However, newer issuers like Libra, should they pass through the regulatory gauntlet, offer a potentially more salubrious, mostly dollar-backed product. Regardless, the crop of dollar-backed coins is growing at a hefty clip. The implications for U.S. policymakers should be clear. Far from compromising the dollar’s mighty advantage internationally, cryptocurrency, and the infrastructure built to support it, will most likely entrench its position.      Clearly, individuals living with inflationary currencies have a demonstrated demand for (relatively) hard money, and a hodgepodge of private issuers have begun to fill this need by creating crypto-eurodollars. Instead of fearing this, policymakers would do well to evaluate this phenomenon and its potential implications for U.S. soft power.      Why am I writing this now? Two reasons. First, I was startled to discover that LocalBitcoins traders in Venezuela were using bitcoin not simply as a means of mere exposure to BTC, but also as a passthrough currency in order to more easily import dollars into the country.      Second, stablecoin transactional volumes have taken off, to the point where they have eclipsed every cryptocurrency aside from bitcoin in on-chain transactional value. It may well be the case that the crypto industry’s most impactful contribution in the near term is to near-frictionlessly distribute dollars on a direct-to-consumer basis to the world’s population – whether their governments like it or not.

42383306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v9Jt,1582102800,Bitcoin Coders Confront an Old Quandary: How to Upgrade an Entire Network,"An old debate is resurfacing in the bitcoin developer community, underscoring one of the critical challenges facing decentralized systems: how to update the software when ostensibly no one's in charge.      The catalyst this time is called Taproot/Schnorr, a years-in-the-making privacy and scaling upgrade that's seen exciting progress recently, especially now that the code in the form of a ""pull request"" is being reviewed and tested, bringing a change first discussed years ago closer to reality.      The code change itself isn't controversial among developers so far. What is up for discussion is the best way to activate the change, making it finally possible to send bitcoin (BTC) transactions in this new way.      At the heart of why there's a question about this at all is that bitcoin has no leader and is distributed across the globe. How does the whole network smoothly upgrade in a way that's backward-compatible, allowing those with older versions of the software to continue participating? What's the best way for bitcoin to make this type of change without disruption?      To be clear: bitcoin's code is updated almost every day by the open-source project's global web of developers. But ""consensus"" code changes, which strike at a deeper part of bitcoin, require a ""soft fork,"" which in turn requires a certain amount of coordination to go through smoothly.      ""There are a series of soft-fork designs which have recently been making good progress towards implementation and future adoption. However, for various reasons, activation methods ... have gotten limited discussion,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo wrote in an email to the bitcoin developers' list last month that reopened the debate.      There are two main options for enacting a soft fork. One option, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9, has been used for a few soft forks in the past. It ensures the miners are prepared in advance of a soft fork, to make sure a change smoothly ripples throughout the network. A common objection to this approach is that it gives miners too much power.      Alternatively, there's BIP 8, also known as the user-activated soft fork (UASF), which activates regardless of whether miners signal they are ready or not. Depending on execution, this approach could cause other problems, Corallo cautioned.    History lesson    The discussion started in 2017, when BIP 9 was used to activate Segregated Witness, or SegWit, a change integral to bitcoin's great scaling debate. To protect miners from mining invalid blocks and losing money, SegWit would not activate until 95 percent of miners raised a flag showing they were ready.      The majority of mining pools (groups of miners who combine their computational power on the network) declared they would not back SegWit – essentially vetoing it – unless it was paired with an increase in the block size parameter. (Bitcoin's mysterious creator had set the ceiling at 1 megabyte, limiting the number of transactions that could be stuffed into blocks, which are published every 10 minutes or so.)      This was a controversial demand that many believed could lead to the centralization of the network (and couldn't be executed successfully unless bitcoin were centralized, anyway).      Long story short, the incident showed mining pools could use the 95 percent threshold to extract other changes instead of the intended purpose: to help them ease into the change so they wouldn't lose money.      Many bitcoiners did not like this, seeing it as miners trying to use their power to push through a change not all users wanted.      As this debate raged on, a mysterious developer going by the handle Shaolinfry pointed out that bitcoiners could still make the upgrade. The root of the idea is that bitcoin users and exchanges should decide whether a change should go through, and miners would follow their desires – not the other way around. This method had been used to activate other bitcoin changes. Shaolinfy formalized this idea in BIP 8, otherwise known as a UASF.      A large swath of users loudly declared support for the SegWit UASF on social media and began running the software. This seemed to have the desired effect. Before the day the UASF would activate, miners started flagging support for SegWit.      Notably, there were a couple of flavors of UASF circulating during this tumultuous time, one more cautious (and more conservatively timed) and less controversial than the other. But without getting into the weeds, the takeaway for some bitcoin developers was that UASF was a better way to enact changes.      At the time, Rusty Russell, a developer at bitcoin startup Blockstream, went as far as to apologize for playing a part in constructing BIP 9.      ""I hadn’t expected that this checkpoint would be used as a chokepoint to ransom the network. This significantly changes the risk model; BIP-8 is now a far superior method for network upgrades, where miners can only accelerate the process, not block it,"" he wrote in a Medium post.    Long memories    Remembering all this drama, some developers are wary about using BIP 9 again for Schnorr/Taproot, or other future changes.      ""I think BIP 9 is a proven failure,"" said Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, responding to Corallo, going on to provide technical reasons for his objection. During the scaling debate, Dashjr was one of the most vociferous proponents of a UASF to push SegWit through.      Alex Bosworth, a developer at startup Lightning Labs, expressed a similar opinion, based partly on recent drama surrounding bitcoin cash (BCH), a smaller cryptocurrency that split off from bitcoin in 2017.      A sizable group of bitcoin cash mining pools recently proposed that some BCH from each new block should go to a development fund, which Bosworth sees as another example of mining pools flexing their muscles in a way that's bad for cryptocurrency decentralization.      ""I know that common thinking for soft fork deployment is to attempt the traditional friendly-miner method. But a good [one third] of our current hashrate has just organized into a cartel for the purposes of censorship to steal coin subsidy,"" tweeted Bosworth, who works on infrastructure for the speedy and scalable lightning network.      That's why he supports a UASF method, though one with a longer time horizon.      ""A slow-burn UASF feels most appropriate to me,"" he added.    Synthesis    But some, urging caution, worry that looking to UASFs as the sole activation method could open the possibility of pushing through changes that could hurt bitcoin.      For example, one reason developers initially liked BIP 9 is the 95 percent threshold could provide a sort of safety net. If a problem came to light while mining pools were working to upgrade their software, then pools could stop the change. It's tougher to stop a UASF activation once initiated.      That's why Corallo re-proposed an old idea, something of a mixture of BIP 8 and BIP 9. The soft fork would start with BIP 9. Then, if it failed over the course of a year due to ""unreasonable objections,"" users could debate and regroup over a period of six months. After that, if the change is definitely something the community wants, they can try BIP 8 over the period of another year.      Some developers might argue this time period is too long for a change with no ""unreasonable objections."" But Corallo urged patience.  Finding out whether the objections really are ""unreasonable"" could take some time. ""In the case that it does fail, BIP 9 process, in fact, provides a good learning opportunity as to the level of community readiness and desire for a given change,"" he said.      ""Developing bitcoin is not a race. If we have to, waiting 42 months ensures we're not setting a negative precedent that we'll come to regret as bitcoin continues to grow,"" he said. Readers can read Corallo's full reasoning as well as many of the nuanced responses from developers here.      And while Russell seemed quite against BIP 9 in 2017, he told CoinDesk he now agrees with this hybrid approach.      ""Since the miners' attempt to block changes didn't work, and we didn't suffer greatly from the delay, I don't mind BIP-9 activation,"" he said. But he proposed a shorter timeline than Corallo.      ""Perhaps the one-year BIP-9 timeout is too long, and a six-month expiry would be preferable. That way, users can organize a UASF if the BIP-9 activation fails and they feel it is due to miner obstructionism,"" Russell said.      Engineers are painstakingly reviewing the proposed Taproot/Schnorr code to fix any lingering problems. So there's still time for developers to discuss activation options. But the community will need to decide on something before the change can be added to bitcoin, building more privacy into the network.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/19/bitcoin-coders-confront-an-old-quandary-how-to-upgrade-an-entire-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7eba7e4fd832c0316823a086dabfc7ae948f539a-1200x804.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383293,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9v97J,1582092000,"Crypto Industry Lauds Token Safe Harbor, but Warns of Risks","The Takeaway:    SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wants to give token projects three years to adequately decentralize their networks before worrying about securities laws.  Industry participants believe some kind of so-called “safe harbor” is necessary, and praise Peirce’s proposal for providing a reasonable plan for creating one.  Questions remain, including how to define network maturity and what happens to tokens deemed immature under Peirce’s definition.  While Peirce’s proposal will not need an act of Congress to take effect, it will require other SEC commissioners to sign on, and it is unclear whether this proposal can become reality.    The dream of compliant, token-based fundraising in the U.S. received a lifeline from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce earlier this month. And though industry observers are generally supportive of the plan, they’re quick to highlight its potential flaws.      Peirce’s “safe harbor” proposal would give crypto entrepreneurs a three-year grace period to launch and decentralize their projects before having to address whether their circulating tokens qualify as securities under federal law. The proposal would have the added benefit of allowing a greater pool of investors to participate in a token sale, she said.      “My hope is I think the same hope that a lot of people in the space have, which is it gives people an opportunity to participate in the economy and society who have before now not been able to participate as fully as they’d like to,” Peirce told CoinDesk in a phone call. “I think it gives the opportunity to people to make decisions for themselves.”      The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the potential for more companies to create genuinely decentralized networks and others concerned it may allow scams to propagate unchecked for years under the guise of “good faith.” Others raised questions about the mechanics of defining network decentralization after the three-year period.      Under the proposed rule, dubbed Rule 195, developers would have to disclose their identities, holdings in the token they are working on, any founder’s rewards and a host of other information. They would have three years from the date of the first token sale to “decentralize” their networks, which Peirce defined as the point where no single entity could reasonably modify the network’s functionality. The proposed rule would only apply to new projects issuing tokens for the first time, and not to any existing projects or networks.      CoinDesk spoke to half a dozen industry lawyers and experts to examine the potential implications of the safe harbor proposal. Many agree a safe harbor is needed, though the specifics of Peirce’s proposal drew a wide range of responses.      Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at industry think-tank Coin Center, told CoinDesk the proposal seemed both sober and reasonable, though he noted it does remain only a proposal at the moment.      “For this to become official policy it would have to be bought into from the other commissioners and [SEC Chairman Jay Clayton], so we’d have to wait for that,” he said in a phone call.      Still, CoinList co-founder and President Andy Bromberg said he believed it was unlikely Peirce would have introduced the rule “if she thought it had no chance of moving through the commission.”    Path forward    Startups, attorneys and advocates in the space praised Peirce’s proposal, saying it gave new tokens an opportunity to build liquidity and give networks the time to mature without getting caught up in securities laws.      Bromberg told CoinDesk the proposal’s advocacy for putting tokens on exchanges was important.      “We actually want these to be traded on exchanges,” he said. “She was making a statement that a lot of people think were coming from a securities law perspective but it’s important for tokens to be trading.”      Furthermore, the proposal creates some clarity around the idea of what a decentralized network might look like, potentially codifying a definition SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman first suggested nearly two years ago.      The proposal “is trying to put some bright lines” around the idea of network maturity, which needs a safe harbor, said Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with ZeroLaw.      Projects meeting Peirce’s proposed definition essentially knock out one of the prongs of the Howey Test (the U.S. Supreme Court case usually used as a reference point to determine whether an instrument is a security meant to generate future returns for holders), said Amy Davine Kim, chief policy officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.      “What I really liked in this rule is the way they've defined network maturity, which is decentralization or a functional network,” she said. “As you know we’ve focused on the Hinman speech, which would be decentralization only and that focuses on one type of business model and may not be appropriate as the market matures.”      The disclosure regime in the proposal is similar to one existing public companies already abide by as well, Van Valkenburgh said. He cited Apple as an example, noting its investors and the general public trust the technology firm to accurately report earnings, shareholder meetings and disclose the financial or business history of its members.      And while the proposal will still need buy-in from the other SEC commissioners, the Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith noted that Peirce’s suggestions fit within existing securities law, meaning it would not need a congressional amendment to take effect.    Not foolproof    The proposal, as it stands, still leaves some questions unanswered, industry lawyers said.      Grant Gulovsen, of Gulovsen Law, told CoinDesk in an email that formal disclosures are “a step in the right direction” but many of the required disclosures already appeared in initial coin offering white papers in 2017.      “With just some minor tweaks I fear that under the terms of the current proposal U.S. investors would be subjected to the exact same series of abuses (and losses) suffered by the rest of the world during the last ICO run,” he said.      He proposed requiring projects to lay out a business plan mapping their road to profitability and preventing exchanges from “gaming the system to their own benefit.”      “If cryptocurrency exchanges were subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional exchanges, this would not be an issue,” he said. “But because they’re not, my fear is that they will see this safe harbor proposal as a means of further enriching themselves at the expense of U.S. token sale participants and the projects that list their tokens with these exchanges.”      Shapiro, who shared a written response to Peirce’s proposal last week, told CoinDesk that one aspect he struggles with is the idea that projects are essentially unregulated for three years, apart from regulations around fraud.      He said this part of the proposal may even be seen as “a technology-specific rewrite” of existing securities laws, as the token sale and subsequent transactions could still be securities transactions, they just would not be regulated as such.      Yankun Guo, an attorney with her own practice, echoed Shapiro's concerns, asking how a three-year exemption can be justified.      Whether the tokens are still essentially securities at the end of the three-year period is another issue: Peirce submitted a definition of what a decentralized network would look like but it remains unclear what might happen to any networks that do not meet this definition.      “Now you’ve had a bunch of things out there trading as non-securities and now they’re suddenly securities,” Shapiro said. “We shouldn’t rewrite the securities laws. I don’t think the government should be creating incentives for companies to raise money in a certain way via regulatory arbitrage.”      Shapiro recommended lowering compliance costs by reforming securities laws as an alternative solution for crypto projects, noting the high expense of filing documents and otherwise abiding by the law is one holdup for companies. (For example, Blockstack reported paying $2 million when filing to conduct a Regulation A+ token sale last year.)      This sort of reform should be addressed across the board, rather than just in one particular area, he said, a view Guo agreed with.      Defining what ""good faith and reasonable effort"" on the part of the initial development team is another area that needs clarity, Guo told CoinDesk, saying there must be checks and balances on these projects during the three-year period rather than no regulatory requirements.    Building liquidity    Crypto exchanges may also fall under tighter scrutiny under Peirce’s proposal, as part of Rule 195 touts the importance of secondary markets for these new tokens. At the least, these secondary markets would be responsible for potentially creating liquidity around new tokens.      “The problem with token sales in general is that there is a disconnect between whether an underlying project can be profitable and the value of its token on secondary exchanges,” Gulovsen said.      Catherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US, told CoinDesk that the exchange has its own “risk assessment framework” that evaluates whether a cryptocurrency has a use case and the team’s viability.      The exchange, a U.S. affiliate of Binance, currently lists bitcoin, ether, XRP, Qtum, Atom, Dash and 20 other cryptocurrencies.      If adopted, the proposal might help exchanges become more comfortable with listing new assets, Coley said, with the understanding that the developers behind those projects would be required to “maintain quality development,” and would not immediately be classified as securities.      “That gives more comfort to the hunger and appetite to the new coin being listed,” she said.      Whether a new token remains a security at the end of the three-year grace period is “a risk the marketplace is taking,” she said.      This risk does emphasize the importance of exchanges in the U.S. independently ensuring their comfort with tokens they list, she said.      “It’s not peer pressure, we really look through things from our own lens because at the end of the day it’s our risk to manage,” Coley said.      On the other hand, the proposal would allow exchanges to help new projects gain momentum as they get started, she said, and having a token “be blessed” would give marketplaces some comfort in the vetting process.      Gulovsen said adding a regulatory oversight component for exchanges may also help ensure the new secondary markets are not being gamed should also help investors be more comfortable.      One question the proposal does not address in its definition of network maturity is whether mining centralization factors in. A network could have a decentralized group of developers under the proposal but still have a small group of miners or nodes or stakeholders.      Kim said the network might still qualify as mature so long as it is functional, while Peirce said mining centralization is a problem, but not necessarily one that falls under securities law.    Next steps    To take effect, a majority of the SEC’s commissioners would have to vote in favor of implementing the safe harbor proposal. Peirce told CoinDesk that while her fellows are aware of her views on tokens and token projects, she has not yet gone to them directly with the proposal.      Rather, she hopes to gather public feedback and support first. Individuals can email her office or file a comment through FinHub, the SEC’s financial technology branch.      “The next step is to get people to rip it apart and tell me what I did right [or] tell me what I got wrong,” she said. “As much as I can get people interacting with each other as they think about it and then try to take that back to my colleagues and say, ‘I think there’s real interest,’ and that’s a way to get something on the agenda, send a positive message to the industry.”      There may be a time crunch, however. Coin Center’s Van Valkenburgh noted Peirce’s term expires this year, and SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson returned to private life last week.      Both Peirce and Clayton can both continue serving in their current roles for another 18 months, assuming successors aren’t nominated, and it is possible they will be re-nominated by Congress to continue serving. Van Valkenburgh said it is entirely possible the SEC will look different in a year.      Peirce declined to comment on whether she expected to be renominated for another term, though she did say, “I certainly don’t feel done with what I want to do at the SEC. I really don’t feel done. There’s lots of work still to be done.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/19/crypto-industry-lauds-token-safe-harbor-but-warns-of-risks,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
