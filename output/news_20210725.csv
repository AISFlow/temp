42434904,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLXh,1627246879,"Vitalik Buterin Joins Cast of ‘Stoner Cats,’ Mila Kunis’ New Animated NFT Show","“Stoner Cats,” an animated web series produced by actress Mila Kunis, already has an A-list Hollywood cast including Jane Fonda, Chris Rock and Ashton Kutcher.      But the blockchain-linked TV show is also adding some crypto star power: Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.      To watch the first five-minute episode, viewers must purchase a non-fungible token (NFT) that is both a digital artwork of a randomly selected character from the show as well as a ticket to unlock all ""Stoner Cats"" episodes as they are made. The NFTs will sell for 0.35 ETH – about $750 at time of publication.      According to Morgan Beller, a general partner at venture firm NFX and a member of the team behind “Stoner Cats,” the decision to use NFTs to fund the series arose out of concerns over censorship of the show’s drug content and a desire to keep creative control out of the hands of the networks.      “Stoner Cats” isn’t the first creative project to try crypto crowdfunding. Earlier this month, the documentary team behind “Ethereum: The Infinite Garden” raised over 1,000 ETH on Mirror, surpassing their goal in less than three days. Crowdfunding via NFT sales allows for a direct exchange between consumers and creators, cutting out middlemen and, in some cases, offering a bit of creative control to consumers themselves.    Vitalik in the spotlight    Buterin, who is also involved in the Ethereum documentary, will join the cast of “Stoner Cats” as the voice of Catsington, a taxidermied, monocle-sporting cat who gives advice to the five living cats belonging to Ms. Stoner, a spunky octogenarian with Alzheimer’s, whose magical strain of weed has somehow given her feline companions the ability to talk.      The quirky cameo for Ethereum's de facto leader comes as the network preps for a proof-of-stake overhaul meant to ready the world computer for mainstream usage. It also explains a recent tweet in which Buterin casually explains Ethereum in what appears to be the kitchen nook of Kunis and Kutcher's shared home.      Though the “Stoner Cats” script was written before Buterin joined the cast, Beller said he tweaked the role of Catsington to better fit his personality.    Read more: Vitalik Buterin Is Involved in a New Documentary About Ethereum    “He doesn’t like cursing and his character said ‘f**k’ a few times, so he asked if they could change that and they were accommodating,” Beller, who left Facebook in September 2020 after co-creating the Libra project, told CoinDesk.      The entire cast, including Buterin, will be paid in ether. He said Monday that 100% of his pay will be donated to the SENS Foundation, a non-profit research organization focused on finding cures for aging-related diseases.  “We had to teach Jane Fonda how to set up a MetaMask wallet,” Beller joked, adding:    “I know some other celebrity NFT projects have a centralized person who cashes out and pays everyone in dollars, which would have been a lot easier for everyone involved, but it just felt really wrong to do that. The technology is what is enabling us to do this, so to just drop it like it’s hot felt really wrong.”    Each cast member will be paid an equal amount, depending on the level of funding the project receives at its initial NFT launch. To finish the season, the “Stoner Cats” team needs to reach at least 50% of its 10,420 NFT funding goal.      But according to Beller, even if the project is fully funded at approximately $7.5 million, the cast would only be making about half of what they would make on an equivalent, traditionally funded project.  “Everyone’s really taking a bet on this,” Beller said, adding:    “We see this as an opportunity to educate people [about crypto] and bring them into the fold. I personally think a lot of crypto resources are daunting. I think we need people and faces and voices that non-crypto people recognize and trust to start explaining these concepts. Even if this fails, we can make that happen.”    UPDATE (July 26, 23:02 UTC): Adds information about Buterin donating his portion of any pay associated with the series.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/25/vitalik-buterin-joins-cast-of-stoner-cats-mila-kunis-new-animated-nft-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/282238fc0aed425bddfc7594ee05af72054c53bf-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLph,1627246800,Countdown to Ethereum’s ‘London’ Hard Fork: What You Need to Know,"In T-minus 10 days, the Ethereum blockchain will undergo its 11th backward-incompatible upgrade, also called a “hard fork.” This hard fork, dubbed “London,” contains five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), each featuring code changes aimed at optimizing and improving the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.      Of these five EIPs, EIP 1559 has been the most controversial among Ethereum stakeholders due to its radical redesign of the network’s fee market. Today’s Briefing features an edited excerpt from CoinDesk Research’s latest report, ""The Investment Implications of EIP 1559,"" that explains the risks and reward dynamics of this code change for investors.    This column originally appeared in Crypto Long & Short, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.  Rewards of EIP 1559    One of the most common arguments against ether as a store of value is its unbounded coin supply.      Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, has a prescribed and capped supply schedule that fuels an important part of its narrative with investors as ""digital gold.""      While EIP 1559 does not introduce a bitcoin-like supply cap on ETH, it does activate a mechanism to curb total supply growth over time by taking a variable amount of ETH out of circulation each time a transaction is executed.      Simulations of EIP 1559 as of June 8 suggest the activation of EIP 1559 over the trailing 365 days would have burned a total of 2,967,937 ETH for a net reduction of 76% in ether supply growth over that period.      In addition to creating a bitcoin-like narrative of limited supply to ETH, EIP 1559 is expected to improve transaction wait times and remove fee-market uncertainty that damp developer and user adoption of dapps.      Finally, EIP 1559 is expected to solidify ether’s role as a form of payment for using Ethereum’s computing resources and interacting with the network’s broad system of dapps by requiring payments of transaction fees on the network to be exclusively paid in the network’s native cryptocurrency.    Risks of EIP 1559    Any technology upgrade comes with risk, and the most salient risk posed by EIP 1559 comes with its proposed changes to reward dynamics and payouts to miners, who face reduced earnings for their work with the activation of EIP 1559. Instead of pocketing 100% of transaction fees, miners will only receive tips from users through an optional ""inclusion fee,"" paid electively by users seeking priority for their transactions.      Changing reward dynamics on its own won’t affect Ethereum’s ability to process blocks or computations. There is the potential, however, for disgruntled miners to leave the network, sabotage it or start a competing chain. If a large share of Ethereum miners exit or revolt, block times and network security would be negatively affected.      As for users and dapp developers, the benefits of EIP 1559 may not prove to be as efficient in practice as they are in theory. A failure to deliver promised fee-market efficiencies could result in user and developer disillusionment. If that occurs, Ethereum competitors such as Binance Smart Chain and Cardano, the two largest smart contract blockchain platforms by market capitalization after Ethereum at time of writing, will undoubtedly seize an opportunity to grab market share.      To gauge the subsequent rewards of EIP 1559 and its impact on users over the long term after activation, investors can view in real time the number of transactions styled in accordance to the EIP 1559 format as a way of tracking its usefulness in practice through privately maintained nodes or public block explorers.    Read more: CoinDesk Research's full report about EIP 1559.    Finally, the activation of EIP 1559 poses the risk of unforeseen bugs or malicious user behavior. A few have already been discovered during the process of testing EIP 1559 on public and private test networks.      At its core, EIP 1559 is designed to make transaction fees on Ethereum less volatile and more predictable. Beyond that, however, the code change poses several risks and potential rewards to Ethereum that will be important to watch for in August.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/25/countdown-to-ethereums-london-hard-fork-what-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e4c2b02505f59f117375b8e8ce7d7859cc22ba4-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a Twitter thread shown in an abridged fashion below, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said that while he disputes claims that high leverage is a major cause of volatility in the market and high leverage makes up only a small part of FTX's business, ""It's time, we think, to move on from it.""  In recent months it's been clear that stricter regulation of the largely unsupervised cryptocurrency market is on the horizon and the amount of leverage that traders can wield gets mentioned a lot by crypto critics and regulators alike.  In particular, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to soon release a new regulatory framework for the sector, following a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler demanding that one be released by July 28.  By self-policing itself now, FTX is perhaps hoping to avoid being a target of regulators by showing it's a good and responsible actor in the space, and by throwing shade at some of its competitors:  ""At FTX, way less than a percent of volume comes from margin calls,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""This contrasts with a few platforms which are sometimes [more than] 5%, and some which removed data because it looked bad.""  Bankman-Fried recently said he sees the U.S. as his next big target market, so FTX has a strong incentive to placate Washington, particularly in light of a New York Times article highlighting the use of leverage at FTX and other exchanges.  One of those exchanges, Binance, has lately very much been in the crosshairs of regulators from Britain to Japan.

42434916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPuLth,1627218000,What a Gory New Horror Film Teaches Us About Financial Censorship,"It’s a complicated time to be a defender of free speech, as the revolution of social media collides with the global rise of some ugly political tendencies. As our society’s sense of common goals and shared values frays, mainstream liberals in particular have been increasingly seduced by the idea that Big Brother should be called into action to monitor and squash thought crime wherever it may emerge.      It’s the perfect time, then, for the nuanced and forceful takedown of censorship at the heart of the new horror film “Censor.” The debut feature by director Prano Bailey-Bond is first and foremost a brilliant and mind-altering film, a magnetic character study in the form of a nightmarish Lynchian hallucination. See it, regardless of your interest in censorship as a social issue.      But what elevates it from a fun horror film to a piece of art is its exploration of the dangerous dance between trauma and repression, for individuals and society as a whole. Those threads entwine through Enid, the film’s main character (though certainly not its hero), who works as a censor in the bleak, bureaucratic offices of the British Board of Film Classification. Niamh Algar brings an amazing and menacing subtlety to her depiction of Enid, projecting a schoolmarmish uprightness while showing, through tiny hints and hesitations, that it’s all a delicate facade.      The film is set in the mid-1980s, when the conservative Margaret Thatcher administration stoked a wave of paranoia over the danger of “video nasties”. These were mostly violent B-movies unleashed as the rise of video technology removed theaters’ gatekeeping powers – a striking parallel to the panic around social media today. In a bid to essentially fight the free flow of culture, the U.K. government imposed state film censorship in 1984.      The film exaggerates and personalizes the video nasty moral panic masterfully in one of its two plotlines. When a murderer appears to have mimicked a violent film that Enid chose not to censor, she becomes the target of a wave of misplaced harassment: The public blames her for the crime instead of the murderer. At the same time, we are shown the economic and social decline that beset the U.K. in the 1970s and 1980s, which the film suggests is the deeper cause of violence. Political commentators have argued that the Thatcherites were intentionally ginning up anti-video anger as a distraction from these material problems.    Read more: Crypto Is the Libertarian Cheat Code in the Final Battle Over State Coercion    Parallel to those events, ""Censor"" reveals that not all is right with Enid herself. In a series of jittery, oblique (that is, very British) interactions with her aging parents, we learn that Enid’s sister went missing long ago while the pair were out wandering the woods. Enid has seemingly erased her own memories of that day, a kind of self-censorship that mirrors her work cutting violent scenes out of films.      And just as the ginned-up panic over video nasties misdirects anger from a bleak reality onto the media that reflects it, Enid’s disconnection from reality takes her to some very dark places. I won’t spoil anything, but this is a horror movie, and Chekhov’s axe will inevitably come into play.    The return of the (financially) repressed    ""Censor"" is a movie with a message, though one that’s messy and contradictory and ambiguous enough to avoid preachiness. The film wants you to walk away skeptical of the power of forgetting, censorship and other forms of denial to control the evil in the world and in ourselves.      Pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud called this “the return of the repressed.” Freud believed that repression, a kind of internal censorship of trauma or unpleasantness, left negative experiences to fester and mutate in the shadows of our individual psyches, manifesting as uncontrollable tics or psychosomatic disorders. Freud’s development of psychoanalysis, the “talking cure,” was based on the idea that by bringing buried truths to light, people could be more integrated, confident, happy selves.      What if the same dynamics apply not just to the repression of memories or the censorship of videos, but to the control of money? The ills of financial censorship are at the very heart of the cryptocurrency project, from Satoshi’s emphasis on irreversibility in the Bitcoin white paper, to the beautifully simple observation by Coin Center’s Jerry Brito that “Without cryptocurrency, a cashless society is a surveillance society.”    Read more: Bitcoin’s Censorship-Resistance Was a Step Change in History    We can clearly see these risks unfolding in real time through an idea that emerged in response to cryptocurrency – the central bank digital currency (CBDC), which has huge utility for financial monitoring and censorship. That’s why China has been most aggressive in pursuing the technology, but clearly it’s appealing even in nominally democratic societies. Look no further than recent statements from Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, who seemed to praise CBDCs for the “absolute control” they would give central banks.      You can certainly understand the motives of these aspiring financial censors. It sounds very convenient to be able to simply flip a switch and take away all the ill-gotten gains of violent drug cartels or cut off every donation to a terrorist group. It would be even better if we could cut off the elaborate money-laundering schemes pursued by the world’s most powerful and supposedly respectable people, though you might suspect central banks controlled by elites aren’t the best tools for that job.    The killer is already in the house    But as with Enid’s censorious faith, the belief that centralized financial control will lead to a crime-free utopia is a self-defeating delusion. And we’re living through an experiment that proves it.      Following 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, new regulations were put into place that heightened scrutiny of everyday financial activity to fight money laundering. That pushed major banks in the developed world to drop a variety of relationships, particularly with international correspondent banks, international nonprofits and “money services businesses,” which include many fintechs.      In essence, they decided to take the same approach to anti-money-laundering (AML) measures that Enid’s boss tells her to take to film censorship: “If you have any doubts whatsoever, reject the film.” Or in this case, the customer.      In a 2015 report, the charitable organization Oxfam chronicled the widespread fallout from this “de-risking” in the global financial system. The report argues that the impacts have been in some ways the exact opposite of regulators’ intent. On the one hand, the developing world’s loss of access to global finance has worked against AML goals. De-risking has pushed greater portions of the global economy, including perfectly legitimate commerce, to smaller banks with less oversight, or even into the underground or “informal” realm. That makes it more difficult for law enforcement to spot genuine criminal activity.      At the same time, Oxfam found that banking censorship has created problems for economies reliant on international remittances, and made it increasingly difficult for international charitable organizations to maintain financial relationships in trouble zones. This is where the vicious cycle of financial censorship can be seen most clearly.    Read more: Financial Censorship Is a Thing. Bitcoin Fixes It | Marc Hochstein    The primary goal of bank controls, after all, is to limit tax evasion, terrorist financing and illegal commerce in drugs and guns. The last two are the result of poverty and discontent, which as Oxfam shows, bank de-risking is making worse. Stricter AML measures surely have some impact on holding international crime in check, but by strangling remittances to countries like Syria and Sudan, bank de-risking has likely driven individuals towards drug-running, arms dealing and terrorism because of a lack of options in the legitimate economy.      In other words, efforts to reduce bank liability through tight AML controls may be increasing the risk of real crime on the ground. It is an act of repression and forgetting, not a solution to the real problems.      The dreamlike, blood-soaked climax of “Censor” shows the endgame of that sort of willful blindness.
