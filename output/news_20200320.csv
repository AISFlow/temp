For now, the Fed does not think that “cash destruction” will be necessary to stymie the spread of the novel coronavirus. COVID-19 has quickly overtaken vast swaths of the east and west U.S. coasts, sending states into lockdown and forcing non-essential commerce to a blistering halt.      But the spread is largely happening via “person-to-person contact,” not cash exchanges, said the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia spokesman, Joey Lee, citing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) findings.      As such there’s no need to destroy potentially infected banknotes from hardest-hit regions, according to the Fed. The People’s Bank of China reportedly took that step last month when it seized all banknotes processed in high-risk COVID-19 zones, according to the South China Morning Post.      “While the Federal Reserve is not considering cash destruction, the Federal Reserve System always has a contingency stock of new currency that can be circulated to the public and is staying in close contact with the CDC to ensure we are aware of the latest thinking on how COVID-19 spreads,” Lee said.    Changing behaviors    The Fed has unveiled a slew of programs, rate cuts and initiatives to keep the U.S. economy afloat in recent days.      In addition to those macroeconomic policy actions, coronavirus is also changing the way the Fed handles its physical notes.      For example, it has begun quarantining U.S. dollars shipped from overseas – first Asia and now Europe as well, according to Lee.      “As a precautionary measure, cash handling procedures have been modified at Reserve Banks that receive currency shipments from Asia and Europe to provide for a longer holding period of 7 to 10 days before processing these deposits,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/20/fed-stands-ready-to-replace-infected-greenbacks-with-clean-bills,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29602cf964910fcb9e5bdc598417ff194bb009a2-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vxwl,1584734156,Coinbase Broke Traffic Records and Saw Massive Volume During Market Collapse,"Coinbase saw record site traffic and a massive surge in 24-hour trading volume during last week’s coronavirus-driven market swings, CEO Brian Armstrong said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.      The San Francisco-based crypto exchange said it processed $2 billion in crypto last Thursday and Friday (for comparison, Coinbase saw $394 million in volume over the past 24 hours, according to Bitwise). Last Thursday also beat Coinbase’s previous traffic record by over 50 percent, Armstrong said.      Where other platforms experienced issues and outages, Armstrong noted that Coinbase remained operational, saying the exchange has been preparing for a crisis “for the last couple years.”      “This hard work contributed to our stability last week while many platforms, in both crypto and traditional equities, struggled with the increased volume,” Armstrong wrote, crediting the company's engineering team specifically.      Jesse Pollak, the head of engineering for Coinbase's consumer division, told CoinDesk in a phone call the platform has been preparing since the 2017 bull run, focusing on both the actual exchange’s matching engine as well as consumer products such as its API.      Some of this work included horizontal scaling on the database end, Pollak said. The company said it was scaling out its databases to enable more reads without interrupting writes (meaning the exchange can view the data stored on its servers while simultaneously adding new data without either operation slowing down the other as transactions are executed).    Coinbase’s COVID-19 response    The move comes, of course, as Coinbase and other firms deal with coronavirus-induced remote work mandates. Armstrong has for weeks publicized his exchange’s pandemic response in a regularly updated blog series. California announced a statewide shelter-in-place order on Thursday.      Pollak said that though Coinbase’s employees are currently remote (the exchange began implementing remote work last week in response to the COVID-19 outbreak), the engineering team used a combination of automated alerts and chatrooms to keep up with the spikes in traffic.      “If we're going to be hitting higher highs than what we've seen, we'll generally pull together people into a hangout just have them available, ready, hanging out, chatting there, looking at all the metrics,” he said.      Still, Pollak told CoinDesk that trading platforms are complex, and a lack of mistakes doesn’t necessarily mean a platform won’t experience any issues.      “From an engineering camaraderie perspective, I think it's just worth highlighting that scaling products is really freaking hard, and we put a lot of work into it and I think that paid off last weekend,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/20/coinbase-broke-traffic-records-and-saw-massive-volume-during-market-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6687e9a2d3e2cb828ebba74fb5c64adcae36888-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy4J,1584733088,"Bitcoin Bumps Up, but for How Long?","As traditional markets continue to struggle with the coronavirus crisis, cryptocurrencies are seeing an upswing in both price and volume. Now crypto traders are wondering how long this new rally will last.      Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1 percent in the past 24 hours of trading, currently changing hands at $6,224 as of 19:00 UTC. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be trending below its 10-day moving average in price, but it’s still above its 50-day average, the signal of a continued upward trend.      On Coinbase, prices were as high as $6,993 on the U.S. exchange over the past 24 hours. That’s an 80 percent appreciation from its lows of $3,845 on March 12, which was hit, in part, by liquidations on BitMEX coronavirus-related news.      “We saw buying in large sizes from some larger players in the last couple of days from $5,000 and up,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital.      Over the past 24 hours, Bitfinex traded on its spot markets more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies, according to the exchange. This coincided with a price spread developing and arbitrage opportunities forming on exchanges like Bitfinex and BitMEX.      Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk the action comes from ""a combination of multiple factors [including] halving, hedging against the traditional market and an important number of fiat inflows entering crypto markets to take advantage of the recent decline.”      See also: The Puell Multiple Is Turning Bullish on Bitcoin      With the potential of government stimulus plans boosting economic activity, bitcoin has been very bullish.      So where is bitcoin's price going? Professional stakeholders, as usual, differ on opinions and strategies.      “Conditions look set for a stellar rise with unprecedented monetary easing and fiscal stimulus along with the halving narrative. So once there was a sense of some stabilization in the spread of the virus (0 cases in China yesterday) a frenzy of buying occurred,” QCP Capital’s Sit told CoinDesk.      “In terms of the recent recovery, if the trend will continue the next resistance will be around $7,200,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital.      However, Kogan also noted a lot might happen on a fundamental level with the coronavirus epidemic and subsequent market reaction. Both the S&P 500 index and bitcoin volatility are jumping to dramatic highs.

Senator Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and husband Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange as well as Bakkt, made a total of 29 transactions in the weeks after the Jan. 24 briefing, the Daily Beast reports.      In a statement, ICE said Loeffler and Sprecher ""have made clear that those transactions were executed by their financial advisors without Mr. Sprecher's or Senator Loeffler's input or direction,"" and that the trades complied with company policies.      According to the Senate Financial Disclosures website, the two sold shares in Resideo Technologies, Exxon Mobile, Ross Stores, Tencent and Delta Airlines, among other companies. The transaction values ranged from $1,001 to $500,000. The total sales sum up to a small fraction of her net worth ($500 million).      Loeffler and Sprecher both jointly bought shares of Citrix, which offers a teleworking product, and Oracle. The two individually also bought shares of the Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust.      ""Appreciate today's briefing from the President's top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,"" Loeffler tweeted soon after the briefing. In the ensuing weeks, she took to Twitter to suggest the threat of the virus was being exaggerated by the Democrats.      Just last week, before the major sell-off, Loeffler, who has an estimated net worth of $500 million, tweeted to assure citizens that a strong economy and response by the administration meant the U.S. was in a ""strong position"" to handle the coronavirus outbreak.      See also: This Is What a Productive Congressional Blockchain Hearing Looks Like      Although Loeffler's office had not responded to the Daily Beast's requests for comment, she denied the reports on Twitter, calling them ""a ridiculous and baseless attack."" Her portfolio was managed by someone else, ""without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" she claimed, and she had informed the Senate Ethics Committee when she became aware of changes in her investments.      Loeffler said she was not aware of the sales until Feb. 16, after many had already been conducted. While her initial disclosure was filed on Feb. 7, the amended version was filed on March 12.      It is illegal for members of Congress to trade based on non-public information gained from their public roles. An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      This is the second time concerns have been raised about Loeffler. In early January, she was appointed to the committee that oversees the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), just weeks after resigning as CEO of Bakkt.      See also: Bakkt Raises $300M Series B From Microsoft, Pantera      Being a bitcoin warehouse hoping to offer derivatives products with its parent firm, Bakkt needed to be approved by the CFTC. An annual report from her husband's exchange group noted that many of its holdings were ""subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""      Responding to concerns there was a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal at the time she had tried to comply with the Senate's ethics rules and would recuse herself on a case by case basis.      Fellow Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also come under fire for selling anywhere between $500,00 to $1.5 million in stock holdings just before markets tanked in February, the Center for Responsive Politics reported.

42383472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy85,1584721026,The Puell Multiple Is Turning Bullish on Bitcoin,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent sell-off has pushed prices on the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization into a historically attractive zone, according to one indicator.      Prices fell from $10,200 in mid-February to 12-month lows below $4,000 last week, dashing many hopes for a strong rally ahead of the May 2020 mining reward halving.      However, with the price slide, a key indicator called the “Puell Multiple” has declined to levels suggesting the value of newly issued bitcoins on a daily basis is quite low compared to historical standards.      Put simply, this signals appears to show the cryptocurrency is now undervalued.      The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value.      Daily issuance refers to new coins added to the ecosystem by miners, who receive coins as rewards for validating blocks on the blockchain. Miners usually cover mining costs by selling coins into the market.      The Puell Multiple slipped to 0.41 on March 16, the lowest level since Jan. 17, 2019 and was last seen at 0.47, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The metric is now hovering in the green zone or the range of 0.3 to 0.5, which has marked bear market bottoms in the past.      Historical data also shows the indicator enters the green zone in the last leg of the bear market following which the bearish momentum weakens.    2018 bear market    Bitcoin’s bear market from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 ended at lows near $3,200 in mid-December 2018, with the Puell Multiple hitting a low of 0.30.      The indicator entered the green zone during the last leg of the bear market, which began on Nov. 14, 2018, when prices fell below the long-held support of $6,000 and slipped to $4,000 by Nov. 20.      On that day, the Puell Multiple fell below 0.5, signaling undervaluation. The selling pressure ebbed in the following days, allowing a recovery from $3,400 to $4,400 in the last week of November.      While the bounce was short-lived, the sellers could not do much damage, as evidenced by prices bottoming out just $200 below November's low of $3,400 on Dec. 15. That’s when the Puell Multiple was hovering near 0.30.      Going back more than half a decade, bitcoin’s downward move from the November 2013 high of $1,100 came to an end near $150 in January 2015. The Puell Multiple also bottomed out near 0.30 in mid-January. Similarly, the preceding bear market had ended in November 2011 with the indicator’s drop to 0.30.    Is the bear market over?    The latest under-0.50 reading on the indicator suggests the worst is behind us. Other metrics like the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score are also indicating undervaluation.      However, the cryptocurrency might not be out of the woods yet, as the Puell Multiple hasn’t dropped to 0.30 – the level which has marked bear market lows in the past.      If history is a guide, we may see one more bout of selling, which could likely push prices back to the $5,000-$4,000 range and the Puell Multiple down to 0.30.      ""We can certainly retest recent lows once or twice,"" Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk, while adding that dips below $5,000 will be short-lived, courtesy of strong demand from long-term holders – investors who bought bitcoins before the massive rally from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during the last five weeks of 2018.

On Friday, the company creating it, Horizon Games, opened its final closed-beta season, Season 0, as millions in the U.S. stay at home to combat the spread of COVID-19.      Similar to Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone and a new entrant still in alpha from Kathleen Breitman’s Coase, SkyWeaver is among a crop of blockchain-based games (led by Gods Unchained) looking to prove the value of digital scarcity in the gaming industry.      Season 0 kicked off today at 14:00 UTC on the SkyWeaver testnet. Although the loot players earn will evaporate once the open beta is launched, there’s still a reason to play.      ""The players who rank in the top 1,000 will each earn a rare gold card that players can play, trade or sell,"" Michael Sanders, one of the Horizon Games co-founders, told CoinDesk. The gold card will be accessible once the open beta launches on the ethereum mainnet.      The company will be waving through a chunk of its extremely long wait list, but it's also easy to hop the line. Players who join the community on Discord and ask to get an invite will be given an access code. There are thousands of people playing now and that number is likely to grow.      Horizon Games isn't committing to a timeline for launching the open beta, other than to say it will be this year. When the game is in open beta, though, card ownership will move to the mainnet and the cards players buy and win really will belong to them from then on, held in their Ethereum wallets.      Read more: Tezos Co-Founder Turns to Gaming With ‘Hearthstone’ Competitor      Max Palmer is a 28-year-old longtime CCG gamer who has been playing in the SkyWeaver preseason since early this year. Previously a fairly successful Hearthstone player who drifted away from that game, Palmer shared his early impressions.  ""To be honest, with me, the most important thing is just that it's a good game,” he said of SkyWeaver's crypto aspect. “Because if it's not a good game then the asset wouldn't matter as much.""      SkyWeaver gameplay    SkyWeaver is free to play but Horizon is calling it play-to-earn. There will also be a revenue model for the company, with players being able to buy cards for the game’s constructed-deck mode.      Horizon gave CoinDesk an invite to the preseason, and this reporter’s record stands at 5-5, as of this writing.      The basic format of the game is much like other similar one-on-one games played with a deck of soldiers and spells. One difference: You are playing with a lead character (""a hero"") who is on the battlefield and the goal is to keep that character alive longer than your opponent’s hero in the turn-based format.      As in other CCG titles, you use a resource (""mana"") to play these cards and you get one unit more of it to use each turn. One difference in play that Horizon’s Sanders emphasized was the fact that some cards have spells built into them, effectively making them two-for-one. So once a card is played you can also spend your resources activating a one-time effect built into that card, ""which allows for an entirely new gameplay dynamic,"" Sanders said.      Palmer echoed the sentiment that the game has a lot of elements that work together in a fun way.      ""It's hard to really exactly explain what makes it so good, but there's just a lot of good elements within the game design,"" Palmer said.      Read more: ‘Gods Unchained’ Crypto Game Raises $15 Million from Naspers, Galaxy      That game design is led by Jonathon Loucks, who helped build games at a number of big companies, including Wizards of the Coast, which makes Magic: The Gathering.      SkyWeaver players can choose one of two formats: discovery or constructed. In fact, they have to start playing ""discovery,"" which provides a random deck of cards the player doesn't keep. Players earn cards they can use later by playing and winning. Once a player has enough cards, they can choose from them to build a deck in the “constructed” setting. The 1,000 players who will earn a gold card in Season 0 will actually be the top 500 in each of these two categories.      Unlike Coase's Tezos-based Emergents, Horizon hasn't committed to creating a software development kit to allow other developers to create new game formats. Horizon will decide which other ways of playing (such as two-on-two or all-for-one, for example) come next.      ""Once we're in open beta we're going to learn from the community in terms of what sort of game modes we want to build next,"" Sanders said.      There are 500 cards to learn, 100 in each of the five categories within the game. A deck has 20 cards. If you play “constructed” and don't have enough cards in the category you're playing, the game will just randomly give you enough other cards to play with for that round.      We are still struggling to get better at the game, so no tips on gameplay but one: A lot of cards have the effect of attaching a spell to your hero. Just know that any new spell attached destroys the prior one, so use it or lose it.      Other than that: Just have fun. The game does its best to match you with players at a similar level so each game should be just challenging enough.      Card economics    The card economics are not completely nailed down, Sanders said, so any of the below could change. The company plans to put out a blog post soon articulating version 1.0 of the marketplace, Sanders added.      There will be three kinds of cards: playable cards held by the game, ""silver cards"" which are purchased from Horizon and ""gold cards"" which are the most rare, and are earned by the best players.      Silver and gold cards will be the same cards as the regular cards, in terms of names and abilities, but they will be cosmetically enhanced and the players actually own them.      Silver cards should sell for something like $2 each. There will be no fixed supply of these cards. Sanders said that once a silver card is created it should always be for sale by Horizon.      The company has created a peer-to-peer marketplace for exchanging the cards between players that serves as an automated market maker.      Gold cards don't have a fixed supply either, but they are limited at the pace they can be released. Right now, the thinking is that the top players each week will earn a cryptocurrency called WEAVE (an ERC-1155 token), and 500 WEAVE can be used to mint a random gold card. Only something like 2,000 will be minted each week and no one can control which card can be minted.      Read more: James Ferguson on Decentralized Gaming’s Next Moves      There's no plan right now for cards in SkyWeaver to have a memory of their gameplay, because that might make the marketplace too confusing. One critical factor will undoubtedly impact cards' value over time: the SkyWeaver team may modify cards' stats if they prove too disruptive to gameplay, an effect that gamers refer to as ""nerfing.""      Players of Magic are familiar with this, only in that game the card just gets ""banned,"" which basically always causes its value to plummet on the secondary market. In a digital format, it can just be modified slightly.      Still, crypto-oriented players might not feel quite so much ownership over assets whose attributes might change at any time. That said, Palmer, the 28-year-old gamer, said there's just no perfect solution.      ""It can be annoying at times when things are changing and prices are changing and you're just trying to play the game,"" he said, but never changing anything once a card is published could create its own problems. ""It's just a balancing thing essentially.""",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/20/skyweaver-didnt-plan-for-a-captive-audience-of-millions-but-it-sure-helps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e195529ed10d237d3a6d36ecf74493ac4e96a0f-1769x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, Tether is using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) as the technical means to launch its tether stablecoins (USDT) on the BCH blockchain. Tether aims for the token's price to consistently match the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio and backs its value with assets.      Running directly on the BCH blockchain, SLP allows users to issue and manage tokens of various types. Tether said the launch means bitcoin.com wallet users – which supports BCH and bitcoin (BTC) – will be able to to send and receive USDT via SLP tokens, without the need for other applications.      Tether is currently live on the Algorand, EOS, Ethereum, Liquid Network, Omni and Tron blockchains with a total market capitalization – total units in circulation multiplied by spot price – of more than $5.6 billion, according to Tether Inc.'s treasury data. However, that does not seem to include any tokens on BCH as yet.      “Our latest collaboration with Bitcoin Cash will provide Tether with a variety of benefits,"" said Paolo Ardoino, Tether CTO.

42383453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vxmh,1584719145,Think a Privacy Law Will Stop Surveillance Capitalism? You Don't Know Google,"Alex McDougall is the co-founder of Bicameral Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on blockchain, interoperability, data and identity self-sovereignty, personalized AI and Web 3.0.      The business model where users with the fewest privacy settings are the most profitable. The opaque data policies that routinely top 10,000 words and legal experts agree are nonsensical. The use of trackers and pixels to allow data players to reach far outside their own domain and index web traffic not even remotely attached to the “services” they offer. Especially the data and content creators who are routinely either completely excluded or massively de-prioritized when it comes to divvying up the value of the platforms they power. Our data paradigm has been broken for a while now.      We generally acknowledge this break with some form of “yeah, I know Google is building an archetype of me for their own purposes, but what else am I gonna do? Plus look how pretty their site is!” Regulators acknowledge this challenge and there have been well-meaning attempts to legislate a better outcome to this with privacy focused legislations such as GDPR and CCPA. These laws are well-intentioned, but I believe fatally incomplete in two ways.      See also: Alex McDougall - Data Creators Should Share in the Profits From Big Data      First, until you either fix the fundamental mismatch of privacy and profit, or alter the system by which investors expect ever increasing quarterly earnings, we will never get a real “private” future led by today’s tech giants. They are too nimble, too powerful, too incentivized by profits and operate in a world that’s too ill defined to be shackled by slow-moving legislation. Legislation that can be innovated around or worse, repurposed for their own intentions.      Secondly, especially in a post COVID-19 virtualized world, “privacy” by forced disconnection is NOT what we need. Prior to this devastating global outbreak, despite mounting work from home and virtual office technology, the majority of business still happens face to face. That’s especially true of the high-value “closing” type interactions and the high-value networking engagements (the real point of conferences!).    Legislation that can be innovated around or worse, repurposed for their own intentions.    Same story with social interactions. Yes, social media has been the defining force of our past 15 years, but the majority of the important interactions in our lives still happen in person, especially the high-emotional-engagement interactions (romance, family gatherings).      Same story with health and wellness. You learn digitally, but execute treatment plans in person. We don’t need further disconnection, we need a new digital paradigm to replace our most important interactions without completely losing our humanity.    What happens when 'in person' doesn’t exist?    You may recognize a correlation here between the things we generally do in person and the events that would be most valuable for current data players to observe and model. For example, buy decisions, romantic choices and family dynamics. Up until now, you’ve always been able to, at least somewhat convincingly, “opt-out” of the data paradigm. While it’s a wrench to leave Facebook when all your friends and family are there, it’s possible. You can live without Facebook.      In the future, it may be impossible to leave society’s dominant data matrix behind.      With the COVID-19 pandemic causing widespread isolating lockdowns and sweeping social distancing measures, we’re about to enter into a world of unprecedented digital mediation. Our digital mediators, with all-time low trust and all-time power high, are about to get even more omnipotent in our lives.    See also: Lindsey Barretthttps://www.law.georgetown.edu/experiential-learning/clinics/communications-technology-law-clinic-ipr/faculty-staff/ - When Corporations Violate Privacy, They Do Concrete Harm    Unfortunately, privacy by itself isn’t the answer to this; it would be a lot simpler if it was. Our data feeds are the lifeblood of our digital personas and our digital personas are about to become our only personas. Slowing down and blocking them at a time where we’re about to lose our ability to physically connect is a recipe for isolation socially and economically.      In the current world, we don’t have control over our digital personas. They are generated, enhanced, tailored and monetized in the shadows. The profiles are rich and detailed and, in some cases, incredibly accurate. Have a look at what Google knows about you sometime.    More privacy without fixing the underlying paradigm isn’t what we need.    Why don’t we have the infrastructure we can control? I can see my Google profile and even download an Excel of it. Why isn’t there a secure vehicle where I take that Google profile, correct what’s wrong and supplement it with my Twitter, Netflix, Lyft, Apple Health, government ID, health and personal information to make a real digital version of me that I can use to connect and share myself?      There are many reasons, including slow emerging distributed technology and strong consumer inertia, that this doesn’t exist today. But this user-controlled, 360-degree, digital profile is what’s going to form the kernel of a world where we can capture some semblance of our valuable physical interactions, in a digital setting.      See also: Elizabeth Renieris - An Identity Layer for the Web Would Identify Us Everywhere      More privacy without fixing the underlying paradigm isn’t what we need. We need more rich data to make better algorithms and more virtual spaces that facilitate deeper, self-sovereign digital interactions. Here are three key pieces of infrastructure, as I see it:    A mechanism by which new reams of data accrue to the user first and then are shared onwards or made available only at the user’s discretion  A suite of digital tools, products and algorithms that are built to only ask for the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve their goal. Further, in certain highly sensitive situations, these tools must be able to have the data processed entirely within a provably private “black-box” execution environment  A “data-supply chain” mechanism by which data can be traced from its raw creation through to its final commercial use and value shared with creators, algorithm makers and any other necessary stakeholders along the way    Sounds like a lot of stuff to build right? Luckily, we have a secret weapon: Our data is exponentially more valuable when we’re sharing it willingly. Google has become one of the most valuable companies on Earth by quietly trying to run digital simulations of all of us. Still, the value of years of surveillance is a tiny fraction of the value of you or I filling out an honest 10-minute survey.      We’re at a tipping point. We need to re-orient our data paradigm away from the “abstract and extract” model to one where individuals and businesses start our own digital identities. We need the tools, products, ecosystem and user willingness to adopt this new world. It won’t be an overnight solution. But the economics of shared data can be incredible, and the reward for getting it done is nothing less than the salvation of integrity and humanity in our post-COVID world of digital interactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Alex McDougall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/20/think-a-privacy-law-will-stop-surveillance-capitalism-you-dont-know-google,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5bda3ef61468c45b315f20ab7b4557164d5f7b4-1500x948.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383466,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vy0X,1584714000,"Customized Crypto Options Seeing Record Demand From Funds, Miners, Says GSR","Digital assets firm GSR says it's seen record interest in its customizable options contracts as funds, exchanges and miners try to hedge against price volatility.      The Hong Kong-based firm, which offers a host of services including market making, over-the-counter trading and product development for digital assets, told CoinDesk that 2020 was already shaping up to be a good year for the company, with structured products becoming a fast-growing part of their business.      ""The pandemic has predictably sparked a rise in trading activity, but it’s only adding to what has been a substantial shift towards risk management in 2020,"" said GSR co-founder Rich Rosenblum. ""Volumes for the custom swaps and options contracts we provide have already surpassed the total volumes for 2019 and we’re on pace for a 400 percent year-on-year increase.""      Market conditions have become increasingly unpredictable as the COVID-19 coronavirus spreads across Europe and North America. When bitcoin's price plunged from $7,800 to $4,100 last week, volatility shot up from 60 percent to well over 160 percent.      See also: Traders Finding More Arbitrage Opportunities in Bitcoin      GSR's clients are mostly funds and exchanges. Many are established companies, with payrolls and overheads, who turn to GSR for products that allow them to hedge against volatile market conditions.      The company also works on risk management solutions specific for miners, who as well as dealing with price volatility, also have to prepare for the upcoming bitcoin halving – where the block reward is set to fall from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. ""Many miners have approached us proactively since last Friday, inquiring about protective puts,"" said Xin Song, GSR's Asia business development director.      As recent volatility has put many options up at a premium, GSR has actually suggested miners begin selling their existing call options, according to Song.      ""Selling a call is effectively giving up upside gains in return for earning the option premium – so if the miner either doesn’t believe that [bitcoin] will rally hard before the expiry, or if they are happy to sell their BTC at a higher price in the event that we do, then selling calls makes sense,"" he said.      See also: Thousands of These Computers Were Mining Cryptocurrency. Now They’re Working on Coronavirus Research      ""If bitcoin went up to $20,000, the need for hedging products would be less,"" said Jakob Palmstierna, GSR's director of investment solutions. ""However, when margin compression happens ... your incentive to have a risk management strategy to survive for two to five years becomes more crucial.""      Options offered on regulated U.S. derivatives exchanges have fallen to rock bottom over the past week. Data from CME shows demand for its bitcoin options largely dried up as market volatility increased; Bakkt has seen no options trading activity since the end of February.      But one of the reasons GSR has seen record volumes is because contracts can be constructed to meet the specific needs of clients, Palmstierna said. Common in the traditional space, the company uses an internal ""risk library"" that gives clients the ability to create and hold specific volatility expressions on customized timeframes.

42383447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvFR,1584711000,How to Escape Contracts That Are Killing Your Company During Coronavirus,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk's Opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      In my last column two weeks ago – ""How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive"" – I suggested that companies take steps to position themselves for the coming storm. Chief among these was sending their employees home (which is now law in New York), cutting their burn rate, reviewing their insurance policies and re-structuring their contracts where appropriate.      Businesses in the hospitality industry in particular have put such emergency plans into effect. If you are a restaurant owner in New York City, extreme measures are necessary to deal with a truly unprecedented 100 percent, near-instantaneous drop in demand. “Social distancing” emergency orders continue to be handed down by governors all over the U.S. including in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.      Even if you’re not a restaurant, the ban on utilizing office space will almost certainly take a hunk out of your business – see, for example, New York and its statewide edict that businesses must keep at least 50 percent of their workforces at home. Of course, the U.S. is much larger than just New York, but New York may be where the rest of the country is headed if we don’t get this outbreak under control.      See also: Preston Byrne: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      Businesses affected by local, state or federal emergency orders have a variety of mechanisms available to them if this emergency materially interferes with their contracts. Businesses that are suffering disastrous losses as a result of the virus have an obligation to take swift action to work with their contracting parties – for example, landlords or event organizers – to stanch the bleeding and reduce their burn rate in the face of what could be the single most disastrous macroeconomic event in history.    Consensual modification    The first thing any business should do in this (extremely stressful) period is talk to your commercial counterparties and try to cut a deal. If you operate a popular restaurant with a beautiful view in New York City, chances are pretty good that the executive orders from the Mayor's and Governor’s offices have wiped out 100 percent of your business.      Under the circumstances, your landlord ought to be sympathetic to your position and recognize your business is under strain. What one ought to do, however, is not necessarily the same thing as what one has agreed to do.      Last week, I was staying in an Airbnb in Washington, D.C., when that city’s first coronavirus outbreak was discovered at a church… two blocks from the apartment on a Sunday night.      I packed up and moved out the following morning. I tried to get a refund from the owner of the unit, who refused. Eventually, I managed to twist Airbnb’s arm enough to get the job done. The contract left that call within the discretion of Airbnb. By communicating with them and demonstrating a willingness to start a fight, I negotiated a better outcome.      In a relationship that is a little cozier than that – for example, between your startup and a co-working space landlord that isn’t WeWork – negotiation is to be expected even in good times and especially in disasters. A tenant with a temporary abatement is better than a tenant that goes out of business.    Contracts are agreements, not straitjackets. Parties are free to breach them provided they are also prepared to face the consequences for doing so.    It bears mentioning that virtually everyone, everywhere is under strain right now: your landlord is and other suppliers are, likely feeling the same pain as you are, and have their own contractual, commercial and financial obligations (including paying lenders) and questions as to where they will find the cash to meet those obligations.      It is the role of government, in this instance, to lean on regulated businesses like utility firms and banks to enact repayment moratoriums wherever possible on these base-level contracts, and then to act as a backstop to the systemically important institutions like the banks to ensure that a liquidity crisis doesn’t transmogrify into a solvency crisis (as happened in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ collapse back in 2008).      But what happens if things go bad?    Force majeure    The first, and best, option is if your contract contains a force majeure clause and the event in discussion is covered by it.      “Force majeure” is French for holy s***. Kidding. It’s actually French for “superior force” and the long and short of it is that if some massive supervening event prevents the parties from performing an obligation, the performance of that obligation is excused. See, for example:      In no event will either Party be liable or responsible to the other Party, or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement (except for any confidentiality or payment obligations), when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party’s reasonable control (a “Force Majeure Event”), acts of God, invasion of interstellar groundhogs from the faraway planet Marmota Prime, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement, national or regional emergency, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, passage of Law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo, export or import restriction, quota, or other restriction or prohibition or any complete or partial government shutdown, or national or regional shortage of adequate power or telecommunications or transportation.      Sounds great, right? There’s a list of really bad things, and coronavirus is a bad thing, so surely can wiggle out of the contract, because that’s what Force Majeure clauses do. Right?      Wrong. The problem, of course, is you need to read the clause. This clause, for example, says that a “Force Majeure Event” will excuse performance “except for any confidentiality and payment obligations,” and of course the thing that every business in the world is currently trying to do is excuse payment obligations in the face of an unprecedented demand shock and associated liquidity crunch.      Even if we presume that payment was captured by the force majeure language (“when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such party’s reasonable control”) it does not say “when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by the decision of one of the parties that it would be uneconomical or inconvenient to perform that obligation.”      If a restaurant is closed and takeout-only, a landlord may argue the New York ban didn’t ban the payment of rent. It merely made it uneconomical to operate the business in that space. While such a landlord would be behaving, in the view of the tenant, unreasonably, as we mentioned above, the landlord is likely facing stressors of its own, and to the extent the force majeure event didn’t cause the failure to perform, at least with this clause, it isn’t going to excuse a failure to perform.    Impossibility and frustration    Force majeure aside, common law defenses to non-performance exist that can, under the right circumstances, be employed to attempt to excuse or modify performance under a contract.      Before proceeding, it bears mentioning there is no “magic bullet” that will excuse you from performing under a contract or losing a lawsuit if you breach. I recall a member of my extended family who locked into a winter heating oil contract one year and, after the price of oil fell below the contract price, asked us (plural, as there are many attorneys in our clan) if there were a way out to get the lower price (there wasn’t).      With that said, contracts are agreements, not straitjackets. Parties are free to breach them provided they are also prepared to face the consequences for doing so. In the example of a lease, for example, a tenant who vacates may be on the hook for the rent for the remainder of the term, subject to the landlord’s duty to mitigate his or her losses.      The common law (in both England and the US) provides escape valves in the event that a contract ceases to make commercial sense. By this I don’t mean the contract simply becomes uneconomical to perform, but rather that the contract ceases to have meaning.    Being prepared to go to war – and having a credible defense to non-performance in hand – is a useful prerequisite to any successful negotiation.    The way these rules are used, most of the time, is as a basis for negotiation if your counter party decides that they don’t want to play ball and would prefer to hold you to the original contract terms, despite the fact that your business is under stress from some external event. For these negotiations to work, you have to be prepared to go to the mat and fight.      Impossibility is the first of these. It doesn’t have a uniform definition among jurisdictions, but borrowing some case law from D.C., a thing is impossible when it is literally impossible, or “when it is not practicable; and a thing is impracticable when it can only be done at an excessive and unreasonable cost.” Transatlantic Financing Corporation v. United States, 363 F.2d 312 (D.C. Cir. 1966). (See also Opera Co. of Boston v. Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, 817 F. 2d 1094 (4th Cir. 1987)and Drummond Coal v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co. No. 7:2016cv00489 - Document 181 (W.D. Va. 2018)for a similar tripartite test).      Per Transatlantic Financing, three criteria must be satisfied before a claim of impossibility will be sustained: ""First, a contingency – something unexpected – must have occurred. Second, the risk of the unexpected occurrence must not have been allocated either by agreement or by custom (or, from Drummond Coal, 'such occurrence was of a character that its non-occurrence was a basic assumption of the agreement of the parties'). Finally, occurrence of the contingency must have rendered performance commercially impracticable.”      So, for example, a contract to rent a beach house will be impossible to perform if a hurricane sweeps through and the land on which the house once sat is devoured by the sea. The contract has become impossible to perform because its subject matter no longer exists. And while one could argue it is possible to remediate the land and reconstruct the house, it is likely a court would consider this an excessive and unreasonable expenditure.      The issue with invoking the defense of impossibility is that, in normal times, there are very few situations where performance is truly impossible. If you wanted to host a comedy night at a bar in Kentucky, for example, where there is (as of this writing) no curfew or public meetings ban but everyone is staying off the streets, that would make the show uneconomic, but not impossible.      Contrast this with the position in Connecticut, where gubernatorial orders have closed all bars, and impossibility would be available. Furthermore, with regard to any contracts concluded after the coronavirus emergency had begun, it cannot be said that the non-occurrence of this plague was not a basic assumption of the agreement, because the emergency is already upon us and the parties may be presumed to have knowledge of it.      See also: Preston Byrne: The States Can't Blockchain      Facts and circumstances, and the terms of the agreements governing the relationship, will determine whether impossibility is available, or not.      The second defense available in the absence of contractual terms is frustration of purpose, or simply “frustration.” Frustration is “a defense to excuse performance on the basis of changed conditions that have rendered the performance worthless to one of the parties.” La Gloria Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, 72 Fed.Cl. 544, 573 (2006) That is to say, the purpose for entering into the contract no longer exists, even if the contract is, theoretically, possible to perform.      As with impossibility, mere inconvenience is not enough to invoke this particular excuse to performance – “changed conditions have rendered the performance bargained from the promisee worthless, not… different or impracticable.” (Id.)      Of course, these areas are complex, and you can be sure that (1) if a company invokes frustration, (2) its counterparty disagrees with your client’s version of reality and (3) the dispute sees the inside of a courtroom, the company’s assertion that the Coronabug/that Executive Order/that space groundhog invasion is going to be picked apart and all manner of counter-arguments can and will be raised.      But invoking these defenses was, is and will continue to be (at least as long as you don’t wait too long) an option. Going down fighting like a berserker honey badger is an option. Ideally, no fighting is necessary. But being prepared to go to war – and having a credible defense to non-performance in hand – is a useful prerequisite to any successful negotiation. Federal and state governments in the US and around the world can make these negotiations easier by doing what they failed to do after 2008: backing up the banks and money markets while debt repayment moratoria are put in place for this once-in-a-century event.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Preston J.

42383435,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv1b,1584709200,Crypto Lender Cred Is Offering Investors 10% Interest With Spencer Dinwiddie Partnership,"Spencer Dinwiddie, the Brooklyn Nets guard who launched his own tokenization platform, has launched an interest-bearing stablecoin service in partnership with crypto lending firm Cred.      The new service launched Friday on Dinwiddie’s personal website. There, visitors can “pledge” TrueUSD and UPUSD stablecoins as well as bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH), earning up to 10 percent interest over the course of the term, according to Cred CEO Dan Schatt.      The service premieres at a somewhat awkward moment for Dinwiddie and Cred, both of whom deal in businesses acutely impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic. A starter for the Nets, Dinwiddie and his season were upended two weeks ago by the indefinite suspension of NBA play. Four of his teammates have since tested positive for COVID-19.      Cred, for its part, is a banking and financial services alternative at a time when global financial markets are in turmoil. Jobless claims for last week – a lagging economic indicator, but a telling one – have spiked more than at any point in over a decade, data from the Labor Department shows. The economic carnage is expected to worsen as the U.S. economy slams on its brakes.      Schatt said that the state of the world right now makes the Cred-Dinwiddie partnership all the more important. It’s offering users a high potential return on a volatility-free crypto asset: stablecoins backed one-to-one with dollar reserves.      “In an environment like this I think everyone is looking for that extra assurance. It just highlights the value of stablecoins,” Schatt said.      It's also an opportunity to bring more people into the crypto fold, he said. Dinwiddie is the NBA’s most outspoken cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiast, a title earned over months of fighting to tokenize his three-year, $35 million contract.      “Spencer is a fantastic spokesperson for what's happening with blockchain and bitcoin – he’s really a thought leader in the sports industry,” Schatt said.      Dinwiddie will donate 26 percent of his revenue share to his charity, the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to Schatt. A Cred spokesperson declined to state what percentage of the overall revenue that slice represents. The firm's website says it offers ""up to 10 percent interest"" through its Earn offering.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | LTC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/20/crypto-lender-cred-is-offering-investors-10-interest-with-spencer-dinwiddie-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0acc5b2e49b9bd2f8b5ba83eb62c9f946fb7a34-2300x1725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383438,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv2r,1584705687,Steem Hard Forks Today Over Fears of Justin Sun Power Grab,"Major crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi have aligned behind a controversial hard fork of the Steem blockchain scheduled for Friday.      An initiative developed by a Steem community group called Hive, the fork is set to go live at around 14:00 UTC.      The blockchain split is the latest development in the ongoing dispute between Tron founder Justin Sun and the Steem community, who have been in a fight for control over who controls the social media and content-focused blockchain.      On Feb. 14, Sun's Tron foundation acquired Steemit, Steem's leading social media dapp and, it's thought, its large hoard of steem tokens, which bring with them great voting power in the blockchain's governance. With the community seeing this as a potential takeover by the crypto entrepreneur, they moved to limit his power with a soft fork in late February that was ultimately unsuccessful.      Sun claimed the move was brought by ""hackers"" at the time.      While Huobi and Binance previously supported Sun's move to acquire Steem and used their token supply to back his moves, it would appear the exchanges have changed their stance. The firms now back the hard fork, which will port over steem tokens to the new chain, all but Sun's sizable stash, that is. The move would exempt him from holding any of the new hive tokens and, thus, voting power on the new chain.      ""We will take a snapshot of all STEEM tokens held by Binance users at the time of the final Steem block prior to 2020/03/20 2:00 p.m. (UTC) and will distribute HIVE tokens at a ratio of 1 STEEM = 1 HIVE,"" Binance said in an announcement on Friday. Huobi made a similar statement Wednesday.      The new hive tokens will deny Sun control of the original development fund through his major share in Steem's ""ninja-mined stake"" tokens – perhaps 20 percent of the total supply. As such, fork backers hope to completely remove Sun from the picture when the hard fork goes live in a couple of hours.      ""The intention of this community-driven fork is to support and build on the strong Steem community values that have made our ecosystem so diverse and exciting,"" said Hive. ""This new direction steps away from the burden of the Steemit Inc. ninja-mined stake, which has impacted the long term ability to work towards further development and decentralization for years.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | BNB | FORKS,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/20/steem-hard-forks-today-over-fears-of-justin-sun-power-grab,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d3bcc95eddacee340822384eb36c5993d6e7685-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvHx,1584703265,Bitcoin Claws Back Over 40% of Recent Price Sell-off With Surge Above $6.8K,"View  After a quick rise over $6,900 Friday, bitcoin's technical charts are calling a continued rally.  Fundamentals also support further gains, according to analysts.  A failure to keep prices above key support near $6,400 would weaken the immediate bullish case and allow a pullback to $6,000.    Bitcoin's (BTC) price recovery gathered pace on Friday, helping the cryptocurrency erase a significant chunk of the recent drop.      The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped to an eight-day high of $6,943 at 10:30 UTC, having started rising from $5,400 Thursday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The solid gains have seen bitcoin claw back a hefty 46 percent of the drop from $10,500 to $3,867 witnessed in the four weeks to March 13. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $6,865, a 27 percent gain on a week-to-date basis.      The rebound seen in the last 36 hours had been expected, with technical charts reporting seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency had also been looking undervalued as per the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score.      The cryptocurrency still looks underpriced at press time, with the Z-score hovering below zero, according to Glassnode data. That bodes well for a continued rally.      Meanwhile, speculators may put a bid under BTC in anticipation of a big buy order, as Tether, the company behind the tether (USDT) stablecoin, has minted over $120 million worth of the coins in the last 48 hours, according to Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at investment platform eToro.      The fundamentals are looking better, too, with fiscal authorities across the globe injecting massive amounts of liquidity to counter the coronavirus-led slowdown in economic activity.      The U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet increased to a record high $4.7 trillion this week. The U.S. central bank also cut rates to zero on Sunday, having injected liquidity worth $1.5 trillion into the system last week.      ""We’re going to be in a period of zero rates for a long time. We could see bitcoin act as a global inflation hedge due to many aggressive stimulus packages being implemented,"" Richard Rosenblum, co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.      What's more, the traditional markets are showing signs of stability. The major European equity market indices are flashing green for the second consecutive day and futures tied to the S&P 500 are up 4.45 percent.      That could invite stronger buying pressure for bitcoin. Ever since the global market shakeout, the cryptocurrency has been moving strongly in tandem with the equities market.      The technical charts, too, suggest scope for a continuation of the recovery rally.    Hourly chart    The ascending triangle breakout at 09:00 UTC was backed by an uptick in trading volumes and has put the bulls back in the driver's seat.      The cryptocurrency could soon challenge resistance at $7,000. A violation there would open the doors to $7,400.      If prices fail to keep gains above the support at $6,425 (December 2019 low), the bearish divergence (lower high) of the relative strength index (RSI) would gain credence and a pullback to $6,000 could be seen.    Daily chart    The daily MACD histogram continues to produce higher lows below the zero line, indicating dropping bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the five- and 10-day averages are teasing a bullish crossover.      The relative strength index has violated the descending trendline in favor of the bulls.      All in all, the daily chart indicators are calling for further gains. However, the cryptocurrency is not out of the woods yet, eToro's Simon Peters told CoinDesk, while adding that bitcoin needs to print more prominent higher highs and higher lows to give us more confidence.      Essentially, Peters wants to see if there is a dip in demand, which would create a higher low.

42383442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv99,1584698400,80% of Australians Know About Crypto but Only 1% Use It: Central Bank Study,"Fewer than 1 percent of Australians paid for consumer goods with cryptocurrency in 2019, according to a study published Thursday by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Australia’s central bank.      Revealed in RBA’s triennial Consumer Payments Survey (CPS), the findings from about 1,100 respondents shows that while consumers are largely embracing digital and alternative payment methods over cash, they’re just not paying in crypto. RBA conducted the survey in October and November 2019.      The low usage comes in spite of respondents’ overwhelming awareness that cryptocurrency can be used to pay for goods. Over 80 percent said they’d heard of crypto, making it the third-most recognized “alternative payment method” the bank surveyed for, behind only “buy now pay later” services and “tap and go” mobile payments.      Crypto was by far the least-used alternative method, falling behind those as well as AliPay and WeChat Pay, bank-owned “PayID” and “Beem It” services, and in-app mobile payment options. Crypto had the worst usage-to-awareness ratio by far, the survey showed.      “Although many respondents had heard of ‘cryptocurrencies’, very few had used a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to actually make a consumer payment over the past year,” RBA said.      The bank has previously cast doubt on crypto’s potential to overtake existing payment rails.      This appears to be the first time that RBA’s CPS survey asked respondents about cryptocurrency. The survey had been conducted on five previous occasions.      RBA found that cash use in Australia is down in 2019, especially among younger demographics such as those under 40, who paid by cash in just 15 percent of recorded transactions. Even older groups are moving away from cash, the survey found. But it remains the most popular payment method for those 65 and up.      The survey also found that mobile payment methods are on the rise. That growth is being driven by younger demographics as well.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/20/80-of-australians-know-about-crypto-but-only-1-use-it-central-bank-study,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/873d8683434796f536590a60ffb5b99218672f9b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383444,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvBf,1584694800,What an Uptick in 'Coinjoins' Says About Bitcoin's Value Proposition,"With the global economy reeling from the coronavirus crisis, bitcoiners are increasingly turning to crypto wallets with privacy features.      A masking feature called “coinjoin” batches transactions together so it’s harder to identify specific participants. Some refer to it as “mixing,” but others dislike that term for its associations with money laundering.      The bitcoin-centric Samourai Wallet, a suite of apps that operates without the involvement of a central custodian, facilitated more batched transactions so far in March than any other month since the feature was first released on desktop last summer.    According to bitcoin podcaster Matt Odell, the competing Wasabi Wallet is currently the most popular coinjoin option, with 3,769 downloads since March 3, followed by Samourai Wallet then JoinMarkethttps://joinmarket.me/ob/. Odell said Samourai’s addition of Whirlpool mobile support in February 2020 was “a game-changer.”    “Mobile support is a huge step forward in user experience,” Odell said. “All bitcoin users should be encouraged to use coinjoin otherwise they expose their transaction history to those they pay and those who pay them.”      By his tally, the number of coinjoin cycles run through Whirlpool this month is 4,758, more than double the number in February. Samourai Wallet said in a statement that the term “collaborative transaction” is more accurate than the colloquial “mixing” because transactions happen directly between users.      “This is a fundamentally different proposition than custodial tumblers or ‘mixers’ like Helix,” said Samourai Wallet, referring to the service that landed its creator in legal trouble with the U.S. Department of Justice last month.      However, it’s tricky for new bitcoiners to use such privacy tech because many exchanges, like Coinbase, Binance or even smaller exchanges like Bits of Gold, flag mixing wallets as a sign of suspicious activity.      Although Bits of Gold CEO Youval Rouach said his exchange saw hundreds of new users over the past two weeks, with new user signups up over 139 percent, they won’t be able to cash out to Samourai Wallet.      “We see regulation not as a hurdle, but as a step forward toward mainstream adoption,” Rouach said, adding that regulators may consider mixer wallets a “red flag” and “brokers should report those transactions to the anti-money laundering authorities.”      In the U.S., attorney Rafael Yakobi said such policies aren’t necessary because there are legitimate safety considerations for maintaining financial privacy.      “Maintaining the privacy of your balances and ties to all past and future transactions, that’s not suspicious,” Yakobi said. “It’s just a normal thing that people should be doing.”      Separately, he believes the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) May 2019 guidance indicates non-custodial services are exempt from money transmitter requirements because they don’t “accept and transmit value on behalf of users.”      Attorney Gabriel Shapiro is less certain about FinCEN’s approach to non-custodial wallets with group transactions.      “Money transmitter laws are very broad and powerful,” Shapiro said. “I am not confident that the mere fact that Samourai does [group transactions] on a ‘non-custodial’ basis is sufficient to protect them from the ambit of financial regulations.”      Regardless of legal ambiguity in some jurisdictions, privacy tools are essential to bitcoin’s value proposition.    Value proposition    Bitcoin Core contributor James O’Beirne said the coronavirus crisis is inspiring some bitcoiners to question bitcoin’s core value proposition.      ""The inflation hedge use case becomes less compelling if bitcoin's performance mirrors equities; everyday investors will just use what they're already familiar with, which is stocks,"" O’Beirne said. ""Bitcoin has been prone to the same liquidity-induced sell-offs that stocks have, it's been kind of sobering. ... I think that will continue as traditional markets continue to decline.""      The price drop is especially relevant to businesses like miners and exchanges. If the bitcoin price drops low and stays there, it will be less profitable for miners to power the network.      ""Then all the commercial infrastructure of bitcoin is generally going to require longer block confirmation times,” O’Beirne said. “If the security gets low enough in bitcoin, doing the final settlement might start to take as long as it does in the traditional system. Then that big benefit of bitcoin gets impaired.”      Bitcoin’s prospective usage as an investment hedge or faster payments network remains unclear. But the censorship resistance use case is still intact so far. According to a source with knowledge of the matter, there is a six-man effort to use cryptocurrency to buy supplies for a medical mask factory in Iran, a nation devastated by both economic sanctions and a coronavirus outbreak that claimed more than 1,284 Iranian lives so far.      These rare cases, using cryptocurrency to buy medicine or supplies despite compliance challenges, do not appear to be a leading use case for the growing popularity of group transactions. When asked if they use such privacy tools, the Iranian factory source said he doesn’t know what a “mixer” is and they’ve used just $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency, both bitcoin and the stablecoin tether (USDT).      As Yakobi pointed out, many bitcoiners around the world see batched transactions as a regular part of their privacy-tech setup. Batching bitcoin might be comparable to choosing not to write your name in ink on every dollar bill you accept or send.      Since the Bitcoin blockchain is public, regular transactions state the user’s address in simple, clear letters. Not writing your name is a good way to not attract stalkers or thieves down the line. O’Beirne said bitcoin is still in its infancy, too immature as a technology to be useful for resisting law enforcement. Beyond fungibility, self-custody is still rare among bitcoin enthusiasts.      “In reality, maybe 0.1 percent of anybody is going to do that [self-custody],” O’Beirne said. “But having this option is really important.”      Along those lines, Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy volunteer Sarah Wiesner said batched transactions are becoming more important as governments like her own in Israel ramp up surveillance measures in the name of coronavirus containment. She sees learning about such privacy-focused wallets as a routine security step for the real circumstances she lives in.      “A mixer is not enough, you also need to make your device somewhat safe from mass surveillance,” Wiesner said. “With cash being banned or discouraged [in Tel Aviv], using mixers will be much more important.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/20/what-an-uptick-in-coinjoins-says-about-bitcoins-value-proposition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a4b96ebd375ab0f42d0d43ad1e18c91248ae1b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
