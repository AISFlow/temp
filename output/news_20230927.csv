18125987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553146,1695855631,Factors That Suggest A Recovery For The ADA Price,"Even with the Cardano network hitting seeing good metrics over the last month, the ADA price has remained rather stale in its performance. However, this trend might soon change for the digital asset as multiple developments have emerged that could fast-track its recovery. Cardano Whales Go To Market It is no secret that Cardano whales have often doubled down on their positions even at times when the digital asset has suffered from the bear trends. This has not changed, especially with the most recent dip in the ADA price, which sent the whales into a buying frenzy instead of dumping their holdings. Related Reading: Cardano: Factors That Could Drive ADA Price As High As $12 Earlier in the week, ADA fell as low as $0.2422, which is the second-lowest that the price has been this month but this did not deter believers in the coin. Instead, Cardano whales increased their activity, suggesting that they were scrambling to buy the digital asset at what is believed to be a low price. Whales increase activity following dip | Source: IntoTheBlock Data from IntoTheBlock showed that these whales moved over $3 billion worth of ADA on Monday alone. While this doesn’t exactly serve as evidence for buying, the time frame in which this happened is what points toward accumulation. The whales began to move these tokens not long after the price dip. Additionally, since then, the digital asset has been showing strength with the ADA price recovering and eventually beating the resistance at $0.245. This continued show of strength on the part of the altcoin suggests that the whales had been buying the token rather than selling it. In this case, they expect the ADA price to continue to rise, and choose to add to their positions. ADA Price Could Be Poised For A Rally Another interesting development on the Cardano network that could boost the ADA price is the rise in its active users. IntoTheBlock’s data showed a prominent jump in the daily active users that brought it up to over 42,500 addresses. This translates to a more than 60% increase from the prior figures. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Barrels Past $5.2 Billion, Is It Time To Buy? Now, the daily active addresses have begun to correct downward with the DeFi tracking website DeFiLlama showing a total of 31,846 active users in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, this remains significant, surpassing the likes of Avalanche at 29,042 daily active users. This surge in active addresses suggests rising interest in the Cardano network. Given that ADA is the token that powers the entire ecosystem, a rise in activity means more demand for the token as users need it to carry out transactions. The ADA price has also been trading in a tight range for some time. So a bounce from there would see the token’s price retest the $0.26 resistance in no time.

Curve Has Enjoyed A Sharp Rally Over The Past Week CRV has gone against the grain recently as it has registered some sharp bullish momentum during a period where the largest coins in the sector, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have struggled. Following this latest uptrend, the Curve DAO token’s price has risen above the $0.52 mark. Here is a chart that shows how the cryptocurrency has performed over the past month: Looks like the value of the coin has significantly gone up in recent days | Source: CRVUSD on TradingView In the past week, CRV is up more than 20%, which makes it the best-performing coin among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The outperformance is by quite a distance, too, as many of the assets are in the red for the period. Now, the main question on the minds of the Curve DAO token holders is: can the asset keep up its rally? In the sharp surge a few days back, the asset had briefly managed to breach the $0.56 level, but the asset had quickly returned to the current level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Now Most Sustainably-Powered Global Industry: Data Since then, CRV has been moving sideways, suggesting a slowdown in the buying pressure. While the asset has continued to hold at the current levels positive, some investors may be becoming restless, like a certain whale. CRV Whale Has Made A Sizeable Deposit To Binance Today According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large CRV transfer has been spotted on the Ethereum blockchain during the past day. The transaction in question involved the movement of about 33.3 million CRVs, worth approximately $17.3 million at the time the transfer took place on the network. Given the large size of the move, it’s likely that a whale entity is behind it. As for what this humongous holder may have wanted to accomplish with the transfer, the full details may reveal some context. This massive transfer appears to have only needed a fee of $0.56 to go through | Source: Whale Alert It would seem like the sending address in the case of this transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform and was likely the whale’s personal, self-custodial wallet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Return To Selling Mode, More Downside Soon? The destination of the move was the Binance exchange. As one of the main reasons investors use these platforms is for selling-related purposes, there is a chance that the deposit has been made for dumping. If this is truly the whale losing patience and taking profits at the current price level, then the Curve DAO token may observe at least a temporary pullback in the coming days.

18124689,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553215,1695852052,XRP Price At Risk? SEC Chair’s Congressional Testimony Fuels Ripple’s Legal Battle,"The cryptocurrency sector, particularly Ripple Labs, has been embroiled in a scenario of concern and uncertainty following a contentious exchange between the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) chair, Gary Gensler, and the House Financial Services Committee in Congress which could affect the XRP price. Despite Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC, Gensler’s stance remains unchanged, as he emphasized the regulatory body’s determination to pursue an interlocutory appeal in the ongoing case. This has raised further questions and apprehension within the industry. Congressman Highlights Ripple Case’s Far-From-Over Status During the hearing, Congressman Stephen F. Lynch expressed his concern about the potential pattern whereby court battles become the norm to determine the classification of individual tokens as securities. While Gensler did not respond directly, he mentioned the SEC’s filing for an interlocutory appeal, highlighting the regulator’s intent to continue the legal battle. Lynch acknowledged that the case is far from over. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Brushes Off Market Downtrend, Scores 11% In Last Week On August 17, Judge Torres granted the SEC’s request to file an interlocutory appeal, granting the regulatory body an opportunity to present a compelling case to the Second Circuit. However, it’s important to note that this permission only allows the SEC to file the motion for an interlocutory appeal, presenting a significant opening for the regulator to challenge the previous ruling and seek a different outcome. These recent developments, as highlighted by Congressman Lynch, indicate that the ongoing Ripple case may take considerable time to resolve. As a result, XRP is likely to remain stagnant, trapped in a consolidation phase, or potentially retracing beyond its current levels. This could potentially push the cryptocurrency to pursue another annual low, extending beyond the $0.4225 mark reached on August 17. XRP Price Analysis Points To Potential Macro Uptrend Despite the legal battles and the uncertainty surrounding the current state of the crypto market, some signs might point to a different scenario, where XRP could follow a macro uptrend. Technical analysis highlights a pattern resembling the last market cycle, which consists of five phases: rise, crash, retrace, reaccumulation, and eventual breakout. Drawing parallels to previous cycles, many coins have experienced explosive growth beyond their previous all-time highs after the reaccumulation phase. For instance, Bitcoin went through its reaccumulation phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, due to the ongoing lawsuit, XRP has entered a more prolonged reaccumulation phase in the form of an Elliott wave triangle, similar to the previous cycle. Currently, the market is in phase E, which suggests a potential retracement upwards, followed by another dip to lower levels. Eventually, there is anticipation for a breakout from this massive triangle, leading to a new all-time high likely to occur next year or the year after. Related Reading: LINKing The Dots: Why Chainlink Could Be The Altcoin To Watch, Top Trader Says While some argue that the XRP price fate depends on Bitcoin’s performance, it is worth noting that when comparing XRP to BTC, it is also within an accumulation range and exhibits a bullish outlook. From this perspective, XRP is expected to outperform other alternative coins significantly. However, for the XRP price to sustain an extended uptrend in the near term, it must overcome significant resistance levels that pose potential challenges. In the immediate time frame, XRP faces a resistance at $0.5132, followed by two additional formidable barriers, which are expected to be particularly challenging in the coming weeks. XRP’s 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages (MAs) are currently positioned at $0.5194 and $0.5318, respectively. These MAs, once considered reliable support levels, have failed to hold, necessitating a significant catalyst for XRP to surpass them. This is evident in the chart, depicting the partial victory on July 13, when XRP surged above both MAs. However, since August, XRP has been trading below them.

Egorov’s DeFi debt profile was revealed on August 1 following a Curve Finance hack that extracted $73.5 million worth of assets across various liquidity pools. As expected, the exploit caused a significant decline in the price of CRV, with the Curve governance token losing over 24% of its value in a single day, based on data from CoinMarketCap. This fall in CRV’s market price brought much attention to Egorov’s multiple debt positions. According to a report by blockchain research firm Delphi Digital, it was revealed that the Curve Finance founder owed around $100 million across several DeFi protocols. Interestingly, these loans were collateralized by 427.5 million CRV tokens, representing 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply. Therefore, the dwindling price of CRV presented a threat of liquidation, which could have been dangerous to the entire DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Curve Finance Announces $1.85 Million Bounty For Stable Pool Exploiter Michael Egorov Closes Debt Profile On Aave Protocol According to a report on Wednesday by the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, Micheal Egorov has now cleared his debt on the Aave protocol. The report stated that the Curve Founder deposited 68 million CRV, worth $35.5 million, on DeFi lending protocol Silo before proceeding to borrow $10.77 million worth of the stablecoin crvUSD. After that, Egorov swapped the crvUSD tokens for USDT and finalized the repayment of his debt on the Aave Protocol. Related Reading: Curve Finance Exploiter Returns 61,000 ETH After Protocol’s Stern Warning Egorov’s Current Debt Profile Based on more data from Lookonchain, Michael Egorov’s total debt now stands at $42.7 million spread across 4 lending protocols: Fraxlend, Silo, Inverse Finance, and Cream Finance. In detail, the Curve Finance founder has his largest debt on Silo, where he owes 17.14 million crvUSD backed by 105.8 million CRV, worth $55.3 million. On Fraxlend, Egorov owes 13.08 million FRAX, collateralized by 68.7 million CRV, valued at $35.94 million. While on Inverse Finance, Michael Egorov has an outstanding debt of 10 million DOLA, backed by 66.18 million CRV, worth $34.5 million. The Curve Finance founder’s lowest debt can be found on Cream Finance, which comprises 2.02 million USDT and 506,000 USDC, secured by 13 million CRV, valued at $6.8 million. Altogether, Egorov’s $42.7 million debt is backed by 253.67 million CRV, worth $132.53 million, representing 28.87% of the total CRV circulating supply.

42419505,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEk2v,1695849781,SEC’s Gensler Throws More Crypto Punches in Congressional Hearing,"The chief of the U.S. securities watchdog fired another public broadside at industry practices, even as his agency is embroiled in court battles with crypto firms.  Chair Gary Gensler was tight-lipped about what the Securities and Exchange Commission will do with spot bitcoin ETFs after its recent legal setback.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler continued his combative stance against crypto ""hucksters"" in congressional testimony on Wednesday, declining to answer the industry's most urgent questions while arguing that digital assets companies have been dangerously careless with customer assets.  In remarks before the House Financial Services Committee, Gensler maintained his consistent criticism of the way crypto companies manage customers’ funds, saying that commingling assets “is a recipe that’s not led to good results.”  And the chief of the securities agency said his agency still hasn’t decided what to do about a judge’s ruling that sent the SEC back to the drawing board on its spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) position.  “It’s still an active consideration of the commission,” Gensler said in his testimony. ""We have great respect for the courts.""  A judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals told the SEC in August to rethink its view on these applications for bitcoin ETFs. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote that the agency’s rejection in the Grayscale Investments case had been ""arbitrary and capricious."" Gensler’s testimony didn’t reveal what the agency will do next, or when it will act.  Much of the hearing focused on non-crypto issues, including a looming shutdown of the federal government and whether the SEC is focusing too much on climate or other issues. As in previous hearings, Wednesday’s meeting saw an acute partisan divide, with influential Democrats praising Gensler and Republicans alleging he was harming consumers or small businesses.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the panel’s chairman, noted the SEC’s “losing streak with the courts” and criticized its “crusade against the digital assets ecosystem” that the congressman argued is causing confusion and “lasting damage” in the industry.  During his turn to question Gensler, he elicited the latest confirmation from Gensler that bitcoin is “not a security.”  Meanwhile, the crypto industry’s business before the agency may be slowed soon. Gensler indicated the SEC is bracing for a potential government shutdown next week, which the chairman said would sap the agency’s staffing by more than 90%.  ""Senior leadership would be there, but we'd be down to a skeletal staff,"" he said, suggesting that the day-to-day reviews and approvals of SEC filings will be significantly slowed.  Of the agency’s 5,000-person staff, the hundreds of people who would be working at any time during a closure won’t be paid, Gensler said. “It’s hard on people.”  He declined to answer a question from Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) about the SEC’s other high-profile legal dustup in its case against Ripple, when a judge ruled the company hadn’t violated federal securities law in selling XRP to retail investors, noting it was an ongoing matter before the court.  Lynch, who equated the SEC accusations against Binance with the pre-collapse behavior at FTX, also contended that giving the industry a harbor of regulation might perversely leave a firm legally blameless in another implosion.  Gensler responded that any congressional action would have to solve the problem of commingled assets in crypto, saying, “If Congress did anything, it would be separating out those conflicts.”  Read More: U.S. House Lawmakers Push SEC’s Gensler to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETF ‘Immediately’",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,"Jesse Hamilton, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/27/secs-gensler-throws-more-crypto-punches-in-congressional-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07c078f9b506896ff4e7fbb51bb8fee8fa6a0cfb-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Looking at price action, TRB is up 640% in 2023, surging 269% in the past month alone and reversing losses of 2022. A spike in trading volume is behind this resurgence, suggesting bull engagement. TRB Prices Rallying, Reverses 2022 Losses With TRB galloping past $44 and 2022 highs, the token has outpaced some of the top coins in the sphere, including XRP and Bitcoin (BTC). For context, Bitcoin is struggling to break above $30,000. On the other hand, XRP has reversed all gains registered following a court ruling declaring XRP as a commodity. TRB is more than 6X from 2023 lows and surging in a crypto winter. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Brushes Off Market Downtrend, Scores 11% In Last Week A look at onchain data shows that though there are hints of retailers taking profits at spot rates, the number of TRB on exchanges has been dropping in the past week. This contraction indicates that retailers and whales could accumulate, adding more TRB. An analysis of the top TRB whales with over $1 million of tokens reveals interesting patterns. For instance, a fresh whale, “0x656”, holds 111.89K TRB ($6.06 million), a figure accumulated in the past three weeks. Buying at an average of $28.1, the whale has an unrealized profit of over $2.92 million at spot rates. Another new whale, “0x8f8”, accumulated 65.7K TRB ($3.6 million) in the past five days at an entry price of $34.5. With TRB edging higher, the associated address has an unrealized profit of $1.33 million. Moreover, on-chain data shows that these whales mostly received their TRB from Binance and OKX. While prices have been rallying, on-chain trackers reveal that none of the above whales had moved their coins to exchanges. This points to confidence and expectations of more price gains going forward. Tellor Rallying Because of Chainlink? TRB’s rally coincided with SWIFT’s announcement that it had completed its trials leveraging Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) in late August. Then, a SWIFT representative said the goal was to drive interoperability and ensure tokenization reaches its full potential. Days after this news, TRB broke above June highs, cementing its place above $13. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Huge Double-Digit Breakout For Bitcoin Price Presently, parallel data suggests that the surge in TRB appears to be driven by fear of missing out, mostly from short-term traders and speculators. IntoTheBlock data on September 27 shows that short-term wallet holders have increased their TRB holdings, with over 72% of TRB holders in the money.

Prosecutors pushed back against a motion to release Bankman-Fried from detention during his trial next month, saying arguments that arguments that he won't be able to meaningfully work on his defense are very vague and don't hold up given his legal team's experience.  ""The Renewed Motion largely recycles the defendant’s generalized claims regarding the manner in which he would like to assist his counsel in his defense,"" the filing said.

42409638,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKU7,1695845703,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Biggest Grift? His ‘Best In Class’ Exchange,"At least WeWork had flashy buildings to flaunt for the billions of dollars ex-CEO Adam Neumann raised. But what did Sam Bankman-Fried have to show?  SBF, as he was often called, is a pathological liar, an alleged fraud and market manipulator and also a really horrible ex-boyfriend who’s pinning his entire downfall on his on-and-off girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who headed Alameda Research.  But the biggest lie that Bankman-Fried ever told likely has nothing to do with being a supposedly spendthrift billionaire who flew private or the backdoor code said to have been used to raid billions in customer funds from FTX.  It was probably the FTX exchange itself.  The very product Bankman-Fried paraded around the world to raise his billions and build political connections was error-prone, slow and often lagged during times of market volatility.  Customer service was said to be non-existent. An online complaint form was linked to a general email address that seldom replied.  FTX positioned itself as “built by traders, for traders” – given SBF’s and Ellison’s past work experience with Wall Street quant firm Jane Street – and quickly found a following in the depths of the previous bear market.  It went from processing a few thousand dollars in trading volumes after its 2019 launch to billions of dollars at its 2022 peak. These surging volumes and his company’s soaring valuation boosted Bankman-Fried’s ego, as he envisioned creating a one-stop exchange to trade anything from bitcoin to orange juice.  An army of venture capitalists, such as Sino Global Capital and Sequoia Capital, hyped the founder and exchange up. Crypto influencers on X (née Twitter) flashed affiliate links that gave discounts on fees. The unsuspecting retail audience bought into the dreams.  When the exchange was new, its technical flaws were more forgivable, especially because Binance's early financial backing and Bankman-Fried's reputation as a skilled arbitrageur gave the startup a sheen of respectability (even if it routinely listed garbage like the Shitcoin Futures Index).  Another facet that boosted growth was Bankman-Fried’s whole Effective Altruism shenanigans. Loved by mainstream media and investors alike, the young ""boy genius"" wanted to eventually donate everything he made to charity.  FTX would, in its later years, even flaunt a foundation page on its site that claimed to give 1% of revenue to various causes. This made the ultimate casino for users: A gambling addiction probably didn’t matter as long as it was helping fuel charitable goods.  Except, the product didn’t work as well as advertised. Complaints ranged from poor order matching to delayed market orders. FTX’s slow execution soon became a popular joke.  Popular trader @HsakaTrades once complained about orders taking a long time to fill. Bankman-Fried, in his deflective way, blamed the web browser the trader was using. @HsakaTrades had none of that — pointing to the scores of similar issues among FTX users.  Such issues were echoed on other social media sites and forums.  “Yeah, as an exchange FTX was pretty terrible,” dcolkitt, a user from the popular technology forum Hacker News, claimed. “The matching engine was notorious for being high latency, unreliable, and having all sorts of undocumented issues.”  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Everyone but Himself for FTX's Collapse | Opinion  “Every algo trader there will tell you horror stories about trying to cancel an open order, getting a cancel confirmation, and then getting notified that the order was executed. Sometimes seconds later,” dcolkitt added.  “Occasionally sending out zero balances was another FTX special,” said another user, Vgatherps.  In hindsight, we now know SBF’s hedge fund Alameda was often the entity on the opposite side of every FTX trade, which goes far in explaining the poor fills, the lag experienced by traders, and just about everything that was going wrong at the exchange. The firm, after all, had a front-seat view to all trades on FTX – which contributed to the $1 billion in claimed revenues it made in 2020.  Today, it's unclear if supposedly sophisticated investors like Singapore's wealth fund Temasek and storied venture financier Tiger Global were sold more on Bankman-Fried's vision or lured in by the speculative frenzy in 2021.  All this raises the question: Did anyone even use FTX before investing?",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/27/sam-bankman-frieds-biggest-grift-his-best-in-class-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47bc8affa73fae14a97749d898bba47428b2843f-850x479.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to filings with the SEC, Franklin Templeton has filed for a bitcoin spot ETF while Hashdex has filed for a spot ether ETF.  The SEC has a maximum of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF from the date the filing appears in the Federal Register, which would place a decision date for these proposed funds in late May 2024, with several interim deadlines where it can ask for additional public feedback and thereby delay the final decision.  The Commission has frequently delayed decisions, looking to use the entire 240 days. A decision on a batch of ETF applications from the likes of BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise and Valkyrie Digital Assets was originally expected in mid-October.  Ahead of a potential federal government shutdown, the SEC has extended its decision deadlines for spot bitcoin ETF applications from Ark 21Shares and Global X, and may delay the balance by Friday.

Renowned crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa, known for his insightful market predictions on the social media platform X, has voiced strong support for Chainlink, highlighting its promising fundamentals. With a current price of $7.45 on CoinGecko, LINK has been steadily gaining traction, posting a 0.2% gain in the past 24 hours and a 9.1% increase over the last seven days. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Struggle To Break $21 Barrier – What Lies Ahead? Sherpa’s Vote Of Confidence On Chainlink Altcoin Sherpa’s LINK endorsement carries significant weight in the crypto community. He believes that Chainlink is poised for exceptional performance in the next bull cycle, emphasizing its resilience during the crypto market’s ups and downs. In his own words: “LINK: Still one of the few coins that I would consider just buying a bag of and letting it sit for the next six months [plus]. I think this is going to be a very strong one for the next cycle. Core infrastructure for a ton of projects with few competitors.” LINK market cap hits $4.3 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com LINK’s Steady Price Growth Chainlink’s recent price surge has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Over the past two weeks, LINK’s price has climbed from a low of $6.53 to a peak of $7.30. This impressive rally has left many wondering about the driving factors behind it. One significant factor contributing to LINK’s recent upswing is the dynamics of its availability on exchanges. Santiment, a prominent on-chain analytics company, has noted that historically, whenever a substantial amount of LINK is transferred to exchanges, it triggers positive price movements. This suggests that investors are actively seeking to acquire and hold LINK, anticipating future gains. There are a total of 81 fresh wallets created on Sept 15 started withdrawing $LINK from #Binance on Sept 18. And these wallets have withdrawn a total of 4.7M $LINK ($31.58M) from #Binance so far.

42409644,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKuZ,1695841452,Jade Protocol Faces Calls to Liquidate $31M Token Treasury,"The native token of crypto club Jade Protocol surged Wednesday after a longtime member proposed the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) liquidate its $31 million treasury and issue redemptions to token-holders.  Jade Protocol is an investment group that sources early-stage crypto deals. Its JADE token – which trades on the Avalanche and BSC blockchains – is currently an access ticket into the community. Under the “Dissolve DAO” call-to-action posted earlier this week, JADE would instead become a cash out.  In his Sep. 25 proposal, a member with the screen name VampireOfCrypto cited darkening regulatory skies that he said are slowing Jade’s progress and imperiling all DAOs, which are crypto collectives whose token-holders have a say in decision-making.  Stormy legal questions and the brutal crypto winter have combined to freeze out crypto trading volume as well as Jade’s deal flow, according to the investor, who joined Jade’s Discord server in July 2022. “The DAO poses a major investment risk to all token holders,” VampireOfCrypto said in the post.  “Distributing all treasury funds back to all token holders without delay is the ultimate win-win situation for everyone,” he wrote. VampireOfCrypto did not respond to a request for comment.  Jade is the latest crypto project to face pressure from its investors to shut down.  In the past 12 months a group of activist investors have pushed for ""rage quits” and treasury redemptions in many DAOs. They claim cash-outs are the only way to protect investors from floundering DAOs, receiving pushback and plenty of profit. Some of those investors have been joining Jade, according to a statement in the Discord server from Jade’s press liaison Jon Ray.  But Jade’s dissolution proposal does not appear to be their doing.  “It is a sad and frustrating reflection on the state of legislation in our space that one of the most positive, supportive and oldest members of the community is bringing this forward,” Kevin Randleman, a high-ranking DAO member, said in the Discord.  Nonetheless, Randleman conceded in the Discord that “the challenges Jade faces are real” and said it will be up to the community to decide its future.  He outlined a series of bureaucratic and technical barriers that need to be cleared before a redemption could happen. He further called for the creation of a $2 million “legal defense fund” to help core contributors wind down the DAO if the dissolution is approved.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/27/jade-protocol-faces-calls-to-liquidate-31m-token-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cebec9d7e414d4d44f22ae4d81319410428ade5-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This would make Kraken the first crypto exchange to explore trading options outside crypto assets. Bloomberg reported that it plans to launch the service as soon as 2024.  Previously, bankrupt crypto exchange FTX’s U.S. arm offered stock trading for its users. Robinhood (HOOD) and Wealthsimple are among the traditional trading platforms currently offering trading of some crypto tokens.  The exchange plans on using a service built by a new division, Kraken Securities, which already acquired the necessary regulatory permits in the U.K. and has yet to be approved in the U.S., the person told Bloomberg.  Kraken declined to comment on the potential for a stock trading platform to CoinDesk. “Kraken is always exploring how it can power the global adoption of cryptocurrencies. While we can’t comment on rumors or speculation, we’re looking to broaden and enhance our offering so clients continue to have secure and seamless access to Kraken’s full product suite,” a spokesperson for the exchange told CoinDesk.  The crypto exchange recently doubled down on its efforts in countries outside of the U.S. amid increased regulatory scrutiny in the country. As part of that, the company recently had to shut down its crypto staking service and pay a $30 million fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges.

The crypto closed bullish at $7.4 yesterday, September 26, with over 7% increase. LINK remains bullish, with an 11% seven-day price increase and over 2% gain in the last 24 hours. But while the token’s price continues to increase, data shows the trading volume has declined 17% in the last 24 hours. What could be the reason behind this contradiction? Chainlink Price Continues To Surge In an X post on September 24, Chainlink network announced it had recorded multiple integrations across six blockchains. These include Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon, and BNB Chain. Also, yesterday, September 26, gaming platform BetSwirl announced that it integrated Chainlink’s CCIP across Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. According to the post, this CCIP integration will help “BetSwirl enable seamless, secure, and reliable cross-chain token transfers” Related Reading: XRP Price Analysis: 4-Month Chart Dynamics Decoded By Crypto Analyst This increased adoption across multiple chains expanded Chainlink’s user base, a plausible factor behind LINK’s resilience amid the prevailing bearish market. Although LINK briefly slipped off the $7.5 level to $7.3 yesterday, it has since recovered momentum. Given the ongoing movement, the crypto asset could break the $7.8 resistance and record higher highs soon. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is number 3 among the top weekly gainers after CRV and PEPE. It has also secured a position on the top daily gainers’ chart. Although the price strides are bullish, the trading volume, down 17%, raises concern about whether LINK can sustain the rally. It indicates reduced trading activity, a possible sign that buyers have reached saturation and paused to weigh their next move. This setup bodes badly for LINK as it could signal the entrance of sellers, which will exert downward pressure on the token’s price. Price Surge Drops Chainlink (LINK) Supply On Crypto Exchanges According to Santiment’s report on September 24, Chainlink remains one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in September. It outlined that, unlike most assets, LINK’s price often records an initial boost when holders move their tokens from exchanges. Santiment noted that the asset’s price increased 23% in two weeks as the exchange supply flowed back to cold wallets. Also, the analytics platform reported that LINK exchange supply increased by 17.2%, reaching a 2023 high on September 14. However, on September 24, 10 days later, the token’s exchange supply dropped to 16.4%. This observation is a plausible reason behind Chainlink’s declining trading volume.

The token trades above the simple moving averages of $6.494 and $6.719 and two key support levels. LINK is approaching the overbought area, forming a bullish candlestick as buyers vie to conquer the $7.823 resistance.

Bankman-Fried's attorneys asked that he be allowed to use a laptop with no internet access to take notes during his trial, though he would not actually be able to hold onto the laptop outside of the courtroom. Judge Lewis Kaplan, the Southern District of New York judge overseeing the case, signed off on the request on Wednesday.  The defense team said in its proposed order that the laptop would be the same machine Bankman-Fried used when he was out on bail earlier this year, though a technology consultant would disable any network connectivity functions.  A paralegal will be tasked with bringing the laptop to court in the morning and take it back from Bankman-Fried after the trial ends every day. The trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 3.  The judge also signed off on a defense request that Bankman-Fried be allowed to wear a suit in court. The U.S. Marshals Service or the Metropolitan Detention Center will have to accept and maintain three suits, four dress shirts, three ties, a belt and other clothing items.  Bankman-Fried appeared in court wearing a suit during hearings for the better part of this year, but has appeared in a prison uniform since he was remanded into custody last month.  The defense team has already lost two bids to have Bankman-Fried temporarily released since he was remanded, but has made another attempt, offering to impose strict conditions around the onetime FTX executive. Judge Kaplan set a 5:00 p.m. ET deadline today for the Department of Justice to comment on the request and scheduled a hearing to discuss the motion at 10:00 a.m. ET on Thursday.

42409647,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcML1B,1695838493,Bitcoin Slides Back Towards $26K as Surging Interest Rates Trigger Macro Jitters,"The price of bitcoin (BTC) appeared set to retake the $27,000 level early Wednesday, but the rally was turned back alongside a renewed slide in the U.S. stock market.  In mid-afternoon action, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were each lower by about 0.6% – by themselves, not large declines, but both indexes are now lower by about 10% since the start of August.  Bitcoin is flat over the past 24 hours just shy of $26,200, but earlier in the day had risen above $26,800. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is higher by 0.15%.  Rising rates not necessarily bad for bitcoin  Although interest rates are continuing to trend upwards, which in theory should put pressure on the price of bitcoin, some have argued that the typical relationship between interest rates and bitcoin is breaking down, while others believe there's a bullish argument to be made about bitcoin based on its technical aspects.  On a recent CoinDesk TV appearance, Mark Yusko, Chief Investment Officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, said that all eyes should be on the next bitcoin halving event -- which occurs every four years -- which will change the 'seasons' of bitcoin.  ""Crypto summer started in June and goes till next June. And that is a slow but steady increase back to fair value,"" he said. ""We start with the halving, pushing us from summer to fall. That’s the parabolic time when people go crazy and buy with leverage.""  The decline today in equity markets came as the 10-year Treasury yield surged another nine basis points to a fresh 16-year high of 4.63%. Alongside the rise in interest rates, the price of oil was ahead by more than 3.5% to a new 2023 high of $93.53 per barrel. The term “stagflation” – suggesting a combination of slow growth and fast inflation in the economy – hasn’t been seen a lot since the 1970s, but quickly rising rates and oil prices are likely to spark an increase in usage.  To wit, a Wall Street Journal survey showed 41% of U.S. chief financial officers (CFOs) as trimming capital spending plans and 42% cutting back on operational costs in response to higher rates. A previous survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022 showed just 30% as planning on cutting capital spending and 27% looking to trim operational costs.  Don't hold your breath on ETFs  In addition to delays on decisions for a couple of spot bitcoin ETFs announced yesterday, the SEC on Wednesday extended deadlines on decisions on spot ether ETFs filings from ARK Invest and VanEck.

42409650,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMLB6,1695838012,How Ethereum Staking Stacks Up in the Proof-of-Stake Landscape,"“How often do you think about the Roman Empire?”  Many of us have likely seen this social media meme in recent weeks. But, if not, some context: spouses across the internet have been perplexed to learn that evidently, their husbands think about the Roman Empire quite often. Once or twice a week, in fact, appears to be the typical response.  The team at CoinDesk Indices has been thinking about the Roman Empire a lot lately. Basically every day. Why? Because of the recently launched composite ether staking rate, otherwise known as CESR.  CESR, licensed by CoinDesk Indices from CoinFund, tracks the annualized yield from staking as a validator on the Ethereum Beacon Chain. This staking rate, which currently hovers at about 3.75%, is a combination of two elements: the consensus base reward and the more volatile transaction reward.  The base reward has marched on a slow and steady decline — the direct result of a continuous increase of fresh validators joining the consensus ranks since staking went live after the Merge in September 2022. That increase was further accelerated by the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, when validators could withdraw their stake for the first time.  As more validators participate in the consensus of the network, the base reward distribution to the entire network increases proportional to the square root of the additional validators. The result is that the reward for each individual validator decreases slightly.  This constant stream of new staking participants — the current number of validators sits at about 800,000 — has been so substantial that it has even led some to propose a hard cap on the number of new validators that can enter the pool on any given day. The rationale being that the current “churn” limit of 12 new validators per epoch, (which equates to 2,700 validators, 86,400 ETH, or roughly $138,000,000 per day), is unsustainable long term. A queue controls how many can join at any given time and the capacity of that queue increases as the network grows*, which could eventually stress the functionality of the network.  See also: How Staking Rates Can Drive the Crypto Economy Forward | Opinion  The numbers don’t necessarily bear that out, however, as nearly every other proof-of-stake protocol seems to operate just fine, despite considerably higher staked-to-unstaked ratios. Additionally, the projected yield if Ethereum was 100% staked is 1.6%. It’s hard to see that rate being attractive to the millions of validators needed to reach that point, but anything is possible.  Regardless, the near-doubling in validators since the Merge one year ago has been impressive. Staking is clearly very popular. But Ethereum is far from the only proof-of-stake protocol in town, which raises the question: What — if anything — sets it apart from the rest?  Tokenomics matter. Pre-Merge, ether’s annualized supply inflation was over 3%. At the moment ... it hovers right around 0%.  Well, for one, inflation. Since EIP-1559 in 2021, Ethereum has implemented a mechanism that burns a portion of ether on every single transaction on the network. The result today is that this burn mechanic often (but not always) offsets the network’s inflationary token minting, and in fact on occasion the inflation is negative. Ethereum’s staking yield is therefore effectively a “real” yield.  Here, we look at some of the other larger proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, nearly all of which have been operating for years now, and evaluate their “real” staking rates. Many protocols boast higher annualized rates than Ethereum’s humble sub-4%. But, adjusted for their respective supply inflations, the “real” rates end up being far less impressive.  In fact, looking at the top PoS protocols by market capitalization in the CoinDesk Market Index, we find that despite advertising the second-lowest yield, after adjusting for supply inflation, Ethereum jumps to the second-highest. Only Polkadot is higher. If we begin to consider these in risk-adjusted terms, it’s no contest, particularly over longer time frames.  What we discover is that nearly every PoS chain has seen substantial supply inflation. In fact, with the exceptions of Ethereum and Cardano, every other PoS chain listed has averaged yearly inflation in the double-, and even triple-digits. So, while some chains boast double-digit yields for validating (or delegating to a validator), the reality is that in some instances a staker could have a negative “real” yield by the time they decide to un-stake.  ""Fully diluted valuation,"" often abbreviated FDV, is not a meme after all; in other words, tokenomics matter. Pre-Merge, ether’s annualized supply inflation was over 3%. At the moment, with the implementation of its burn mechanics, it hovers right around 0%, meaning what you see is pretty much what you get.  It should be obvious that this high-level overview by no means covers the various intricacies of each proof-of-stake protocol. They have their own unique goals, and consensus is achieved in different ways. The difficulty, access and cost of staking can vary widely from one chain to the next. But what is evident is that a tremendous amount of infrastructure and products are being built around it, both on- and off-chain.  See also: The State of Staking: 5 Challenges for the Ethereum Network  The advent of liquid staking is opening doors to an entirely new industry, rich with innovation and creativity. Other services are focusing heavily on simplifying the staking process, thereby removing the barriers to entry and enabling further decentralization in the space.  In the not too distant future, staking may be viewed as one’s civic duty. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Until then, CESR will keep marching on.  * For every 64,000 additional validators to the total pool, the number of new validators than can join increases by one validator per epoch (or 225 per day).",NEUTRAL,ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Max Good,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/27/how-ethereum-staking-stacks-up-in-the-proof-of-stake-landscape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1eb934240a7ae5e6ea8f0afb25da1be8f1f506e4-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While there is a chance that the price could end up swinging downward and crashing, a crypto analyst has predicted that a surge in the cryptocurrency’s price is on the horizon. Bitcoin Price Breakout Is Coming A crypto analyst who has grown to prominence on the TradingView site has put forward a bullish prediction for the Bitcoin price. The analyst who goes by the pseudonym Tolberti mapped out a yellow trend line which he believes points toward the next bull rally for the coin. Related Reading: Early Rejection Of 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF Sparks Concerns The trend line sits just above the $26,000 level which means that the cryptocurrency is currently close to it. The analyst explains that the BTC price remains bullish despite recent performance, especially as the month of October draws close. Using the Fibonacci retracement which sat at 0.618, Tolberti points out the next significant resistance for Bitcoin. From here, he puts it at $29,167, which after beating, the analyst expects the Bitcoin price to surge above $30,000. A surge of this magnitude would mean that the Bitcoin price rises at least 15% from its current level. Tolberti's chart outlining the forecast | Source: Tradingview.com However, it is not all easy sailing from here as the bears will not give up the fight easily. Speaking about the yellow trend line, the analyst said it is “a gateway to the ultra-huge bull market. Once it breaks, I expect a massive uptrend.” But he cautioned traders to “be aware of a possible retest first. Your stop-loss needs to be safe!” How High Can BTC Price Go? Tolberti’s bullish profile for the Bitcoin price also runs through to the long term. Just like a lot of other analysts, Tolberti expects the cryptocurrency to trade in the six digits in the next bull market. For his long-term prediction, he puts Bitcoin at a price of $125,000. According to a previous analyst, he believes that the Bitcoin price will reach this level sometime in the second quarter of 2025. Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency the analyst is bullish on. Altcoins were not left out of the post with the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP making an appearance as other bullish tokens. Related Reading: Upcoming Optimism Unlock Threatens To Drag OP Below $1 Given this forecast, Tolberti believes that the current price of Bitcoin is a good price for investors to buy. “26k is still a good price for Bitcoin to buy in the long term because I expect 120k in 2025,” the post read. Bitcoin is currently showing strength because it continues to hold above $26,000 after the SEC delayed the 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF decision. It is currently trending at $26,275, although it’s down 3% in the last week.

The document, filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, shows Kwon's lawyers are opposing any opportunity for the stablecoin creator to offer testimony to U.S. regulators. The lawyers argue that it would be ""impossible"" to bring Kwon to the U.S. because he remains detained indefinitely in Montenegro. The former executive, they say, also cannot provide written testimony to the SEC because it would violate his due process rights under U.S. law.  ""An order mandating something that is impossible serves no practical purpose and risks undermining judicial authority,"" Kwon's lawyers said in the filing.  The SEC asked the court last week for permission to interview Kwon about the Terra/Luna collapse before the case's discovery cut off date of October 13.  The SEC sued Terraform Labs in February, alleging the company misled investors about the safety of investing in its TerraUSD stablecoin, which offered yields of up to 20%.

For today’s issue, our Margaux Nijkerk sat down for an interview with Sreeram Kannan, the University of Washington computing professor who now serves as founder of EigenLayer, the most well-known among restaking pioneers. (Spoiler alert: He acknowledges the systemic risks flagged by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.)  Also in this week’s issue:  Google pushes deeper into blockchain.  How much do blockchain engineers get paid these days?  Mixed views on Ethereum’s progress since April’s Shapella upgrade.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  James Tromans, Google Cloud’s head of Web3. (CoinDesk TV)  GOOGLE BLOCKCHAIN: In a sign that big tech companies are nosing into blockchain, Google’s cloud-computing division is increasingly popping up in crypto news headlines, and top executives focused on Web3 are making the rounds with media. Last week, Google Cloud announced it would add 11 networks including Polygon, Optimism and Polkadot to its ‘BigQuery’ program for public datasets, originally set up for Bitcoin in 2018 and later expanded to additional chains including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin. “Over the past 18 months we’ve been investing in this space, we’ve continued to hire, we’ve continued to grow not only our business development and our go-to-market teams but also our product and engineering capabilities,” James Tromans, Google Cloud’s global head of Web3, told CoinDesk TV in an interview last week. “We’re not just fly-by-night.” On Sept. 14, Orderly Network, a decentralized exchange designed for white-labeling, posted on X that it would “exclusively develop off-chain components of DeFi infrastructure” on Google Cloud, and that it would be “actively involved in alpha testing Google’s Web3 innovations.” Over the past couple years, Google has announced business initiatives with BNB Chain, Celo, Polygon, Celo, Axie Infinity, LayerZero Labs, Solana and Tezos. It bears reminding readers that Google’s push to develop quantum computing has been posited as an existential threat to the blockchain industry, since theoretically such ultra-fast machines might be able to crack the cryptography underpinning digital-asset networks.  ETHEREUM’S BAD RAP: How has the Ethereum blockchain performed since April’s Shapella upgrade, which allowed staking withdrawals for the first time? It might depend on whom you ask, and how you ask the question. In a widely-circulated report, JPMorgan analysts noted that “the increase in network activity has been rather disappointing.” According to the bank’s calculations, the daily transaction count over the network has fallen by 12%, and daily active addresses are down 20%. The analysts acknowledged the steep drop in Ethereum’s energy consumption as a result of the “Merge” shift to a proof-of-stake network a year ago, as well as the overall reduction in issuance of new ETH – a bullish factor. But Akash Mahendra, director of Haven1 Foundation, which supports the Haven1 network, notes that the acute focus on Ethereum alone might take too myopic a view – since it might ignore the rapid growth of layer-2 networks that work atop Ethereum and have absorbed many of the transactions that might otherwise take place on the layer-1 blockchain. The build-out “yielded substantial improvements in scalability and alleviated congestion on the mainnet,” Mahendra said in emailed comments. Even so, transaction activity on Ethereum has been so anemic lately that the supply curve has recently reverted to being inflationary. A fresh source of criticism is that Ethereum developers appear to have fallen behind in their push toward the next big upgrade, known as Dencun. Galaxy’s Christine Kim wrote last week that the developers are now cautioning that they are unlikely to activate Dencun this year if they can’t get the upgrade launched on a test network before Devconnect, an Ethereum-focused conference set for mid-November in Istanbul.  YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE: Arbitrum Foundation, which maintains the development of the Arbitrum blockchain, said Sunday it had transferred 69 million (worth $59 million) in unclaimed ARB tokens to the network’s treasury, after the claim period ended.  BUT ARE YOU WINNING? The median pay globally among 570 blockchain engineers surveyed was $120,000, with those in North America getting $193,000, up 1.5% versus the prior year, according to a new Pantera study. (The study also found that 97% of crypto-industry employees take their salaries in fiat currencies, and that 88% of roles are remote.)  ALSO:  Mixin Network has confirmed a report from SlowMist, a blockchain security consultancy, that it was hacked for nearly $200 million on Sept. 23. Mixin said there was an attack on the database of its cloud service provider; snarky posters on X (Twitter) noted that the database was under centralized control, creating a single point of failure.

18118168,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553086,1695834020,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Long-Term Holders Deposit To Exchanges,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin long-term holders are making deposits to exchanges currently, something that could be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD Has Spiked Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, investors have been making deposits to spot exchanges recently. There are two relevant indicators here: the “exchange inflow” and the “exchange reserve.” The former of these keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that the holders are transferring to centralized exchanges, while the latter one measures the total amount sitting in the wallets of these platforms. When the value of the inflow metric spikes, it means that the investors are moving a large number of coins to the exchanges. As one of the main reasons why holders may make such transfers is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a sign that selling is occurring. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Now Most Sustainably-Powered Global Industry: Data Since selling activity occurs on the spot exchanges, the quant has restricted the exchange inflow and reserve indicators to track only the data related to the spot platforms. The analyst has also chosen another modifier on the exchange inflow: the “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD). In simple terms, what the CDD checks for is the activity of dormant coins in the market. Tokens that have been sitting in wallets for a long time accumulate a large number of “coin days” (where 1 coin day corresponds to 1 BTC staying still for 1 day) and when these coins finally move, the coin days are reset or “destroyed,” which is the number that the CDD measures. The exchange inflow CDD naturally only keeps track of the coin days being destroyed through transfers to exchanges. Now, here are the charts that show the trends in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) value of this Bitcoin indicator and the 14-day SMA exchange reserve: Looks like both of these metrics have gone up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant From the first graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD has registered a sharp spike recently. This would suggest that a potentially large number of dormant coins have been moved into these platforms. Usually, the CDD having large values like these can be a sign that the “long-term holders” (LTHs) are on the move. The LTHs (defined as holders carrying their coins since at least six months ago) are the most resolute bunch in the market, so their depositing to exchanges can be something to watch for, as it implies that the market has made even these diamond hands waver. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Return To Selling Mode, More Downside Soon? As is visible from the second chart, the exchange reserve has also gone up alongside this spike in the exchange inflow CDD, suggesting that there haven’t been enough withdrawals to make up for these inflows. It now remains to be seen what effect these possible selling moves from the LTHs may have on the Bitcoin price in the coming days.

Analyst Forecasts","The LINK price has been the best performer in the crypto top 20 by market cap over the past week, data from Coingecko shows. The cryptocurrency recently broke out of a critical level and a downtrend and seems poised to re-capture previously lost territory. Related Reading: LINK Price Extends Increase, Will Chainlink Bulls Be Able to Hit $8.5 Milestone? As of this writing, the LINK price trades at $7.70 with a 4% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 12% profit while other tokens in the top 20 have mostly seen losses, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) standing as the exception along with Chainlink. LINK Price About To Start Uptrend? When the LINK price broke below in early 2023, the cryptocurrency began to descend to its current levels. The price struggled to stabilize around $5.5, but once buyers stabilized the cryptocurrency around those levels, the token formed a sideways trend. Since May this year, the LINK price has been moving in this trend with a high of around $8. The chart below shows that trader Rekt Capital believes the token’s recent price action spells good news for LINK holders. The chart above shows that LINK broke above an essential trend after closing a weekly candle above $7. Thus, the cryptocurrency could rise to $10.5 before meeting any critical resistance. If the token can extend its gains, the next target could see LINK hitting $16.5 as an ultimate stand for bears to take back control and prevent a full-on bull run above $20. As of this writing, the crypto market, at least its two most important tokens, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are playing along on short timeframes. These cryptocurrencies recorded a 2% and 2.4% profit in the last 24 hours. Stars Align For Chainlink In addition to the favorable winds in the crypto market, the Chainlink platform is strengthening its fundamentals.

42409639,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKaj,1695830439,"ETH Staking Has a Bright Future, Despite Regulatory Uncertainty","Since Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022, the blockchain has been maintained and secured by users who stake ETH and run validators. The mechanism is simple. Validators deposit ETH in a smart contract, run software to validate and propose new blocks, and get paid for providing this service.  The Ethereum blockchain was designed so that staking can be accessible to any user that owns at least 32 ETH, with the hope that ETH owners around the world will choose to stake their assets, increasing the decentralization and security of the network.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Jason Hall is the CEO of Methodic Capital Management.  ETH staking allows users to provide a service to the network, contributing value to the asset they already own. Payment for this service is accrued in ETH, which has the added benefit of compounding any returns generated by the underlying asset.  Importantly, this payment is incurred without many risks. At time of writing, only 279 of 805,945 (0.03%) validators have lost any portion of the 32 ETH they deposited which can happen in a process called slashing, essentially a penalty for compromising network integrity.  Despite the volatility of the asset class, the major technical upgrades and many other risks associated with the technology, it is relatively safe to run a validator and receive staking rewards in return.  However, additional risk is incurred when intermediaries stake ETH on behalf of owners. Exchanges and staking providers offering this service have not always transparently reported staking returns, failing to link payments to the ETH staking rate and disclosing the risks associated with staking.  Additionally, to provide better user experiences (i.e. by removing staking lockups), some providers managed reserves of customer funds, financializing the staking service. As such, a number of staking service providers have been targeted by the SEC for offering staking services, which we believe has tarnished staking in the eyes of many observers.  Much of this confusion has been propagated by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Gary Gensler. Last year, Gensler stated that staking “looks very similar — with some changes of labeling — to lending.”  However, lending and staking are fundamentally different concepts, with different risks. Lending is an agreement between parties to exchange money today for money tomorrow, at the cost of an agreed-upon interest rate. Staking is a technical service that validators provide the Ethereum blockchain. The payment to validators is not fixed and is determined by network activity. Both activities need rules but the same ones shouldn’t apply.  Proper lending due diligence is a detailed, complex process. The investor (the “lender”) must first underwrite the credit quality of the entity they make a loan to (the “borrower”). Lenders assess the borrower’s credit by verifying the borrower’s ability to make interest payments and pay back the principal of the loan.  Given that borrowers have discretion on the use of funds once a loan is made, this process requires an analysis and assessment of a borrower's future performance. If this assessment is correct, lenders get their principal back plus interest. If wrong, lenders could lose part, or all, of the loan amount.  Staking Ethereum is a completely different arrangement and thus requires a completely different diligence process. Prospective validators must verify their understanding of the technical specifications of staking, answering questions like: are they running the correct software or will they be able to maintain internet uptime? Validators must also understand infrastructure security to ensure their signing keys are stored safely and not accessible to potential hacks.  Compensation for staking is not determined by validators but comes directly from the Ethereum network and consists of consensus rewards and transaction fees. Additionally, neither validators nor the Ethereum network have ability to move or rehypothecate (i.e. reinvest) staked assets. If validators make an honest mistake, like not maintaining internet uptime, the 32 ETH they deposited will most likely be returned without penalty. If they run malicious software to try to attack the network, their 32 ETH deposit will be penalized. Simply put, bad actors will be punished but less sophisticated or apathetic actors will not.  Despite these differences, regulators have recently been making the argument that staking should be regulated like lending. What this has functionally achieved is many investors are left without options. Ether has been flowing from regulated U.S. companies to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like Lido or Rocketpool.  Over the past six months, centralized exchanges Coinbase and Kraken staking are down 4% and 36%, respectively, while Lido and Rocketpool are up 56% and 85%. Many more investors are simply holding ETH and not staking it, due to regulatory fears. As a result, they are not earning staking rewards (~4% over the past 12 months), or contributing to the security of the Ethereum network.  See also: Coinbase, SEC Spar Over Definition of Securities, Nature of Staking  Currently, we believe one of the best available solutions in this regulatory environment is staking assets through private funds. The fund manager can conduct diligence on staking service providers on behalf of investors to identify the leading solutions. By pooling investor funds, managers can achieve economies of scale, driving down costs of staking, security, trading and so on.  A private fund structure also provides a layer of regulatory insulation when staking is run from under an investment advisor umbrella. Regulatory questions about, for example, whether staking services are a technology service or an investment activity become irrelevant if the manager is properly structured.  Additionally, private funds can be held in traditional balance sheet compatible fund shares, or crypto balance sheet friendly token form. A professional fund manager can continuously survey and assess partnerships in the industry to increase the efficacy, safety and liquidity available to investors.  The industry is building solutions to a myriad of problems caused by regulatory ambiguity. Service providers such as the Liquid Collective, in collaboration with the advocacy group Proof of Stake Alliance, address investors’ specific needs regarding liquidity and security with a deep focus on solving the questionable compliance practices of DeFi liquid staking providers. Traditional investors can access solutions like Liquid Collective and others through private fund structures.  See also: Staking Brings Decentralization Back to DeFi | Opinion  CoinDesk Indices in partnership with Coin Fund has created the Composite ETH Staking Rate (CESR), a benchmark for investors to hold managers, exchanges, and service providers accountable for their returns. Indices are the cornerstone of a robust derivatives market and institutional participation. There has been a dearth of professional index products for institutional investors. DeFi has mature indices, through products like staked ETH, but TradFi investors that want private fund exposure have to contend with deviations from NAV, high fees, no staking and sloppy compliance.  It is our sincere hope that the U.S. changes its approach to staking regulation. Increasing access to staking through thoughtful policy would be a boon for the users, the industry and also for the U.S. The most effective way to influence this technology is by regulating the control points. The current policy of regulation by enforcement is so extreme that it has pushed users away from regulated entities.  However, the window of opportunity has not closed, and by engaging with industry groups like the Proof of Stake Alliance, we are hopeful that regulators can craft policy promoting domestic capital formation. One day, we believe countries will be competing for influence over Ethereum validators. Instead of waiting until that day comes, let’s work together to create thoughtful regulation that promotes safety and stability.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jason Hall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/27/eth-staking-has-a-bright-future-despite-regulatory-uncertainty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16a744908fe9603180c74fac7a789a323df17ab5-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409637,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKQo,1695829500,Five Reasons Why the World Needs a Standardized Ethereum Staking Rate,"Staking rates are to crypto what interest rates are to traditional finance. Ethereum’s transition a year ago to proof-of-stake with “The Merge” was an incredible accomplishment for its ecosystem that delivered obvious enhancements to network security and reduced its energy footprint by 99.95%.  This shift, which made it so validators are rewarded with both protocol emissions and priority transaction fees, also unlocked something perhaps less obvious but absolutely groundbreaking for Ethereum: the introduction of a native interest rate. Staking ether (ETH), the ecosystem’s native token, now pays an interest rate. This forms a sort of bedrock layer – similar to the role interest rates play in traditional finance – that could power a new, global staking economy. For this to work, though, there must be a reference rate, so investors know what the benchmark is at any given time – a reliable number derived by observing the mean, annualized returns across a comprehensive validator population.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A standardized staking rate built on social consensus will serve as a foundational pillar of the crypto economy. It will catalyze new financial instruments and capabilities and unlock a new wave of consumer and institutional adoption.  Here are five reasons why the world needs a standardized staking rate:  Benchmarking: Standardized interest rates are foundational across global finance. They serve as reference rates and performance indicators, and enable derivatives that serve as risk assessment tools. A standardized benchmark would help market participants clearly identify relative performance to Ethereum’s benchmark rate. Like an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which integrates efficiently into traditional financial securities infrastructure, a standardized staking rate benchmark would neatly fit into traditional systems – just like any other fiat reference rate. It would be a big deal for institutions. Today, institutional staking providers pay clients variable, bespoke, annual percentage yields (APYs) or floating rates. Offering yield returns relative to a common reference rate would give end users greater transparency and confidence about the floating returns they are set to receive.  Real Yield: Ethereum’s real yield competes nicely with its traditional finance peers. Over the last year, changes to the protocol shifted the supply mechanics for Ethereum, making it potentially deflationary. As a result, when looking at the staking rate through a real yield lens, it can compete with its fiat peers. In time, investors seeking to maximize risk-adjusted yield will need to seriously consider deploying capital for the real-yield opportunities across Ethereum’s staking economy.  Total Return Products: When it comes to exchange-traded products (ETPs) and other structured instruments, market participants do not want to limit their market exposure to ETH; they prefer products that deliver total return ETH, which includes the staking rate. While liquid staking tokens may deliver variable rates for crypto native market participants, a standardized staking rate could unlock a new class of financial products (synthetic or otherwise) that deliver ETH plus staking, a total return that would have strong institutional appeal. The holy grail of ETH ETFs will be the one that also pays the staking yield, and a standardized benchmark for that yield is essential for this offering.  Risk Management: A standardized staking rate will enable market makers to create a forward yield curve and offer liquidity across a vast array of derivatives products, including swaps, futures and options that can be used for hedging and other risk management use cases. In traditional financial markets, interest rates alone underpin $500 trillion in notional swaps exposure, and derivatives such as these enable stakers to hedge against the volatility of the benchmark while also allowing market participants (on the other side of the trade) to hedge against future rising gas costs or seek real yield. Derivatives will also allow institutional staking providers to offer fixed-yield rate products, which are few and far between in crypto but widely available in traditional finance. Markets grounded by hedgers tend to drive liquidity, and a standardized staking benchmark will serve as a foundational building block for a new class of derivatives markets.  Valuations: Using a discount rate to calculate a valuation is a common method in finance and investment analysis, especially when evaluating the worth of an investment, business or financial instrument. A standardized staking benchmark that serves as a foundation for a discount curve will help inform valuations across the Ethereum economy. This would not be possible without native staking rates.  Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake introduced native interest rates to the ecosystem for the first time. Industry adoption of a standardized benchmark has nearly infinite use cases and will be an important step in the evolution and maturity of crypto markets. Like traditional markets, interest rates can potentially drive crypto native markets forward and unlock a new wave of global adoption.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Christopher R.

42409643,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKnx,1695829500,"With All Eyes on a Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval, Don’t Sleep on ETH (or ETHE)","A federal judge last month severely undermined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to reject converting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more alluring exchange-traded fund. The decision has many analysts now pricing in approval of a spot bitcoin ETF sooner rather than later. Analysts at Bloomberg put the odds of approval this year at 75%.  Market prices show this optimism, too, and not just for Grayscale’s bitcoin product. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) had traded at massive discounts to NAV – industry jargon for the value of all the bitcoin and ether, respectively, that they hold. But they’ve narrowed significantly. GBTC went from trading at a 46% discount to only 21%, while ETHE went from 59% to 29%.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  So, with everyone penciling in a bitcoin ETF as a matter of when and not if, bullish investors should just buy GBTC, and wait for a final approval, right? The theory goes that the discount will all but evaporate (as open-ended ETFs typically only trade at narrow differences to NAV), and as a bonus the underlying asset (bitcoin) might catch a bid – win/win. Perhaps. But the bigger opportunity could be Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust.  My view is if a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF gets approved, there should be little argument for holding up a spot ether ETF. And Grayscale itself has said it plans to convert ETHE and other products to ETFs. I wouldn’t hold your breath when it comes to SOL, ATOM or any other smaller crypto asset, but we have first-hand knowledge that ETH ETFs work. In fact, ethereum ETFs launched within weeks of the first bitcoin ETF. Regulators in Canada were comfortable with the product because there is a regulated futures market for ETH, allowing market makers to hedge risk while creating and redeeming units. I suspect that following a BTC approval, an ETH approval would not be far behind. ETHE’s discount is greater than GBTC’s, meaning a far greater arbitrage opportunity. Also, ETH markets are less liquid than BTC, so the incremental buying from an ETF could have a more material impact on price. And, in my view, ETH has better upside as the leading platform for Web3 development.  Futures ETFs have badly underperformed spot markets. Spot ETFs don’t have this problem. They’re a safe, sensible solution for investors and like many, I expect they’ll be approved. Just don’t take your eye off ETH (and ETHE).

42409649,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcML7n,1695828075,Staking Risks Are Vastly Misunderstood,"Interest in staking has shown a strong resilience to the bear market. A considerable amount of value remains staked on top blockchains, in many cases surpassing the actual total value locked (TVL) living on-chain.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" JK is the founder of ApybaraIO, the maker of ProtocolStaking.info.  However, things are not looking so good otherwise for staking. Public perception of staking has become one of the biggest casualties of the current bear market. Many of the crypto lending firms and exchanges that went under in the past year frequently marketed their service offerings as “staking.” In most cases, they were not.  As a result, staking has been categorized as a high-risk activity and discouraged by regulators. In some cases, regulatory actions have been taken leading to some crypto platforms shutting down any staking service offerings. Are these actions against staking justified?  See also: Crypto Lenders Caused Crypto Contagion Last Year | Opinion  Will the real stakers please stand up  It’s important to first draw a line between staking and “staking.” Staking involves locking tokens directly on the blockchain with operators/validators. Stakers do not give up ownership of their tokens through this process. Operators/validators are expected to secure and perform work on the blockchain with the stake delegated to them.  Liquidity pool (LP) token locking and lending are the biggest offenders of liberally using “staking” when describing their services. These imposter “staking” services are harder to analyze in comparison to on-chain staking, which can be fully observed and monitored because it's on a blockchain.  The risks for on-chain staking are relatively clear cut and should be assessed independently from these other services that may entail higher and, at times, obscure risks.  Realistic risks of staking  There are four major risks associated with staking.  1. Slashing and penalties: Slashings occur when a validator attests to two different histories of the chain and penalties occur when a validator is offline for a prolonged period of time. In combination, they deter malicious validators from attacking blockchains. The amount at risk is not de minimis. For example, the most recent slashing on Ethereum resulted in a loss of 1 ETH (roughly a 3% loss on a 32 ETH stake deposit).  2. Validator risk: Assuming you don’t run a validator yourself, stakers will need to select a third party validator with which they will stake their tokens. This process does not involve giving away custody of the stakers’ funds. So, the staker does not need to worry about loss of funds, but they still must assess whether the validator is reputable and will not engage in harmful behavior that could lead to slashing or penalties.  3. Client software bugs: Software is not foolproof, especially for blockchains that have frequent upgrades. Ethereum experienced issues with achieving finality due to one of its client software. The best way to mitigate software risk is to have multiple implementations of the blockchain, which Ethereum strives to do by maintaining multiple client teams.  4. Unstaking (unbonding) periods: Blockchains implement a buffer period for when stakers can unstake and withdraw their stake. This prevents malicious actors from performing an attack and running away before their funds are slashed. This could create a duration mismatch for custodians or exchange platforms who stake assets on behalf of their users.  Staking cannot cause major meltdowns like we’ve seen in the past year  Of these risks, slashing is the biggest and most plausible concern for stakers. Empirically, slashing is not a frequently occurring event. Over the course of its history, less than 0.04% of Ethereum validators have been slashed resulting in losses of less than $1 million at around today’s price of ETH.  These risks are nothing in comparison to hacks of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, totaling approximately $5 billion worth of losses occur over a similar time period.  Short side note on LST  Thanks to Lido’s rise in popularity, liquid staking protocols (LST) have become a staple method of earning staking rewards for many crypto users. At its core, LSTs are a wrapper around staking. They act as an aggregator of validators, which pool stakers’ tokens using a smart contract and create a derivative token representing the locked up tokens providing immediate transferability.  These platforms, which in a sense have become a systemically large part of the staking ecosystem, are the added risks to consider on top of the above.  1. Smart contract risk: Maintaining a bug-free smart contract is no easy feat. Since LSTs pool tokens and also issue tokens representing staked assets, there are multiple layers of smart contracts involved. Each one could be a security risk if not developed and audited properly by competent developers.  2. Operator risk: The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or entity operating the LST is another additional operator that must be taken into account on top of the underlying validators. Stakers will need to assess whether the DAO or entity involved can competently run the operations of an LST.  Progress needed within staking  Staking cannot cause major meltdowns like we’ve seen in the past year with lenders. Arguably, it is the on-chain activity with the lowest risk that a crypto user can participate in. It makes sense for staking reward rates to become the de facto benchmark rate of each blockchain’s ecosystem.  We can already see this taking place as borrow rates for some staking tokens begin to converge to the staking reward rates. We will one day see staking become a staple form of crypto participation.  See also: DeFi vs CeFi Lending: Before Choosing, Understand the Challenges and Risks  It won’t be an easy path with the misconception and miscategorization of staking. The staking ecosystem needs more products and tools to help users securely engage in and understand staking.  Compared to the DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, staking falls significantly behind on this front. Services like CoinDesk Indices, Rated, Stakingrewards.com and Observatory Zone are pioneers, but much more will need to be built before we can, one day, onboard and educate non-crypto people to staking.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jun Soo Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/27/staking-risks-are-vastly-misunderstood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea14964cd6081afb8e7f12ff3d853a2b2098f300-1952x1098.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409641,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKe2,1695827445,EigenLayer’s Sreeram Kannan on the Hot (and Risky) Ethereum Trend of ‘Restaking’,"Sreeram Kannan was a professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, when he started working for its blockchain research lab in 2017.  It was there while working at the lab that he founded his company, EigenLabs, the organization behind EigenLayer – a blockchain protocol considered a pioneer in a just-now-arriving trend in the Ethereum ecosystem known as restaking. The idea is to repurpose ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain for double duty, using them to provide security for other applications.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  EigenLayer has been in the news lately, as the restaking ecosystem starts to take shape. Some top Ethereum figures have also raised flags about the risks; Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at one point cautioned that the new feature could ultimately pose systemic risks to the main blockchain’s stability.  We spoke with Kannan last week, where we asked him questions about EigenLayer and restaking. Some highlights include:  On Kannan’s response to Buterin’s concerns about staking: “Anything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do.”  On Ethereum’s plan to slow the rate of new validators coming on line, via the EIP-7514 proposal: “This is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow.”  On whether Ethereum will ever reach its maximum capacity for shared security: “There's absolutely a limit.”  Q: I saw Vitalik’s blog post about overloading the consensus layer, and how restaking, in his view, could pose systemic risks to Ethereum. I'm curious to hear your take on his take?  Kannan: One of the things I think he wants to kind of lay out is that, “Hey don't externalize, and don't create something that, assuming that if the protocol goes wrong, Ethereum is going to fork around it.”  I think that is a pretty reasonable position from Ethereum, that you build protocols and the protocols have to internalize social consensus rather than externalize it to Ethereum.  So I read it as to not overload Ethereum social consensus, which is used only for forking the chain. And don't assume that you can build a protocol that, and because you're too big to fail, Ethereum can fork around that. So that's how I read it.  And I think it's a pretty obvious statement in our view. But I think it has to be said, somebody has to say it, so it's good that Vitalik went out and said it.  Because what we don't want is for calls to deploy code that is not properly audited, doesn't have internal security controls, and then the Ethereum community has to now work hard to figure out how to retrieve it.  I think a lot of people after reading the article have been talking a lot about restaking risks.  I want to make it super clear: anything that restaking can do, already liquid staking can do, so I view restaking as a lesser risk than liquid staking.  Q: Can you expand on that?  Kannan: Basically, you can take a liquid staking token and then deposit it into complex DeFi protocols, or you could just deposit it into validating a new layer 2, or a new oracle or any of these things.  So anything that restaking can do, liquid staking can already do. Because you know, you have the LSD [short for liquid staking derivative] token, and you can do anything with it. And one particular thing you could do with that is, of course, go and validate another network.  So I view restaking as just one particular use case of liquid staking, but actually reducing the risk of that one particular use case.  Q: Why do you think restaking is having a moment in the news?  Kannan: I don't know. I'm glad people are talking about it. Of course, anything that adds new rewards to stakers is something interesting.  I said anything that could be done with EigenLayer could be done with LSTs, but people didn't know what to do with these LSTs.  They were doing exactly the same thing that people are doing with ether, which is lending, borrowing, the same set of DeFi parameters.  I think one thing that EigenLayer did is by creating this new category, that validation, if I can borrow the Ethereum trust network to do new things: I can build a new layer 1, I can build a new like oracle network, I can build a new data availability system, I can build any system on top of the Ethereum trust network, so it internalizes all the innovation back into Ethereum, or aggregates all the innovation back into Ethereum, rather than each innovation requiring a whole new system.  So I think that narrative is quite attractive.  Q: I was just reading the news about EIP-7514, which is a short term solution for solving the overcrowdedness of validators, by limiting entries of new validators. How does that affect an EigenLayer?  Kannan: I think mostly, it means the same thing for EigenLayer that it means for liquid staking protocols, that there is going to be a smaller rate at which new validators can enter.  There's a long entry queue right now, and people don't want to wait that long.  And making it slower is going to just make the new growth of LSTs slower. But I understand fully that this is a super important thing for Ethereum to be conservative and not have an overflow of validators that may not be able to be handled by the consensus layer.  But in the long term, if the total staking of Ethereum cannot grow, one of the things that happens is the total yield or the return that stakers are getting is bounded by the Ethereum staking, whereas in the presence of restaking there is a possibility for them to get some of these additional rewards. Other than that, it's pretty similar.  Q: You were making the point that EigenDA is just like in-house AVS (actively validated service) – explain what it is:  Kannan: What we decided is, in order to keep this system of shared security, in order to keep EigenLayer as decentralized as possible, we want to make sure that there is a highly scalable data system at its backbone. And that's what EigenDA is, it's a highly scalable data availability system, built on the same ideas that underpin the Ethereum roadmap, particularly what is called danksharding.  Our view is that building an Ethereum-adjacent data availability layer requires first principles thinking, whereas Celestia and Avail are built to be chains by themselves.  If you're building a data availability system adjacent to Ethereum, you'd want Ethereum validators to participate. So that's just one part of the story. Of course, EigenLayer enables that.  But then you go beyond that, and then you see, “Oh, it's not just you want to get the Ethereum nodes to participate.”  Ethereum already has consensus built in, and Ethereum gives you the ordering of the various transactions. So you should build the data availability system, which doesn't need its own ordering.  Whereas all the existing other protocols like Celestia and Avail, are basically chains that have to do their own ordering; we built a system which doesn't have internal ordering; all ordering is done on Ethereum.  Q: Liquid restaking tokens - once your liquid staking tokens are locked on EigenLayer, they become illiquid?  Kannan: That’s correct, the problem that the liquid restaking tokens are trying to solve is, can I just have a restaked position, and then still keep it liquid. So you can take that receipt token of liquid restaking and then transfer it.  We are not building this kind of liquid restaking but other people are building liquid restaking on top of them.  Q: I think your comment was, you want to use the Ethereum shared security for as many things as possible. I'm curious, now that there's also people building on the back of what y'all are doing, is there a natural limit to how much that you know, Ethereum can support?  Kannan: This is a similar kind of question that one could ask already at the application layer of Ethereum: How many applications on Ethereum are smart contracts and how many smart contracts can be built on top of Ethereum?  So it's the same thing with EigenLayer because people staking and running new applications, but now they do it much more flexibly and programmably with these aliases on top of EigenLayer, all contribute back to Ethereum. Their ETH staking increases rewards, ETH itself potentially increases in value because of all these additional use cases.  So over time, this can start to accommodate more and more.  But there's absolutely a limit.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | RESEARCH | TIA,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/27/eigenlayers-sreeram-kannan-on-the-hot-and-risky-ethereum-trend-of-restaking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3be199fad1884188e390fb30659c75d918a00c3-837x471.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18115670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553097,1695826830,ETH Gate Saga Continues: What Is Lubin’s ‘Piece Of Paper’?,"Steven Nerayoff, an active participant in Ethereum’s (ETH) Initial Coin Offering (ICO), who is believed to know where the “bodies are buried,” has made further revelations in the ongoing ETH Gate saga, which boils on whether or not the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave Ethereum a ‘regulatory free pass.’ Lubin’s Piece Of Paper Appears In ETH Gate After being pressured by a member of the XRP community to release the dirt that he claims to have, Nerayoff released a follow-up tweet that contained transcripts from an email that Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin sent to him personally on July 21, 2014. Lubin (whom Nerayoff now also refers to as #CrookedElbowJoe) also copied Fry, Bertrand, Vitalik Buterin, and Jeffrey Alberts in the mail. Related Reading: Early Rejection Of 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF Sparks Concerns In the mail, Fry, Bertrand (there is an assumption that ‘Fry, Bertrand’ is one person rather than separate individuals) stated that the “opinion letter” was being put on a letterhead and would be forwarded to Lubin after. Following the revelation of this mail, a video clip surfaced where pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton gave his opinion on the mail. In the clip, Deaton suggested that the ‘opinion paper’ mentioned in the mail was the same one Lubin had referred to when he said he had a “piece of paper” in his pocket before the ETH ICO. Deaton also stated that Nerayoff got that piece of paper in Lubin’s pocket and that this series of events was extremely significant. It is worth mentioning that Deaton might already have first-hand information as to what might have transpired between the SEC and Ethereum and how deep the irregularities run, as he has already been in communication with Nerayoff (under the Attorney-Client privilege communication). This is something that he revealed during his “announcement” last week. In an earlier tweet, Nerayaoff had also suggested that the ETH Gate was beyond just former SEC Director William Hinman’s speech, where he stated that Ethereum wasn’t a security. He said, “They’re hiding more than the motives behind the speech by #DirtyHinman.” He also used the hashtags #CryptoJudas (what he refers to Vitalik as) and #CrookedElbowJoe (Joseph Lubin). What Is This Lubin’s Piece Of Paper? Attorney Bill Morgan seemed to suggest that Nerayoff was indicating that Jeffrey Alberts and Fry Bertrand (who co-authored the piece ‘Is Bitcoin A Security?’ in 2015) were the same persons who wrote the opinion letter (which Deaton suggested was the same piece of paper Lubin spoke about before the ETH ICO). If so, he could be driving at the fact that Alberts and Bertrand (who happen to be lawyers) may have written this opinion letter to convince the SEC that Ethereum wasn’t a security before the ICO. Meanwhile, Nerayoff reposted a tweet which had a similar theory. In the tweet, the X (formerly Twitter) user highlighted a part in Alberts’ bio where he was said to have “helped structure the initial public sale of ether.” Related Reading: Upcoming Optimism Unlock Threatens To Drag OP Below $1 The bio alluded to the fact that the SEC had concluded that Bitcoin and Ether weren’t securities, adopting the “legal interpretation Alberts had articulated years ago.” The user also noted the relationship between Alberts and Marc Berger (who charged Ripple) as they worked together at the Manhattan US Attorney Office’s securities and commodities fraud task force. Marc Berger is said to be working with Bill Hinman now.

42409632,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcMKDa,1695824546,Ending the Staking Trade-Off Can Save DeFi Communities,"Voter apathy is killing the spirit of community in DAOs. Mismanagement and indecisiveness has left many decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) wounded and vulnerable to crypto’s equivalent of the 1980s corporate raider.  Even MakerDAO, one of the early proponents of this novel form of organization, is battling to revive governance participation with its long and complex “endgame” restructuring.  The reasons for anemic participation rates in many DAOs vary. Mainstream institutions and retail investors are often skittish about taking part, particularly given the evolving — and often murky — regulatory picture in the United States and other jurisdictions. Or DAO participants who jump in enthusiastically may lose interest after the initial flush of enthusiasm has passed and prices are deflated.  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Staking Week."" Taylor Johnson is the co-founder of PsyFi.  One major driver behind disengagement from governance, though, is the central dilemma facing users in many decentralized finance (DeFi) communities: how best to deploy their assets — and their energies — in an ecosystem.  In networks where there is a clear divide between governance tokens and reward-generation assets, users are left with an impossible decision: should they stake to earn rewards? Or concentrate on participation in governance?  All too often, it is the desire to earn personal profit from rewards that wins out over helping a project advance toward its mission.  But there is a solution to the asset deployment dilemma. Staking. To spare users the Hobson’s Choice of where to put their assets, staking — already one of the most powerful innovations in DeFi, which is itself a construct based on automated incentives — can now be retooled  As headline-grabbing incidents this year involving protocols such as NounsDAO, Hector Network on the Fantom blockchain and Parrot Protocol on Solana have shown, disengagement can leave DAOs vulnerable to predators who can swoop in, buy up governance tokens from less-interested community members, and force projects to liquidate their treasuries or take other steps that can decimate a project.  Apathy can have consequences that are less dramatic but potentially as damaging. It can sap the energy out of a community, leaving DAOs struggling to drum up enough votes to get even rudimentary decisions passed — never mind mission-critical proposals. The resulting bottlenecks can lead projects to miss out on opportunities in the fast-moving DeFi space.  But retooled staking, coupled with measures such as greater automation in decision-making and support for delegation, can make a difference.  It is perfectly possible to build elegant infrastructure that supports a new form of dual-purpose staking: one that provides real yield for stakers in the form of a share of protocol revenue, while also allowing community members to retain a voice in how a project divides its income.  With infrastructure of this kind, community members no longer have to choose between having a say and earning rewards. And projects will benefit from enhanced liquidity, streamlined decision-making, and more productive dialogue with protocol users.  I’ve always been a firm subscriber to the view that a rising tide lifts all ships. If such tooling is to help DeFi chart a choice toward a brighter horizon, it must be open source and available for every community on a blockchain to use.  See also: ENS and the Limitations of DAO Governance | Opinion  There are such tools in Ethereum and on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains, but it’s time their transformative power reached non-EVM networks. On many platforms, tokenomics tend to be fragmented, with a firm divide between governance tokens and assets purely geared toward rewarding users for activities such as liquidity provision or liquidity farming.  A group of us — the development teams behind PsyFi and HXRO Network, another long-standing Solana project — aim to help change that. We’ve created a free-to-use hybrid staking mechanism that any project in the ecosystem can use.  The longer users lock up their tokens, the more influence they gain over project direction – and the greater the share of the protocol generated rewards. This isn't just a tool for PsyFi; any Solana team can use it, build upon it, and customize it to their needs to better align their token holders and products.  By giving community members a stake in a future we can all benefit from, this kind of infrastructure can reinvigorate user engagement across DeFi, making decision-making faster and more efficient and heading off predators before they strike.",NEGATIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | ENS,Taylor Johnson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/27/ending-the-staking-trade-off-can-save-defi-communities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eea7c8a3e5053261f85829ad82d5afe18ba48efb-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18114415,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553100,1695823204,Polygon Price Speculation: Can MATIC Defend The $0.5 Threshold?,"Polygon (MATIC) has been treading in the water for much of September, caught in a tight range that reflects the uncertainty gripping the cryptocurrency market. As the altcoin hovers around the $0.50 mark, traders are closely eyeing a significant technical indicator that could spell trouble for its price trajectory. The altcoin’s price, currently at $0.508295 according to CoinGecko, has shown signs of weakness, with a 2.4% decline in the past 24 hours and a 7.3% dip over the past week. However, the real concern for MATIC investors lies in the potential reversal from the down-sloping trendline. This trendline, intact since February 2023, has kept MATIC in check for months. If breached, it could unleash a wave of selling pressure that might push the price below the critical $0.50 level. Related Reading: Cardano $0.24 Support Test: Can ADA Price Reverse Its Downward Trend? Polygon Faces Increasing Selling Pressure On The Horizon Traders are well aware that when an asset approaches a long-standing downtrend resistance line, it often faces increased selling pressure. Analysts suggest that a reversal from this trendline could lead to an 18% price decline, potentially dragging MATIC down to the next key support level at $0.42. It’s a make-or-break moment for the altcoin, and its fate hangs in the balance. For those who remain bullish on Polygon’s native coin, patience is key. A daily close above the resistance trendline would signal a significant shift in market sentiment. Such a breakthrough could provide the bulls with the momentum they need to initiate a recovery rally. If successful, MATIC may set its sights on initial resistance at $0.63, with an even more ambitious target of $0.69. MATIC market cap slightly below the $5 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com Polygon 2.0: A Potential Game Changer Adding a layer of complexity to this price analysis is Polygon’s recent announcement of Polygon 2.0. This strategic overhaul envisions a fundamental shift in Polygon’s blockchain architecture and an expansion beyond Ethereum to include various other blockchains. Polygon aims to execute this transformation in the early fourth quarter, potentially paving the way for a surge in interest and demand for its native coin. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again? As MATIC teeters on the edge of a crucial technical juncture, the cryptocurrency market remains a battleground of uncertainty. Traders and investors must exercise caution and closely monitor developments around the down-sloping trendline. The success or failure of MATIC to break free from this resistance could determine its price trajectory in the coming weeks. Moreover, the impending rollout of Polygon 2.0 adds an extra layer of anticipation to an already dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, promising potential surprises for MATIC holders and the wider crypto community.

The protracted crypto winter since late 2021 has further reinforced this stance among those that generally question the value proposition underlying this fledgling ecosystem of decentralized networks and the nascent economies being built on top of them. For the patient observer that is mindful of Ethereum’s evolution and transformative potential over time, the present circumstances may rightfully be characterized as the calm before the storm. “Token money was developed at an early date to shelter trade from the enforced deflations that accompanied the use of specie when the volume of business swelled. No market economy was possible without the medium of artificial money.” - Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation , pg. 202 In an increasingly interconnected world, where the internet has seemingly erased the borders between people on a global scale over the last several decades, it appears obvious in retrospect that internet-native forms of money and value would eventually take form. This new reality began with Bitcoin in 2009 and its facilitation of peer-to-peer transactions. The launch of Ethereum in 2015 expanded upon this concept by enabling the development and deployment of smart contracts on chain that could interact with one another and which users could interact with as well. Some contend that because there’s nothing tangible about BTC ( BTC-USD ), ETH ( ETH-USD ), and other forms of digital assets, that their value is questionable at best. The protracted crypto winter since late 2021 has further reinforced this stance among those that generally question the value proposition underlying this fledgling ecosystem of decentralized networks and the nascent economies being built on top of them. To date, Ethereum stands out as the blockchain network with the most development activity . Ethereum has also proven its robustness in terms of revenue generation that enables it to uphold an economically sustainable tokenomics model that pays its validators vis-a-vis a minimal viable issuance policy, while correspondingly burning transaction base fees that users pay for using the network. In totality, these qualities have advanced the ultra-sound money meme that ETH is commonly associated with. Despite the ongoing bear market, several observations may be noted from considering ETH’s price chart over the last several years: ETH-USD (Coinbase: Ethereum) First, ETH has managed to close above the $1,000 level on the monthly time frame since bulls first reclaimed it in January 2021 to kick off the most recent bull market, following its first and only prior monthly close above it in the previous bull market in January 2018. Although ETH traded below $1,000 in June and July last year, bulls managed to defend the $1,000 level and sustain monthly closes over it. Next, ETH has essentially traded in a sideways pattern since The Merge was completed last September; ETH’s high that month was just under $1,800, about ten percent higher from its current price of around $1,600. This means that Ethereum’s successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus, and the implementation of staking withdrawals in April 2023, has effectively been ignored by market participants. “To manage an Ethereum account, you don’t have to have an identity, you don’t have to be a human being... a system, like GPT-4... can easily manage an Ethereum account... it’s entirely digitally native.” - Jordan McKinney, ""GPT4 & Ethereum: Autonomous AI Agents & the World Financial Computer"" on YouTube For the patient observer that is mindful of Ethereum’s evolution and transformative potential over time, such as its possible business use cases , the present circumstances may rightfully be characterized as the calm before the storm. As such, one may consider this period as an opportunity to gain exposure to ETH, while being considerate of the inherent volatility that is to be expected in participating in such an emergent asset class. While this may all just be artificial internet money as some would say, the reality is that the emergence of digitally native markets built on top of blockchain networks like Ethereum are ultimately a product of it. Eventually, this artificial internet money may also become the preferred medium of exchange for artificial intelligence agents as well, and I personally don’t think the broader market has priced this in yet.

18113140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553104,1695819604,Bitcoin Price Trend At Stake: How September’s Close Could Change Everything,"Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has recently highlighted the pivotal nature of the Bitcoin price’s imminent monthly candle close. In a statement via X (formerly Twitter), he detailed that Bitcoin has tagged the $27,000 monthly level from the underside, meaning it is acting as resistance for the time being. He explained that “the upcoming monthly candle close is just around the corner. Bitcoin needs to monthly close above $27,091 for this to be a fake-breakdown. Otherwise, the breakdown will be technically confirmed.” To give this statement some historical context, the preceding month – August – saw a significant development for the flagship cryptocurrency. BTC registered a bearish monthly candle close, finishing below approximately $27,150. This data point, according to Rekt Capital, effectively confirmed it as lost support. Reflecting on this development at the time, the analyst had conveyed that it is possible BTC could surge to $27,150, “maybe even upside wick beyond it this September. But that would likely be a relief rally to confirm $27150 as new resistance before dropping into the ~$23000 region. $23000 is the next major Monthly support now that ~$27150 has been lost.” Is Bitcoin Following Historical Patterns? Rekt Capital’s observations about Bitcoin aren’t made in isolation but are deeply rooted in Bitcoin’s historical price and cycle behaviors. Drawing parallels to previous patterns, he had previously shed light on Bitcoin’s tendencies around 200 days before a halving event. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Return To Selling Mode, More Downside Soon? “At this same point in the cycle (~200 days before the halving): In 2015, Bitcoin retraced -24% within a re-accumulation range, but price consolidated for months going into the halving. In 2019, Bitcoin retraced -37% as part of a downtrend that continued for months going into the halving.” These historical retracements at a similar juncture have given rise to two essential insights, as stated by Rekt Capital. First, an immediate retracement has occurred at this same point in the cycle. Second, a repeated retrace of between -24% to -37% in 2023 would lead Bitcoin to retest its macro higher low, possibly pushing its price under the $20,000 threshold. The analyst didn’t stop there. Accentuating the ideal accumulation phases for investors, he noted, “The best time to accumulate Bitcoin was in late 2022 near the bear market bottom. The second best time to accumulate Bitcoin is upon a deeper retracement in the pre-halving period.” Related Reading: Analyst Uncovers BlackRock Long Interest In Bitcoin Mining – Details Shifting the focus to potential future outcomes, Rekt Capital made an intriguing speculation about the potential of BTC’s price movement post-halving: “If ~$31000 was the top for 2023. Then the next time we see these prices will be months from now, just after the halving. Only difference between now and then? In this pre-halving period, BTC could still retrace from here. But after the halving, BTC would break out much higher from current prices.” To summarize, the upcoming monthly candle close for Bitcoin could have profound implications for the asset’s short-to-mid-term trajectory. All eyes will now be on whether BTC manages to close above or below the critical $27,150 mark – an indicator that could either confirm a technical breakdown or prevail over a historically untypical price rally. At press time, BTC stood at $26,687.

Speaking to Serdar Turan, the Editor-in-Chief of CoinDesk Türkiye, in the lead up to Binance Blockchain Week in early November, Conlan said: ""I think we have an enormous potential and opportunity in Web3, and it's one of the reasons I've been drawn to this industry three years ago. The major reason being the penetration. If you look at the global industry, we're only at 5% penetration globally. I know obviously here in Turkey, it's at 12%.""  While explaining the significance of Turkey in the global ecosystem, she said, ""Turkey is one of the most exciting communities for crypto. That's not just through the numbers. While you have incredible penetration, we know that's growing month over month.""  ""That's with not just the crypto exchanges and people holding crypto, that also is the vibrant ecosystem here of startups, investments. It's very exciting. For us, Turkey represents a market where we can learn a lot. We can learn and take insights from the user base here and how we can apply that to what are our global programs, what we need to be doing better.""  Conlan continued by expressing her satisfaction with Binance Turkey's achievements, adding: ""I think Istanbul is already one of the main hubs. I don't think it's about becoming the hub. That's really one of the reasons that we chose to host our upcoming Binance Blockchain Week here in November. That really is about merging both the local community with the international Web3 community.""  Conlan also emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance and highlighted Binance's commitment to compliance as one of the key reasons for her joining the exchange. She underscored the crypto exchange holds 18 licenses globally and mentioned there are over 700 compliance officers at Binance working on user security, with an investment of over $80 million in infrastructure. Furthermore, Conlan mentioned this figure could be doubled in pursuit of excellence.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose 2% to $26,750 even as the U.S. dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against the major currencies, reached a fresh 10-month high of 106.48. A rise in the dollar index usually has a bearish impact on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""Bitcoin's move higher was set in motion by the spot market buyers,"" pseudonymous crypto trader and analyst Skew (@52kskew on X) told CoinDesk.  ""That kicked off market buying and a short squeeze or bears covering their bearish futures bets, which pushed prices further higher,"" Skew added.  Data tracked by Coinalyze show the early rise from $26,000 was accompanied by an uptick in the spot market cumulative volume delta (CVD), a sign of net capital inflows or net buying in the spot market. Later, the CVD in the stablecoin-margined and coin-margined futures contracts led the market higher.  ETH, XRP and other major cryptocurrencies tracked bitcoin higher, with XRP gaining 1% despite the impending death cross.  The ominous-sounding technical analysis pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average of prices dips below the 200-day SMA, signaling a long-term bearish shift in momentum.  XRP's impending death cross is consistent with similar patterns in recent weeks in bitcoin and ether. These SMA-based patterns are lagging indicators and often trap sellers on the wrong side of the market.

Related Reading: Early Rejection Of 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF Sparks Concerns The letter described major flaws in the US SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF proposal, stating that if the SEC is unable to provide an appropriate explanation for its different regulatory treatment of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin Futures, then its rejection would be seen as an “unlawful” discrimination. The letter was signed by prominent US lawmakers including Mike Flood, Ritchie Torres, Tom Emmer, and Wiley Nickel. The lawmakers stated that Congress is tasked to ensure the US SEC meets all investment product requirements created by Congress. The members of Congress have also shown support for the initiation of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and stated that spot Bitcoin ETFs would ensure investors are properly safeguarded from investment risks since there would be better clarity on Bitcoin cryptocurrency. “A regulated spot bitcoin ETP would provide increased protection for investors by making access to bitcoin safer and more transparent,” the US lawmakers stated. A hearing between the US SEC Chairman and the Congress is scheduled for Wednesday, September 27 and Gensler may be subjected to intense scrutiny and questions on his rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs. US SEC Delay ETF Approval Yet Again The US SEC has continued to delay its approval for Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF application since August 2023, requesting more time to deliberate on evaluating its actions concerning the proposal. Grayscale, a crypto asset management company applied to convert its Bitcoin trust to an ETF in October 2021. However, the US SEC denied the request, stating that the crypto asset investment firm’s proposal did not meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards. Grayscale responded by filing a court appeal in the District of Columbia requesting the court to review the US SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF application. The digital asset management company scored an unprecedented victory against the US SEC after Judge Naomi Rao from the federal court of appeals ruled against the US SEC, stating that the commission’s rejection of Grayscale’s proposal was “arbitrary and capricious” because the regulator failed to explain its denial of spot Bitcoin ETFs after approving similar products like Bitcoin Futures in June 2023. Related Reading: BULLISH: Bloomberg Analyst Points Out Two Key Bitcoin Metrics Demonstrating Historic Strength In light of the court’s ruling, the crypto community and other prominent financial institutions like JP Morgan believe that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is inevitable.

The commission is yet to respond to the demands of Congress and the crypto community awaits more detailed information in the hearing on September 27.

42409648,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcML4U,1695815645,First Mover Americas: Binance Sells Russian Unit,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance has sold its Russian unit as it looks for a complete exit from the market. The buyer CommEx is a crypto exchange that appeared to only launch yesterday, while it seemingly listed BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT trading pairs for spot trading in July. It was reported in May earlier this year that Binance was facing a Department of Justice inquiry into whether Russian customers were able to access the exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The firm subsequently said in August that it was cutting ties with sanctioned Russian banks. CommEX said it will not onboard customers from the U.S, EU and some other jurisdictions.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed in the last 24 hours, amid signs that major cryptos are correlating with U.S. equities. The threat of higher rates for a longer period took hold throughout financial markets, which generally negatively impacts riskier assets. “The positive correlation between cryptocurrencies and the stock market is temporarily back on track,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk. “Despite the storm in the equity markets, the crypto market remains subdued, losing only 0.3% in 24 hours to $1.045 trillion.” Crypto markets slumped 0.5%, the CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, shows. This mirrored a drop in the U.S. markets on Tuesday – with the S&P 500 losing 1.5%, the Dow Jones Index falling 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ending the day 1.4% lower.  Shiba Inu ecosystem token bone (BONE) rose around 10% in the last 24 hours amid the otherwise muted crypto markets. BONE exchanged hands at 90 cents in Asian morning hours today. The tokens have a market capitalization of $233 million. Developers had said that the deployer contract for bone tokens was fully “renounced”, thus boosting its security, which may have played a part in trading volume rising some $3 million compared to Monday. Renouncing is when a smart contract’s creator no longer has control over it, removing some fears investors may have of it being manipulated.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows market price for oracle protocol Tellar Network's TRB token, open interest in perpetual futures tied to TRB, cumulative volume delta (CVD) in spot and futures markets since March.  The token's price has surged by 33% to $50 in four weeks, with rising CVD in the futures market and a declining CVD in the spot market.  In other words, the rally has been predominantly led by derivatives traders.  A positive and rising CVD means more buyers are in action, while a negative CVD implies sellers are aggressive.

""We utilize a small portion of our hash rate to experiment with our development pool and research potential methods to optimize our operations,"" Marathon said. ""The error was the result of an unanticipated bug that came from one of our experiments,"" the company added.  Earlier Wednesday, anonymous Bitcoin developer ""0xB10C"" wrote on X that MaraPool had a ""transaction ordering issue,"" which was confirmed by CasaHODL co-founder Jameson Lopp.  The invalid Bitcoin block was rejected by other node operators. The block contained a transaction that was ordered incorrectly with a spending output transaction, thus, the block was invalidated, according to BitMEX Research.  The mining of invalid block raised some questions within the community as to the security of the network. However, the rejection of the block was cited by Marathon as an example of the resilience of the Bitcoin network.

The daily charts have revealed a story of indecisiveness, characterized by the formation of neutral doji candles. This hesitation in price movement follows a previous sharp decline, indicating that the bearish momentum is losing steam. Despite the cautious optimism among bulls, the recent price action has been far from encouraging. The $21 resistance level proved to be a formidable barrier that buyers struggled to breach. This resistance level has been a key focal point for traders, as it represents a crucial milestone for SOL’s bullish aspirations. As of now, SOL is trading at $19.05 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 1.6% decline in the past 24 hours and a 5.2% dip over the last seven days. While these figures may seem discouraging, there is still a glimmer of hope for those betting on a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Cardano $0.24 Support Test: Can ADA Price Reverse Its Downward Trend? Solana Watch: Key Metrics To Watch Amidst the market’s uncertainty, technical analysts have identified an intriguing pattern on the daily time frame chart—a potential inverted head and shoulders pattern. This pattern is often regarded as a bullish reversal indicator, and its completion could be a sign of better days ahead for SOL. The pattern consists of three main parts: a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder. The recent pullback in SOL’s price is seen as the completion of the right shoulder, setting the stage for a potential rally. The key support level to watch is $19 which, if held, could pave the way for SOL to retest the neckline resistance at $20.80. SOL registers a market cap of nearly $8 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Indicators Signal Caution While the inverted head and shoulders pattern offers a glimmer of hope, traders must remain cautious. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been lingering below the neutral 50 level in recent days, suggesting that bearish sentiment still holds sway. Additionally, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has struggled to break through local resistance despite multiple attempts in September, indicating that sellers may still have the upper hand. SOL seven-day price movement. Source: Coingecko To flip the market structure bearishly, a price report notes SOL would need to breach the $18.58 level convincingly. Until then, the possibility of SOL forming a short-term consolidation range before making a potential upward move remains on the table. However, the current evidence suggests that sellers are not ready to relinquish control just yet. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again? The emergence of an inverted head and shoulders pattern provides a glimmer of hope for bullish traders, but caution is advised as key indicators signal ongoing uncertainty in the market. The coming days will likely determine whether SOL can break free from its current range and embark on a path toward higher prices. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42392481,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7Gqf,1695808800,Sam Bankman-Fried Can Grill Former FTX Insiders on Drug Use in Court,"Judge Lewis Kaplan will indeed let Sam Bankman-Fried's defense team ask certain Department of Justice witnesses about their recreational drug use – sort of, anyway.  The judge, who has overseen the case for nearly a year now, inched closer to resolving outstanding issues ahead of trial. Last week, it was the Daubert motions regarding expert witnesses. Yesterday, it was resolving most of the motions in limine, addressing testimony and evidence questions.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The defense team can cross-examine cooperating witnesses (read: former FTX insiders) about issues like privileged company information and their recreational drug use (though the attorneys need to notify the court beforehand).  The prosecution can also present evidence tied to FTX’s bankruptcy during the trial, over the defense’s objections. We’ll also see information about the FTT token and whether it was manipulated by other FTX insiders.  Separately, as reported Tuesday, Bankman-Fried is once again trying to get himself out of jail – this time starting Oct. 2 and through the duration of his trial. The FTX founder has been locked up since August after Judge Kaplan ruled he’d likely tried to tamper with witnesses. Earlier this month, his request to overturn that decision was denied, and last week, an appeals court refused to alter the ruling. But, in a Monday letter, lawyers for the disgraced crypto CEO asked a New York court to let him stay at a temporary residence in the city with a security guard anyway.  They also asked the judge to let Bankman-Fried travel to his attorneys’ workspaces during the trial itself because it was “exceedingly difficult” to prepare for the trial from jail. The security guard, who the lawyers say will remain with Bankman-Fried at the residence, will also make sure he doesn’t have any visitors or access to any computers, cell phones, the internet, television or any other electronic devices, the letter said.  It’s unclear if the judge will approve this last-ditch attempt to keep Bankman-Fried out of the slammer, even with the promise of a stringent gag order that’ll keep him from speaking to anyone other than his attorneys or family and stated willingness to accept any other conditions the court wants to impose. He set a deadline of 5:00 p.m. EDT today for the DOJ to weigh in on the application.  Defense attorneys have also requested that Bankman-Fried be allowed to wear a suit during the trial. During his last appearance before Judge Kaplan, he wore a prison uniform and was shackled.  We’re now less than a week out, so it’s helpful to quickly take stock of what we may expect.  The trial will start with voir dire (jury selection) on Oct. 3 (Tuesday) at 9:30 a.m. EDT. The DOJ anticipates this taking the better part of a day. White-collar attorneys believe it’ll take longer. Either way, opening statements will likely begin the day after a jury is seated. The DOJ also anticipates bringing some witnesses up to testify as soon as next week, with the court docket hinting that those witnesses may well be FTX insiders like Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh. The following Monday (Oct. 9) is a holiday so the trial – and this newsletter – will take a pause.

18108661,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553076,1695807302,XRP Price Analysis: 4-Month Chart Dynamics Decoded By Crypto Analyst,"In a recent tweet, renowned crypto analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, unveiled an intricate 4-month XRP price analysis which presented various crucial insights and predictions. This was encapsulated in his words: “XRP Steel Foundation & Eye-Opening Insights: Behold the chart below, crafted from 4-month candles, revealing that higher time frames are less susceptible to deceptive signals.” The Steel Foundation Of XRP Egrag’s analysis draws attention to two major price zones, zone A and zone B, each with its own ultra-strong support zone which he metaphorically describes as the “steel foundation”. For zone A, which saw XRP trading between $0.00485 to $0.02483 from 2013 until early 2017, the steel foundation is identified by him as the price range from $0.00485 to $0.00596. The significance of this foundation is amplified by the fact that it remained untouched even during the harshest market downturns. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – Will Recent Correction Trend Push XRP Under $0.50? On the other hand, zone B, with its price range spanning from $0.25939 to $2.00, is marked by a steel foundation between $0.25939 and $0.32630. This has acted as a robust support from 2017 onwards. However, the weight of a prolonged bear market combined with external factors like the SEC lawsuit did manage to push the price momentarily below this line. A critical observation by Egrag is that the price, when plotted on a 4-month time frame, has never recorded a close above the $2.00 mark. Drawing from this observation, Egrag speculates that breaking past this resistance is essential for XRP to revisit its all-time high of $3.40, attained on January 7, 2018. For this feat to occur, the cryptocurrency would need a surge of more than 580% from its current pricing. More Insights From The Crypto Analyst Egrag further elaborated that in June 2022, September 2022, and January 2023, the bulls tried and succeeded in preventing the XRP price from breaching the steel foundation, portraying a highly bullish sentiment. Moreover, the chart underscores the $0.80-$0.85 range as a significant historical point of contention. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Developer Xumm Reveals “Infrastructure Overhaul,” More Than An Upgrade? XRP has continually failed to close above this threshold, repeatedly showing red during bearish phases. “The chart unmistakably highlights the 0.80-0.85 cent range as a historical battleground. The cryptocurrency has never closed a full-bodied Green Candle above this threshold, perpetually donning a red shroud during the #Bear market descent,” Egrag stated. Another notable prediction from Egrag is that the emergence of a monthly green candle closure above $0.83 will set the stage for the next steel foundation which he calls the “the imminent transformation”. In simpler terms, this might be the last opportunity for traders and investors to purchase the token under $1, according to him. Lastly, Egrag warns of the potential FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) rush when XRP hits the $2 range, indicating this could be a crucial zone for traders. Concluding his analysis, EGRAG CRYPTO encouraged the XRP community to remain vigilant and informed, promising to provide further in-depth visuals and insights on longer timeframes, such as the ASO bullish cross. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5001.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) remained under pressure at $26,200 on Tuesday as the idea of higher rates for a longer period takes hold throughout financial markets, as reported. Traders are seemingly pricing in fear of inflation, which may impact riskier assets.  “The positive correlation between cryptocurrencies and the stock market is temporarily back on track,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk. “Despite the storm in the equity markets, the crypto market remains subdued, losing only 0.3% in 24 hours to $1.045 trillion.”  “However, the Crypto Market Fear and Greed Index is dipping into ""fear"" territory, implying the crypto market did not suddenly become a safe haven,” he added. The index assumes that fear drives stocks lower while greed boosts stock values.  Crypto markets slumped 0.5%, the CoinDesk Markets Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, shows. This mirrored a drop in the U.S. markets on Tuesday – with the S&P500 losing 1.5%, the Dow Jones Index falling 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ending the day 1.4% lower.  However, Asian markets rose higher Wednesday, bringing relief to crypto bulls as majors pared back some of Tuesday’s losses. BTC exchanged hands at $26,300, ETH at $1,580 in Asian morning hours.

Binance said on Wednesday that with the sale, it would exit the country completely, adding ""Binance will sunset all exchange services and business lines in Russia"" over the next several months.  ""Unlike similar deals from international companies in Russia, Binance will have no ongoing revenue split from the sale, nor does it maintain any option to buy back shares in the business,"" the release said.  CommEX said it will not onboard customers from the U.S, EU and some other jurisdictions.  The off-boarding process for existing Russian users will take up to one year and all their assets are ""safe and protected,"" the firm said.

42392502,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7I5b,1695802411,Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Gauge Tops Ether for Record 20 Straight Days,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains the world's biggest and most liquid digital asset. Still, crypto traders are increasingly pricing higher volatility in bitcoin relative to ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.  The spread between dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility index for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) has been consistently negative since Sept. 7, the longest such stretch since Deribit started the DVOL indices in early 2021.  In other words, bitcoin's implied volatility (IV) has topped ether for 20 straight days. Implied volatility is an estimate of the price turbulence over a specific period based on options prices.  The spread briefly turned negative in March for the first time in nearly two years, reflecting the relative richness of BTC IV. Since then, it has become a norm in a sign of traders not looking beyond macroeconomic issues right now and being less interested in trading alternative cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020, consistently taking cues from the Fed policy, the U.S. fiscal and banking sector developments, and sentiment in traditional markets.  Of late, macro risks have piled up in the form of rising U.S. Treasury yields, stagflation risks, a strengthening dollar index, the lingering threat of a U.S. government shutdown and increased prospects of a deflationary crash in China, all denting the appeal of investing in risk assets, like bitcoin.  Besides, expectations for a U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund keep traders squarely focused on the leading cryptocurrency. Ether, meanwhile, has fallen out of favor, thanks to Ethereum's dwindling revenue and renewed inflationary tokenomics.  That said, ether may see renewed investor interest later this year when the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844 goes live. The upgrade will introduce ""proto-danksharding,"" to the Ethereum blockchain in a bid to reduce gas fees and increase transactions.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/27/bitcoins-implied-volatility-gauge-tops-ether-for-record-20-straight-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75e8f337a91a9d38d4bdb576fb5af218b93fe806-1680x945.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18106498,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553070,1695801615,Early Rejection Of 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF Sparks Concerns,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) early delay of the ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF application has raised concerns in the crypto community about what this move might mean for the potential launch of any Spot Bitcoin ETF this year. No Spot Bitcoin ETF This Year? In a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart questioned the SEC’s latest decision and whether or not it “may put the hammer down for any hopes of an ETF approval this year.” He further quizzed whether this means we could see an imminent delay on some other Spot Bitcoin ETF applications with a deadline in October. Related Reading: Upcoming Optimism Unlock Threatens To Drag OP Below $1 On September 26, the SEC extended the time to decide on Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest ETF application until January 10, 2024 ( the final deadline). However, it is worrisome that the Commission had until November 11 (about 46 days to go) before making this decision but chose to do it this early. The SEC has usually made such a decision just days (and not weeks) before the deadline. Seyfarrt showed less optimism in a subsequent tweet when he stated, “Its so over. Everybody can pack up and go home now.” signaling that he had probably lost hopes of a Spot Bitcoin ETF being launched this year. Its so over. Everybody can pack up and go home now. https://t.co/wBsTHXCuEs — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 26, 2023 His statements are more significant considering that he, alongside another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, had increased the likelihood of a Spot Bitcoin ETF launching this year to 75% following Grayscale’s victory against the SEC in August. Amidst all these delays, the SEC is yet to make a statement regarding the Grayscale’s application as the court had ordered the Commission to review the application again. Many expect the Commission to appeal the decision, with the deadline for an appeal coming in October. Plausible Reasons For The SEC’s Early Delay Many in the crypto community, including Seyffart, had two major theories on why the SEC decided early on the ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF application. One, they attributed it to the potential government shutdown that is looming. The SEC is expected to be affected if the US government services were to shut down on October 1. The Commission will have to furlough 90% of its workforce and suspend most of its activities. However, it seems far-fetched considering that November 11 still seems far off, and government activities will have resumed by then. Related Reading: BULLISH: Bloomberg Analyst Points Out Two Key Bitcoin Metrics Demonstrating Historic Strength The second major theory was that the letter that Congress sent to the SEC Chair Gary Gensler might have struck the wrong nerves, prompting the Commission to make such a decision. In the letter, the congressmen urged the Commission to approve the pending Spot Bitcoin ETFs following the court’s decision in the Grayscale case, stating that the “SEC’s current posture is untenable moving forward.” BTC price still holding $26,000 despite spot ETF delay | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | OP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/21shares-spot-bitcoin-etf/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could lead to an influx of $300 billion into Bitcoin. CleanSpark is ranked as the top Bitcoin mining company, with low valuation ratios and strong growth metrics. Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset class over the past decade by a wide margin. Detractors come out of the woodwork and like to focus on the massive corrections that occur regularly in this sector. Yet, the average annualized return for Bitcoin since 2014 has been 60%. This compares to an average annualized gain of 5% for gold, 9% for the S&P 500, and 16% for the Nasdaq 100. Nicoya Research Those massive drawdowns have proven to be excellent buying opportunities over the past 14 years since Bitcoin was launched and the trend appears to be continuing with the price up 60% year-to-date in 2023 after the massive correction in 2022. Bitcoin mining stocks offer investors leveraged gains during bull cycles but also leveraged losses during bear cycles. As I believe that we are in the early stages of a major bull market cycle for the cryptocurrency sector, this could be an opportune time to buy crypto mining stocks at discounted prices. There are several significant catalysts upcoming for Bitcoin, but one of the most important is the April 2024 halving, an event in which the supply output will be cut in half. This will reduce the inflation rate for Bitcoin from 3.6% to 1.8%. The price has historically rallied in the months leading into the halving and then advanced sharply in the months following it. Bitcoin Magazine / HIVE The other major near-term catalyst is the likely approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. While the SEC has previously denied applications by smaller player, we now have the world's largest asset managers applying to list a spot Bitcoin ETF. These include BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, VanEck, GlobalX, ARK Invest, Valkyrie, and Bitwise. In total, these managers are estimated to have around $18 trillion of Assets Under Management ((AUM)). If these managers put just 1% of the wealth they control into Bitcoin, it would represent $180 billion in new capital inflows into an asset with a market cap of just $500 billion. The approval of a spot ETF by the SEC could lead to an influx of $300 billion into Bitcoin. - Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital This estimate does not include any multiplier effect from other institutions finally having the green light to start investing. And it is worth noting that a spot Bitcoin ETF is much different than current iterations, as it will create real demand for scarce Bitcoin in the marketplace. This projected spike in demand would be coming at a time when the percentage of Bitcoin held by long-term holders continues to increase and the amount available on exchanges to trade continues to decrease. This has the potential to cause a powerful spike higher in the price, which is still trading 60% below the late-2021 record highs. The next SEC ruling on BlackRock's Spot Bitcoin ETF is on October 17th. They could postpone a decision again, but experts see increasing odds of approval. Bitcoin Mining Offers Leveraged Returns Crypto mining is a process that blockchain networks use to finalize transactions. It's called mining because it also releases new coins into circulation. Crypto mining requires significant computing power from specialized machines purpose-built to solve complex problems. These Application-Specific Integrated Circuit ""ASIC"" miners are the workhorses and main capital investments for crypto mining companies. Crypto miners ensure each transaction is legitimate, helping verify and secure blockchain networks. This mining process allows Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies to function in a decentralized manner without oversight from a third party, like a bank. The largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, has been snapping up crypto miners, likely positioning itself ahead of approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF and the coming April 2024 Bitcoin halving. They are now the second-largest shareholder in 4 of the top 5 cryptocurrency miners. But Blackrock is not alone, the investment giant Vanguard , with $7.7 trillion in assets under management, has also accumulated a stake of over $600 million in top Bitcoin miners. This has come mostly indirectly through index funds, but is still significant due to the sheer size of their investment. And Fidelity was an early investor in crypto miners, purchasing a 7.4% stake in Marathon Digital ( MARA ) for $20 million in July of 2021. Crypto firms also received good news this month as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved a change to fair-value accounting. Companies record their crypto at the historical price they paid and review their holdings every quarter for impairments. Holdings are considered impaired even if the price of a cryptocurrency falls temporarily during the reporting period, and values can't be upwardly revised if the price recovers. The new accounting rules mark an improvement over the current method as companies will be able to record gains and losses immediately and classify crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum as financial assets. The rules are expected to take effect in 2025. Crypto miners are down significantly from their 2021 highs. During the time period when Bitcoin crashed from $69k to $15k (78%), most crypto miners were down over 90%. Then when Bitcoin doubled from $15,000 in November of last year to over $30,000 in July of this year, most crypto miners realized gains of 4x to 5x. In this time period, the upside leverage was significantly higher than the downside leverage, offering an attractive risk/reward set-up for investors. With crypto prices having pulled back from recent highs and Bitcoin around 12% off the July highs, crypto miners have corrected by around 50% from their 2023 highs. With several bullish catalysts ahead for the cryptocurrency sector, I believe this current pullback offers an excellent buying opportunity. If Bitcoin climbs 15% back to recent highs, this could equate to gains of 60% to 80% in the value of mining stocks (if recent trends repeat). And if the Bitcoin price is able to return to the late-2021 highs of around $69,000, this 155% move in Bitcoin could equate to gains in excess of 600% for top crypto mining stocks. Marathon Digital reported a Non-GAAP direct cost per coin of approximately $18,900 in the latest quarter. The company reported a total margin excluding D&A at 32.5% of revenues. Most bitcoin miners are reporting gross profits in 2023, but are still operating at a net loss. The reason is due to selling, general, administrative, depreciation and amortization expenses. This is why we have included a ratio of SG&A to revenues to see how lean each company operates. I estimate that the Bitcoin price needs to rise into the $35,000 to $40,000 range for most miners to start seeing a positive net income. Our current price target for Bitcoin by year-end is $45,000, so it is possible that Bitcoin miners could be reporting substantial cash flows and positive net incomes heading into 2024. Comparative Analysis of Top Bitcoin Mining Stocks Given our view that crypto prices are likely to trend much higher over the next 12 months and the demonstrated leverage available from top Bitcoin mining stocks, I decided to run a comparative analysis of the top miners. This analysis looks at a variety of metrics to measure valuation, growth, profitability, operational efficiency, balance sheet health, Bitcoin mining efficiency, and how much Bitcoin each company holds on the balance sheet relative to their overall enterprise value. I highlighted the best data points in each category by assigning a gold, silver, or bronze shading. I gave 3 points for each gold, 2 points for each silver, and 1 point for each bronze assignment, coming up with a total score and ranking. Nicoya Research I then summed up all the points to get an overall ranking. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) came in at #1, Hive Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) was #2 and Marathon Digital Holdings came in at #3 according to our rankings. CleanSpark had the lowest price/book ratio at under 1, the lowest debt/asset ratio at just 8%, and came in second place in terms of quarterly revenue growth (Y/Y), gross profit margin, and Bitcoin mined in the latest quarter per exahash of processing power. CleanSpark also ranked third in terms of EV/Sales at 4.6 and 3-year compound annual growth rate ((CAGR)) at 139%. I would like to see them work on reducing overhead costs and increasing the amount of Bitcoin held as we move toward the next halving. CleanSpark is a leading bitcoin mining company listed on the Nasdaq and incorporated in Nevada. They own and operate five bitcoin mining facilities in Georgia and co-locate miners in upstate New York. The company has a deployed hashrate of 9.3 EH/s and is fully funded to 16 EH/s at full deployment. CleanSpark's hashrate has grown by 210% year over year. They have located facilities in areas where their power cost is as low as 1.5 cents and averages 4.1 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). This is quite impressive considering that the average commercial electricity rate in the U.S. is 12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). By running at max operating power when electricity costs are lowest, and optimizing when electricity costs are higher, we have been able to achieve some of the best margins and highest realized hashrates in the industry. - Gary A. Vecchiarelli, CFO Not only has the company used the bear market cycle in Bitcoin to increase its hashrate (mining capacity), but they have also used this period of lower prices to aggressively increase the amount of Bitcoin held in their treasury. As you can see from the chart below, they went from holding 100 BTC in February of this year to holding 1,677 in August, an increase of nearly 17x! CleanSpark corporate presentation CleanSpark mined 659 Bitcoin in August, 1,624 Bitcoin during Q3 and 4,729 year-to-date in 2023. Q3 revenue was $45.52M (+46.8% Y/Y) and GAAP EPS was -$0.12, but beat expectations by $0.05. The loss was mainly driven by depreciation amortization and another measure of profitability, adjusted EBITDA, was $13.3 million in Q3, an increase of $8.2 million or 160% Y/Y. Risks Mining operations require significant capital expenditures for hardware and infrastructure. Bitcoin mining companies like CLSK are currently losing money and could require additional funding that dilutes shareholders should crypto prices fail to rally as we expect. Rising energy prices and the increasing hash rate could negatively impact margins. The higher the Bitcoin hash rate climbs, the more computing resources that are necessary to solve problems and mine Bitcoin. Hash rate recently hit an all-time high and could continue climbing. This translates into higher overall hardware costs for miners and declining profitability. The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April of 2024 will reduce the block rewards in half, which will negatively impact the financials of mining companies. This is because the miner that solves the problem first and is awarded the Bitcoin will get half of what they are current getting. The Bitcoin price will need to trade significantly higher for the mining companies mentioned in this article to return to reporting positive earnings. Conclusion While I advocate for holding actual Bitcoin in cold storage as the best overall way to participate in this sector, investors might also want to consider investing in Bitcoin miners, as they typically provide leverage gains and can offer a way to diversify exposure to the cryptocurrency sector. CleanSpark is my top pick, but investors might consider owning a small basket including other top names such as HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( HIVE ) or Marathon Digital Holdings.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Wait, I've Seen This One Before  The narrative  The last time the U.S. government shut down, it delayed several approvals for companies and slowed down what many in the industry hoped would be greater regulatory acceptance of crypto.  Why it matters  Well, here we are again. But this shutdown looks to be much weirder than the last one.  Breaking it down  There's a very strong possibility the federal government will be shut down by the time you receive the next edition of this newsletter.  The House of Representatives does not look particularly close to a deal on keeping the federal government running in the short term, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy facing dissatisfaction from his right flank, decreasing the chances of a continuing resolution that would keep federal employees paid.  During the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, companies like Bakkt and ErisX (now a part of Cboe) saw much-needed approvals pushed weeks behind. A bitcoin exchange-traded fund application was withdrawn, with one of the executives at the company behind the product explicitly blaming the shutdown.  We're already seeing the SEC preemptively delay bitcoin ETF applications. Coinbase is also currently looking at an Oct. 11 deadline for a response from the SEC to its Mandamus petition.  My colleague Jesse Hamilton dug into this yesterday for CoinDesk, finding that the shutdown won't quite be a death knell for crypto projects.  One big concern may be for civil and bankruptcy court cases after the first few weeks, when the courts themselves start to slow down. The SEC may also have a limited litigation team during the time period.  Crypto legislation is also likely to be slowed or halted entirely (though these bills have a limited chance anyway), Jesse wrote.  Read more here.

Daniels. According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Rodriguez, along with his co-conspirators, masterminded a sprawling global pyramid scheme that defrauded investors of millions of dollars through false promises of cryptocurrency trading and mining profits. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Developer Xumm Reveals “Infrastructure Overhaul,” More Than An Upgrade? AirBit Co-Founder Convicted For $100 Million Crypto Fraud Per the DOJ’s investigations, the elaborate scheme involved luring unsuspecting and often inexperienced investors into purchasing AirBit Club memberships with the guarantee of substantial returns. However, instead of engaging in legitimate cryptocurrency activities, Rodriguez and his cohorts allegedly diverted the funds for personal gain while employing an intricate money laundering operation to conceal their ill-gotten profits. Rodriguez’s co-defendants, Gutemberg Dos Santos, Scott Hughes, Cecilia Millan, and Karina Chairez, have already pleaded guilty and await sentencing. The court has also ordered the forfeiture of the fraudulent proceeds, which include a staggering $100 million worth of assets, such as US currency, Bitcoin (BTC), and real estate. Describing Rodriguez’s actions as a flagrant exploitation of cryptocurrency for fraudulent purposes, US Attorney Damian Williams emphasized the importance of this case in deterring potential fraudsters from making false promises of lucrative cryptocurrency investments. Troubling Pattern Of Fraudulent Ventures According to court documents, Rodriguez and Dos Santos founded AirBit Club in 2015 and “aggressively” marketed it as a multilevel marketing club operating in the cryptocurrency industry. The duo reportedly organized extravagant expos and presentations worldwide, enticing victims to invest in cash and providing them access to an online portal showcasing false investment returns. As early as 2016, victims who attempted to withdraw funds encountered excuses, delays, and exorbitant hidden fees. The scheme’s architects, including Rodriguez, spent the defrauded money on luxury items, financed more expos to attract additional victims, and siphoned funds through a network of domestic and foreign bank accounts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume Hit Six-Year Low – Is Investor Confidence Rising? According to the DOJ, Rodriguez’s attorney trust account, managed by Scott Hughes, played a crucial role in concealing the illicit proceeds of the AirBit Club scheme. Before AirBit Club, Rodriguez and Dos Santos were involved in another pyramid investment scheme called Vizinova, which led to a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Hughes, an attorney representing Rodriguez and Dos Santos in the Vizinova case, later assisted them in perpetrating the AirBit Club fraud by removing negative information about both schemes from the internet. With Rodriguez’s sentencing, justice has been served to one of the key figures responsible for defrauding countless victims through AirBit Club.

BTC is on the brink of pushing ETH lower at spot rates, registering new 2023 lows and extending gains from early this year. The Downtrend Remains: Will Bitcoin Extend Rally? Bitcoin bulls are in the driving seat. Candlestick arrangement in the weekly chart shows that BTC pushed on, extending its rally against the second most valuable coin despite attempts for higher highs in mid-August. In the second week of August, ETH added roughly 7% versus BTC. Notably, this expansion was after a period of horizontal consolidation as momentum shifted in favor of ETH. However, bears reversed gains and continued the primary trend established since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Developer Xumm Reveals “Infrastructure Overhaul,” More Than An Upgrade? The medium trajectory seems to be guided by events in mid-March 2023. Then, ETH prices devalued drastically versus Bitcoin, forming a bearish engulfing bar marked by a spike in trading volume. The surging demand for BTC saw prices reverse progress in late October 2022. Bitcoin bulls have since extended gains versus Ethereum. However, one notable formation is that BTC is rallying at the back of light trading volume. Since the rally of BTC in Q1 2023 versus ETH, trading volume has been contracting despite prices printing lower lows. Regulatory Pressure, Hacks In Focus, Will Halving Spark Demand? It cannot be immediately ascertained whether the current draw-down will continue. The level of participation has significantly decreased in the last six months as sentiment dipped. Over the past two quarters, the involvement of regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seems to have negatively impacted activity. In early June, the SEC sued Coinbase and Binance, two of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The regulator cited various claims, accusing Coinbase of listing unregistered securities and Binance of, among other charges, manipulation and violating different securities laws. Binance and Coinbase plan to defend themselves against the SEC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume Hit Six-Year Low – Is Investor Confidence Rising? Besides regulations, the broader community remains cautious, considering the number of hacks targeting multiple exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Some of these exploits have been linked to the Lazarus Group, a notorious cell allegedly sponsored by North Korea. Despite the general market lull, traders look forward to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024. The event will create a supply shock, making BTC scarcer. Whether this will see BTC press ETH even lower back to June 2022 lows is yet to be seen.

18095827,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553022,1695772803,Analyst Uncovers BlackRock Long Interest In Bitcoin Mining – Details,"Based on a recent report by Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts, asset managers’ interest in Bitcoin stretches beyond exchange-traded funds (ETF) into the mining sector. In particular, Coutts speaks about BlackRock, describing the asset manager’s application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin spot ETF as “unsurprising.” The analyst stated that BlackRock and other prominent global asset managers, namely Vanguard and State Street, have been involved in the Bitcoin mining industry for over three years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New All-Time High As BTC Price Moves Sideways BlackRock And Other ESG-Driven Companies Investing In Bitcoin Mining, Analyst Says James Coutts stated that BlackRock began its venture into Bitcoin mining in 2020 by investing in Marathon Digital, the second-largest publicly traded mining company. Notably, this development occurred when the Bitcoin mining industry faced high criticism, likely due to the substantial reliance on fossil fuels. Over the last three years, Coutts reports that BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have increased their respective investments in Bitcoin mining companies, regardless of the market cycle. Interestingly, all three asset managers are known to promote Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment principles, part of which is limiting fossil fuel use. However, it appears that investing in Bitcoin mining may not damage the ESG credentials of these companies. According to a report by Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital, James Coutt notes that Bitcoin mining currently derives 50% of its energy from sustainable sources. And this percentage is likely to increase as Bitcoin mining has the unique ability to monetize stranded energy and stabilize energy grids. Related Reading: Here’s Why Arthur Hayes Is Not In Support Of A BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Potential Effect Of Bitcoin Mining Institutionalization Based on James Coutts’s report, BlackRock and the two other asset managers in the discussion are currently the top investors in the three largest publicly traded mining companies, namely Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and Cleanspark. Together, these mining companies collectively own 8.9% of the global hash rate, which is significant as public miners only account for 15% of the global hash power. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence For now, James Coutts believes that the involvement of these asset managers in Bitcoin mining poses little challenge to the network’s decentralization. However, the analyst notes that there may be a future clash of network and ESG values, especially given the activist tendencies of BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. However, this would not prevent the Bitcoin network from operating as expected. But it may lead other miners whose operations still rely on fossil fuels to start processing “censored transactions.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,198.48, with a 0.57% gain in the last month, according to data from Tradingview.

In a press release sent out on Wednesday, SCBX and Hashed announced that they have signed an agreement to work on joint R&D initiatives and events aimed at promoting decentralized technology adoption regionally and globally.  “This partnership amalgamates the expertise of a reputable institution with the technological and philosophical foundations of Web3,” Simon Seojoon Kim, CEO & Managing Partner, Hashed, said in a release. “I am confident that this partnership will significantly nurture the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, extending its influence not only across Southeast Asia but also on a global scale.""  While many of Asia’s largest financial institutions are still skeptical of crypto, despite a warming regulatory environment in the region, SCB has invested heavily in the market. In 2021, SCB announced that SCB10X, its venture arm, was launching a $50 million blockchain fund. Recently, SCB’s cross-town rival, Kasikornbank (KBank), launched a $100 million web3 and AI fund.  As part of this collaboration, Hashed will spearhead tests on Web3 technologies through its research hub, ShardLab.  In an interview, Hashed’s Hojin Kim, the Chief Strategy Officer at its startup studio UNOPND, who will be overseeing this effort, said that the joint effort will be testing Web3 technologies that are specific to helping address pain points in South East Asia’s business environment.  “In Southeast Asia, the existing customers still face certain inconveniences in their regular lives; their banks are still not as advanced, and e-commerce platforms are still evolving. Thus, there's more room for improvement in terms of digital transformation for retail customers in Southeast Asia compared to developed countries,” he said.  The two firms have yet to name any specific projects they are working on, but that’s expected in the near future.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | ZRX,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/27/digital-arm-of-thailands-scbx-and-korean-web3-firm-hashed-ink-rd-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2290b9892d90c7d4c7a06683f022d45795152287-1279x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
