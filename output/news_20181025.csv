42381332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94soF,1540509409,Bitcoin's White Paper Isn't Just Words – It's a Constitution,"Bruce Fenton is CEO of Atlantic Financial, founder of Chainstone Labs, host of the Satoshi Roundtable and board member of Medici Ventures.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      The bitcoin white paper changed how money can work, yes, but less discussed – and even more important – is how it is changing how we share and place value on ideas.  As we look back at the 10 years since bitcoin's white paper was first published, I think it's clear Satoshi's words aren't just words. Like another famous white paper, Alan Turing's ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"" bitcoin's was clear and scientific, describing with authority a particular – and new – idea.  This is an important differentiator. We tend to think of bitcoin as the network, nodes, miners and HODLers, but it's really an idea, first expressed in the white paper. (Many so-called white papers today are simply marketing or legal documents.)  Everything that came after, including the code, is a continuation of that idea. An ideal white paper, then, is an objective description of an idea. Beliefs about what the idea means can change, but if an idea is good people will build on it.  The concept of bitcoin as an idea is basic, but it's also easy to misunderstand.  Bitcoin was a new invention that could do things that were not possible before. The world just does not work the same way as it did before the existence of the bitcoin white paper and its idea. That's a big distinction from describing an idea based on an existing invention.  One can argue that they think an idea is bad or they can say that they think that it won't have much application or adoption. There are valid debates about the technology, but the basis for them should acknowledge that the idea exists and is indeed new.  At least for now, bitcoin does work. It also works in a different way than anything else before it ever worked: this is important. Those who criticize the technology without understanding what it can do as ""nothing more than a database"" are missing this key point.  It really is a new idea and can do things differently.  This Thing Called Governance  Once we have a basis to agree what an idea is, we can begin work on that idea.  I was early enough in bitcoin to see this firsthand: a mostly unified vision of what this experiment might do. In those early days, there was also much less focus on day-to-day economics. Early on, it's easy to gather around a vision. As time goes on and interpretations of the idea change, there will be differing opinions about direction.  White papers, like bitcoin's, both help people gather around an idea that they share in common and serve as a guideline for future people working on that idea.  When those interested in bitcoin as an idea differ on the direction of a project, they can choose from several options:  Interpret the original texts in the way that they believe was intended  Adapt the text or keep it fixed and rigid (like a Constitution)  Adapt the text, change it and make it different  Disregard it or propose something potentially better.  Ideas, at least at first, are always centralized.  On day one, no one really disagrees about what that idea means. The creators of that idea can be very clear and no one can say ""this is what you meant."" This key early centralized authority to define and start a project is crucial.  But as bitcoin adapts and grows, we're seeing that disagreement unfolds in a special way.  Building a Forest  Bitcoin is like planting a forest: an idea started with somebody planting a seed. In the case of the bitcoin white paper, the planter was Satoshi Nakamoto.  Then people come along to water that seed (early developers). Then more people help: other developers, companies, and individuals begin to support it. People take clippings from this little tree that's now growing and they plant their own copies of it.  Some are an identical copy, some use the same seeds, some are clones. Some are mutants, some are what some call weeds. Some die.  Eventually a whole bunch of people plant more plants, water them, feed branches and together we built a forest. It's in the later stages that it gets more and more tricky. As systems become large and complex, there are more stakeholders and disagreements.  It is inevitable that there will be shifts and splits, fragments and schisms. You can hang out in any section of that forest you want.  But when people disagree, bitcoin (the idea) has a unique mechanism to deal with this (as do other the projects which copy it in form and substance). Bitcoin is a huge network now with diverse participants with diverse goals. Many of these participants may or may not like every aspect of the way that bitcoin evolves.  But, we all have shared incentive as participants in the network to make the work network work. If it is got a network effect and it's secure, then we are going to continue to use it.  Voting with software  A key part of the invention is that bitcoin is designed to prevent mob rule.  Efforts in the past in global politics have worked on trying to fight, control or end mobs. In crypto, mobs can go their own way. People who agree to a certain set of rules can participate on a network with any set of rules that they agree with.  The mob does not have the ability to outvote them. They can still run that chain. The only effect other individuals can have is to move elsewhere and build something new. If it makes your system obsolete then you can choose to follow them.  Inevitably as with all important texts, we had major groups which fractured and disagreed over their interpretation of the paper.  Ultimately, in bitcoin, each party is able to run the code that they prefer based on the rules that they like. People are free to choose their own personal interpretation of what the white paper means (or whether that is even relevant or important).  The success and popularity of bitcoin helps to contribute to a new governance system. This could perhaps affect commerce and other voluntary interactions: the ability to voluntarily run the code with the rules you want.  Many people do not understand this. We still have people concerned about the centralization and control over bitcoin by key developers or companies. Other projects may have more centralized or influential personalities. While certain people have great *influence* over some projects, they only have control if they control consensus.  This is what's great about decentralized open-source projects, and it's a critical part of bitcoin as an idea.  Running code is like running your own personal Constitution. When you run the bitcoin software, you are agreeing to a set of rules that can't be affected by mob rule. If times or your beliefs change, the system allows you to adapt and change with the rules you prefer.  Whatever comes next, the white paper will be the root of it all.

Citing ""people familiar with the matter,"" the report says Bitfury is looking into listing in Amsterdam, London or Hong Kong, possibly as soon as 2019, though no final decisions have been made, according to the report.  Other options include raising debt financing or selling a minority stake.  The company has contacted investment banks around the world as it considers whether to hold an IPO, Bloomberg said.  Bitfury may be valued somewhere between $3 and $5 billion if it goes public within the next two years, according to Bloomberg's sources. However, these valuations are ""early estimates and could change depending on markets and the industry,"" the report continued.  The company most recently released its latest generation of bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for mining the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap last month, as well as an enterprise-grade bitcoin miner earlier in October.  It has also been working to build up a number of mining farms in Canada through its affiliate, Hut 8 Mining Corp.

42381353,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t5r,1540485928,Ripple Says XRP Cryptocurrency Sales Doubled in Q3 2018,"Distributed ledger tech startup Ripple saw revenue from the sale of the digital asset XRP more than double this past quarter compared to the second quarter of 2018.  In its Q3 2018 XRP Markets Report, released Thursday, Ripple announced it sold $163.33 million in XRP, up from $75.53 million in the second quarter. Most of the increase came from institutional direct sales, where Ripple subsidiary XRP II sold $98.06 million, compared to only $16.87 the quarter before. It saw a much smaller increase in programmatic sales quarter-over-quarter, going from $56.66 million to $65.27 million.  That being said, Ripple has yet to match its first-quarter sales of $167.7 million.  Year-over-year, Ripple is still coming out ahead: it sold $19.6 million in XRP in direct and $32.6 million in programmatic sales during the third quarter of 2017 when the cryptocurrency market bull run was entering its peak.  Notably, while Ripple has previously made some mention of new customers in its markets reports, to the point of saying it saw its ""best quarter ever in Q2"" in terms of customer growth, its latest report did not discuss adding any new clients.  Ripple also reported releasing 3 billion XRP out of escrow accounts last quarter, though 2.6 billion tokens were placed in new escrow accounts. The remaining 400 million XRP tokens are ""being used in a variety of ways to help support the XRP ecosystem,"" the report stated, though it did not provide any details.  The report added that while XRP's price declined through most of the third quarter, matching the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization, it did rally near the end of September.

Citing anonymous sources, Reuters reported Thursday that the Royal Mint had frozen its plans to issue Royal Mint Gold (RMG) tokens after its partnership with the CME Group fell through and the U.K. government ""vetoed a plan to have the tokens trade on a cryptocurrency exchange.""  A Royal Mint spokesperson confirmed that RMG will not be launching at this time, though they left the door open to restarting the project in the future.  The spokesperson said via email:  ""Over the last few years, The Royal Mint has been working on the development of a digital gold product, RMG, which was due to launch this spring. Sadly, due to market conditions this did not prove possible at this time, but we will revisit this if and when market conditions are right.""  RMG was initially scheduled to launch in the fall of 2017, but the CME partnership failed ""at the last minute,"" resulting in the Royal Mint no longer having a trading platform to issue tokens on. While the organization tried to find a crypto exchange to partner with instead, the British finance ministry reportedly blocked the move.  The RMG token was later scheduled to be issued in spring of 2018, but this again did not work out.  RMG was envisioned as a way to manage small amounts of gold, making it easier for investors to enter the market and increase liquidity. The Royal Mint also believed the blockchain platform RMG was based on could be used to track and prove a piece of gold's provenance, as well as support global trades.  Crypto security firm BitGo was tapped to build digital wallets for storing the tokens, while Civic would provide know-your-customer (KYC) services for the project.

The two announced in a joint press release on Thursday that two blockchain prototypes built to their specifications had ""successfully"" supported the settlement of securities transactions, payments (including interest) and bond repayments at maturity.  The project got started in March 2016, when both parties launched BLOCKBASTER (for blockchain-based settlement technology research) project – aimed to create ""a conceptual prototype"" for blockchain-based system to transfer and settle securities and fiat currency.  The prototypes were developed on Hyperledger Fabric and the blockchain platform created by Digital Asset (DA), which is notably also working with the Australian Securities Exchange to replace its CHESS system in 2020.  According to the release, the tests showed that the prototypes are able to facilitate the ""productive operation of a realistic financial market infrastructure."" Recent upgrades of both blockchain platforms could further improve performance if integrated, it adds.  ""The tests have shown that blockchain technology is a suitable basis for applications in the field of settlement and other financial infrastructures,"" said Berthold Kracke, CEO of Clearstream Banking and head of Clearstream Global Operations at Deutsche Börse Group.  Burkhard Balz, member of the executive board, Deutsche Bundesbank, added the firms expect the development to continue apace, and that they see ""potential in using it for high-volume applications.""  He added:  ""The approach of a permissioned architecture, which takes into account the requirements of the financial sector from the outset, has proven to be right.""

42381343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t0p,1540471855,Blockchain's First Hardware Wallet Will Let You Trade Crypto for Crypto,"One of the oldest software wallet providers in the cryptocurrency industry is launching its first hardware product.  Announced Thursday, Blockchain has partnered with hardware wallet maker Ledger and started taking orders for a new handheld device called Lockbox. The first batch of shipments will go out in November.  While there are a number of hardware wallets on the market, Lockbox stands out in two ways, according to Blockchain CEO and co-founder Peter Smith. First, in addition to storing funds offline like other devices, it will facilitate crypto-to-crypto trades through Swap, the company's native brokerage, which is launching next week.  The aim is to make trading easier with an all-in-one account, Smith told CoinDesk, explaining:  ""For us, what's really important right now is to get the product to a point where you don't need other places to complete your user actions in crypto.""  Further, unlike other hardware wallets, Lockbox is ""endpoint-controlled,"" Smith said. In other words, while the wallet connects to the internet by plugging into a computer, a special key set inside the device will only allow it to connect with legitimate websites, deflecting phishing attempts by fake versions of external platforms like MyEtherWallet, for example.  Much like Blockchain's online platform, which garnered nearly 30 million accounts since its founding in 2011, the Lockbox will mainly support bitcoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. However, the team said they are willing to consider adding support for additional assets if there's proven user demand.  Smith added that although his company will be selective about which assets it supports on Lockbox, the Swap brokerage will allow the whole Blockchain platform to expand crypto offerings faster than ever before because it will not be solely reliant on external liquidity sources.  ""We built a machine trading platform,"" he said. ""It connects to different liquidity [sources] across the ecosystem, everything from different exchanges to market makers.""  As a result, ""I think we will be more aggressive on adding assets in the next six months,"" Smith said. ""In the long run, I see our trading system being both a consumer and a provider to DEXs,"" or decentralized exchanges, where traders retain custody throughout the process.  Reducing friction  All this will be made easier by Ledger's full scope of support for a variety of cryptocurrencies, scheduled to reach support for 100 assets by 2019.  ""It's the first big deal between our two companies and there may be more in the future,"" Ledger president Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk. ""When we design technology for us, we design also for our partners. So whatever features we make for the Nano S, we will also make available for our partners, should they have the need.""  In the meantime, altcoin traders will be able to pair Ledger's multi-coin Nano S devices with Blockchain wallets for a smoother trading experience.  While Ledger handles the manufacturing side of Lockbox, Blockchain is focused on creating a holistic mobile and platform experience. This collaboration is indicative of a broader shift among industry incumbents seeking to reduce friction for traders, who must generally juggle multiple exchange and wallet accounts, and conduct extensive research about platforms' security before connecting their devices.  ""With our products, you can go from cold to hot [storage] in a heartbeat and the device will never reveal the key, so it means that it opens many avenues, especially for traders,"" Gauthier said.  Concurring with Smith on the role of hardware wallets in DEX platforms, he added:  ""We believe our security systems and the types of devices that we have will be at the heart of this [DEX] industry.""  Speaking broadly to hardware wallet innovations over the past year, Johns Hopkins cryptography professor Matthew Green told CoinDesk the crypto industry is ""relearning some of the lessons that smart cards and the secure devices community have learned over the years"" about security.  On the other hand, Green said there are still design factors that could help improve the devices' usability, such as more buttons for entering passcodes without relying on a computer for account management.  In Green's mind, the perfect hardware wallet would let users ""generate transactions directly without connecting to your computer.""  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

The unnamed woman is said to have stolen 100,000 XRP in January from a wallet owned by a 56-year-old man, according to a report by ZDNet on Wednesday. She was apparently arrested by police following a raid at her home after a 10-month long investigation.  Following the hacking of his email account, the victim had reportedly become locked out of his crypto wallet for two days. When he managed to regain access, he found the XRP was gone.  Another report by News Corp Australia alleges that the woman transferred the XRP ""into an exchange based in China, which was later converted into bitcoin.""  At the time of the theft, XRP was trading at around $3.50. Due to the sharp fall in prices since then, XRP is worth around $0.45 at press time, making the current value of the stolen funds just over $45,500, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  News Corp quotes Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis, Cybercrime Squad Commander, New South Wales Police Force, as saying:  ""An email account is more valuable than people realise – scammers are increasingly targeting emails as they link the individual to financial accounts and other personal information.""  Katsogiannis further stressed that email accounts containing personal and financial information should have a ""minimum of two-factor authentication.""  News Corp indicates that the woman has been granted conditional bail and is due to appear at a local court on Nov. 19.

42381350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t8N,1540465252,Bitcoin Price Still Seeking Buyers Despite Passing Key Trendline,"Bitcoin's price remains in a tight range below $6,500 despite recently breaching a key price hurdle.  The leading cryptocurrency cleared the resistance at the trendline drawn between the July 25 and Sept. 4 highs on Oct. 10., yet the bullish breakout failed to put a bid under BTC, leaving it directionless in a narrow range of $6,476–$6,376.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,395 on Coinbase.  The U.S. stock markets fell sharply yesterday triggering a flight to safety across the globe. The heightened risk aversion, as represented by a 3 percent drop in the S&P 500, could be bad news for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency is still considered a risky asset. The blue-chip index has been leading the bitcoin market by 12 hours or more over the last few weeks.  As a result, a range breakdown cannot be ruled out. However, if BTC continues to show resilience in the next few hours, then the prospects of a range breakout would improve. Even so, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only if prices climb above $6,810, as discussed earlier this week.  Daily chart        The bulls' inability to capitalize on the violation of the falling trendline could be down to the fact that the breakout was a sideways breach – generally considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace.  As a result, attention has shifted to last week's high of $6,810, which, if scaled, may allow a sustained rally to the September high of $7,402.  4-hour chart  A break below $6,376 (lower edge of the range) could embolden the bears, driving prices down to key support at $6,230 (horizontal line on the above chart). Acceptance below that level would expose the next major support: the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) lined up at $6,121.  Monthly chart  Over on the monthly chart, BTC seems to have carved out a bottom along the 21-month EMA. However, the 5-month and 10-month EMAs produced a bear cross last month. As a result, a break below the 21-month EMA cannot be ruled out as long as BTC is trading below the 10-month EMA of $7,114.  View  A range breakout could happen if BTC continues to defend support at $6,376 despite the risk aversion in the stock markets. A break above $6,476, if confirmed, would open the doors to $6,810.  A range breakdown, if confirmed, would shift risk in favor of a drop to $6,230 and $6,121 (21-month EMA).  A weekly close (Sunday's close as per UTC) above last week's high of $6,810 would put the bulls in a commanding position.  A monthly close below the 21-month EMA will likely prove costly.

42381340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94syJ,1540461633,Investors Received False Information About Bitmain Funding Round,"Parties solicited to invest in the pre-initial public offering (IPO) funding round for Bitmain Technologies, Ltd., the leading maker of cryptocurrency mining software and hardware, received pitch decks falsely suggesting the company had secured financial backing from Digital Sky Technologies Global and GIC Private Limited, an investigation by CoinDesk has found.  The question is who put those misrepresentations into the pitch decks. With all three versions that were identified and reviewed, CoinDesk was unable to verify their authenticity independently of their recipients. Bitmain has not responded to multiple inquiries concerning the production and dissemination of the pitch decks, even though all of them printed the company name and a confidentiality warning on each slide, and two versions prescribed deadlines and methods on bank wiring instructions.  One version of the pitch decks, originally written in Chinese and translated into English by CoinDesk, described Bitmain as having ""recently completed a $400 million Series B round of financing from Sequoia Capital, DST and GIC, with a pre-investment valuation of $12 billion"" and was forwarded by someone claiming to have access to the deal and, without offering proof, knowledge that Bitmain created the pitch deck, says a source who came into possession of the copy.  The other two versions, worded differently and already formatted in English, stated Bitmain had ""raised another $400 million at a $12 billion valuation from investors such as Sequoia China, GIC and DST in a Series B round"" and circulated in public social media discussions and private email exchanges where one copy was procured from participating in the pre-IPO round, according to another source who claims the pitch deck originated from Bitmain.  CoinDesk learned about the inaccuracy of the statements three days after reporting about Bitmain's Series B investors on August 10. Jan Wootten, a representative for DST Global, Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner's Hong Kong-headquartered technology investment group, notified CoinDesk by email that ""DST Global did not invest in Bitmain"" and asked for a correction to the article. Josh Lindsfor, a DST Global managing director, confirmed Wootten's statement in another email weeks later, refuting a DST Global investment across Bitmain's funding rounds altogether.  The following month, GIC, one of several sovereign wealth funds managed by the Singaporean government, issued the same denial when CoinDesk reached out to a spokesperson for comment. Other investors listed in the pitch decks besides DST Global and GIC were found to be legitimate.  Possible legal implications  The investigation comes after a CoinDesk article last month revealed SoftBank Group and Tencent Holdings did not invest in Bitmain. The report contradicted earlier media items from IPO Zao ZhiDao, a WeChat news outlet popular in China for covering IPOs across the Asian continent.  Following the CoinDesk report, many voices in the cryptocurrency community accused Bitmain of spreading the false claims, but the sourcing for the IPO Zao ZhiDao article has been unclear. IPO Zhao ZhiDao's pseudonymous author ""Uncle C"" has refused to comment on the tipster's identity, and the investment claims have not been published in official investor documents of knowledge to CoinDesk.  However, the link between Bitmain and these latest misrepresentations about DST Global and GIC, while inconclusive, appears to be less tenuous enough to compel a serious reaction from the source who spoke with CoinDesk about receiving an English pitch deck and investing in the pre-IPO round.  The source, who claims a Bitmain investor provided the pitch deck after introducing and co-signing the offer, believed the claims were true when the deal was being finalized and feels sufficiently ""unsettled"" by the debunked assertions to consider taking legal action against Bitmain, although the response remains to be seen.  If Bitmain is discovered to have been responsible for advertising the false claims in the pitch decks, the legal implications could be significant. In Hong Kong, where Bitmain is physically located, a company that makes false statements ""for the purpose of inducing another person to enter into an agreement"" could face legal liability for committing ""fraudulent or reckless misrepresentation,"" said Ashurst LLP legal counsel Hoi Tok Leung.  Depending on the discretion of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, Bitmain management could be penalized with up to 7 years in prison, HK$1 million in fines and partial or full monetary damages in investor claims under Hong Kong law, Leung explained, drawing comparisons to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Generally speaking, the S.E.C., or the equivalent regulatory body in the U.S., is also ""likely to pursue anyone they believe is fraudulently seeking to raise capital from U.S. investors"" on jurisdictional grounds unless ""management had a reasonable good faith reason to believe the information to be true at the time,"" said Timothy Peterson, a Murphy & McGonigle financial technology law partner and former S.E.C. Division of Enforcement senior counsel.  Still, not every investor has come in contact with the pitch decks containing the false claims, limiting the magnitude of potential legal recourse against Bitmain. A managing director at a Hong Kong venture capital firm that participated in the pre-IPO round of funding who spoke with CoinDesk on condition of anonymity recalls that a pitch deck was not exchanged and DST Global and GIC were not brought up at any point in funding discussions.  The investment opportunity was instead presented at a pitch meeting organized by a group of intermediary investors. ""There were a few asset managers who made a bulk [funding channel in] the round and many investors went through them,"" the managing director said.  Going public  Mainland Chinese natives Micree Zhan and CEO Jihan Wu co-founded Bitmain in 2013 to build cryptocurrency mining rigs that would run on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. Their goal was to out-compete existing mining devices, which performed complex, energy-intensive mathematical computations to crack cryptographic codes and retrieve bitcoins as fast as possible from a distributed digital ledger known as a blockchain.  With the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry since then, Bitmain has experienced booming business by diversifying into the alternative cryptocurrencies ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash and siacoin. Bitmain has also profited enormously by running its own mining rigs throughout in-house mining farms that operate in the U.S., China, Europe and the Middle East.  According to investor documents, in the last year alone, Bitmain has raked in billions of dollars from sales of mining equipment and management of mining pools and farms, pouring vast sums of that money into robotics, artificial intelligence and other companies working on blockchain technology.  The explosive growth has also been reflected in the IPO listing Bitmain filed in September for public trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by the beginning of next year, CoinDesk previously reported. The IPO's market capitalization was valued at somewhere between $40 to $50 billion, making Bitmain one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency companies and startup unicorns.  But now, in light of these pitch decks, Bitmain could be placed in not only murky financial waters with the recent market slump contributing to excess product inventories, but also legal jeopardy with the company's plans to go mainstream as the cryptocurrency sector continues to fend off an overwhelmingly negative reputation as an industry rife with credibility problems.  In March, the S.E.C. reportedly subpoenaed 80-something individuals and businesses for suspicious activities associated with initial coin offerings (ICOs), a crowdfunding structure that transacts in cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-like financial assets.  In late August, the North American Securities Administrators Association announced more than 200 investigations into cryptocurrency operators and businesses throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 70 are actively underway.  Dozens of lawsuits and arrests have been reported worldwide in connection to the cryptocurrency vehicles at the center of these investigations, with areas of interests that include the veracity of marketing statements and promotional materials.

Blossom Finance, a microfinancing platform for social causes using Sharia models, is planning to issue a blockchain-based sukuk in coming months, according to a Reuters report Wednesday.  While the size of the initial issuance may not be large, the use of blockchain tech is expected to lower issuance costs and attract more retail investors, chief strategy officer Khalid Howladar said at a recent Islamic accounting event, according to the report.  He explained:  ""Technology allows you to on-board customers in a far cheaper way than you could ever do before. The sukuk would use a profit-sharing structure and carry a profit rate of around 10 percent.""  Unlike traditional bonds that are debt instruments with an interest component, sukuks are tradeable instruments based on a profit sharing model, much like stocks.  Blossom Finance also plans other blockchain-powered bonds to fund a green waste disposal project and a hospital expansion, the post adds.  The firm first introduced its ""Smart Sukuk"" platform in May to standardize and automate legal, accounting and payment aspects of the bonds. The platform utilizes ethereum smart contracts to ""increase the efficiency and reach of sukuk issuance globally,"" the firm said at the time.  Blockchain and smart contracts are seeing increasing attention in the bonds markets. A World Bank trial in August raised $81 million through its first blockchain-based bond.  Additionally, the city council of Berkeley, California, was seeking approval for its issuance of a blockchain-based microbond in May, as a way of funding local initiatives. And JPMorgan Chase in April partnered with National Bank of Canada and other major firms to trial a blockchain platform aimed to improve the debt issuance process.

42381331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94smz,1540447231,Japan's Financial Regulator Mulls Cap on Cryptocurrency Margin Trading,"Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is planning to put a cap on the leverage available for crypto margin trading to curb speculation and risk.  According to a news report from Nikkei Thursday, the financial market regulator is considering limiting crypto margin traders' borrowing power to two to four times their deposits.  Currently, there are no regulations specifically governing the cryptocurrency margin trading space in Japan, the report added, with exchanges offering as much as 25 times leverage. That means traders can effectively borrow cryptocurrencies worth up to 25 times the deposit with an exchange, however, just a 4 percent drop in the purchased crypto assets would wipe out the initial deposit.  Nikkei said seven of the 16 licensed exchanges by the FSA now offer marge trading services, adding that a panel comprised of FSA officials and industry experts is now set to discuss ways to impose potential regulations in this area.  The news follows previous statistics released by the FSA, which indicated cryptocurrency margin trading has seen rapid growth in Japan. For instance, over 80 percent of the total cryptocurrency trading volume in Japan in 2017 came from derivatives trading, which recorded $543 billion. More than 90 percent of that figure came from margin traders.  Early this year, the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory body formed by the 16 licensed trading platforms in Japan, pushed for setting a cap as a low as 4 times the deposit.  ""This is just a provisional measure – I don't think a ratio of 4 is adequate,"" Taizen Okuyama, who chairs the association, was quoted as saying in the report.  Just yesterday, the FSA officially approved the JVCEA as a ""certified fund settlement business association,"" meaning it now has legal status to police domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

42381333,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94sql,1540440039,A Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange That's Almost Decentralized,"Of all the cryptocurrency projects describing themselves as ""decentralized exchanges"" (DEXs), Bisq may live up to the description better than most.  Operating since 2016, when it was originally called Bitsquare, the Bisq DEX runs directly on the user's computer, rather than a hosted site, as many of the self-described DEXs currently do. And while DEXs like Airswap and Everbloom are operated by startups, Bisq is a strictly open source project developed by a grassroots collective.  However, the team behind Bisq recognizes it has more to do to eliminate single points of failure. As Bisq contributor Felix Moreno, a former chief financial officer of the bitcoin custody startup Xapo, told CoinDesk:  ""If the [Bisq] founders want to go complete Satoshi and disappear from the project, it has to be able to survive that.""  So the Bisq team is launching a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), essentially software designed to manage compensation for contributors to the project's code without oversight from any single party. The testnet goes live in November, with the mainnet launching later this year.  That compensation will come in the form of a new cryptocurrency called BSQ. It's a colored coin, essentially bitcoin that's been marked as representing some other form of value in a layer above the core protocol. The Bisq DAO will distribute bitcoin that's been donated to the project, in this watermarked form, to those contributors that the community has voted to approve.  ""Every month there is this voting and compensation cycle where any contributor files a compensation request for the amount of BSQ,"" Bisq co-founder Manfred Karrer told CoinDesk. ""Then the BSQ stakeholders, anyone who has BSQ, can vote if they accept or decline this compensation request.""  To be sure, this plan combines two crypto concepts with inauspicious histories. The bitcoin community's colored coin projects have generally floundered and attracted far less usage than ethereum-based tokens, which allow people to issue their own cryptocurrency without creating a unique blockchain. And the most famous example of a DAO, known simply as The DAO, collapsed after a highly publicized security breach in 2016.  Yet security is precisely the reason Bisq is launching BSQ on top of bitcoin, rather than ethereum, where The DAO debacle led to a contentious hard fork. Karrer said proof-of-work coins, which rely on miners doing complex calculations to update the blockchain ledger, are only secure when they've reached as widespread usage as bitcoin has. Furthermore, the Bisq community doesn't believe that ethereum developers are able to provide secure, bug-free token generation quite yet.  ""It [BSQ] is running on bitcoin, which on one hand is much harder to do because the programming language is not as flexible. But on the other hand, it's more secure,"" Moreno said.  So far, the Bisq project has received 2.5 bitcoin in donations, which can potentially be marked and divided into roughly 2.5 million BSQ tokens. But these tokens aren't automatically generated. They are created if and when a DAO compensation proposal is approved. Then, much like a subway token or a movie ticket, BSQ will be consumed when someone spends them to use the DEX.  Specifically, the tokens will be used to pay trading fees to Bisq and security deposits via the DEX's multi-signature smart contract, which holds bitcoin in escrow until the seller confirms receiving payment (off-platform, in another currency) from the buyer.  But while BSQ is one-time-use, the tokens will retain value as bitcoin, and those fees are generally used to pay bitcoin miners for processing transactions, as well as an arbitrator to referee disputes when necessary.  Tortoise vs. hare  The road ahead is steep. A comparative lack of market makers is a serious issue for the Bisq network.  Many ethereum-based tokens that proliferate on other DEXs are scarcely represented on Bisq's order book. For example, out of 236 sample Bisq orders for bitcoin, the only cryptocurrency payment option with more than 10 orders was the privacy coin monero, with just 23 compared to the 46 euro offers for bitcoin. Indeed, The Block reported nearly 89 percent of Bisq's trading volume over the last three months involved monero.  To a degree, this underscores the Bisq community's privacy focus. When the DEX garnered more than $2 million in transactions through more than 979 trades in September, overall monero was the most popular crypto swapped directly for bitcoin. (Bisq also works through the anonymizing Tor browser.) Then the exchange reached an all-time high in October, with an overall monthly trading volume exceeding $3.5 million.  Yet while Bisq has been regularly processing more than 900 transactions a month since April 2018, this is a small number of transactions compared to DEX ecosystems like 0x, which facilitates thousands of transactions a week, including more than 100 cryptocurrencies. In terms of overall offers, the institutionally focused Everbloom recently aggregated 140,000 offers at once and garnered roughly 5 percent of its traction from India, plus 7 percent from Turkish crypto traders.  Moreno told CoinDesk the team aims to increase global diversity, especially fiat options. ""We want it to be able to run in India and China, even if there's a complete ban in those countries on all things crypto related,"" he said.  So far the only developing market Bisq has any modest volume in is Brazil, with just over $7,000 worth of transactions in September. Although most current users hail from tech-savvy circles in North America and Europe, volunteers are now working on a Farsi-language interface.  A software developer who works in Iran's nascent blockchain industry, Yashar Rashedi, told CoinDesk he is intrigued by Bisq's potential. But Rashedi went on to say Bisq is not yet mature enough, both technically and in terms of a critical mass of users, to support crypto traders who need to circumnavigate internet censorship.  Speaking more broadly about DEXs, he added:  ""Right now a very small percentage of people are using DEXs. They are complicated, slow, don't have a matching engine (mostly), not completely decentralized and private as they promote themselves.""  This is why bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer balks at the idea of calling Bisq a DEX at all. He told CoinDesk he sees Bisq as more of a peer-to-peer, over-the-counter trading desk.  ""Exchanges that don't have [order books] can't really help with price discovery, and are open to all kinds of manipulation,"" Wertheimer said. ""So they can't really be considered exchanges in the same way that the incumbents are.""  So far more than 144 people contributed to the Bisq project, with roughly 10 developers handling most of the heavy lifting. At the moment, roughly 200 people hold small amounts of BSQ.  Many more will need to join the pack in order to create a truly decentralized BSQ ecosystem. Karrer concluded:  ""The goal is to become as decentralized and censorship-resistant as bitcoin. That's a very high goal and it took bitcoin a very long time to get there.""

42381344,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94t3L,1540431930,Judge Issues Temporary Dismissal in Bitcoin Cash Lawsuit Against Coinbase,"A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit against Coinbase alleging the exchange hurt investors when it listed bitcoin cash by allowing insider trading.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, from the Northern District of California, dismissed a lawsuit filed by Arizona resident Jeffrey Berk against Coinbase, who claimed that the exchange allowed insiders to trade bitcoin cash prior to its listing on the exchange. This in turn harmed investors, he said in March.  In the original complaint, filed in March, Berk claimed that ""unsurprisingly, those who had been tipped off [about bitcoin cash's listing], immediately swamped Coinbase and the GDAX [sic] with buy and sell orders, thinning the liquidity but obtaining BCH at fair prices. The market effect was to unfairly drive up the price of BCH for non-insider traders once BCH came on line at the Coinbase exchange.""  In dismissing the suit, Judge Chhabria wrote that ""Berk's complaint does not sufficiently articulate the legal basis for his claims,"" and explaining that ""a reader of the complaint is thus left wondering what Coinbase should have done differently, or why the rollout of bitcoin cash would have gone more smoothly had Coinbase done whatever Berk thinks is appropriate.""  With one exception, all of Berk's claims were dismissed without prejudice, the judge continued. As a result, Berk and his attorneys now have three weeks to file an amended complaint.  This exception revolves around a claim Berk made concerning the Commodity Exchange Act. However, Berk lacks the standing to make this sort of argument, according to Stephen Palley, an attorney with corporate law firm Anderson Kill P.C.  ""The Court dismissed with prejudice a claim purporting to arise out of the [CEA]. While a private right of action might exist under the CEA, it only arises if there's a futures contract at issue. Here, there's no futures contract. The Court says that claims of fraud/manipulation related to spot market virtual currency trades under the CEA can only be asserted by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] in an enforcement action and the Plaintiff here isn't the CFTC,"" he explained.  Lynda Grant, an attorney for Berk, told CoinDesk via email that she will be filing an updated complaint within the deadline, though she did not provide any further details.  ""We intend to amend the complaint,"" she said.  A representative for Coinbase declined to comment on the case.  Arbitration  Coinbase's victory in getting the case (at least temporarily) dismissed came alongside a loss in another motion the exchange filed.  In his ruling, Chhabria denied a Coinbase motion to compel arbitration, which sought to force Berk to sit for individual arbitration, rather than continue the case to a potential trial.  Coinbase claimed it had the right to compel arbitration according to the User Agreement Berk had to have agreed to when signing up for the exchange. However, a judge dismissed this motion without prejudice (meaning Coinbase can try again after Berk's amended complaint is filed).  Palley said that this particular aspect of the ruling stood out to him, adding ""my view of this case is that it tells you something about the Coinbase arbitration clause.""  Regardless of the eventual outcome of this case, the ruling on the motion to compel arbitration is likely one that will be referred back to in future suits, Palley said, explaining:  ""What happened was Coinbase moved to compel arbitration and also to dismiss, and the thing that jumped out at me was that it obviously matters a lot to them, they would prefer not to have cases heard or tried in court, they'd rather have it tried in arbitration, they have an arbitration case ... [but] the court denied the motion saying the arbitration clause should only apply to things that are under contract.""  Berk's allegation that Coinbase hurt consumers by allowing market manipulation does not fall under this contract, according to Chhabria.  In his ruling, the judge noted that Coinbase's motion to dismiss did not reference the user agreement, and ""assessing whether Coinbase might have engaged in market manipulation or unfair business practices does not require 'reference to the underlying agreement or interpretation of the parties' contractual relationship.'""  Moving forward  The ruling is significant to how the case may proceed, Palley said. While Coinbase has the option to file another motion to compel arbitration, the amended complaint is likely to move even further away from the user agreement than the original.  ""A decent lawyer isn't going to make a losing argument when they've already lost on the point before,"" he said.  As a result, the case may then proceed through the court system.  While Palley did not speak to the merits or the claims made in Berk's suit specifically, he noted that generally, if a lawsuit moves past a motion to dismiss and discovery and is certified as a class action, ""in most cases these things settle.""  ""If you're a class, if I'm one person and I've lost $50 that's not very much, but if I'm ... representing 10 million people and we've all lost $10 then that's $100 million. That's the advantage of a class action,"" he said.  Read the full ruling below:    ORDER DENYING MOTION TO COM... by on Scribd    Editor's note: This article has been updated for clarity.
