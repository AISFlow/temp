19873931,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559305,1699311621,Top 3 Altcoins For November 2023 That Could 100x Your Crypto Portfolio,"Altcoins have become one of the most preferred ways for crypto investors to secure massive gains in the industry especially given Bitcoin’s massive growth rate in the last decade. Because a lot of these altcoins have significantly smaller market caps, they tend to have a lot of runway for growth, making them an enticing option. So here is a list of the top 3 altcoins that could 100x your crypto portfolio in the coming bull market, in no particular order. Memecoin (MEME): The New Meme Crypto Memecoin (MEME) is the latest brainchild from the 9GAG team. The team had successfully launched multiple non-fungible token (NFT) projects in the last year before finally moving on to the launch of their very own cryptocurrency; MEME. Related Reading: ETH Sent To Exchanges Climbs Above 500,000, Is Ethereum At $2,000 Still Possible? So far, MEME looks to be like any other meme coin in the crypto market with no promises or roadmap. But as far as altcoins go, MEME has one of the most important factors that can guarantee success for a project and that is a very strong community. The Memecoin official Twitter account already has 2.8 million followers, surpassing established meme coin players such as Floki Inu and falling just behind Shiba Inu which sits at 3.7 million followers. This massive support from the community, coupled with the fact that its market cap is sitting at only $180 million, makes it one of the altcoins with a lot of potential going into the bull run. Liquity (LQTY) Joins Altcoins With Potential Liquity (LQTY) has made a name for itself as being one of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols offering interest-free borrowing on the Ethereum network. This is a good draw for investors looking to take out loans but not having to pay huge interest on those loans. In the DeFi summer that was recorded between 2020 and 2021, these kinds of protocols were proven to be an investor favorite. As such, their native tokens are wont to soar if there is a repeat of such a trend. LQTY token is still trading below $2 and just like MEME, it has a low market just above $150 million. This makes it one of the altcoins with a good runway to grow especially in a bull market and secure good gains for crypto investors. LQTY price at $1.69 | Source: LQTYUSDT on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu’s BONE Could Be A Game Changer For years, the Shiba Inu-based BONE token has been able to fly under the radar and has not achieved the notoriety of some of its meme coin counterparts. However, this could quickly change especially with the launch of the Shibarium network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ends October On A High Note, What To Expect For BTC Price In November Shibarium, which is a Layer 2 network built atop the Ethereum blockchain, actually uses the BONE token as its ecosystem utility token. Many expected this to be Shiba Inu but the team has clarified that SHIB only acts as a governance token in the network. Given that BONE is the native token of the Shibarium network, it stands to gain a lot when the network begins to gain widespread adoption. And with a market cap under $160 million, there is still a long way to go for BONE to catch up with its competitors in the space.

19872343,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559251,1699308042,Four Reasons Why Investors Are Bullish On Chainlink,"Chainlink’s recent price surge of 63% has turned heads in the cryptocurrency community. This uptrend begs the question: what’s driving investor confidence in Chainlink? Let’s dive into four key reasons that might be contributing to this bullish trend. #1 Chainlink Dominance In The Oracle Space Oracles act as a bridge between blockchain networks and the external world, fetching data that decentralized applications (dApps) rely on to function. This data can vary widely, from cryptocurrency price feeds essential for decentralized financial (DeFi) platforms to weather information or the results of real-world events for betting platforms. Related Reading: November Outlook For Bitcoin Price: Another Pump Or Retrace? Chainlink has emerged as the leader in this pivotal market, capturing a 47% share with its extensive network of over 1,000 oracles and support for 14+ blockchain platforms. By positioning itself as the primary provider of external data integration, Chainlink has become an essential component of the blockchain infrastructure. #2 Other Products By Chainlink Expanding beyond its initial focus on data feeds, Chainlink now offers a broad spectrum of blockchain services that have significantly strengthened its market presence: Verifiable Random Function (VRF) – a verifiable method of producing complete randomness at a low cost, particularly useful to create random outcomes within gaming and gambling applications, as well as for any application requiring unpredictability in its protocol. Automation – allows smart contract developers to utilize Chainlink’s infrastructure to automate their smart contracts cost-effectively and securely, which is crucial for the scalability and efficiency of decentralized applications (dApps). Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) – enabling seamless interaction and transfer of data and value across blockchain networks. This interconnectivity is pivotal for a more integrated and accessible blockchain ecosystem. The introduction of CCIP, especially, underscores Chainlink’s commitment to driving the industry forward. It simplifies the user experience and broadens the potential use cases for blockchain technology, aspects that are highly attractive to institutional investors looking to enter the space. #3 Institutional Interest Chainlink’s CCIP and other products have allowed it to collaborate with big institutions, such as: SWIFT – a global financial network that 11,000+ financial institutions use to securely transmit information and value, up to trillions of dollars. DTCC – a global financial entity that processes and settles security transactions totaling quadrillions of dollars. ANZ – one of the big four banks in the Asia-Pacific region, handling billions of dollars annually. Other notable institutions working with Chainlink are BNP Paribas, Citi, and PwC Germany. These partnerships highlight that institutions see the potential opportunity for blockchains and real-world systems to interact effectively. Chainlink’s co-founder Sergey Nazarov says: It’s now clear that both top global banks and leading market infrastructures believe there will be greater adoption of digital assets across the entire banking industry, and that this adoption will happen using multiple different blockchain technologies at the same time. #4 Bullish Price Action Chainlink had traded between $5 and $9 between June 2022 and September 2023. In October, its price finally managed to break out of this range after an increase of 63%, reaching $12. This price increase was one of the largest within the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the faith investors have in this token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Season: Leading The Charge In The Crypto Market The price currently sits in a previous trading range between $11 and $17. For the price to reach the top of this range, it would have to climb another 50%. Chainlink's Price Action on the monthly chart.

Specifically, a 340% increase would have to occur for it to reach its previous highs. Investment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

42419178,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1Xh,1699306812,"XRP, LINK, DOGE Lead Altcoin Gains as Bitcoin Sits at $35K","BTC was little changed while large-cap altcoins gained 5%-10% in a broadening crypto rally.  A decline in bitcoin's market cap dominance is a sign of investors' riskier market stance, one analyst said.  ByteTree analysts hinted at early signs of a potential altcoin season, adding weight to altcoins in their portfolio at the expense of BTC.  Alternative cryptocurrencies – altcoins – posted gains of 5%-10% on Monday while bitcoin [BTC] treaded water near $35,000 as investors ventured into riskier tokens.  Following key approvals for the company to operate and offer services in Georgia and Dubai last week Ripple's XRP jumped nearly 10% during the day and toppled Binance's BNB as the fourth-largest crypto by market capitalization.  Read more: XRP Spikes 10% as Several Institutions Adopt Ripple’s Services  Other large-cap digital assets such as native tokens of layer 1 networks Cardano [ADA] and Avalanche [AVAX], popular meme token dogecoin [DOGE], oracle network Chainlink's token [LINK] and decentralized exchange UniSwap's token [UNI] rose 5%-6% over the past 24 hours.  Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur's token [BLUR] added 32% today to its gains, more than doubling in price in a month as the platform prepares to distribute 300 million tokens in an airdrop to users on November 20.  Bitcoin, meanwhile, on Monday has been trading in a tight range on either side of $35,000. Ether (ETH) is also little changed.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a broad basket of cryptocurrencies, advanced 0.6%.  Bitcoin dominance drop brings call for altcoin season  Altcoin outperformance – though it's only been in place for a handful of days – could be a sign that traders will continue to rotate profits from BTC's roughly 30% October rally into lower-cap digital assets.  Bitcoin’s market cap dominance – which measures the largest crypto asset's market share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization – has dipped to 52.5% Monday from around 54.3% in late October, which at that point was a 30-month high, TradingView data shows.  ""The decline in dominance after five consecutive weeks of increase marks the first signs of heightened investor interest in altcoins, suggesting a riskier market stance,"" Matteo Greco, research analyst at Fineqia International, said in an email.  Investment advisory firm ByteTree hinted at the early innings of an ""alt season"" – an extended period of the broader altcoin market outperforming BTC's price – as the crypto rally's market breadth improved and a likely end of the Federal Reserve's rate hiking cycle offered a more supportive environment for risky assets.  ""Today, we make the most significant investment into altcoins we have made for some time,"" ByteTree analysts wrote. ""Bitcoin has rallied, and the space is catching up.""

19870712,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559398,1699304441,Crypto Forecast: Analyst Predicts ‘Santa Claus Squeeze’ May Deliver Year-End Gains,"Markus Thielen, the Head of Crypto Research and Strategy at Matrixport, has hinted at a potential pre-Christmas rally with Bitcoin leading the charge. This anticipation comes amid a backdrop of macroeconomic shifts that could set the stage for a significant surge in crypto prices, which Thielen describes as the “Santa Claus squeeze.” Thielen’s analysis is rooted in recent market movements where some altcoins began to outperform Bitcoin, suggesting a momentum build-up that could translate into substantial gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Tide: Could ASIC Miner Values Signal An Approaching Crypto Surge? Macroeconomic Indicators Fueling Crypto Optimism This concept of a “Santa Claus squeeze” in the crypto market, a term coined to describe the seasonal rally often seen in equity markets, is not new. Thielen, in his Deribit Insights report, noted that Bitcoin has historically seen an average rally of 23% during the festive months of November and December. This trend, coupled with last week’s performance where alternative cryptocurrencies gained an edge over Bitcoin, lends credibility to the forecast of a year-end rally, according to the Head of Crypto Research and Strategy at Matrixport. Notably, the potential for a “Santa Claus squeeze” is underpinned by several macroeconomic indicators that Thielen has identified. Thielen points to a trio of events that collectively signal an interest rate peak, setting a conducive stage for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The US Treasury’s pivot towards “slowing the pace of issuing longer-dated debt” is the first sign Thielen identified, implying expectations for a decline in interest rates, which historically benefit growth assets such as tech stocks and, by extension, digital currencies. Adding to the mix is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s “dovish” tone at the post-FOMC meeting press conference. His statements have been interpreted as a potential halt in rate hikes, with the possibility of cuts in 2024, bringing a dose of positiveness into the markets. For context, during the conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussed the balanced nature of inflation risks, referencing the term “symmetric” twice, which suggested a tone of accomplishment in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reduce inflation. Additionally, Powell expressed his view that a recession is not on the horizon. Furthermore, a less-than-stellar US nonfarm payroll reported last Friday suggests a “weakening labor market,” according to Thielen, reducing the chances of aggressive rate hikes in the future. Bitcoin And Ethereum: A Potential Rally In Sight? Drawing parallels with the past, Thielen recalled Bitcoin’s response at the end of the last Fed rate hike cycle in January 2019, which saw the cryptocurrency’s price rally by approximately 400%. While Thielen tempers expectations for a repeat of such dramatic gains, the Head of Crypto Research and Strategy at Matrixport anticipates that Bitcoin and some other altcoins the analyst calls “higher beta crypto assets” could see considerable growth in the coming years. The Head of Crypto Research and Strategy at Matrixport backed this bullish outlook further by the potential approval of a BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, which could act as a catalyst for a more widespread crypto rally. Thielen’s observations extend beyond Bitcoin in another report. He notes the Ethereum ecosystem’s nascent signs of recovery, evidenced by increasing revenues and ETH’s resilience in holding the crucial support level of $1,550. The analyst also noted the outshining of Ethereum and other altcoins over Bitcoin, a shift reflected in their growing market dominance and trading volumes. The perpetual futures funding rate for both Bitcoin and Ethereum is also on the rise, mirroring a more confident stance among traders.

However, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is currently experiencing an increase in on-chain transactions, and BONE hasn’t been left out. Some SHIB whales have increased their holdings in anticipation of a new milestone for Shibarium. At the same time, BONE also had an increase in large transactions, and this key on-chain metric suggests the token could be ready for a major price appreciation. BONE Large Transaction Volume Increases The daily large transaction volume for BONE, ShibaSwap’s governance token, has exploded in the past week. According to recent data from IntoTheBlock’s metric of large transactions, each valued at $100,000 or more, spiked from no activity at the end of October to more than 5.17 million BONE tokens over the weekend. This type of large transaction activity can either mean that big money is flowing into or leaving an asset. But more often than not, the former is the case. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Rally Not Over: Crypto Capital Inflows Reach One-Year High At the same time, BONE’s biggest whales have been loading up their bags. On-chain data shows whale wallets (more than 1% of the total supply) now hold 44.03%, up from 43.41% reported last month. Investors’ wallets holding between 0.1% and 1% of the circulating supply also went up, now holding 16.85%. Inflows into these two sets of addresses increased by +295% in a 7-day timeframe, indicating interest from whales. Source: IntoTheBlock Bearish Sentiment Reversal? Road to $1? With the large transaction increase, it’s clear BONE is gaining major traction and interest from whales. But some on-chain and BONE’s price points to a double-edged sword. Despite the inflow into large wallets and increase in large transactions, broader on-chain signals point to bearish sentiment from retail traders. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Bet Big As Shibarium Grows – Road To $0.1? This is particularly evident as interest from small investors has dropped in the past month. At the time of writing, BONE is trading at $0.71 and is down by 64% from its yearly high of $2.20 in February. Bulls push token price toward $1 | Source: BONEUSDT on Tradingview.com On the other hand, BONE has spiked by 3.6% in the past three hours after recently bouncing off major support at $0.69. A continued surge in on-chain transactions among bulls and whale investors could push the crypto back up to $1. BONE is used as gas fees on the Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, which has had a steady increase in cumulative gas usage since its launch. Shibarium is now approaching the four million total transactions milestone, which could also push BONE towards $1.

42419167,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1NN,1699300096,Crypto Traders Are Ready to Move Past Sam Bankman-Fried,"At the height of Sam Bankman-Fried’s influence and power, there was a mostly unspoken question as to how FTX could be spending so profligately on advertisements and investments. The exchange, often cited as the third largest by volume before its epic collapse, was suspected to be unprofitable when compared to competitors. Something of an understatement, in hindsight.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Consensus Magazine's Trading Week is sponsored by CME.  Founded in 2017, and ultimately rocketing to a valuation of $32 billion, FTX had also accrued a lifetime net loss of $3.7 billion before SBF’s multi-billion dollar fraud was even revealed. Those carryover losses were even offset by a wildly profitable bull market in 2021, a year that FTX tax filings show it netted $377 million in profit (Coinbase, by comparison, earned $3.6 billion profit in 2021 with over over 10x the headcount).  We now know, according to expert testimony from forensic accountants during SBF’s excruciating trial, that spending by the wannabe “JP Morgan of Crypto” was funded by unsuspecting FTX customers. SBF directed a score of buyouts, acquisitions and real estate purchases, hundreds of millions of dollars in political and charitable “donations” as well as billions in venture investments and other gambles.  Money also flowed from the FTX exchange into Alameda Research’s coffers, to pay off the hedge fund’s massive loan obligations, finance trades and, in at least one example, pay off Alameda’s losses from market making.  The whole situation has left a massive stain on the crypto industry. How did SBF get away with it for so long? Why did no one notice something was amiss or fail to speak up? Could something like this happen again?  There’s a saving grace in that, in the words of FTX CEO John J. Ray III, SBF’s fraud was simply “old fashioned” embezzlement. Although FTX happened to be a crypto exchange, and SBF a cryptocurrency powerbroker, the scam itself had almost nothing to do with crypto itself. (So much so that the district judge overseeing SBF’s trial actually prohibited many of the conversations about crypto that SBF’s defense team would have liked to have had.)  Sam Bankman-Fried was attracted to money, power and fame, but crypto was merely his means. He was never an ideological proponent of decentralization, and at times he appeared to loathe the scams and Ponzi schemes that propagated across the industry. Perhaps he felt entitled to steal from his customers because he figured he’d put the money to better use.  It’s for this reason that crypto is ready to move on from FTX. Even as the trial was unfolding, many industry participants began to feel that it was a bit of a sideshow. To the extent that the industry learned anything from the FTX fraud, it’s what many already knew or believed to be true: that centralized operations are anathema to crypto. It’s telling, for instance, that the first lending platform to liquidate Alameda was a DeFi protocol.  Of course, as former CoinDesker Michael McSweeney wrote in a recent Blockworks op-ed, the industry will likely be irrevocably changed by SBF. In the same way that the collapse of Mt. Gox accelerated the formation of regulations around the world (in particular in Japan, where Mt. Gox was based, and in New York State with the BitLicense), legislatures have mobilized to pass laws to prevent the next FTX.  It may take years for trading volumes to reach pre-crash levels again. The recent runup in bitcoin, supported by positive advancements on the bitcoin ETF front, has been an optimistic reminder that capital is on the sidelines waiting to be deployed. And while crypto isn’t exactly “cool” nowadays, it remains intriguing for the wider public.  Just like the reputational hits after the collapse of Mt. Gox, the DAO attack and the Bitfinex hack — each of which felt existential at the time — there are now generations of committed crypto traders who are more or less unaware of those stories.  The collapse of FTX will be no different: it proved crypto’s worth and in time will prove its longevity.

Per the announcement, the platform was pivotal in driving progress within the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena, enabling “seamless” asset transfers across various chains. Conflux Foundation Passes The Torch ShuttleFlow emerged as one of the advanced multi-chain asset bridges in the DeFi space. Its architecture facilitated interoperability between different blockchains, opening up new user possibilities. Notably, ShuttleFlow enabled “effortless swaps” between external blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB), utilizing Conflux as the transit chain. With the decision to shut down ShuttleFlow, the Conflux Foundation has entrusted cryptocurrency hub company Zero Gravity with the responsibility of maintaining and further developing the technology stack. Related Reading: Did Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Short Ethereum? Unraveling A 70,000 ETH Sale According to Monday’s announcement, Zero Gravity will continue to enhance the Bridge’s capabilities to ensure a “seamless and secure” experience for users within the expanding multi-chain ecosystem. Furthermore, the Conflux Foundation assures users that their funds are secure throughout the transition. All user funds will be migrated from ShuttleFlow to Zero Gravity, safeguarding their assets. Users who have previously bridged assets through ShuttleFlow and successfully claimed them on the destination chain will not be required to undertake any additional actions for the migration. ShuttleFlow will continue to assist users in claiming assets on the destination chain even after the bridging service is shut down. Users can locate their unclaimed assets on the ShuttleFlow history page. ShuttleFlow Service Ends The ShuttleFlow website and decentralized app (dApp) will continue to operate with limited functionality until January 6, 2024. However, the bridging service through ShuttleFlow’s dApp will cease on November 6, 2023. Once ShuttleFlow fully shuts down, users can bridge their assets through Zero Gravity’s official dApp. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Just Cleared A Level That Historically Lead To Rallies Of 99%+ The Conflux Foundation firmly believes that the decentralization and accumulation of infrastructure partners are crucial for the growth of its ecosystem.

19866146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559363,1699293623,The Main Drivers Behind The 23% XRP Price Rally Revealed,"Recently, the main players responsible for the recent 23% increase in XRP price were brought to light. The digital asset has since continued with its firm rally over the last 24 hours, arriving at almost $0.72. Recent Activities Buttress The Price Of XRP XRP’s 23% price surge took place in the last day and crypto enthusiasts and investors’ belief in XRP has been steadily increasing as whale wallets keep filling up. Related Reading: XRP Price Surge Imminent? Expert Eyes 1,500% Rally Signal From Past According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, wallets holding up to 100,000 to 1 billion XRP have reached their highest point this year, making about 45.8% of the token total supply. Due to this XRP price crossed the $0.68 for the first time since August, indicating an upward trajectory for the crypto asset. The crypto asset’s potential Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) have not been left out, as they have both presented a bullish signal for XRP price. XRP’s price movement has been above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, thereby signaling continued rising momentum. With this technical layout and an RSI that is safely over the 50 mark, buyers appear to be in control, providing a tough basis for future price growth. In addition, the digital asset’s recent adoption and social media dominance also seem to have contributed to XRP’s price surge lately. This has been the case following the XRP’s recent regulatory approval under the digital asset regime of the Dubai independent financial services regulatory body within the DIFC, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). According to the social dominance metric, the social media discussions encompassing XRP have increased impressively over time, marking its highest level since mid-July. The crypto asset’s increase in popularity and interest among crypto enthusiasts and investors in the cryptocurrency world is believed to have impacted the price of XRP. This is because social media dominance often paves the way for price trajectory. Chart Analyst Predicts The Crypto Asset to Reached The $1 Mark Chart analyst EGRAG once predicted in September that XRP will surpass the $0.65 within the following month, which seems to have come to pass. According to the analyst if XRP crosses $0.65, a path to the $1 mark is wide open. Related Reading: XRP Hits $0.6 In Unstoppable Surge: How High Can It Go This November? The analyst has recently shared another prediction on the price of XRP to crossing the $1 mark while comparing the challenges encountered by the asset at its current resistance point to the “Berlin Wall” of resistance. According to EGRAG, a successful breakout from its current resistance level which is the Berlin Wall, would see the crypto asset approaching the $1.10 to $1.40 price range when this happens. EGRAG predicts that before XRP breaks above $1, it will retest between the $0.55 and $0.58 range. However, the price range between $1.10 and $1.40 would be confirmed by this retest and a rebound. XRP trading volume surged to $2.55 billion in the last 24 hours, a noteworthy 169.41% increase from the day before. With XRP’s price currently stable around $0.68, seasoned market analysts are set to provide predictions for the cryptocurrency’s future direction.

42419186,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1KH,1699292227,Indian Police Arrest 8 More in $300M Crypto Scam: Report,"Indian authorities have reportedly arrested as many as 18 people, including four police officers, for suspected involvement in a $300 million crypto scam.  Investigations into the Himachal Pradesh scam, which victimized around 100,000 people, are continuing, according to local reports.  Eight new arrests have been made in India where a $300 million (2500 crore Indian rupees) crypto scam that duped around 100,000 people continues to unravel, according to local media reports from Monday.  Four cops were among those arrested, one report said. Victims of the Himachal Pradesh scam include 5,000 government officials and around 1,000 police personnel, according to findings by a Special Investigation Team (SIT).  The scam came to light in late September but may have begun as far back as 2018, with fraudsters approaching would-be victims with investment plans involving a local cryptocurrency called Korvio Coin (or KRO coins). Subsequently, several more cryptocurrencies were reportedly used through fake websites, with at least one being subject to a rug pull where the project was abandoned after people had already purchased the token.  The scam appears to have gained unprecedented legitimacy because it involved police personnel. More than 1,000 cops became involved in the scheme; most were duped, some made huge gains, but others volunteered and became promoters, according to local officials.  Around 56 complaints were filed with police stations in the past two years. Since then, multiple agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate, along with regional police teams, ran a sweeping investigation led by the SIT. Dozens of searches conducted in late October led to the discovery of around 250,000 identification cards linked to suspects. The investigations have reportedly found more than 100 people had earned profits of $240,000 each from the scam, while another 200 made around $120,000 each.  As many as 18 arrests have been made so far, but the alleged kingpin, Subhash Sharma, remains at large. Several properties linked to Sharma have been identified and seized.  The Enforcement Directorate is also investigating the role of five women, suspected of having worked as agents or promoters for the kingpin, a separate report said.  The Himachal Pradesh State Police did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Appearing last week on Merryn Somerset Webb's podcast for Bloomberg, Wood claimed there is no counterparty risk in bitcoin thanks to its decentralization and visibility of all transactions on the network. She contrasted this to the opaque inner workings of the banking system.  ""You can only surmise because they're losing deposits and they have to fund those by selling securities,"" Wood said. ""The deposit flight has not stopped and they're forced to raise interest rates to compete against money market funds.""  Wood reminded of the regional bank crisis in the U.S. in March when a handful of lenders collapsed, helping to send bitcoin's price higher by nearly 50% to $30,000.  ""[Now] you see it pumping up again and you see the regional bank index in the U.S. breaking below where it was in March.""  Wood was echoing comments she made in May that the banking crisis along with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX a year ago had ""proved the concept"" of bitcoin as they exposed the dangers of centralization in financial systems.  BTC's reputation as a potential inflationary protection investment is in step with the crypto's comparisons to digital gold. While Wood acknowledged that actual gold can also work as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, she maintained that bitcoin would be her choice ""hands down"" if she had to choose an asset to hold for the next 10 years.  ""Gold already has its demand, it's happened. Bitcoin is new, institutions are barely involved,"" she said. ""Young people would much prefer to hold bitcoin than to hold gold.""  Wood's ARK Invest is a sizable holder of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) stock and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The company has also filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its own spot bitcoin ETF.

FTX, at the time one of the largest crypto exchanges, collapsed almost a year ago, sending shockwaves through the industry. Since then, the bankrupt exchange has received multiple bids for a potential restart, now narrowed down to a shortlist of three, according to Perella Weinberg Partners, an investment bank involved in the process.  Other options being considered include selling the entire exchange and its valuable 9 million-strong customer list or bringing in a partner. A decision should be made by mid-December, said Kevin Cofsky, a partner at Perella Weinberg last month.  Proof Group is a venture capital investor in crypto projects such as Aptos, Lightspark and Sui.  Other firms reported to have shown an interest in reviving FTX include fintech and digital assets firm Figure, which also bid for Celsius as part of the unsuccessful NovaWulf group. Venture capital investor Tribe Capital was also reported to have submitted a bid for FTX.  There are many moving parts in the FTX bankruptcy, and a restart would have to deal with various aspects of claims, token lockups and compliance issues. The process is not straightforward.

19864603,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559319,1699290058,Bitcoin Has Just Cleared A Level That Historically Lead To Rallies Of 99%+,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin has recently made a break that led to rallies of at least 99% during the last three times it happened. Bitcoin Has Now Crossed Above “Single Cycle HODLers” Cost Basis In a new post on X, analyst Ali has talked about a level that BTC has broken recently. The level in question is the cost basis of the single-cycle Bitcoin long-term holders. The terms may be unfamiliar, so here’s what they mean, one by one. First, the “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the investors who have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. The LTHs are made up of the resolute diamond hands or HODLers, who rarely sell even when volatility occurs in the market. Related Reading: XRP Enjoys 11% Rally As Sharks & Whales Hit 2023 High Holdings Next, the “single cycle HODLers” specifically refer to those LTHs who bought within the span of a single BTC cycle. Their range is typically taken to be 6 months to 3 years. This means that the oldest among these investors (with coins aged 3 years) would have gone through the entire chaos of the current cycle, from the highs of the 2021 bull to the lows of the 2022 bear. Lastly, “cost basis” refers to the average buying price of a group of Bitcoin investors. If the spot price of the cryptocurrency is trading below this value, it means that the cohort in question is in a state of net loss. Similarly, the asset being above implies the dominance of profits. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the cost basis of the single-cycle LTHs over the past few years: Looks like the price of the asset has interacted with this level in recent days | Source: Glassnode on X Currently, this metric has a value of $34,150, which means that Bitcoin has already surged above it with the latest rally. This means that the average single cycle HODLer who had been in losses since the first half of 2022 has now finally returned to profits. In the graph, Ali has also highlighted the trajectory that BTC followed during the last three times a break above this level took place. It would appear that each of the last two major bull rallies occurred after the breaks that took place in 2016 and 2020, respectively. From the point of this breach, the cryptocurrency enjoyed returns of 4,778% and 787% over the course of the respective rallies. The recovery rally that started in April 2019 also observed a break of this cost basis, following which BTC registered gains of 99%. If this pattern of the single cycle HODLer cost basis paving the way for a Bitcoin rally is anything to go by, then the asset could potentially see a surge now that it has once again broken above it.

19863063,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559283,1699286404,Can The ADA Price Climb Above $20 In The Bull Market? Analyst Provides Answers,"The ADA price has always performed incredibly well in the bull market cycles with price rallies that have put millions of holders in profit in the past. However, like any other cryptocurrency, it can be hard to pinpoint how high the price will climb in the next bull market. Nevertheless, one crypto analyst is taking the bull by the horns to reveal where they expect the altcoin’s price to reach in the next bull market. ADA Price Could Rise As High As $24 In an analysis posted to TradingView, crypto analyst masoud_paydarsani outlines how the ADA price could rise to double-digits. First, the analyst points to Cardano’s ADA token being a long-term upward channel on the weekly time frame, albeit a rather slow uptrend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Bet Big As Shibarium Grows – Road To $0.1? However, this does not invalidate its bullish tendencies, especially when it comes to ADA repeating its previous bull market cycles. Masoud points to the fact that the past crypto market cycles saw approximately 108 weeks of the bear market before 66 weeks of the bull market, and it is within these 66 weeks that ADA shines. Source: Tradingview.com The analyst believes that if the upward channel is validated, then the next ADA bull run could turn out like the rest. Using the previous performances of the altcoin, eg, the run-up in the year 2021, the ADA price could rise to as high as $24 following the same trend. Also, going by historical performance, the crypto analyst reveals that this could happen sometime in the next 66 weeks. So it could lead up to 2025 before this rally is complete. Being Bullish For ADA Above $20 Interestingly, the expectation for the ADA price to cross the $20 mark is not unique to Masoud alone. Another crypto analyst, @LucidCiC on X (formerly Twitter) also believes that this double-digit level is possible for ADA. Related Reading: Why This Fidelity Investments Director Believes Bitcoin Is ‘Exponential Gold’ Lucid actually has an even higher price target for the altcoin compared to Masoud. Where Masoud sees the ADA price reaching $24, Lucid’s forecast goes as high as $30. Lucid compares Cardano to the Ethereum network which was able to reach a $500 billion market cap despite going through multiple hurdles. Given this, the analyst believes Cardano will also be able to rise as well while expecting the crypto market cap to cross $10 trillion in a decade. Cardano is also seeing a good amount of interest from institutional investors. Grayscale Investments, the company behind the largest Bitcoin trust in the world, recently announced new crypto indices featuring ADA in response to this rising interest. If these large investors continue to double down on their investments, this newfound inflow could drive the price to the double-digit mark predicted by the analysts.

42419184,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1cr,1699285482,Sizing the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETF Opportunity,"Bitcoin is the non-sovereign reserve currency of the digital world, and from an investment management perspective, it can uniquely and inexpensively diversify well-balanced portfolios to improve total risk-adjusted returns. However, while there have been many ways to gain exposure to crypto’s apex asset, there has long been one glaring hole, the holy grail of access if you will: a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF.  Brian Rudick is a senior strategist for GSR. Matt Kunke is a research analyst for GSR. This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  The road to a US spot bitcoin ETF has been long and arduous, with the SEC rejecting all 33 applications across more than a dozen filers since the Winklevoss twins first sought approval over a decade ago. However, from BlackRock, with its $9 trillion in AUM and impeccable application track record, entering the fray in June, to Grayscale’s resounding court victory over the SEC vacating its previous application denial to the recent approvals of a levered bitcoin futures ETF and Ethereum futures ETFs, it appears as if we are closer than ever before.  Indeed, noted industry analysts now peg the chance of approval by early January to be 90%; Grayscale’s discount to net-asset value (NAV) has narrowed from 45% at the beginning of the year to 13% indicating a higher market-implied probability of approval/conversion, and bitcoin is up a resounding 110% year-to-date due at least in part to spot ETF hopes.  So what’s the big deal?  A U.S. spot bitcoin ETF is a massive opportunity because of the sheer size of the U.S. capital markets. In fact, SIFMA estimates that the U.S. accounts for a full 40% of total global fixed income assets and equity market cap. Moreover, ETFs in the U.S. represent a greater percentage of total assets than in other jurisdictions, coming in at 7% of equity and fixed income assets versus 4% in Europe and 2% in Asia-Pacific.  All in, that amounts to a $7.0 trillion U.S. ETF market, which is multiples the size of Europe's $1.5 trillion market and Asia-Pacific’s $1.0 trillion market. Looked at another way, assets managed by broker dealers, banks, and RIAs in the U.S. total nearly $50 trillion, so it would take just a tiny percentage of managed and brokerage assets migrating into a spot bitcoin ETF to move the needle. And crypto adoption in the U.S. is high with the U.S. ranked fourth in Chainalysis’s Global Crypto Adoption Index, portending well for adoption translating into investment.  Another reason a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF is such a big deal is because of its advantages over other trading vehicles and the resulting increased likelihood of greater adoption. Relative to spot, futures, proxy stocks, OTC-traded trusts, and private funds, ETFs offer a unique and advantaged combination of fees/transaction costs, liquidity, tracking error, and operational complexity, not to mention alleviating the need to figure out custody.  And while several bitcoin futures ETFs have existed since late 2021, there are notable disadvantages to its futures-based construction such as tracking error, tax inefficiency, and roll costs that will typically lead to material underperformance over time, making them more appropriate for short-term trading than a buy-and-hold strategy that better capitalizes on the benefits bitcoin brings to a portfolio.  Put simply, a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF gives bitcoin legitimacy, eliminating regulatory uncertainty (many compliance departments currently don’t allow it), giving credence to crypto as an asset class, and ensuring strong oversight and investor protections, all in a convenient and familiar vehicle. Add in a potential offering from the likes of BlackRock, with its sterling reputation among advisors and distribution to nearly every major wealth platform, and it becomes easy to see why investment managers and advisors may suddenly take the leap.  Put simply, a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF gives bitcoin legitimacy  In fact, only 12% of financial advisors currently recommend bitcoin to clients according to the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals, but a full 77% say they plan to do so if and when a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF becomes available.  While predictions around inflows and their resulting impact on price are notoriously difficult when dealing with a new asset class, the introduction of a spot ETF and its impact on the gold market is perhaps the best analogy. Indeed, like bitcoin, gold has a (relatively) fixed supply, and prior to the launch of the first spot ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), by State Street Global Advisors in late 2004, it too was difficult to access by investors.  However, the SPDR Gold Trust reached $1 billion in assets in just three days, setting a record at the time, and today sits at roughly $55b. All in, gold ETFs hold over 3,200 tonnes of gold worth ~$200b and equate to 1.5% of the gold supply. And while the analogy isn’t perfect – it was harder to own gold prior to the introduction of an ETF than it is to own bitcoin now, bitcoin is significantly more volatile than gold so investors need less exposure to achieve the same potential return, and gold funds certainly benefited from the macroeconomic environment at the time – the price of gold has increased over 4x since the first spot gold ETF was introduced.  To boot (and liquidity issues aside), bitcoin will likely see a larger impact on price for each net new investment dollar it accrues than did gold, as bitcoin’s market cap is just 27% that of gold in 2004. A spot ETF transformed the gold market, and it just may do the same for bitcoin.  To be sure, there is still significant uncertainty around ultimate approval, not to mention the AUM that spot ETF products may garner, and the resulting impact on price. And whether due to relatively subdued sentiment compared to the bull markets of yesteryear, the run-up in price in anticipation of an approval or portended by the lackluster debut of ether futures ETFs, it's entirely possible and perhaps probable that short-term inflows will disappoint.  However, given the size of the U.S. market, the superiority of a spot ETF product, and the impact spot ETFs had on gold, the world is perhaps at the precipice of a truly game-changing moment for bitcoin and digital assets as a whole.

Revenue increased by 14.2% YoY, driven by a surge in 'other revenue' and stablecoin sales. Despite short-term improvements, the company still faces challenges with the lack of intrinsic value in cryptocurrencies and declining monthly transacting users. On November 2nd, the management team at Coinbase Global ( COIN ) announced financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year. In addition to seeing revenue increase year over year, the company exceeded analysts’ forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. Naturally, investors are viewing this optimistically. In particular, there's the fact that the company has succeeded in cutting costs materially and it is now consistently generating positive cash flows. While this in and of itself is a positive thing, I do still believe that investors in the enterprise are playing a dangerous game of speculation. Those who follow my work know that I have not been a fan of this enterprise. But it is also true that fundamentals have been improving. This fundamental improvement has now led me to upgrade the company from a ‘strong sell’ to a ‘sell’ because cash flow at the end of the day is still valuable. But this is not to say that the company is in good shape. For now, cash flows are positive. However, the company is still dealing with a faux asset of negligible intrinsic value and it is also seeing some rather painful declines on the user and asset side. Ultimately, I believe that these issues, if not addressed, will cause shareholders a great deal of pain. And because of that, I would urge caution for those who find recent developments bullish enough to justify an investment. Good news first Before we get into some of my concerns, let us first appreciate how well recent performance achieved by Coinbase Global has been. Starting with the most recent quarter, which is the third quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year, we see that revenue came in strong at $674.1 million. That represents an increase of 14.2% over the $590.3 million generated the same time last year. It was also $20.6 million higher than what analysts anticipated . There were a couple of drivers behind this growth. The most obvious when looking at the income statement is the ‘other revenue’ category. Revenue skyrocketed from only $14 million last year to $51.1 million this year. This part of the company generates revenue that's primarily earned on the corporate cash and cash equivalents on the company's books. Basically, the company allocates capital on its balance sheet toward other investments that earn it interest income. Though some of the revenue also comes from the sale of crypto assets that it is the principal owner of. Given the higher interest rates that the economy is dealing with, it's not surprising to see a surge in income when it comes to this category. Author - SEC EDGAR Data What requires a little deeper digging is the net revenue associated with its core operations. In the image below, you can see the many working parts of this. While overall revenue increased from $576.4 million last year to $623 million this year, there were some areas of weakness for the company. Total transaction revenue, for instance, plunged from $365.9 million to $288.6 million. I would get into this a bit more shortly. There were other ways in which revenue increased though. Coinbase Global The biggest rise actually came from revenue associated with stablecoins. Sales there skyrocketed 124.3% from $76.9 million to $172.4 million. Since 2018, the firm has generated income on funds under an arrangement with the issuer of USDC that falls under its stablecoin offerings. But that picture has changed since then because, effective August 18th of this year, it has started earning a pro rata portion of income earned on USDC reserves That is based on the amount of USDC held on its platform, as well as from other related activities. Most of the money made by Circle, the issuer of USDC, is from assets that back the stablecoin, such as dollar deposits and short-term securities. The rise in interest rates has certainly been beneficial in this regard. And if stablecoin adoption grows materially, that could be a good catalyst for revenue and profitability for Coinbase Global. In addition to outperforming on the top line, Coinbase Global outperformed on the bottom line. The firm generated a loss per share of $0.01, which was far better than the $2.43 loss per share generated one year earlier and it exceeded analysts’ forecasts by $0.52 per share. This took the company from generating a net loss of $544.6 million to generating a loss of only $2.3 million. The increase in revenue helped the company in this regard. But it was more than that that drove the improvement that the company experienced. For instance, technology and development costs plunged from 94% of sales to 48%, with some of that improvement driven by a more than 50% cut in stock-based compensation associated with those operations. Some of that cost cutting, as well as other costs cutting under the same category of expenses was driven by a 24% decline in headcount. Investments in website hosting and infrastructure also helped cut costs on that front from $96.3 million to $40.6 million. General and administrative costs also improved drastically, dropping from $339.2 million to $252.6 million as the company embraced greater automation of services and a reduction in customer support activities in a bid to stem significant cash outflows. Author - SEC EDGAR Data The improvement from a profitability perspective also helped when it came to cash flows in general. Operating cash flow went from negative $397.5 million to positive $313.9 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, it went from negative $156.5 million to positive $126.2 million. And finally, EBITDA for the firm went from negative $115.9 million to positive $180.9 million. As you can see in the chart above, 2023 as a whole is looking up compared to 2022 as evidenced by results for the first nine months of the 2023 fiscal year relative to the same time last year. Now for the bad news To be perfectly honest with you, this improvement in both the top and bottom lines, particularly in the third quarter, is impressive. Investors have a right to be happy about recent developments. It stands to reason that additional cost cutting could help the company from a cash flow perspective. But this does not change the fact that the firm has some serious issues to contend with. The first of these I won't delve into really. That's because I have covered that issue before in separates here and here . The core of this particular argument is that many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), lack any significant intrinsic value and having a business that generates such a significant amount of revenue from a faux asset is awful from a long term operational and strategic perspective. This does not mean that everything that the company does lacks value. That would be a mistake to say. For instance, while they have issues of their own, stablecoins could be considered a viable asset. And given how many countless thousands of other cryptocurrencies exist, I would imagine that there are others out there that do have some true value to them. More broadly speaking, blockchain technology itself is a massive innovation that has true staying power. So there are certain aspects of the company that could go on to generate value for investors. But when you have 48.7% of all customer crypto assets that the company holds in the form of Bitcoin and 37% of transaction revenue, up from 31% last year, coming from Bitcoin, that is truly worrisome. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Again, for more details on my thoughts regarding this particular matter, I would refer you to the aforementioned article. But even outside of this, there is another issue brewing. In the chart above, you can see both the value of crypto assets and the transaction volume that the company has seen over the past several quarters now. And in the chart below, you can see what management refers to as MTUs, or monthly transacting users. Because cryptocurrency prices can be extremely volatile, the data in the chart above is not all that significant. But it is interesting to see. The data on the chart below, however, paints a very disturbing picture. The fact of the matter is that, in almost every quarter from the first quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of this year, the company has experienced a decline in MTUs. The drop since the start of this window of time has been 2.5 million, or 27.2%. And what makes matters worse is that the percentage decline it seems to be worsening. Author - SEC EDGAR Data At the end of the day, Coinbase Global is a network of sorts. Or at least it has network effects. Seeing declines like this would be like seeing declines in the number of MAUs (monthly active users) of Facebook or any other social platform. It paints a picture that cryptocurrency adoption is not expanding but, perhaps, might even be contracting to some extent. At the very least, it doesn't seem to be growing meaningfully. This is something that I wrote about in another article that you can read here . When I see this data though, it is worrisome because essentially all of the price in a faux asset like Bitcoin comes from the bigger fool theory. And when you have a situation like that, it is only the hype that keeps the ball rolling. When the music stops, the picture can change rather abruptly and painfully. And the music is definitely slowing. Takeaway In the near term, Coinbase Global is doing a really fantastic job compared to what it was able to achieve even last year. Revenue has started growing again and both profits and cash flows are looking up. There are parts of the company that could be viable in the long run if management can continue growing those particular operations. But this doesn't change the fact that the company has some real issues to contend with. Its core business still centers around something that does not have any meaningful value to it. So if the company is to thrive, it must continue to diversify away from those core operations. But when you see data such as the MTUs, it paints a scary picture because it shows a rapid decline in activity on the network. And unless that picture changes for the better, the company could face issues down the road.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4648009-coinbase-global-still-woefully-risky-despite-a-well-deserved-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19862685.jpeg

19861987,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559339,1699282859,XRP Hits Critical Price Juncture As Whales Scoop Up 1.26 Billion Coins,"XRP, the popular cryptocurrency, has been making significant strides in recent trading hours. Investors and traders have witnessed remarkable gains, with the hourly chart indicating a bullish trend despite a sharp rise. As the price of XRP hovers around $0.696533, CoinGecko reports an impressive 8.9% increase in the past 24 hours, marking a seven-day rally of 24.4%. Bulls are flexing their muscles on the daily time frame, underlining the cryptocurrency’s resilience and potential for further upward movement. An analysis of XRP’s price action reveals several compelling factors that suggest a bright outlook for this digital asset. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Run: Is $15 On The Horizon Amidst Strong Recovery? Sustained Momentum Above Key Moving Averages XRP’s current price of $0.696533 is not merely a fleeting spike. It is notably trading above the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a strong indicator of bullish sentiment. When a cryptocurrency maintains a position above these key EMAs, it typically signifies a solid foundation for a prolonged uptrend. The potential for a bullish cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs adds weight to the argument for sustained growth. This technical configuration implies that XRP may continue to climb, potentially attracting even more investors looking to capitalize on the positive price action. Related Reading: RUNE Solid 100% Rally Hits Barrier: THORChain Price Nears Key Resistance XRP market cap currently at $37.546 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com RSI Confirms Strong Buyer Sentiment In addition to the moving averages, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for XRP is comfortably above the 50 mark. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. When it crosses the 50 threshold, it indicates a shift towards bullish sentiment. With the RSI clearly in the bullish territory, it further solidifies the notion that buyers are firmly in control of XRP’s price trajectory. This heightened level of buyer confidence is a crucial driver for the cryptocurrency’s ongoing price appreciation. Critical Resistance Point While XRP’s recent performance is undeniably impressive, traders and investors should exercise caution and closely monitor the daily bar closure, particularly in relation to the resistance level at $0.6541. This price point serves as a critical juncture that could influence the direction of XRP’s price movement. Breaking through this resistance could propel XRP to even greater heights, possibly establishing new support levels at higher values. Conversely, failing to surpass this obstacle may lead to a temporary setback. Therefore, staying vigilant and responsive to the market’s dynamics is paramount for those considering XRP investments. Source: Santiment XRP Whale Appetite Increasing Meanwhile, there has recently been a notable increase in the acquisition of XRP by prominent cryptocurrency investors, referred to as “crypto whales.” This surge in purchasing activity has contributed to a highly dynamic commencement of the month of November this year. The XRP price surge has been significantly influenced by bullish trading activity observed within a cohort of strategic crypto whales, as indicated by recent on-chain data. Whales, who possess between 100,000 and 1 billion XRP, accumulated an extra 1.26 billion XRP between October 24 and November 6, setting a new record for their total holdings in 2023. The chart above illustrates how the price of XRP began to rise positively around October 24, which is when these wealthy investors started making large purchases of the cryptocurrency. At $0.68 per XRP, the 1.26 billion XRP obtained are worth $850 million. XRP price rose over the important resistance zone at $0.65 after this significant investment in two weeks.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its debtors have asked the U.S. bankruptcy court of Delaware to approve the sale of some trust assets, funds of Grayscale and Bitwise valued at an estimated $744 million, through an investment adviser, according to a Friday court filing. “The Debtors’ proposed sale(s) or transfer(s) of the Trust Assets will help allow the estates to prepare for forthcoming dollarized distributions to creditors and allow the Debtors to act quickly to sell the Trust Assets at the opportune time,” the filing said. “Additionally, because the Debtors may sell the Trust Assets to one or more buyers in one or more sales, sales pursuant to the Sale Procedures will alleviate the cost and delay of filing a separate motion for each proposed sale.” The “trust assets” are held in five Grayscale Trusts, totaling an estimated $691 million, and one trust managed by Bitwise, amounting to $53 million, based on the market value as of Oct. 25. Grayscale and CoinDesk are part of the same parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).  XRP has spiked in the past 24 hours to become the top-performing crypto major as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) held steady. Prices rose over 11% before slightly retreating on Monday, with trading volume jumping to $2 billion from Sunday’s $1 billion, CoinGecko data shows. At the time of writing, XRP traded at 69 cents and had replaced BNB as the fourth-largest token by market capitalization. Data suggests the gains were largely spot-driven as liquidations on XRP-tracked futures breached just over $4.4 million. A large liquidation amount may suggest that the use of high leverage may have boosted prices.  The Bank of England (BOE) will regulate “systemic stablecoins” that are in wide enough circulation to potentially disturb financial stability, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the wider crypto sector according to discussion papers published by the two regulators Monday. The proposals followed broader plans for overseeing the crypto sector published by the U.K. government last week. Proposals from Big Tech companies like Facebook, now Meta (META), and PayPal (PYPL) to issue stablecoins and last year's collapse of stablecoin empire Terraform Labs have propelled related regulation worldwide, with major jurisdictions such as the European Union and Japan recently finalizing regimes.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows fluctuations in yield on the one-year U.S. Treasury note since November 2022.  The yield reached a 3.5-month low of 5.28% on Friday, signaling a bearish trend reversal.  The turn lower is a sign the market is looking ahead to rate cuts in the next 9-12 months which have driven a resurgence in bond and equity demand, according to Blockware Solutions.

42419176,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1Vd,1699279316,7 Successful Strategies of Crypto Traders,"Let me peel back the curtain. To get a pulse of how traders are thinking about the current crypto landscape, it’s instructive to see how this very article evolved. Originally, I had intended for it to be called, “How Traders Find Edge in Crypto Winter.”  Except traders had a different message for me: It’s no longer crypto winter. “Bitcoin doesn’t go up +130% for 10 months straight in bear markets,” the trader Adrian Zduńczyk told me over Twitter/X DM. Zduńczyk believes the early phase of a bull market started in January 2023. “Many projects keep referring mistakenly to it as crypto winter or bear market,” says Zduńczyk, “while what they mean is a slow economy.”  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  The question is more than academic. For many traders, understanding the macro environment is essential for plotting even short-term moves. It’s one of the oldest saws in trading: The trend is your friend. In a climate where prices tend to go up, you’re “long-biased” and shorting can draw blood. Vice versa in a bear market.  Some traders have embraced what might be a Crypto Spring, while others are still skittish and scarred by the bear market. “It’s tough for traders. We’re human beings, we’re emotional,” says Christopher Inks, who runs the trading group Texas West Capital. Inks says that for many traders who were so accustomed to the sluggish price action of 2022, “there’s a recency bias, and it can be hard to get the idea that the bottom is in.” Inks, like Zduńczyk, is a believer in a new bull market, as “the fact is that we’ve been rallying for just about a year now.”  Read more: Jeff Wilser - US Treasuries Spearhead Tokenization Boom  And then there are other traders who are indifferent to the direction the wind is blowing -- they’ll happily go long or short. “From my perspective, it’s always a bull market. Always. We don’t care about which direction the market is going,” says Paweł Łaskarzewski, who runs the hedge fund Nomad Fulcrum. “Depending on the sentiment we use different strategies, and maybe go more short than long.”  So that’s the first of two disclaimers: Not all traders trade the same way, have the same strategies, or view the market through the same lens. If they did, by definition, there would be no trades -- every buyer needs a seller.  And the second disclaimer is one you should see a mile away: None of this is financial advice. Please don’t buy or sell anything based on a quote you read in an article. Do your own research. Eat vegetables. Wear sunscreen. Call your parents on their birthdays.  With all of that said, here are seven strategies that crypto traders are using right now to find that most elusive and coveted term -- Edge.  1. More breakouts, more signals, more trades  Adrian Zduńczyk, who runs a trading group called The Birb Nest, has a certain set of rules and signals he uses to enter trades, which are often breakouts. Those signals are the same in bear or bull markets, but what changes is now they “light up” more than in 2022. “I buy when there’s a confirmed price breakout,” says Zduńczyk.  Often these trades fail, as Zduńczyk says his win rate is only 30%. “I lose money for a living,” he says with a laugh. But he keeps a tight stop loss (the max he can lose for each trade) and lets the winners run, so his 30% winners more than make up for the 70% losers. That math is the same in crypto winter or in crypto spring, but now he’s spending more time in trades as opposed to sitting on the sidelines.  2. The “moonbag” strategy  This one’s courtesy of Wendy O, former CoinDesker and host of The O Show. If a project that she’s invested in starts to “moon,” she begins taking profits and then recoups her initial investment. “Whatever I have left is my moonbag. I own it free and clear,” says Wendy. Then sometimes she’ll plunk that bag on a staking platform (if available), so she can earn passive income while she waits for it to moon.  3. Correlated arbitrage  Paweł Łaskarzewski, who’s indifferent as to bull or bear markets, shares an example of two assets that are correlated in price action. “Tesla goes in the same direction as NASDAQ,” he says. You can then draw two price curves -- one for Tesla and one for NASDAQ. “If the spread between them is growing, we can make money on the spread. We don’t care if it’s going up or down.” That same principle can be used for the forex market (such as the spread between the U.S. Dollar and Euro) or in crypto, such as the spread between Bitcoin and something like Solana or BNB.  4. Trading The “Wyckoff Method”  Over 100 years ago, a financial technician named Richard Wyckoff developed a theory that the market moves in cycles, and that understanding these cycles will give signals on when to buy and sell. They’re still used by traders and are known as the Wyckoff market cycle. Christopher Inks studies the charts and uses these cycles to guide his setups. “My edge is really this understanding of market psychology,” says Inks. “Being able to read price action and volume.” Inks says these cycles occur on both the longer horizons (weeks and months) and even on the shorter timeframes (minutes). This helps clarify the direction of a trend, says Inks, “and one of the best things traders can do is trade in the direction of the trend.”  5. Trade more than just crypto  Many crypto traders are also stock traders and forex traders, hunting for the best setups wherever they may appear. “Why limit yourself?” says Łaskarzewski. “Why limit yourself to only the crypto market if you can also make money somewhere else?” Łaskarzewski’s firm frequently shifts capital from crypto to oil to Tesla to gold and back to crypto, and yes, the tokenization of RWAs is part of that larger strategy. “The role of tokenization is 100% important,” says Łaskarzewski, adding that his firm will be launching its own RWA token in January, allowing more investors to buy into the fund.  6. Use leverage with caution  Several times in our call Wendy O stressed that none of this is financial advice -- so I’ll repeat that message here -- and added that she doesn’t personally use much leverage. “If I do, something like 2X or 3X, max,” says Wendy. Łaskarzewski agrees, noting that over-leverage is one of the ways that rookie traders get crushed. “They do a 1-to-100 leverage and the market moves 1% in the wrong direction and they lose everything,” says Łaskarzewski.  Read more: Sam Reynolds - Post-FTX, Bitcoin Is Ready for its Next Chapter  7. Scalping  An oldie but goodie, and a key part of Nomad Fulcurm’s toolkit. “We have night scalpers and day scalpers operating on different timeframes,” says Łaskarzewski. “Hours, minutes, and quarter-hours.” The basic principle: You identify a range where the price has been yo-yoing -- let’s say it tends to bounce up when it hits $15 and then gets “rejected” (moves lower) when it hits $20. There are a ton of sophisticated metrics (often focusing on volume) that help refine the criteria, but the idea is that you buy at $15 and then sell at $20, rinse and repeat.  Simple in theory, difficult in practice. I know from personal experience, as I tried scalping U.S. stocks every morning for nearly two years. How did it go? Let me put it this way. If it’s easy and lucrative, do you think I’d be writing this article? Or that’s another way of saying, proceed with caution.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/06/7-successful-strategies-of-crypto-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/957157baafd30450f083a33c613a701a8d495439-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19860508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559297,1699279256,"Expert Predicts Date For Next Bitcoin Cycle High Of $130,000","CryptoCon, a figure in the crypto analysis community, has presented a detailed chart that anticipates the next Bitcoin cycle peak to be in the vicinity of $130,000. According to the analyst, the date for the next cycle high will be November 28, 2025, with a possible deviation of 21 days. This projection is based on the Halving Cycles Theory, which aligns the Bitcoin price movement with the dates of its halving events. Bitcoin Halving Cycle Theory The chart delineates Bitcoin’s historical and projected price trajectory across four color-coded cycles, each representing a different market phase postulated by CryptoCon. The “Green Year” indicates periods of accumulation, with the best cycle buying prices and a return to the median, which is half of the previous all-time high (ATH). The “Blue Year” is identified as a preparatory phase where the price gravitates around the median before climbing towards new ATHs at the end of the year. The “Red Year” heralds new ATHs, while the “Orange Year” suggests a bear market where the price becomes undervalued and bottoms out at the end of the year. CryptoCon’s theory is grounded in the historical patterns observed around Bitcoin’s halving events—the first on November 28, 2012, and the second on July 9, 2016. The analyst asserts, “Every prediction of this model has remained precisely on track since its creation in Jan of this year.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Under $35,000 But 86% Of Supply Remains Unmoved – Temporary Setback? Despite criticisms regarding the exact timing of past cycle peaks, CryptoCon maintains confidence in the model, stating, “The biggest critique I have seen of this model is that the technical top came in April 2021 and not November. But you can’t argue with the numbers, the price was higher.” Early Top, Top, And Bottom For The Next BTC Cycle The analyst’s approach combines various price experiments and a Trend Pattern Price model, leading to a consensus target of $130,000. The shared chart also specifies that Bitcoin is on the cusp of a “Blue Year.” According to CryptoCon, the next early top for Bitcoin is anticipated to occur within a 21-day window around July 9th, 2024, with an expected price range of $42,000 to $48,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge To $12,000 Is Not Foreseeable – Analyst Explains Why The chart analysis goes on to forecast the next cycle top, which is expected to fall within a similar 21-day margin around November 28, 2025. The projected price range for this peak is notably bullish, setting the target between $90,000 to $130,000. CryptoCon’s tweet underscores this prediction, stating: “Nothing has changed about my time frame or expected price for the next Bitcoin cycle top. 90 – 130k +/- 21 days from Nov 28th, 2025.” Remarkably, Cryptocon is also providing insights into the next cycle bottom. His forecast suggests a price floor of approximately $27,000, again within a 21-day range from November 28th, 2026. This aligns with the model’s ‘Orange Year,’ which is typically characterized as a bear market period where the price is expected to bottom out by the end of the year.

42419174,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1TZ,1699278516,5 Strategies for Acquiring Users On-Chain,"User acquisition in crypto is broken and underdeveloped. Most projects don’t have a clear idea on how to acquire users, how their users interact with their applications, or where their users come from. Ask a crypto project what their LTV (lifetime value of a customer) or CAC (customer acquisition cost) is and you might receive some blank stares or fluffy answers.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, sponsored by CME. Alex Topchishvili is the director of marketing at CoinList.  The reason for this is simple. Marketing is all about knowing your audience, but since crypto wallets are anonymized by design (on-chain and off-chain user identities are distinct), crypto marketers struggle to identify and communicate with potential customers.  Even those pseudo-anonymous individuals who are already your customers are difficult to communicate with as they can’t be identified among the large group of followers that projects have on Discord, Twitter or Telegram.  Luckily for marketers, the past couple years saw tremendous progress in on-chain identity and attribution. On-chain activity represents a new data set that can be used to construct user profiles and segment cohorts. Minting a non-fungible token (NFT), participating in a governance vote, using dApps on a specific chain or participating in a testnet are actions that signal meaningful interest and high intent.  In this piece, I’ll summarize the pros and cons of five user acquisition strategies that crypto projects might consider deploying.  1. Airdrops. — mass distribution but easy to game  Airdrops are a user acquisition and community building mechanism whereby a crypto project sends free tokens to members of their community in a bid to encourage adoption. In most cases, an airdrop is issued to users in exchange for completing a certain task related to the product offering or on-boarding journey like linking a wallet, following a social media account, sending or receiving a transaction, or minting an NFT.  Thanks to the transparency of blockchains, on-chain activity can also be leveraged for curating airdrop recipient selection. Most frequently, on-chain activity is recorded within a specific timeframe, after which a snapshot is taken to determine airdrop eligibility.  Airdrop eligibility can be done retroactively (e.g. Arbitrum), proactively (e.g. Blur) or through some combination (e.g. Optimism).  There are two challenges with airdrops as an acquisition model. Similar to the ""blitzscaling"" days of Uber, Netflix, etc, it’s not clear that users are interested in your product at a sustainable price point. Are users interested in your product or simply the free money?  Moreover, airdrops are easy to game. Because airdrops happen on-chain, there are few reliable ways for a project to evaluate a recipient’s off-chain reputation or identity. This creates two problems:  Airdrop farmers and Sybil attackers who game the system to receive outsized airdrop allocations, and  Unengaged users who may not be well-educated on the token utility or committed to the development of the protocol.  Without sufficient curation of the token recipients, airdropped tokens are often dumped immediately, causing price crashes, harm to the overall ecosystem and little (if any) real user acquisition. This is well illustrated by the botched airdrop that saw many airdrop recipients of Optimism's tokens immediately selling the freshly claimed tokens, driving the price of the OP token down over 70%.  2. Onchain ad networks – quality targeting but limited in scale  Another interesting user acquisition channel that has picked up some traction this year is using crypto native ad networks that use on-chain data to deliver personalized and relevant content to crypto natives on dApps. In other words, crypto native versions of Google AdSense.  Rather than using cookies, these platforms use wallet and on-chain data for targeting, segmentation and cohort construction. The ad networks enable projects to monetize their dApps with display ads and advertisers to reach active crypto users.  The challenge of working with crypto native ad networks like Slise, HypeLab, Pr3sence, BlockchainAds and others is that the publishers they work with have limited reach. High quality crypto traffic is very difficult to acquire, and with the exception of media platforms like CoinDesk, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CoinTelegraph and a couple more, there are very few ways of reaching interested audiences of users at scale.  This dearth of publishers in crypto is known as the “publisher problem,” and is made more difficult by the fact that most popular dApps like Uniswap, OpenSea or Magic Eden do not feature ads. The total dApp market is still small and amateur, and it will take time for projects to open up to placing ads and for their volume of traffic to grow.  3. Find crypto users in Web2 – great potential but unproven  One way to solve the “publisher problem” mentioned above is to target crypto users on traditional Web2 social networks like Facebook and Twitter. This is a complex and novel channel, but also one with a massive reach and distribution given the scale of Web2 social networks.  One crypto marketing company leading the charge in this category is Addressable, which allows marketers to connect the dots between on-chain blockchain data and off-chain social media accounts.  By leveraging machine learning and big data analysis, Addressable finds relationships between anonymous wallets and social media accounts, creating a channel for marketers to target crypto users in Web2. Once a custom audience segment is available, marketers can launch targeted ad campaigns on mainstream social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram and Reddit.  Addressable is running several pilot campaigns with brands like Bancor and Immutable X and I look forward to tracking the results of those initial campaigns.  4. Quest platforms – Low cost but poor quality traffic  Quests have grown to be the de-facto native ad-unit in crypto, given the lack of effectiveness in other channels. Quests are incentivized rewards campaigns on platforms like Layer 3, Rabbithole and Galxe that reward users with crypto when they complete specific value-add on-chain actions (i.e. trade, stake, swap, lend, follow on Twitter, join Discord, etc).  Given the huge user friction in crypto applications, the user is presented with a set of tasks and quests with rewards at each stage for onboarding. For new users, it is a way to earn crypto while learning and building credentials to become a contributor to emerging projects. For crypto projects, it is a way to identify and acquire quality contributors based on their credentials and value-adding activities.  By incentivizing that initial taste of a product, builders hope to draw long-term users into the experience. The quest platforms generally charge for campaigns either on a per-campaign or per-completed-quest basis. Whatever the payment model, you will end up with a CAC from the campaign and will therefore be able to quantify the return on ad spend (ROAS) that will evaluate the performance of the campaign.  One big question for quest platforms is the quality of traffic they attract. Given that many quests follow the same airdrop model of earning tokens, quests often attract bots (or real users) chasing freebies. Once they pass quests challenges and obtain the reward, they churn and leave you with little to no retention.  See also: UK Regulator Publishes Guidance for Crypto Marketing Regime  Nonetheless, there appears to be some success in this model of capturing retained users. The question is how do you further target the potential real users while weeding out the bots to increase ROI on the campaign. When choosing a quest platform, make sure to ask for case studies and a breakdown of the userbase to make sure it matches the users you actually want to have.  5. Partnerships and integrations – quality distribution, hard to pull off  Traditional tech companies have grown tremendously through large partnerships and integrations, and the crypto world has successfully adopted this strategy.  In the DeFi [decentralized finance] world, integration with other projects is a massive growth channel. DeFi protocols are composable, meaning they can be programmed to interact with and build on one another like building blocks.  This allows developers to bootstrap their own communities without having to build everything from scratch. When MakerDAO was launching Dai, their algorithmic stablecoin, their go-to-market strategy consisted of  Partnering with the biggest crypto exchanges for retail and institutional trading; and  Integrating into as many wallets and applications as possible. They achieved this with a relatively traditional business development team driving as many integrations as possible, much like Polygon is doing today.  Similarly in the crypto gaming world, a major growth channel is partnerships with guilds. A gaming guild is essentially a group of gamers that play together, share data and in-game assets, and support other gamers. Guilds such as Yield Guild Games and Good Games Guild allow new players to start playing a game by loaning them game assets that they might otherwise not be able to afford. They also help crypto games with user acquisition through scholarships, co-marketing and other direct contributions.  See also: Post-FTX, Bitcoin Is Ready for its Next Chapter  The challenge with crypto partnerships is that since many projects are decentralized, negotiations take place in governance forums rather than in conference rooms behind closed doors. The transition from founders-led towards community-led governance is complicated, and raises difficult questions around ongoing development, voter participation, and incentive alignment between stakeholders. It is critical that whatever partnership or integration is voted on is actually beneficial to the protocol and all its participants.  Whether it’s through product integrations, joint AMAs, or joint marketing initiatives, when you do have an opportunity to cross-pollinate and leverage your partner’s marketing reach, make it count.

42419163,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1JF,1699278266,DAOs Are the New Degen: Crypto Traders Can Copy-Trade Token Treasuries for Fun and Profit,"Another year has almost come to a close and crypto continues to be shrouded in regulatory uncertainty. Now, with some of the choppiest waters we have ever had, sentiment analysis has never been more important and treasuries for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can serve as a potential guiding light.  Take where we are now, for example.  Consensus Magazine's Trading Week week is sponsored by CME. Kushagra Agarwal is the co-founder of Samudai.  Despite the current uptick across certain crypto assets, we are very much in a down market compared to last year. Even so, DAO treasuries can yield valuable insights about both where the market is and where it’s going.  Consider Mantle, which aims to serve as an interoperable network hub for all sorts of decentralized projects and communities. Right now, the bulk of its assets are ether [ETH], stablecoins and its own native token. Mantle (MNT) by far makes up the largest allocation.  Logically, it is natural for a DAO to take as much control as possible over its own token during bear markets to decrease liquidity and therefore, overall risk of catastrophic price depreciation.  Compare such an allocation to a year ago when Mantle was heavily exposed to FTX’s native token, FTT, due to FTX’s investment in what was formerly BitDAO in 2021. At that time, BitDAO allowed for a swap of its former native token, BIT for FTT.  When it is a bull market (or in degen speak: “up-only”) DAOs tend to spread out their native tokens in exchange for both further investments in their ecosystems and further investments in other areas to diversify.  When the consensus says it’s a bear, the opposite occurs.  Others, like Gnosis, a top-five DAO by assets under management (AUM), pursue growth strategies no matter the market. In bears, this tends to mean weighting their treasuries towards safer tokens like ETH and its liquid derivatives, but in bulls they often branch out to choppier altcoins.  What about Arbitrum, which stands as the world’s largest DAO by AUM?  For now, its treasury is all-but exclusively allocated to its native token. Whether or not that changes remains to be seen.  Traders, looking for the next wave to ride and set of market indicators, could take cross-sections of these DAO treasuries. This works by cross-analyzing a set of DAO treasury wallets with their respective governance forums, where all treasury related discussions happen. Perhaps mix that with tool sets designed to watch what venture capital funds, crypto hedge funds and even traditional funds do when they move into crypto.  This could create a diversified picture of the market at-large. However no trading indicator is and ever will be foolproof.  DAOs may be down but they’re far from out  Since treasury movements can always be tracked on-chain, they still represent the most transparent example of what crypto practitioners are thinking about their native market. As treasury strategies evolve, they may become even more robust indicators of where the crypto market is leaning.  Ideally a healthy market would involve DAOs diversifying their treasuries with multiple coins that can appreciate in or hold their value even when crypto markets are volatile. More on-chain payments made in DAOs' native coins also tends to be a positive sign as it shows confidence among contributors in the DAOs longterm prospects.  No indicator is fool-proof, but widening your sources for tracking the market can mean the difference between being in a boat made of wood versus iron when the seas get choppy.

42419168,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1OP,1699275999,U.S. Treasuries Spearhead Tokenization Boom,"If the 2021 bull run was known for cartoon apes, meme coins, and gushing endorsements from celebrities, the next wave of crypto adoption – or even “crypto spring” – could come from something less sexy but more substantive: the tokenization of RWAs, or Real World Assets. At least that was my thesis earlier this year, when I reported on the projected $16 trillion market of tokenized RWAs.  Since then?  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  The tokenization space has caught fire, providing new tools (and profits) for investors and traders alike. This is especially true of tokenized U.S. Treasuries. According to 21.co, the market value of tokenized Treasuries increased nearly six-fold since the beginning of January, jumping from $104 million to $675 million.  One reason has nothing to do with crypto and everything to do with macro-economic forces. “The exceptional growth was fueled by the rise in U.S. Treasury yields,” says Carlos Gonzalez Campo, a Research Analyst at 21.co. Thanks to the gauntlet of rate hikes by the Fed, the three-month Treasury yield surged from virtually 0% at the end of 2021 to over 5% at the time of this writing. Not bad for the “boring” asset. “Amidst the uncertain macro and geopolitical environment,” says Gonzalez Campo, “there has been a ‘flight to safety’ to U.S. Treasuries.”  Traditional banks might not have much interest in Dogecoin or NFTs, but they love things like instant settlement (which you get with RWAs), 24/7 trading, lower costs, and the transformation of illiquid assets into liquid instruments. So the bankers are getting in on the action. Franklin Templeton, for example, tokenized over $300 million of its U.S. Government Money Fund on Stellar and Polygon. The European Investment Bank issued 150 million Euros of tokenized bonds. And the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, called tokenization “the next generation for markets.”  The buyers of these tokens include traders, investors, DAO treasurers, and wealth management firms. “This is specifically interesting for people who are already in stablecoins, and looking for diversification, and who are looking for yield with very little risk,” says Nils Behling, COO of Tradeteq, a U.K.-based private debt and real-world asset marketplace, which recently launched tokenized Treasuries on the XDC blockchain.  In the world of traditional finance, it’s common to diversify a portfolio with Treasuries and bonds, which provides a sort of “shock absorber” in case the stock market collapses. Crypto investors (sometimes) use the same kind of risk management, but instead of U.S. Treasuries, they use stablecoins. The good thing about stablecoins is that they’re (theoretically) risk-free, the bad thing is they offer no yield.  Read more from Trading Week: Post-FTX, Bitcoin Is Ready for its Next Chapter  “The U.S. government bond is seen as a risk-free rate,” says Behling, and if you can get 5% instead of 0% – and do it on-chain – then why wouldn’t you? The other problem with stablecoins, of course, is that sometimes they’re not entirely stable. (Exhibit A: Terra.) So Behling considers tokenized Treasuries to be “a nice hedge against de-peg risk.”  Given today’s juicy yields, many in the crypto space now see Treasuries as essential to modern investing. Allan Pedersen, the CEO of Monetalis (which worked to tokenize RWAs for Maker DAO), even compares tokenized Treasuries to carbon, as in the chemical element. “You need carbon for life on earth,” says Pedersen, “and you need U.S. Treasuries for life on-chain.”  Trade finance  Treasuries make up the bulk of tokenized RWAs – for now – but more asset classes give investors more options, some with higher risk and returns. Consider “trade finance,” or the arcane world of invoices and receivables. If someone sends an international shipment from Copenhagen to Cairo, that invoice is part of trade finance. Companies like Tradeteq are working to tokenize these invoices, which brings more liquidity to the market, gives more borrowing options for small businesses, and provides yet another asset class for investors. Behling thinks market alone is over $1 trillion and considers trade finance “the last frontier in finance.”  Or take small business lending. “This is kind of a niche area of underwriting,” says Sid Powell, co-founder of Maple Finance, which also tokenizes RWAs. Small business loans can offer yields of well over 10%, says Powell, and he gives the example of a COVID-era tax rebate program. Let’s say you’re a pizza shop that kept your employees during COVID in 2020.  “The government created a stimulus program through taxation, where they effectively rebated the taxes you would have paid,” says Powell. Thanks to government bureaucracy, these rebates took years to process and don’t sunset until 2025. Now they can be tokenized and traded as an asset, bringing yield to investors. “Once a real world asset yield gets above 10%, it starts to become much more interesting to funds, high net-worth investors, and other institutional allocators,” says Powell.  Some of these deep pockets might wish to invest in both cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) and traditional equities (like Apple stock), and RWAs let them do both in the same ecosystem. “For people who are investing and trading in crypto – and there’s not always a clear distinction between the two – then you kind of want to have all of the above [including stocks and bonds],” says Timo Lehes, co-founder of Swarm Markets, which also brings RWAs on-chain. “You don’t want to do all these wire transfers in between applications.”  More aggressive traders are finding ways to leverage tokenized Treasuries to squeeze even more yield. “I’ve seen people who do loans via various protocols and leverage five or six times,” says Pedersen. You buy a tokenized Treasury, then use that as collateral to get a loan, and then buy more Treasuries, and so on. “You can lock in 10% to 15% of interest by layering on top of each other,” says Pedersen. (This is the obligatory time to say THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, and over-leverage can backfire.) Or, as DeFi researcher Thor Hartvigsen explained in a widely shared X thread, you could get a 16.3% yield by “looping” various RWAs and acknowledged, “Alright this is getting outta hand.”  Putting the merits of leverage aside, there’s every reason to believe that the tokenization pie will keep growing. Adam Lawrence, CEO of RWA.xyz, a data provider, suspects that the tokenized Treasuries market is entering its “scale phase,” and predicts that over the next few quarters, tokenized Treasuries will “easily 10x the current market size.”  One final thought. While the words “risk-free” should make everyone in crypto do a double-take – we’ve seen that movie before – in the case of U.S. Treasuries, that really is how investors view the asset. But then again … as the House of Representatives descends into chaos and another government shutdown always looms, it might also be fair to ask, tongue firmly in cheek, “What could possibly be risky about the U.S. government?”  So, as with all things in crypto investing, caveat emptor.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/06/us-treasuries-spearhead-tokenization-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b751c64af19824fc862118663629188f655c38e-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Unraveling A 70,000 ETH Sale","A video has surfaced on social media where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he sold 70,000 ETH tokens during its price all-time high. Buterin Acknowledges Shorting Ethereum Crypto community member, MetaMan X, published a video post on X (formerly Twitter), disclosing a conversation where Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin admitted that he had sold about 70,000 ETH tokens, essentially shorting the cryptocurrency during a major all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Under $35,000 But 86% Of Supply Remains Unmoved – Temporary Setback? In the podcast with American hedge fund director, Eric Ross Weinstein, Buterin spoke on the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017. During Ethereum’s previous all-time high in 2017, when the price of ETH rose as high as $1,600 and Bitcoin’s price was up $20,000, Buterin voiced doubts about whether the significant price surge truly aligned with the crypto market’s modest achievements over the years. “The crypto space has reached half a trillion dollars, does it deserve it?” Buterin stated. When asked if he had shorted Ethereum during the all-time high, Buterin stated that he had convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a considerable amount of ETH tokens, and the result of the decision made a huge impact on the cryptocurrency later. “I did get the Ethereum Foundation to sell 70,000 ETH like basically at the top, and that’s doubled our runway now, so it was one good decision that had a lot of impact,” Buterin said. ETH price at $1,886 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Community Worries Over Buterin’s ETH Sell-Offs Many crypto community members have raised concerns about the multiple ETH transactions said to be conducted by Ethereum’s founder. Recently, Buterin was spotted making a transfer of 100 ETH, worth about $181,000 to Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The motive behind the transaction has sparked curiosity among Ethereum investors and the crypto community. Earlier in August, Buterin was also reported moving 600 ETH worth $1 million to Coinbase. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum: Crypto Pundit Says Expect A Repeat Of Massive 2019 Rally However, the Ethereum Founder had publicly clarified in October that he had not sold any ETH tokens for personal gain since 2018. He also stated that most ETH transactions were not him selling, but rather the recipients of his charitable donations selling the ETH tokens. The founder has also been caught in controversy over the weekend when Ethereum whistleblower Steven Nerayoff alleged that Buterin was involved in some sort of fraud involving ETH. Nerayoff says Ethereum is linked to corrupt SEC officials to carry out this fraud which he says is on a larger scale than what happened with FTX. For reference, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty of fraud charges after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 with a $9 billion hold in its balance sheet.

42419181,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1an,1699274283,"Post-FTX, Bitcoin Is Ready for its Next Chapter","Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty on all seven counts of fraud, and his first trial has come to a close with FTX's founder and former CEO facing a possible century in prison.  Last November, FTX's collapse kicked off a deep, dark crypto winter with the possibility of billions in customer funds lost and regulators hell-bent on suffocating the industry. Fast forward a year, and there's the very real possibility of FTX's estate returning 90% of customer funds. Bitcoin is now above $35,000, according to data from CoinDesk Indicies, up from a low of $15,625 on the coldest crypto winter day last year.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  Bitcoin's growth powered by utility potential – and an ETF  It didn't take long for bitcoin to shake off fear of a broader crypto contagion and recover to where it once was before the collapse.  On January 18, CoinDesk reported that bitcoin had erased its entire FTX-related decline.  Certainly, macroeconomics played a role in bitcoin's quick recovery, but so did the growing field of utility applications around the Bitcoin blockchain.  ""The price of Bitcoin, whether it's 200k or 400k, won't be just due to speculation; it will be because people see the value in Bitcoin's utility,"" Jason Fang, the managing partner at Sora Ventures, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Fang, whose Sora Ventures invests in utility applications for bitcoin, believes that the future gains of bitcoin will be a testament to its technology first and foremost.  Part of the advantage, he says, is its decentralization.  It's questionable how decentralized Ethereum, or leading layer-1s like Solana, are when both are heavily reliant on cloud providers like Amazon's AWS. As Fang also points out, both – and other layer-1s – are reliant on their foundations for maturing the technology, a big problem if they run into trouble.  ""They're centralized in tech and funding. If one fails, they're in trouble. Bitcoin, however, is funded by miners, who are incentivized by the utility to support the network,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""This leads to a more profitable business for them. Bitcoin's path is unique and not dependent on being Ethereum-compatible, which gives it a stronger narrative.""  But it’s not like ether or sol have been slouches in their performance over the last year.  Ether is up 17% on-year, while sol is up 26%. But bitcoin is up 70%. That’s because as Metalpha's Lucy Hu explains, the market is anticipating an ETF and movement from the Fed.  ""Bitcoin's price, in the short and medium term, will still be determined by the approval of ETFs, possible Fed rate cut, bullish sentiment from institutional investors such as Microstrategy as well as the halving event in the first half of next year,"" she told CoinDesk.  The consensus wisdom currently is that spot bitcoin ETFs are likely to be approved as early as January 2024, with a raft of big names, including BlackRock and Fidelity, readying offerings.  Trading Volumes Ending the Year Strong  An ETF that seems months away from being approved, and renewed interest from institutions, has attracted attention from traders.  Crypto trading volume was slow throughout most of the year, with publicly-listed Coinbase feeling the chill as it reported earnings throughout the year.  In September, CoinDesk reported that crypto spot market activity hit a 4.5-year low.  But then, in late October – despite Coinbase reporting soft transaction volumes at the start of the month – something changed as the ETF narrative picked up and the market thawed. Trading volumes surged.  By the end of the month, crypto investment funds recorded their largest inflow in 15 months at $326 million, according to CoinShares.  ""Bitcoin has proven its resilience, especially after the FTX implosion — it didn't go to zero, showing it's not just some scam chain. It's here to stay,"" Fang said.  ""In contrast, many top-20 tokens are still in their infancy and haven't faced a real bear market. Bitcoin, however, is expected to survive multiple downturns and last for a long time,"" he continued.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/06/post-ftx-bitcoin-is-ready-for-its-next-chapter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fab0f62d1904d83e7cda05c41aabc9aa43e87455-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP Sharks & Whales Are Backing The Current Rally In The Asset According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the large XRP holders have participated in buying recently. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures the percentage of the total supply that each investor cohort in the market is holding in their wallets as a whole right now. In the context of the current discussion, the 100,000 to 1 billion token group is of interest. This cohort naturally includes all investors or addresses who are carrying at least 100,000 and at most 1 billion XRP in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge To $12,000 Is Not Foreseeable – Analyst Explains Why At the time of writing, this range converts to about $69,000 at the lower end and $690 million at the upper end. The holders that carry such large amounts are popularly called the sharks and whales (with the sharks obviously being the smaller cohort of the two). Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution specifically for these sharks and whales over the past few months: Looks like the value of the metric has registered some increase in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the XRP sharks and whales addresses hit a low last month at the same time as the asset’s ratio with Bitcoin had reached a bottom. At these low prices, the cohorts participated in some rapid accumulation, leading to their holdings shooting up. In the period since this buying started, the cryptocurrency has enjoyed a sharp rally. From the chart, it’s also visible that the sharks and whales aren’t done with the asset just yet despite all the price increases it has already seen so far, as their holdings have continued to trend up recently. After the latest rise in the indicator, these humongous entities now control about 45.8% of the entire circulating supply of the asset, which is the highest level for the year 2023. During the last 24 hours, XRP has registered a further 11% uplift and so far, the sharks and whales haven’t shown any reaction to it. Further buying or even sideways movement at these highs would naturally be an optimistic sign for the asset. Related Reading: $113 Million In Longs Get Rekt As Bitcoin Plunges Back To $34,000 One obstacle that the coin could face, though, is the social dominance spike that it has just seen with the latest leg in the rally. The “social dominance” is a metric that tells us how the social media talk related to XRP currently compares against that of the top 100 coins by market cap. As is visible in the graph, this indicator has now hit its highest point since mid-July, suggesting that the coin is receiving considerable attention right now. Historically, such hype has often not been a good sign for rallies, as tops have become more probable to form in these conditions.

Prices rose over 11% before slightly retreating on Monday, with trading volumes spiking to $2 billion from Sunday’s $1 billion, CoinGecko data shows. At the time of writing, XRP traded at 69 cents and replaced BNB as the fourth-largest token by market capitalization.  Data suggests the gains were largely spot-driven as liquidations on XRP-tracked futures breached just over $4.4 million. A large liquidation amount may have suggested that the use of high leverage may have boosted prices.  No immediate catalyst for the gains existed on Monday. However, bulls may have reacted to two positive developments for payments firm Ripple from last week as the company won key approvals to operate and offer services in Georgia and Dubai.  Ripple said last Thursday that the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved XRP under its virtual assets regime – allowing licensed firms in the Dubai International Financial Centre, a financial sandbox, to incorporate and offer XRP to clients as part of their crypto services.  On the same day, the firm said it would start working with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) on the Digital Lari (GEL) pilot project, which will use the firm’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform.  Hong Kong and Taiwan governments are already using the CBDC service, which launched in May. Institutions can use the platform to manage and customize the entire life cycle of the CBDC, which includes minting, distribution, redemption and token burning.  Central banks can issue both wholesale and retail CBDCs, which can make offline transactions as well.

19856093,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559295,1699268454,Chainlink Bullish Run: Is $15 On The Horizon Amidst Strong Recovery?,"Chainlink (LINK) has witnessed a noteworthy surge in its price over the past week, defying the increasing overhead supply pressure that typically exerts downward force on cryptocurrencies. Despite these challenges, LINK’s price has managed to maintain a slow yet steady rally, driven by the influence of a rising channel pattern. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Chainlink is currently trading at $12.44, marking a 1.3% gain in the last 24 hours and a remarkable 12.9% rally over the past seven days. This upward trajectory has left many investors and analysts wondering whether this rally is likely to persist or if a correction is on the horizon. Related Reading: RUNE Solid 100% Rally Hits Barrier: THORChain Price Nears Key Resistance Rising Channel Pattern Supports Chainlink Rally According to LINK’s price chart, LINK buyers may find a strong support level at $10.75. This support trendline is critical, as it serves as a safeguard against a steep correction. As long as this trendline holds, it suggests that LINK may avoid a sharp decline. A rebound from this level could empower buyers to challenge the immediate resistance at $12.6, paving the way for an advance towards the $14.65 to $15 price range. However, amid the price action, the cryptocurrency community is abuzz with news of a substantial Chainlink transfer, meticulously tracked by Whale Alert. An impressive 3.8 million LINK tokens, equivalent to approximately $46 million, were moved between wallets of unknown origin. Such large-scale transfers within the crypto space often trigger close scrutiny, as they can potentially foreshadow significant market-moving events, including large sell orders or liquidity provisions. 🚨 🚨 3,894,965 #LINK (46,000,786 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/CKzDNxxG9O — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 5, 2023 With these developments in mind, the future of Chainlink’s price trajectory remains uncertain. The rising channel pattern and recent gains indicate a degree of bullish sentiment, but it’s important to remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Related Reading: This Chainlink Metric Just Hit Meteoric Levels – Good News For LINK Price? LINK market cap at $6.942 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com A Crucial Level For LINK’s Future The ability of LINK to maintain its rally and potentially breach the $12.6 resistance level will be closely monitored by traders and analysts alike. It is essential to keep an eye on the $10.75 support level, as a breach could signal a change in the current trend. Additionally, large transfers like the one observed may hint at influential market actions on the horizon. Chainlink (LINK) is showing resilience in the face of overhead supply pressure, and its performance over the coming days will be a focal point for the crypto community. While the current rally is promising, investors should exercise caution and remain attentive to potential market-moving events that may arise.

42419200,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2tJ,1699264547,Roger Ver Seeks Winding Up of Matrixport in Seychelles Lawsuit,"While CoinFLEX's creditors and OPNX's management await their day in a Hong Kong court, another legal scuffle is brewing between Roger Ver – whom some call 'Bitcoin Jesus' – and Jihan Wu, the co-founder and chairman of Matrixport. The feud is over $8 million Ver says Wu took from him as punishment over his supposed role in the demise of unrelated crypto exchange CoinFLEX.  Ver’s counsel, in a lawsuit filed in Seychelles last year, alleges that bit.com, a crypto exchange owned by Matrixport, will not let him withdraw $8 million, as Wu – a creditor of CoinFLEX – suffered financial losses when the exchange filed for restructuring.  “CoinFLEX’s insolvency lies at the heart of the reason Wu ordered [Matrixport] to convert my Funds,"" the court docket reads. ""CoinFLEX’s insolvency has nothing to do with the sums [Matrixport] owes to me.”  Ver was also named in the writ against OPNX, which was filed by CoinFLEX’s creditors in Hong Kong.  Ver says CoinFLEX’s demise was not his fault  In the aftermath of CoinFLEX’s collapse, a narrative emerged that the exchange's demise was because a large individual customer failed to meet a margin call, whom the exchange’s management later named Ver, in hopes of recovering the position’s value of $84 million via arbitration.  For his part, Ver says in the Seychelles suit that the whole narrative emerged only because of “flagrant breaches of confidentiality” involving arbitration between CoinFLEX and himself.  “I started the arbitration against CoinFLEX in June 2022, seeking $200,000,000 in damages. I was the plaintiff, not CoinFLEX. CoinFLEX was the defendant and only later filed a counterclaim for $84,000,000,” Ver told CoinDesk in an email.  Ver said he began an arbitration case against CoinFLEX in June 2022, seeking $200 million in damages he sustained from trading on the platform, CoinDesk reported. Ver alleged he had “evidence that certain third parties were provided with knowledge of my sizable positions on CoinFLEX and traded against them to my detriment.”  “The arbitration was in Hong Kong, where the law is clear that the arbitration is required to be kept confidential,” he continued in an email to CoinDesk.  Despite this, he says that Lamb, CoinFLEX’s founder and CEO, broke confidentiality to “intentionally misrepresent to the entire world that CoinFlex was the plaintiff and give their side of the case.”  “CoinFLEX went insolvent due to a combination of the May 2022 market turmoil and its co-founders’ poor risk management,” Ver wrote in a Seychelles court filing.  Matrixport doesn’t deny withholding crypto  In exhibits attached to court filings, and statements Matrixport made to CoinDesk, neither Wu nor the company denies that crypto is being withheld from Ver. Still, the dispute is over the rationale behind it.  “My position is very simple. I am a creditor of CoinFlex, and CoinFlex is a creditor of you. You just send your USDC back to CoinFlex to repay the debt there, and CoinFlex releases the $5 million USDC to me,” Wu wrote.  In earlier correspondence with CoinFLEX’s Mark Lamb, Wu discussed selling the debt to him.  “Roger chatted with me and insisting that CoinFLEX owes him money because you refused to liquidate,” Wu wrote. “In no way I will release the USDC to Roger.”  Ver also alleges that Matrixport is struggling with liquidity issues, quoting a statement that Wu made to him, in which he said he “needs to gather every possible liquidity have to Matrixport.”  “If I had an easier situation, I would not have done this,” Wu is quoted as saying.  “Wu’s statement further indicated to me that Respondent was insolvent or on the brink thereof, and therefore was unable to permit me to withdraw the Funds,” Ver wrote in the Seychelles filing.  Matrixport says the funds are being held because of an investigation into Ver’s “margin trading irregularities.”  “Subject to a penalty fee for margin call defaults, Mr. Ver was free to withdraw his funds but instead disputed the penalties payable,” Matrixport spokesperson Ross Gan told CoinDesk. “Ver continues to make unreasonable demands to bit.com other than the withdrawal of his funds.”  Ver has filed in Seychelles to wind up (liquidate) Matrixport “based on Jihan’s written admission that Matrixport was forfeiting funds it owed me for his own personal reasons.”  Correspondence between Ver and Matrixport shows that the exchange wants to withhold $1.29 million as a penalty for defaulted margin calls and legal fees.  Disputes over Terms of Service  In emails between Matrixport executive Mo Zhou and Ver’s attorney, Daniel Kelman, Matrixport wrote that the firm is committing significant legal resources to fight Ver’s case in Seychelles and “our counsel has advised us that bit.com has the right to claim set off against your balance given these costs/damages.”  Kelman countered that bit.com’s terms of service, which Ver agreed to before opening an account, do not allow such penalties.  “There is no set-off permitted by your terms,"" Kelman wrote. “[Matrixport has] put forth no legal justification for the continued retention of the approximately $6.54 million left after deducting your fake penalty — not even a phony one invented after the fact to give yourself cover from allegations of criminal theft and conversion.""  “Given the ongoing litigation, our counsel has advised the funds be withheld until a court decision provides clarity on the proper course of action,” Matrixport’s Gan wrote to CoinDesk.  In an April 2023 email between bit.com and Kelman, a company representative said that it was willing to put the disputed $8 million into a third-party escrow account pending the resolution of both side’s contractual differences.

That hasn’t been the case, though, and a recent revelation from a prominent crypto analyst suggests that the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, could continue to see an upward trend. New Liquidity Coming Into The Market Could Boost Bitcoin, Ethereum In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the crypto market has seen close to $10.97 billion in positive capital inflows, which represents the highest level this year. According to him, this inflow of capital into crypto could potentially mean that investors are heavily bullish on these assets. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Bet Big As Shibarium Grows – Road To $0.1? Source: X Meanwhile, there is also further evidence that the market, most especially Bitcoin, could see an influx of new money in the coming days, as Martinez mentioned in a subsequent post that over 700,000 new BTC addresses were created on November 4. The analyst believes that such a happening is an important milestone as Bitcoin’s network growth is one of the best price predictors. Source: X It is uncertain what could be behind these inflows and the revived interest in the crypto market. However, some believe that it could be institutional investors who are taking positions ahead of a possible approval of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others believe that the Bitcoin Halving could be contributing to the resurgence in Bitcoin’s price and the crypto market by extension. Historically, Bitcoin has seen significant gains in the period leading up to the Halving event. The next Halving is expected to happen in April 2024. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt the influx of new money into the ecosystem is a positive development. A particular crypto analyst had once noted that many altcoins were tepid due to the lack of liquidity in the market and that they could pick up once there is renewed interest in the market. Institutional Interest Coming From Overseas According to a Bloomberg report, Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Securities and Financial Commission (SFC), is considering allowing the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow investors to invest directly in the cryptocurrency itself (Spot trading). Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Under $35,000 But 86% Of Supply Remains Unmoved – Temporary Setback? This development comes amid the US SEC’s reluctance to approve the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which would allow US investors to have direct exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. This further highlights the stark contrast between the treatment that the crypto industry has received overseas and in the United States. The positive approach taken by regulators overseas is, however, commendable as the crypto industry continues to see interest from such regions.

42419187,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2dp,1699262836,UK Financial Watchdogs Publish Plans to Regulate Stablecoins,"The Bank of England (BOE) will regulate “systemic stablecoins” that are in wide enough circulation to potentially disturb financial stability, while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the wider crypto sector according to discussion papers published by the two regulators Monday.  The proposals followed broader plans for overseeing the crypto sector published by the U.K. government last week.  Proposals from Big Tech companies like Facebook, now Meta (META), and PayPal (PYPL) to issue stablecoins and last year's collapse of stablecoin empire Terraform Labs have propelled related regulation worldwide, with major jurisdictions such as the European Union and Japan recently finalizing regimes.  While the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation seeks to limit potentially wide-use stablecoins such as the one proposed by Meta, a person familiar with the matter said the BOE's proposals would allow companies to issue payments-focused, fiat-backed stablecoins in the U.K. if approved to do so. No existing stablecoin, however, qualifies as ""systemic"" under the proposals.  The U.K., which has expressed a desire to become a global crypto hub, successfully brought stablecoins into the scope of the country’s payments regulation in June. Legislation for fiat-backed stablecoins is expected early next year.  The discussion papers published Monday represent ""an exploratory phase in developing the new regime,"" and after regulators receive feedback from stakeholders on these proposals, they will consult on the final rules, the BOE said. The FCA and the central bank aim to consult on final rules by mid-2024, and implement the stablecoin regimes by 2025, according to a document published alongside the discussion papers.  Protections for stablecoin issuers  The BOE’s plans focus on stablecoins pegged to the value of the British pound because the central bank considers these to be likely to be used widely for payments, the bank said in a press statement. Among other things, the central bank is considering limits on individual stablecoin holdings.  The BOE paper was published Monday alongsidea letter from the country’s Prudential Regulations Authority (PRA) to deposit-takers. The PRA expects lenders in the country to mitigate risks “of contagion,” it said in the letter, which clarified that the protections available to traditional deposit takers differ from those available for stablecoin users.  “Contagion risks will be lower for stablecoins used in systemic payment systems regulated by the Bank, than for e-money or other regulated stablecoins captured by the FCA’s regime,” the letter said.  FCA plans  Meanwhile, the FCA said issuers will need to seek authorization to circulate fiat-backed stablecoins in or from the U.K. It wants stablecoins to be backed by “appropriate” assets to equal the value in circulation. It also wants issuers to make sure that the crypto can be easily redeemed for fiat currencies regardless of technical or liquidity issues.  The watchdog also proposed that regulated stablecoin issuers should be allowed to retain revenues derived from “interest and return from the backing assets,” which will help set a “clear distinction between stablecoins and deposits.” The FCA is also of the view that regulated stablecoin issuers should not be permitted to pay income or interest to consumers.  “We are conscious that this may be perceived as unfair to consumers, in the event that interest rates continue to remain high and/or go up significantly (given that the regulated stablecoin backing assets are expected to be protected as client assets),” the paper said.

19851985,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559265,1699258542,Elon Musk’s Cousin Among First Investors In Solana: Expert Reveals,"A recent social media post by crypto pundit MartyParty has sparked renewed interest in the early investment patterns surrounding Solana. This interest centers around the revelation that Lyndon Rive, a cousin of Elon Musk, was among the first investors in Solana, a fact that has largely flown under the radar since Rive’s announcement on July 30, 2019. “Why is Elon Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive one of the first investors in Solana. Rive is a cousin of Elon Musk as their mothers are twin sisters,” Marty remarked. The Story Of Solana And Elon Musk’s Cousin Lyndon Rive, better known as the co-founder of SolarCity and cousin to tech mogul Elon Musk, has maintained a lower profile compared to his renowned relative. Despite their familial ties, Rive’s investment trajectory has diverged notably from Musk’s, especially after Rive left SolarCity following its acquisition by Tesla in 2016. In July 2019, Rive invested in Solana Labs, the company behind the SOL blockchain. The project, launched in 2018, is distinguished by its use of a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which aligns with the growing interest in more energy-efficient blockchain technologies. While Rive’s participation in the Series A funding of Solana was not singularly significant, it was part of a crucial $20 million funding round that helped kickstart the project. Subsequent investments by entities like CoinList and MXC Exchange bolstered Solana’s growth, cumulatively raising an additional $40 million. Related Reading: Is Fantom (FTM) About To Explode Like Solana (SOL)? This Analyst Thinks So The connection between Rive’s investment in Solana and Musk’s stance on SOL remains unclear. Elon Musk is widely recognized for his enthusiasm for Dogecoin, often expressing support for the meme coin. Additionally, Tesla, under Musk’s leadership, has included Bitcoin as part of its corporate balance sheet. However, Solana was never mentioned by Musk. Notably, after Tesla ceased accepting Bitcoin in May 2021 citing environmental concerns, the Solana Foundation reached out to Musk via Twitter, answering “dms are open”. Musk has never responded publicly, suggesting that there is no official connection between Musk and Solana despite his cousin’s investment. Related Reading: Solana Price’s 70% Rally Persuades Detractor, Arthur Hayes Makes Confession The intrigue deepens with the parallel choices of Musk and Solana’s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, in favoring the Rust programming language for their respective projects, xAI and SOL. xAI’s recent announcement lauds Rust for its robustness and reliability, essential for scalable and maintainable infrastructure. Crypto expert Joe McCann commented: “Elon Musk chooses Rust for xAI. Anatoly Yakovenko chose Rust for Solana.” In conclusion, while Rive’s early investment in Solana is a notable piece of the platform’s history, the extent of his influence or any indirect connection to Musk remains speculative. Nevertheless, it is a story to keep in mind. SOL Prize Takes A Break At press time, SOL was trading just below $40 and was undergoing a retest after the price broke out of the trading range post the FTX crash last week. A daily close above $38.76 could be crucial to establish a new range and possibly target the 1,618 Fibonacci extension level at $57.85.

Nearly four hundred different GROK tokens have been released by anonymous developers over the weekend, running to a combined market capitalization of tens of millions of dollars, which has let early bettors bag several multiples on their initial token buys.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  These tokens are seemingly inspired by Grok, an AI chatbot service by social application X that started to roll out on Saturday. Previews show the service is more uncensored – and humorous – than existing players, which has seemingly helped it quickly gain a cult following.  Blockchain data shows the earliest GROK token was issued early Saturday on Ethereum and reached a market capitalization of $10 million as of Monday morning. It has 4,600 holders, and $10 million worth of the tokens were traded for ether [ETH] in the past 24 hours, data shows.  Top holders of this token are sitting on over $150,000 in unrealized gains from initial buys of just a few thousand dollars worth of ether.  Another GROK on the Base network has reached a $4.32 million capitalization with $3.5 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours.  Not every release has been well-intentioned, however. Developers behind at least ten different GROK releases have already “rug pulled” – or removed the liquidity of their tokens – leading to cumulative losses of more than $1 million for speculators.  Such tokens aren’t a new spectacle of opportunistic players creating a s**tcoin market on trendy topics. Developers have previously created tokens based on tweets ranging from Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin’s tweets to jokes from McDonald’s official Twitter accounts.

42419194,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2m5,1699256595,"There Is No Reason Not to Be Bullish on Bitcoin After Payroll Data, Crypto Expert Says","Bitcoin [BTC] has seen little upside momentum since Friday’s dismal U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) release. Still, market sentiment remains positive, with weak data signaling an end of the Fed tightening.  “There’s no reason not to be bullish BTC,” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amerdata, said in an email, citing Friday’s payrolls figure and the recent decline in stock market volatility indices as the likely catalyst for continued gains in the cryptocurrency.  The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday showed that job creation slowed to 150,000 jobs in October after rising by 297,000 in September.  Meanwhile, the jobless rate rose to 3.9% while wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings, softened, hinting at continued disinflation.  The data has made it more likely that the Federal Reserve will not hike interest rates again, supposedly a positive development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The central bank has raised rates by 525 basis points to 5.25% since March last year. The so-called tightening aimed at taming inflation was partly responsible for last year’s crypto market slide.  “This [NFP] print was also accompanied by revisions lower for both September (+336k→ +297k) and August (+227k → +165k). We’re also seeing decent progress on the CPI and hourly earnings trends, giving room for the Fed to speak in a continued dovish tone,” Magadini noted.  Supporting the case for continued upside in bitcoin is the dwindling volatility in the U.S. stock and bond markets. The S&P 500 VIX indicator has tanked from 21.13 to 14.19 in the past five trading days, while the MOVE index, an options-based measure of volatility in the Treasury bond market, has dropped from 132 to 118, according to charting platform TradingView. Perhaps tensions in the Middle East are no longer the focal point for the market.  Reduced volatility in traditional markets, especially bonds, alleviates liquidity stress in the global market, incentivizing risk-taking.  ""The Middle Eastern war (something beyond my understanding) seems to have taken a backseat in terms of market-driving news. I expect a continuation of the relief rally for risk assets. Especially given the massive drop in VIX and VVIX week-over-week and the classic end-of-year rally narrative that traders look for in Q4,"" Magadini said.  Bitcoin changed hands at $34,890, representing a 0.4% decline on the day.

Last week, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of defrauding his customers and lenders by a jury. A sentencing date has been tentatively set for March 28, 2024. Theoretically, he could face 115 years in jail, but realistically, that could be between 15-20 years, according to experts.  The “trust assets” are held in five Grayscale Trusts, totaling an estimated $691 million, and one trust managed by Bitwise, amounting to $53 million, based on the market value as of October 25, 2023. The trusts allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without owning the digital assets.  “The debtors’ judgment is that proactively mitigating the risk of price swings will best protect the value of the Trust Assets, thereby maximizing the return to creditors and promoting an equitable distribution of funds in the debtor’s’ plan of reorganization,” the filing said.  Apart from using an investment adviser, the debtors have proposed setting up a pricing committee in which all stakeholders are represented.

During Treehouse of Horror 34, the Halloween special episode of the iconic animated series, the show made numerous references to the overvaluation of on-chain NFTs in the first chapter of the episode titled “Wild Barts Can’t Be Token.”  NFTs are a special type of crypto asset that allows holders to prove their ownership of real or digital items.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  In the episode, Marge battles through the blockchain to rescue Bart, now a living NFT, while the city’s mayor declares that Springfield’s art gallery will be digitized. There are also plenty of appearances by blue chip NFTs, like the Beeple, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and second-tier PFPs being shown as nearly worthless.  On X, Noah Bolanowski, an NFT collector and adviser to Crypt Gallery, an IRL NFT gallery, analyzed how the show portrayed NFTs.  “I loved how the episode had an incredible art emphasis - the PFPs were painted largely as the bottom of the barrel, whereas art was positioned at a level of prestige. They even had BAYC holders cleaning their feet,” he posted on the social networking platform.  The episode, which has plenty of references to the NFT crash of last year, isn’t the first time that crypto – or NFTs – has appeared on the show.  In 2020, the episode “Frinkcoin” features Jim Parsons educating viewers on cryptocurrency, complete with a singing ledger book and teases to the identity of Satoshi.  “For cryptocurrencies to work, we need a record of every transaction that occurs. These are recorded in what’s called a distributed ledger,” Parsons explains during the episode, which aired just before the Covid crypto crash of March 2020. “When you use the currency, the transaction is recorded in the ledger, and when one ledger book gets filled up, we add to a chain of previous books – that’s the blockchain.”  Last year’s “The King of Nice” had a gag where Krusty the clown is forced onto the celebrity-for-hire app Cameo because he blew all his money on NFTs. “Non-funny TV shows” is how the clown describes it.  This isn’t the first time Simpsons creator Matt Groening’ has snubbed crypto and blockchain. Earlier this year, Futurama, another popular animated series by Groening, mocked crypto miners in an episode titled “How the West Was 101001.”  The latest episode appeared to have a minor impact on the floor prices of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, up 0.3% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, and the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, with its floor prices up 2.9%.

42419199,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE2qD,1699241739,Hong Kong Now Considering Spot Crypto ETFs for Retail Investors: Bloomberg,"Hong Kong’s securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), is moving towards allowing retail investors to buy spot crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).  “We welcome proposals using innovative technology that boosts efficiency and customer experience,” SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung is quoted by Bloomberg as saying. “We’re happy to give it a try as long as new risks are addressed. Our approach is consistent regardless of the asset.”  Hong Kong regulators are continuing to take a progressive approach to crypto, and their opinion on retail exposure to digital assets has shifted throughout the year.  In January, the SFC tightened regulations by restricting retail investors from accessing crypto spot ETFs, limiting them to professional investors with portfolios of at least 8 million HKD ($1 Million). Then, in October, the SFC updated its rule book to allow a broader range of investors to engage in spot-crypto and ETF investing, stipulating that they pass a knowledge test and meet net worth – though less than the professional investor threshold – requirements.  “The policy is updated in light of the latest market developments and enquiries from the industry seeking to further expand retail access through intermediaries and to allow investors to directly deposit and withdraw virtual assets to/from intermediaries with appropriate safeguards,” the SFC said in a circular.  Issuers of listed crypto products would need to publish risk disclosure statements.  “As the crypto ecosystem evolves step-by-step to the point where we’re comfortable, then we’re happy to open up more access to the wider investing public,” Leung is quoted by Bloomberg as saying.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/06/hong-kong-now-considering-spot-crypto-etfs-for-retail-investors-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba24e4d9cb54970fed2b3aa45aa6799e3b49d17-5517x3679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is trading near $34,850 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with support near $34,320 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

BTC climbed higher above the $34,500 and $34,650 resistance levels to start another increase. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $35,945 swing high to the $34,133 swing low. However, the bears were active above the $35,200 level.
