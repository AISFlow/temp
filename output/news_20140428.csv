42377186,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfrP,1398723918,Word Analysis Shows How Different Bitcoin and Dogecoin Fans Really Are,"As message boards and news articles routinely show, bitcoin and dogecoin have attracted markedly different crowds within the digital currency community.  Bitcoin fans routinely allege that dogecoin's very existence undermines what they consider the overall message of digital currency movement - that consumers should be freed from archaic monetary systems, while dogecoin users are quick to point out that bitcoin users can be overly focused on the value of bitcoin against the dollar.  Now, two new graphics have emerged that use the day-to-day language of the communities' own reddit users to illustrate the differences between the respective groups.  Popular terms like 'people', 'money' and 'time' dominate the bitcoin subreddit, while in the dogecoin subreddit, words like 'dogetipbot', 'verify' and 'help' are the most common.  Bitcoin emphasizes financial systems  The bitcoin subreddit word cloud includes a wealth of terms related to existing financial systems, suggesting that bitcoin enthusiasts want to see BTC disrupt the global financial system.  That, in turn, might cause its price to continue upward.    Words like 'transaction', 'government' and 'bank' show that bitcoin fans on reddit are talking about BTC in terms of how it could replace fiat systems of monetary value.    Dogecoin focuses on giving  By contrast, the dogecoin subreddit word cloud includes a number of terms related to gratitude. 'Help', 'thanks' and 'community' are some of the more popular expressions used.  The dogecoin community has also created a lingo all of its own with terms such as 'shibe', 'wow' and 'moon' prominently appearing on the chart.  This suggests that dogecoin has created a unique community in the short time since its December launch.  Bitcoin versus dogecoin?  It's hard to put bitcoin and dogecoin in direct competition with one another. Yes, they are based off of the same core software, but they were built for two different reasons. Bitcoin appeared because of distrust over government controlled money, which has been the subject of conversations on its subreddit.  Dogecoin, on the other hand, was started as a joke. No one would have ever thought that it would become so popular, even to the amazement of its creator, Jackson Palmer. And the more carefree conversation in the dogecoin subreddit is a reflection of that.  What do these charts tell you? Tell us below.

42377181,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfmN,1398720190,Yelp Officially Announces New Feature for Bitcoin Merchants,"San Francisco-based merchant directory provider Yelp has officially announced a new functionality that allows bitcoin-accepting merchants to promote awareness of the payment method via its platform.  Though rumors of the new feature have circulated since as far back as 10th April, this was the first time that the company confirmed the news.  Wrote Yelp in its official blog post:  ""We’re constantly thinking about how to make our business attributes more useful for consumers and businesses. That’s why we’re excited to announce that as of today, we’re adding a new attribute: 'Accepts Bitcoin: Yes'.""  Business owners that accept bitcoin can now update their profile on biz.yelp.com to take advantage of the new attribute.  Finding the new feature  The new attribute will now be visible in Yelp profiles under the ""More business info"" section of all applicable entries.  Other attributes in this section denote whether the business accepts credit cards or has available parking.  Austin book store adds feature  One Austin, Texas-based bitcoin merchant was quick to embrace the feature, as he said he had long lobbied for Yelp to promote bitcoin.  Harlan Dietrich, owner of Brave New Books, has been accepting bitcoin for 20 months, but only more recently started using Yelp. Dietrich said that about a year ago he told the company he would refrain from getting a business account until Yelp accepted bitcoin, though he did create an account before this most recent announcement.  He expressed hope his initial holdout had an influence on this latest update, saying:  ""I think I did plant a seed somewhere in the office.""  From the perspective of the ecosystem, Dietrich said he is happy that Yelp has introduced the new attribute, as it is likely to be seen by the platform's tech-friendly users.  He added:  ""I think it's great that we're specifically targeting [early tech adopters] through a service like Yelp.""  'Buzz about bitcoin'  Yelp's blog post also came with some additional information for those who may be unfamiliar about bitcoin.  The company, which has a market capitalization of nearly $4bn, lauded bitcoin as a ""fast, secure and low-cost digital payments"" tool that enables businesses to conduct transactions without storing sensitive user data.  Added the company:  ""We’re hopeful the introduction of the Bitcoin attribute will provide yet another way for consumers to connect with great local businesses.""

42377175,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfep,1398711040,US Government Sells Silk Road User's Seized Bitcoins for $3 Million,"A Netherlands-based user of the now-defunct online black market Silk Road has plead guilty to a federal drug conspiracy charge.  Cornelis Jan Slomp admitted to importing controlled substances into the US and distributing 104kg of MDMA, 566,000 ecstasy pills and 4kg of cocaine, among other substances, globally from March 2012 to August 2013.  Slomp was arrested at the Miami International Airport in late August of last year, when he allegedly sought to meet with business partners who were looking to purchases his Silk Road operations and customers.  Gary Hartwig, special agent-in-charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Chicago, called Slomp a ""prolific vendor on Silk Road"" and went on to issue a stern warning to potential wrongdoers following in his footsteps.  Said Hartwig:  ""Those who mistakenly believe the anonymity of the Internet - even on the Deep Web - shields them from scrutiny are finding out they can’t evade detection in cyberspace.""  However, perhaps most interesting about the story is that the government has already sold more than $3m in the proceeds from Slomps' crimes, Assistant US Attorney Randall Samborn told CoinDesk, though he declined to offer any further specifics about the sale.  If convicted, Slomp faces up to 40 years in prison and a maximum fine of $5m.  More details  Court documents suggest that Slomp, who used the vendor names 'UnderGroundSyndicate' and 'BTCMaster', conducted more than 10,000 transactions on the black market website, earning 385,000 BTC in the process.  The investigation against Slomp began as far back as April 2012, when US Customs and Border Protection officers in Chicago seized an envelope containing MDMA.  As a result of the ensuing investigation, during which 100 similar envelopes were discovered, Slomp was eventually determined to be the individual mailing the illegal substances.  More details  US and Dutch law enforcement officials have been among the more active international groups at coordinating the arrest of bitcoin-based black market users.  Earlier this January, a 25-year-old US citizen was arrested after allegedly mailing a semi-automatic pistol to Dutch Law enforcement officials.  Slomp is among the first to plead guilty to charges in such cases. Most notably, alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht pleaded not guilty to charges against him this February.

42377178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfhL,1398708746,Problems Plague KnCMiner As Broken 'Super Jupiters' Arrive,"Buyers of digital currency mining hardware developer KnCMiner’s modified Jupiter mining product are reporting serious problems with shipments.  The company originally offered the 'Super Jupiter' as a replacement for customers that didn't want to wait to receive the company's next-generation Neptune line of miners.  Disgruntled customers took to the company’s forum to voice their frustrations, with some reporting what appeared to be broken or incorrectly constructed components, including fans and heat sinks. Others said that some of the ASICs arrived malfunctioning or simply not working.  In response, the company has publicly apologized and announced that it will issue replacement cards to affected buyers.  Said the company in a 28th April blog post:  “So last week we really messed up. We sent out products to our customers which arrived broken, damaged and quite frankly unusable.”  The company went on to outline its next steps, which include a rush order for new cards and the production of an assembly video to assist buyers in fixing their Jupiter units. Additionally, KnCMiner is not requesting that the modified Jupiters be returned.  KnCMiner said:  “We will simply assume that every card was damaged in shipment even if it arrived undamaged. We will send out to every customer who had a 3TH Jupiter or several already arrive, enough cards to replace their entire collection.”  Problematic products  According to KnCMiner, the issue lies in substandard shipping practices during transit. Rough handling may have exacerbated problems with the design that many forum users said was flawed to begin with.  In a series of forum posts, users argued that the interior hard foam inside the ASIC case failed to provide adequate clamping. Another forum member suggested that plastic plugs holding some of the components in place were insufficient for normal operation.  One member on the Bitcoin Talk forum shared pictures of his modified Jupiter rig. The photos show that the thermal paste applied to the ASIC heatsinks had failed. In its statement, the company made no mention of problems with improperly applied heatsinks or other non-card components.  Issues in broader mining ecosystem  KnCMiner is not the only mining product manufacturer that has run into recent problems.  Butterfly Labs has issued a notice saying that it had delayed its 28nm Monarch mining ASIC until April, citing problems with some of the product’s components. At the time, the company said that the delay would last for approximately four weeks.  There aren’t just problems in the hardware sector of the mining world, however.  Last week, Google pulled five apps from its Google Play store after revelations that mining malware had been disguised as downloadable wallpaper apps.

42374526,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCnx,1398701290,Online Beer Platform Honest Brew Will Mail Ale for Bitcoin,"UK-based online beer platform Honest Brew has added bitcoin to its list of payment methods.  The company specialises in craft beers from its own and guest breweries – including quirky labels like Weird Beard, BrewDog and Pressure Drop – and is now very likely the first online alcohol merchant to sell directly to the bitcoin-wielding public.  Andrew Reeve, Honest Brew's CEO, said:  “As the first online platform [for alcoholic products] to offer payment by bitcoin, we are hoping the community gets behind it.""  Heady brew  Honest Brew was started up in London by Reeve, a New Zealander who had long been a fan of both home-brewed beer and bitcoin.  In 2013, Reeve graduated to commercial-scale brewing at Late Knights Brewery in South London, after which he and his small team ""brewed with hops flown in from New Zealand, dabbled in chilli and were even convinced [...] to do a brew with woodlice"".  More recently, marrying a love of technology and beer, Honest Brew set up its online merchant platform to allow its wares to be sampled by a wider audience across the UK and Europe.  The company's decision to accept bitcoin payments was down to this affinity for technology and an appreciation of the bitcoin community.  Said Reeve:  ""Our goal is to make it easy for people to enjoy great craft beer. Bitcoin is an easy way for people to pay and it's a near-direct transaction. This fits what we are trying to achieve at Honest brew, so it makes perfect sense to accept bitcoin.""     ""We've followed bitcoin since the beginning,"" he continued. ""It wasn't until our digital designer was recently offered freelance work paid in bitcoin that we really considered it for Honest Brew [...] We love the community that sits behind bitcoin and the passion they have to bring bitcoin into the mainstream market. As a tech-focused company we wanted to get behind this.”  Bitcoin transactions from the Honest Brew site are processed by the BitPay platform ""giving people security and peace of mind"", Reeve added.  Just the tonic  While Honest Brew may be the first beer merchant to accept bitcoin online, a number of pubs and bars are now accepting bitcoin over the counter, including licensed premises in the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia.  As Honest Brew's move into cryptocurrency indicates, larger alcohol retailers are also now starting to take notice of the growing bitcoin market, and only last month, the London Distillery Company started taking the digital currency for its gin products.  When considering the move into digital currency payments, Reeve said he was not deterred by the bad press and scare stories that have plagued bitcoin in recent months:  ""Bitcoin is still very new and you are bound to get some bad press. In general the community is overwhelmingly positive and we are excited to help grow it further.""  Of course, there was one very important question left to ask Reeve: just what does woodlice beer taste like?  ""It was a beer lead by Master Brewer Stuart Howe,"" he said. ""It was a very small run and tasted great (no notes of 'land shrimps'). I don't think it's one you will be finding on the platform anytime soon. You had to be there for that one.""

42377173,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfcJ,1398696416,"Regulators in Maryland, Nevada and Canada Weigh in on Bitcoin Debate","Two US states have issued new advisories and warnings on bitcoin, while Canada's tax authority has outlined its position on revenue from the cryptocurrency.  The Nevada Department of Business and Industry, Financial Institutions Division, has issued consumer and investor guidance on digital currencies. Maryland’s Department of Labour, Licensing and Regulation issued a warning on the risks associated with digital currencies, while Canada’s tax authority issued more guidance on bitcoin activities and transactions.  Of the three, the Canadian guidance is the most likely to have a direct and immediate effect on some members of the bitcoin community. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) published a new document outlining its position on digital currencies and responding to questions raised back in March.  Canada taxman to evaluate on case-by-case basis  CRA’s document 2014-0525191E5 is dated 28th March, but it appears to have been made public just recently. The document points out the difference between personal and business activities, citing previous precedents ruled on by the Supreme Court of Canada.  In essence, it means Canada will view the matter subjectively, on a case by case basis. When authorities deem the activities were undertaken for profit, the taxpayer’s income will be taxed with reference to the taxpayer’s inventory at the end of the year. The value of inventory will be based on fair market value, although alternative methods could be applicable in some situations.  Eventual losses through theft or embezzlement will be deductible if they are caused by inherent risks rather than negligence.  Barter transactions are allowed, but the CRA states that the value of goods or services obtained by bartering digital currencies must be included into the taxpayer’s income, provided they are business related. Gifts will not be subject to income tax, but this does not apply to voluntary payments from an employer, reports Canadian tax litigation.  Bitcoin too risky for Las Vegas  Nevada’s guidance is more or less in line with what we have seen from various national regulators over the past six months.  The Nevada Financial Institutions Divisionhttp://www.fid.state.nv.us/GuidanceVirtualCurrency.pdf points out that bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and they are not backed by any central bank or governmental authority. All consumers are urged to consider a range of risks associated with digital currencies, including volatility, risk of theft, lack of consumer protection, potential tax implications or the use of digital currencies for illicit activities.  Nevada is calling on consumers to do their homework:  “Consumers considering the use of virtual currencies should research any company offering services related to virtual currencies. This includes exchanges, platforms, administrators, sellers, or ATMs.”  There is nothing earth shattering in Nevada’s guidance, as we have already seen plenty of similar warnings and the vast majority of crypto users are already familiar with the risks.  Maryland echoes Nevada guidance  The Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation has issued a similarly worded warning. Like their counterparts in Nevada, Maryland regulators are urging regulators to do their ‘homework’ and be aware of the risks associated with digital currencies, including volatility, theft, criminal activities and so on.  The advisory points out:  “State and federal regulators are evaluating and developing approaches to regulating virtual currencies and companies that deal in virtual currencies. Any company that offers to exchange, administer, or maintain virtual currencies may be subject to state regulation and licensing, as well as federal regulation. CURRENTLY, MARYLAND DOES NOT REGULATE VIRTUAL CURRENCIES.”  Furthermore, the regulator points out services that engage in converting, buying, selling or transmitting digital currencies must be registered as a money services business (MSB).  Need help with your ‘homework’?  Although regulation is still very controversial in the bitcoin community, these latest notices shouldn't be.  State regulators are taking a neutral approach and their principal goal appears to be education – hence all the homework references. Consumers are encouraged to familiarise themselves with digital currencies and regulations that may apply to their investments.  The notices include several resources that could be beneficial to novice investors as well as seasoned bitcoiners. These include lists of securities regulators and relevant regulatory notices.  For example, FinCEN can be used to ascertain whether or not a bitcoin operator has an MSB license. It also lists of out-of-state licensed money transmitters whose licenses have expired.  Since neither state currently regulates digital currencies, the regulators have to rely on the existing (and somewhat inadequate) framework. However, they can attempt to educate the public and help consumers make an informed choice.

Quickly a fund-raising scheme was set up on reddit and the DOGE started rolling in – with one donator, Moolah founder Alex Green, accidentally giving ten times what he had planned.  Since the campaign kicked off, around 68 million dogecoins have been donated to support Wise.  Now pictures have been released of the completed Ford Fusion, which has 'DOGECOIN' emblazoned on front and sides, as well as the altcoin's shiba inu dog logo to win over the hearts of US racegoers.  There's even a rocket behind the rear wheel next to the doge catchphrase 'to the moon!'.  Altruistic leaning  The dogecoin community has built somewhat of a reputation for unusual fundraisers, with help given to both Indian and Jamaican Olympians to attend the Sochi Winter Olympics earlier this year. On a more serious note, cash was also raised for a drought-stricken region of Kenya for new water wells.  More recently, an ethical coffee shop and creative space received a helping hand from Manchester’s small dogecoin community in the UK, and an anonymous Banksy-like character known as 'Hood' has been giving away thousands of dollars-worth of dogecoin to address social injustice in California.  As well as providing Wise with much needed cash, the press garnered by the latest campaign and the stunning exterior design of the race car look likely to gain dogecoin a large new audience when it takes to the track at Talladega on 4th May.

The Silicon Valley event was held at Draper University in San Mateo, California, close to the Boost VC offices. Participating in the event cost entrants $25-worth of BTC per person.  A total of 12 projects were presented, after which judging was scored and winners for best ideas were announced.  Boost VC co-founder Brayton Williams, who helped to run the hackathon, seemed impressed by the number of inventive ideas:  “It was good. A lot of the stuff, I didn’t even know people were working on.”  The rules  The hackathon started on Friday, and ended Sunday afternoon, with participants being allowed to hack for 24 hours at the location over the weekend.  Twelve projects, mostly made up of teams, then pitched ideas for five minutes each.  A Q&A session for each idea followed from the judges, consisting of Boost VC’s Ross McKelvie, Boost CEO Adam Draper, Avish Bhama from Vaurum, Dan Held of Blockchain and Brian Armstrong from Coinbase.  The judges then scored each idea based on three criteria on a 100-point scale: idea (25 points), product (25 points) and business plan (50 points).  The winners  First: Coinviz,a financial visualizer for block chain transactions. Co-founder: Brian Bloomer.  Boost's Adam Draper said during the group’s presentation that:  “I’m assuming you had to go through a lot of data in order to get this.”  Second: Coindash, which plans to build a way to hedge bitcoin investments in order to reduce volatility risk.  Coinbase’s Brain Armstrong remarked:  “We would use something like this.”  Third: Bitbook.ie, a betting platform that offered spread bets and money line bets.  The prizes were:  1st: 5 BTC and three months of office space at Boost VC  2nd: 2 BTC and two months of office space  3rd: 1 BTC and one month of office space  Interesting ideas in 48 hours  Brian Bloomer and Shaun Giudici, co-founders of winning idea Coinviz, said that they plan to continue pursing their first-place concept:  “We're very excited with the insights we drew this weekend, but we've only scratched the surface – there are many more visualizations we're going to explore.”  All of the ideas that were worked through for the 48 hours that made up the weekend seemed new, or at least were a twist on an existing idea.  Some of other interesting ideas included:  Coinpapa: uses Apple’s Passbook app, normally for coupons and tickets, as a bitcoin payment method.  Photon: a web-based biometric authentication system that uses a device camera to scan an iris.  Coinmail: integrating addresses and digital opt-in linking email systems to bitcoin technologies.  Marco Montes Neri, who worked on the three-person team that came up with Coinmail, said that the group had to move quickly in order to complete something by the end of Sunday at the 3.30pm deadline:  “We decided in the first day, [with] a couple of hours of brainstorming.”  Boost VC Summer Session  Applications for Boost’s Summer session are currently open. The deadline to apply is June 1, with the program commencing on 27th July.  Boost CEO Adam Draper told CoinDesk he expects to have 10 bitcoin companies in the summer class, part of his effort to incubate 100 bitcoin companies over the next three years.

42377177,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfib,1398656705,Ohio Bans Bitcoin for Alcohol Sales,"The State of Ohio has effectively banned the use of bitcoin for alcohol sales, becoming the first government in the US to take such explicit action.  The decision reportedly came in response to a local journalist's query to the Ohio Department of Public Safety, after that reporter wrote about the Bitcoin Boulevard US project in Cleveland's Cedar & Lee district.  The query asked if accepting bitcoin could jeopardize local liquor licences in any way. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for issuing liquor licences in the state.  Apparently, the answer is 'yes'.  Money and currency  Cleveland.com reported that Eric Wolf, agent-in-charge with the Ohio Investigative Unit of the Ohio Department of Public Safety, said that ""because bitcoin's value fluctuates so much, it is more like a commodity and 'not recognized as legal currency.'""  Ohio's Liquor Control Law under Chapter 4301 expressly mentions 'payment of money' in its rules governing the provision of alcohol. It does not use the word 'currency'. This again raises questions about the exact definition of 'money' versus 'official legal currency'. The state's law is quite specific in the way it defines various forms of alcoholic drinks.  This means using anything other than US dollars to buy alcohol in Ohio is prohibited.  Trying to reach out  Some alcohol-selling members of Bitcoin Boulevard US, which announced its project just last week, had already expressed a desire to communicate with authorities about the project and make their positions clear.  The campaign had already reached out to other relevant regulators. The Ohio Liquor Control legal board sent a 'no stance' reply and the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Trade Bureau (TTB) also reportedly raised no objections.  Bitcoin Boulevard US  is due to be America's first such scheme – where a group of merchants in one local area all opt to accept bitcoin.  Organizer Nikhil Chand posted his regrets on reddit yesterday, saying the agencies the campaign contacted had all been ""intrigued"" by bitcoin and listened to explanations.  ""I personally think their conclusion is unfortunate, and is indicative of the type of senseless obstructionism small businesses face from many antiquated and complicated laws and regulations,"" he wrote.  ""But, it makes for an interesting new chapter to the bitcoin story and an interesting topic to present at our launch event. I fear this will set a precedent for other areas of the US as bitcoin continues adoption and so I plan to do whatever I can to keep this issue alive.""
