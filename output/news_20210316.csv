42433956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6jRh,1615927266,How the Federal Reserve Might Try to Calm Inflation Fears This Week,"When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell steps up to the podium at a virtual press conference on Wednesday to discuss the U.S. central bank’s latest thinking on monetary policy, he’ll be speaking straight to Wall Street.      Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes have surged to about 1.6%, close to a one-year high, in anticipation of faster economic growth as the coronavirus vaccine rollout proceeds. Not only have some $5 trillion in economic stimulus packages swelled the U.S. government’s borrowing to record levels, investors are demanding higher returns from Treasury bonds as compensation for the risk of inflation.      Wall Street analysts are worried the higher bond yields might lead to a correction in prices for riskier assets, from stocks to bitcoin. So the question is whether Powell will allow bond yields to keep rising or if the Fed will step in to ward off any unwanted market reaction. Options range from tightening monetary policy to address the underlying inflation risk, or deploying the central bank’s money-printing machine in new ways to keep yields from rising.      “The markets don’t trust the Fed,” Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and current senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute. “It will be a huge test of the Fed into this year and next year. It’s the trickiest monetary policy since the Volcker Rule” deliberations on bank risk-taking that followed the 2008 financial crisis.      Fed officials have used recent speeches to float or tout the possibility of using experimental monetary policies, using names like “Operation Twist” and “yield curve control.”      It’s unlikely Powell will announce any new policy Wednesday, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises.      “It could be more moderate,” Kelly said. Fed officials could ""add language to the statement saying that they’re prepared to use any tools necessary.”      It’s also unlikely the Fed would employ never-before-used monetary policy tools before increasing the size of asset purchases that are already in effect, Sahm said.      For most of the past year the Fed has been buying some $120 billion a month of U.S. Treasury bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy by keeping down yields. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from their yields, so the extra purchasing volume from the Fed helps to push down the yields, which in turn helps keeps interest rates low on everything from business loans to 30-year home mortgages.      The Fed might shift some its Treasury purchases to more heavily weight its bond purchases toward longer-term maturities, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for Oxford Economics.      “As of December, when I calculated the average maturity of [the Fed's] purchases, it was 7.4 years,” Bostjancic said. “So they could start to shift that outward towards 10-year, 20-year, 30-year bond purchases.”      Oxford Economics revised its GDP forecast for the U.S. from 3.2% this year to 7%, projecting the U.S. would beat China in economic growth, Bostjancic added.      Powell might have to address how prices and markets might react as the economy reheats when people start getting out and about, and when jobs are created, increasing competition for workers and driving up wages.      According to Sahm, these “pent-up demand” narratives are being “overplayed” by market commentators who see an elevated inflation risk.      She expects Federal Reserve officials’ median estimates for future inflation – contained in a revised “Summary of Economics Projections” expected to be published Wednesday – will likely come in above 2% but well below 3%.      That’s far from the double-digit inflation levels witnessed in the late 1960s and early 1970s of which some analysts have warned.      The Fed has ""commented that certain parts of the market are risky and have elevated valuation such as the equity market and also commercial real estate,” Bostjancic said. “I think [the central bank] wouldn't target that. They're not going to try to [target] cryptocurrencies. They probably wouldn't mind, though, if we had a moderate rise in long-term [bond] rates that was somewhat of a natural break for some of these riskier assets.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/16/how-the-federal-reserve-might-try-to-calm-inflation-fears-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623d17ed8c49e10d16cd8d4f060a61fd9173ab9e-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sliding 1.73% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,350.37-$56,988.34 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin traded in a narrowed range as Monday's sell-off appeared to subside and prices settled in the mid-$50,000 range for the most of Tuesday.      Monday’s decline resulted in some $1.6 billion in derivatives bets being liquidated, second only to the record level that took place on Feb. 22, according to Norwegian blockchain analytics firm Arcane Research.      Read More: Bitcoin Eyes Bull Revival as Dip Below $54K Wipes Out Millions More in Leverage      “But on Feb. 22, the relative price decline in bitcoin was larger than on this Monday.” Arcane wrote Tuesday in its weekly newsletter. “The extreme liquidation levels this Monday then suggests that this time around even more traders applied higher degrees of leverage in their trades.”      Bitcoin found strong support at $54,000, blockchain data shows.      Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which charts bitcoins based on the price at which they were last moved, indicates that 865,000 BTC were moved around the $54,000 to $58,000 range as of March 15, according to Arcane.      Read More: Bitcoin Holds Short-Term Support at $54K, Resistance Seen at $58K: Technical Analysis      At the same time, the all-time high price above $61,000 reached on Saturday appears to have alleviated some chart-following analysts' concerns the market might be forming a “double top.”      Double tops are an extremely bearish price chart pattern. After bitcoin pushed out new all-time highs in January and February, traders fretted over the possibility of a double top then, too, according to Annabelle Huang, partner at Hong Kong-based market maker Amber Group.      “The weekend breakthrough has lifted some of those pressures,” Huang said.    Ether seeks support below $1,300, fails to reach a new high    Ether (ETH) was down Tuesday, trading around $1,784.90 and sliding 0.28% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      “Ether is currently struggling to push higher,” Arcane Research wrote. “Investors are getting impatient as the second-largest cryptocurrency hasn’t been able to surpass its all-time high from Feb. 20, while bitcoin has continued to new highs.”      Ether’s spot trading volume also has been flat, according to data from eight major spot crypto exchanges CoinDesk tracks.      The trading volume was nearly $3 billion on Feb. 20, when ether broke above $2,000 for the first time, followed by several volatile days with daily trading volume as high as around $5.4 billion. Yet, when ether was trying to eke out a new all-time high on March 13, trading volume was only about $1.6 billion.      By using the DeMarker Indicator, a charting tool that’s used to measure the demand of the underlying asset, ether “is flashing a short-term ‘sell’ signal,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies.      “A two-week consolidation phase appears likely, at the minimum,” Stockton said. And the “recent volatility has left the first key support for ether back below $1,300, dictating extra attention to risk management.”      Cardano, meanwhile, which aspires to rival Ethereum as a “smart-contract” blockchain, saw a double-digit percentage gain in the past 24 hours after the cryptocurrency exchangeCoinbase Pro announced that it would support trading in the token.

In theory, according to the stock-to-flow model, the bitcoin price should rise as the issuance rate declines.

The MVRV ratio is a measure of bitcoin’s market value relative to its realized value. The gauge represents the difference between the cryptocurrency's current price and the average price at which bitcoins were acquired.

Graham Ivan Clark, who was 17 at the time, was charged as a “youthful offender” for hacking into Twitter and taking control of the accounts, a state judge said during a virtual hearing Tuesday. Clark can serve some of his sentence at a boot camp. He will receive credit for serving 239 days in prison to date.      Clark was arrested with two alleged co-conspirators last year after the July Twitter hack, in which over 100 high-profile accounts were taken over, including CoinDesk’s. The hijacked accounts tweeted links to a cryptocurrency scam, netting the perpetrators about $120,000 at the time. Clark initially pleaded “not guilty.”      The Tampa Bay Times first reported Clark would plead guilty on Tuesday morning.      “The factual basis for each of these counts relate to the criminal, fraudulent takeover of many Twitter accounts, and then using this fraudulent takeover to convince their victims to send cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency accounts under the control of the perpetrators,” state prosecutor Derrell Dirks said during the hearing Tuesday.      Prosecutors charged Clark with 30 different felony counts, including organized fraud, several counts of communications fraud, fraudulent use of personal information and accessing a computer without authority.      During the hearing, Clark and his attorney, David Weisbrod, affirmed that all of the stolen cryptocurrencies had been turned over to officials for the purposes of restitution.      During his probation, Clark has agreed to unannounced, unlimited searches and will provide unlimited access to his electronic devices to those supervising his probation, including Florida law enforcement officials.

Gasparino said Tuesday that Kraken executives are mulling either a tie-up with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) or a more traditional initial public offering (IPO).  No major crypto exchange has gone public in the U.S. just yet, but that should soon change as Coinbase is barreling toward a direct listing and eToro announced it's merging with a SPAC Tuesday.  With no bitcoin ETF in sight and crypto service companies booming, Wall Street investors may be eager to capture whatever slice of exchanges they can to ride the wave of a burgeoning asset class.  The multi-pronged crypto brokerage, which also holds a national banking charter, is one of crypto space’s biggest unicorns and has reportedly sought a $10 billion valuation in private equity deals.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell has previously hinted his interest in going public in 2022, but only at the right price. He said $10 billion is too low. For context, Coinbase, a direct competitor, has an expected valuation of $100 billion and eToro weighs in at $9.6 billion.  Contacted by CoinDesk, a Kraken spokesperson confirmed that while the exchange might consider a public offering next year, any such offering would happen through a direct listing and not through a SPAC as the company is ""too big"" for that.

42406066,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerpQg,1615918507,"$80M Deal Gone Wrong: Alameda Research, Reef Finance Spar Over Unloaded Tokens","An $80 million deal between a rising decentralized finance (DeFi) project and a juggernaut crypto investment firm unraveled Monday, with both projects pointing fingers and wagging chins.      Reef Finance, a multi-chain liquidity provider, appeared to reverse course on an over-the-counter (OTC) deal for its REEF tokens halfway through due to “doubts around Alameda’s long-term interest in being a strategic investor,” the startup said in a Monday blog post.      Reef had offered a 20% discount on the tokens to promote “synergies” between Serum and Solana – two projects in which Alameda is heavily invested. The dispute turned into a Twitter flame war, however, after a large portion of that initial token set was immediately transferred to Binance, presumably to be sold.      With the conflict, crypto plebs got a behind-the-scenes glimpse at an over-the-counter deal between one of crypto's most aggressive trading desks and yet another young DeFi team trying to make it big.      “For the first $20M tranche, we followed the movement of the sold [REEF] tokens and immediately saw that the tokens we had just transferred to Alameda were being offloaded on the Binance exchange,” Reef wrote in its blog post. “We could not understand why Alameda, our long-term strategic investor, would offload their tokens immediately after purchase to Binance.”      In contention is the existence of a vesting period for the tokens. Reef CEO Denko Mancheski told CoinDesk in an email that an immediate token flip was “definitely not what was supposed to happen.” Alameda, on the other hand, says there was no agreed-upon vesting period. Now the whole ordeal is public, with legal threats mounting. Alameda directed CoinDesk to its blog post when reached for comment.    High-stakes OTC    Alameda agreed to purchase 2.7 billion REEF tokens worth an estimated $80 million on March 8, according to public documents. The purchase was set to be broken into two parts: One $20 million transaction followed by a press announcement, and then a second $60 million transaction.      However, both sides now dispute if the second transaction was ever supposed to occur under the verbal agreements (occurring on messaging app Telegram) made prior to the trade.      Mancheski told CoinDesk, “There was literally no legal agreement/contract (or any kind of paperwork whatsoever).”      “They portray themselves as a reputable VC fund while in reality they just manipulate projects/retail with their ‘reputation,’” Mancheski said of Alameda, which is helmed by FTX CEO and breakout crypto star Sam Bankman-Fried.    Read more: Alameda Research Pumps $20M Into Cross-Chain DeFi Platform Reef Finance    Alameda said in its Monday blog post the Reef team “initially agreed to an [$80 million] trade and locked in the price for the entire size. After settling the first tranche, Reef reneged and refused to settle the following tranches.”      Those claims were preceded by a tweet from Alameda Research trader Sam Trabucco, who said Reef “went to the press to brag” over the initial transaction and then “reneged on the OTC trade.”      Indeed, Reef did issue a press release on the initial $20 million purchase, as reported by CoinDesk and others. The Alameda blog post published Monday after Trabucco’s tweet makes it clear Alameda knew in advance about the press release.      Regardless, the tokens remain at issue.      Trabucco and Alameda agreed to take the remainder of the tokens under a vesting period as offered by Mancheski in a counter offer, with the caveat that the tokens would be transferred to Alameda. When Mancheski declined moving funds to Alameda, the dispute went public.    Next steps    According to documents obtained by CoinDesk, Alameda is considering legal action against Reef.      “I don’t really need to threaten here,” Alameda Head of OTC Ryan Salame said in a chat with Mancheski seen by CoinDesk. “We’re 100% in the right here.”      Alameda partner exchange FTX also threatened to delist REEF for conducting a “rugpull” in a now-deleted tweet. Some REEF contracts do remain on FTX as of press time.    Read more: FTX in Talks to Sponsor Miami Heat’s NBA Arena: Report    Mancheski, on the other hand, told CoinDesk Reef has petitioned Binance to reveal its REEF trade book in order to prove Alameda pushed the REEF token’s price down.      “Basically we will be requesting Binance to give their trading log because we believe that they fulfilled their threat and dumped the price – which triggered liquidations and people lost a lot of money,” he said.

42406067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerpRf,1615913999,The Node: 'Green' Bitcoin Is the Price of Mass Adoption,"Kevin O’Leary appeared on CoinDesk TV yesterday to deliver a bombshell: Before Wall Street goes all-in on bitcoin, he said, it needs to know how BTC is being mined.      The “Shark Tank” star and chairman of O’Shares ETFs said institutions want to invest in BTC but they have environmental issues. They’re leery, as it were, of operations driven by coal or other climate-unfriendly technology. And they want transparency around origin.    This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly known as Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    O’Leary even compared some BTC to “blood diamonds,” suggesting that miners who want to be on the right side of history need to become more efficient.      This raises a lot of big questions, including whether BTC can remain fungible, or whether we might see a split between provably “clean” coins and coins with uncertain provenance.      The reactions on Twitter to O’Leary’s comments were furious.      Commenters speculated O’Leary was trying to drive down the BTC price so Wall Street could buy more on the cheap. They accused him of hypocrisy. (Doesn’t Wall Street invest in gold and oil and other noxious stuff?) They scoffed, “Who cares about Wall Street?”      Others shrugged and said they’d heard it all before.      And it is true that this is a new version of an old narrative. As my colleague Marc Hochstein wrote, “For years, there has been talk of newly mined, ‘virgin’ bitcoins fetching a premium over units that have passed through multiple wallets.” That alleged coin discrimination had to do with legal and regulatory rather than environmental concerns.      Meanwhile, the “bitcoin energy debate” has been one of crypto’s fiercest (which is saying something).      On one side are people who complain (somewhat erroneously) that bitcoin’s energy consumption is the size of a small country and who can’t understand why a climate-threatened world needs energy-intensive peer-to-peer money.      On the other, people say that 1) bitcoin’s mining is getting cleaner, 2) that fiat uses plenty of energy too, and 3) that, why don’t we ever talk about the energy consumption of, say, America’s wars and Christmas lights?      To me, O’Leary’s comments point to two reckonings.      One, as much as Bitcoiners want to dismiss the energy/environment debate, it’s not going away. There are simply too many people frightened about climate change to allow BTC a free pass on these questions. The community needs to account for its footprint the same way every industry (more or less) has to these days. That’s just modern business.      And two, well, the energy debate actually doesn’t matter. It’s not important if you think the critics are wrong or hypocritical. It only matters that the people who matter on Wall Street take this seriously.      At bottom, this is a question less about the environment and more about institutionalization. Large companies are bound by sustainability and ESG committees. They have stakeholders and rules and processes to follow. And, these days, environmental impact is a material liability. They need to prove they’re clean.      Bitcoiners may not like it. But ""greener"" bitcoin may be the price of admission to mainstream markets.

Lukashenko said the government, the National Control Committee and the country's central bank should ""clarify some regulatory norms and establish necessary control"" over crypto usage in Belarus, Belarusian news agency Belta reported. The country should also establish a special governmental body to control the development of digital economy, using China's regulatory practices as an example, Lukashenko said.      The discussion followed the recent use of bitcoin as a tool for dissidents in Belarus.      Cryptocurrencies have been regulated in Belarus since 2017, and there is one locally registered crypto exchange, Currency.com.      Lukashenko added there haven't been any notable cases of criminal usage of crypto in Belarus, but ""there have been new rules established in the world recently to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing and any encouragement of criminal activities"" using crypto, Lukashenko said.      Read also: After Tumultuous Election, Belarus Goes Offline      In response, Deputy Prime Minister Nickolay Snopkov suggested the country's government-backed IT incubator, the Belarus Hi-Tech Park, should be tasked with supervising the nation's cryptocurrency services.      The Hi-Tech Park, an incubator offering tax benefits for IT startups in Belarus, has recently became a hotbed of protest after Lukashenko won the presidential election in August, provoking nationwide protests that are continue. Many IT entrepreneurs took part in the protests, calling for Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus for more than two decades, to quit. Many have had to leave the country, including the founder of the Hi-Tech Park and Lukashenko opponent Valery Tsepkalo.

BYSOL, a nonprofit of Belarusian IT entrepreneurs, has distributed over 2 million euros in bitcoin (or more than $2.8 million) to people who lost their jobs as a result of their protest activities or quit their government jobs in protest. BYSOL transferred $1,500 grants to verified applicants for help, using bitcoin as a way to circumvent the financial surveillance.      Eugene Romanenko, Belarusian crypto expert, believes Lukashenko understands the limits crypto puts on his power: ""Apparently, he was briefed that the government can't financially control Belarusians because of cryptocurrencies, but he wasn't told that this technology can't be destroyed.""

""Economically, Lukashenko is totally dependent on [Russia's president, and Lukashenko's largest creditor, Vladimir] Putin, in everything but the digital tech,"" he added.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday, Beauty in the Streets is working with blockchain platform Enjin to enable performing artists and dancers to create non-fungible token (NFT)-based “emotes” (think animated emojis).      The NFTs represent signature moves and mannerisms of various performers which, in turn, can then be sold to fans via online stores and live shows and used as emotes within participating video games and apps.      The company’s first NFT is a signature dance move from founder Cjaiilon Andrade, aka Snap Boogie, called “Speedy Walkovers.” Token holders are able to use the NFT to perform the move in a 3D PC and VR game called AlterVerse.      “NFTs are turning everything into a market, even human movement,” said Simon Kertonegoro, vice president of developer success at Enjin. “By taking memorable moments and tokenizing them as emotes, the joy and awe we experience in the real world will echo across the digital space.”      See also: NFT Mania Fits With ‘Crippling Inflation’ Fear, but Don’t Call It a Bubble      Kertonegoro added that despite speculation about whether NFTs are a bubble, the initiative demonstrates how artists can “create value” by adding their own content to games and apps.

42406078,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerpaW,1615906800,State of Crypto: NYDFS Hackathon Is 'Testament' to Crypto's Growth,"Crypto is growing up. Government regulators are increasingly asking for industry’s help rather than just implementing rules. A two-week-long event by NYDFS appears to be evidence of this trend.    You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  NYDFS’ extended hackathon  The narrative    The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) wants to be better at regulating crypto companies – and it’s asking for the crypto industry’s help.      The financial regulator organized a techsprint (a sort of extended hackathon with participation by both industry and regulators) over the first two weeks of March. The NYDFS, along with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR), invited industry participants to help it improve how it oversees regulated virtual currency businesses.    Why it matters    NYDFS is the best-known state regulator in the crypto scene, dating back to the controversial BitLicense it introduced over five years ago. Current Superintendent Linda Lacewell has spoken about updating regulations since starting her term at the agency in 2019, which capped off with a reformation of the landmark regulatory regime last year. The techsprint could be a significant step in how the regulator continues supervising the industry, drawing from industry expertise and not just its own research. It could also send a signal to other regulators and companies in the U.S., detailing one way that digital assets regulation can evolve in future.      “The purpose of the techsprint is really to help DFS become the regulator of the future,” an official familiar with the effort told CoinDesk.    Breaking it down    On Demo Day, the last day of the techsprint, teams presented their solutions to the regulator’s proposed problems, which were:    How can DFS achieve real-time or more frequent access to company financial data from virtual currency licensees and receive early warning signs of financial risks to the companies or their customers?  How can DFS obtain real-time transaction data from its licensees and automatically analyze the data to safeguard against illicit financing risks?  How can DFS use tools such as natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify risks by processing and analyzing supervisory reports that are submitted by licensees in a wide range of formats?  How can DFS use technology to facilitate information-sharing among licensees to help them more quickly identify and stop scams, ransomware strikes, and other criminal enterprises that put licensees and their customers at risk?    These problem statements were developed with industry input, according to the agency.      The agency official told CoinDesk that at present most regulatory reporting occurs on a quarterly basis rather than in real time. NYDFS believes it needs better access to data to properly monitor risk.      The teams, composed of both industry participants and regulatory representatives, worked on building technology solutions to these questions during the techsprint.      “There’s nothing more instructive than the government being able to speak from the perspective of industry,” Lacewell said after the presentations.      She cited recent major banks and financial firms moving into the industry, including Fidelity, Bank of New York Mellon and PayPal, in discussing why the regulator is active in the crypto space.      Chen Arad, the chief operating officer of Solidus Labs and a participant in the techsprint, said blockchain can be complex for regulators and regulations can be complex for developers if they aren’t communicating.      “I really appreciate the fact that DFS had the foresight to come up with this and they reached out to a lot of members of industry, including myself,” he said.      He noted that NYDFS has held roundtable discussions about supervising the crypto industry in the past, some of which looked at what the biggest challenges are for regulators and companies. The most effective use of data for supervision was one such challenge that was raised.      “It was a very intense two weeks but it was just so powerful to see everyone sitting around one table, including the regulators, regulated entities, legal experts, members of industry, trying to bring everyone’s expertise to these issues,” Arad said.      That the techsprint occurred at all is a signal of the evolution of the crypto industry, said Sandra Ro, the CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council and one of the event’s judges. Other judges included Brian Behlendorf, executive director at Hyperledger; Chris Brummer, a law professor at Georgetown University (and rumored future Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair nominee); and Richard Berner, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.      Ro said it was significant that NYDFS is not only looking at how it can parse information it collects, but also how it can integrate technologies like blockchain into its supervisory process.      “I think it is a testament to how far the crypto community has come from an industry standpoint to work with regulators and legislators and various bodies, to solve for critical problems in order for the industry to grow and scale, and become mainstream within regulation and guidelines,” Ro said.    Biden’s rule    The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has advanced the nominations of Gary Gensler and Rohit Chopra out of committee, meaning the full Senate will vote whether to confirm these two individuals as Securities and Exchange Commission chair and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, respectively. Gensler was advanced with a vote of 14-10, while Chopra received a 12-12 vote split on party lines. As far as I know, both are expected to be confirmed.      In other regulatory news, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency remains up for grabs. For a while it looked as if Michael Barr, a former under secretary at the U.S. Treasury Department (and onetime Ripple board member) would receive the nomination for this bank regulator role. American Banker reported last week that he has now been “all but ruled out” after pushback from progressives. University of California Irvine School of Law Professor Mehrsa Baradaran and California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation Commissioner Manny Alvarez are now rumored to be the frontrunners. Both have testified about cryptocurrencies in the past. We’ll talk more about them next week.    Changing of the guard  Elsewhere:  US Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Clarify Crypto Regulations: Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) introduced a bill to create a working group that would evaluate the regulations around crypto, with representatives from industry, academia, investor protection groups and, notably, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Also last week, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) reintroduced his Token Taxonomy Act for a third time.  Former US Senator Joins Binance as Policy Adviser and Government Liaison: Binance has hired former U.S. senator and ambassador to China Maxwell Baucus to help it navigate the U.S. regulatory structure. Which will probably help the exchange because less than 24 hours after announcing its new policy adviser, Bloomberg reported the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is investigating the exchange (though no wrongdoing was alleged).

42406060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerpLl,1615904452,How eToro Got Ready to Go Public,"Ahead of an upcoming public listing announced Tuesday, eToro saw explosive growth at the start of 2021.      Over 2020, eToro grew its revenue 147% year over year, with the crypto trading business accounting for 16% of revenue, said CEO Yoni Assia.      “Obviously we started this year with a bang thanks to the crypto rally,” Assia told CoinDesk in an interview. “In January 2021 we added 1.2 million new registered users to the network versus an average of 440,000 per month in 2020, and a 192,000 monthly average in 2019.”      The merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which elevates eToro’s value to around $9.4 billion, will drive an aggressive expansion plan, said Assia, with “hundreds of positions” to the current 300 staff being added over the coming year.      “Globally, we're very excited about our expansion in the U.S., both the triple-digit growth rate we're seeing right now in the U.S. as well as our expected launch of equity in the U.S.,” he said.    Read more: eToro to Go Public Via Merger With SPAC; Combined Firm to Have $10.4B Value    The firm has made several acquisitions in the crypto space including asset tokenization startup Firmo and Delta, a crypto portfolio tracker application company, both in 2019.      During an investor call Tuesday, eToro said 87% of total revenue in 2020 were generated from the spread of buy and sell prices of assets. The residual revenue were derived from interest income from margin position, currency, conversions and other income, the firm said.      The eToro social investment platform was launched back in 2010, and the firm was one of the earliest to get into cryptocurrency. Before any cryptocurrency was added to the trading platform, Assia began to buy and hold bitcoin, he explained.      “We bought some crypto for our treasury 10 years before Elon Musk for between $5 and $20 back in 2011. Unfortunately, we only bought about $50,000 back then. But that enabled us to become the first regulated brokerage in Europe to offer cryptocurrency trading back in 2013,” he said.      Even assuming all were bought at $20, eToro would have a trove of 2,500 BTC – worth over $138 million at today's prices.      It may be the perfect time for companies that handle cryptocurrency to go public, but eToro was around for the last bull run and the ""winter"" that followed.      The firm said it grew its business significantly during the first crypto rally of 2017-2018 and has extended its equities business, which grew from 11% of revenue in 2017 to 44% of revenue in 2020.      “I think for us, what we learned from the crypto winter, is the importance of diversification,” Assia said. “A significant amount of users joined eToro during a crypto rally in 2017, and many are still active on eToro today in trading both stocks and cryptocurrencies.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/16/how-etoro-got-ready-to-go-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3386f2d8914ef4b3ab6d0a8146dda00dc1398367-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collaboration, Malone’s second in the NFT space, is set to take off on March 18 with a series of NFTs meant to memorialize concert experiences. In a world where attending concerts in person is still out of the question for many, Malone and his manager, Dre London, are hoping NFTs can bring some of the magic back.      The resulting token structure operates much like a colorful artistic Super Bowl ticket of years past, said Alex Shultz of Fyooz. The collectible pieces by crypto artist Fvckrender and others also grant their holders access to exclusive events.      Such perks might involve getting “backstage” or “flying” with Malone to the venue or even playing virtual beer pong with him; once COVID-19 restrictions ease, perhaps even in person. Holders can use their tokens for access now and then perhaps trade them later.    Read more: Social Token App Fyooz Offers Chance to Play Beer Pong With Rap Artist Post Malone    Built atop Fyooz’s social token system, the experiential NFTs add a crypto streak to one-year-old AUX Live, a Netflix-like streaming platform specific to live concerts.      London said AUX Live will also begin accepting payment in Fyooz’s token for fans outside of the U.S. (Shultz was hopeful the company can soon add the U.S. to that list. He’s waiting for input from token-skeptical securities regulators on the matter.)      Earlier this month, rock band Kings of Leon trotted out ""golden tickets"" as part of its NFT album release. The latest from Malone represents an escalation of sorts in the fan-engagement arms race among tech-savvy musicians.      Only last month Malone and Dre launched their first NFT crossover event with the suds-soaked “Celebrity World Pong League.” There, as here, the rapper partnered with Fyooz to bring an experiential crypto offering to fans. Holders of the NFTs minted in that event were given the chance at playing pong against the rapper.

And betting on a bitcoin rally remains one of the hottest trades.      According to the survey, higher-than-expected inflation is now seen as the biggest “tail risk” – an event that’s seen as statistically unlikely but with potentially dramatic consequences. The coronavirus slipped from the No. 1 concern for the first time since February 2020.

Concerns about rising inflation could boost hedging demand for the store of value assets such as bitcoin and gold, although recently investors have started to wonder whether the Federal Reserve might unwind stimulus as the economy reheats. That might set up the cryptocurrency’s price for a fall because the 12-year-old digital asset is still seen as a risky investment, similar to stocks.

Announced Tuesday, Ledger Enterprise Solutions will drive forth the firm’s institution-focused Ledger Vault, the first crypto custody technology to be publicly linked to a major bank in the form of Nomura and the Komainu consortium, which recently raised $25 million.      As large financial institutions look to enter the new realm of digital assets, a handful of specialized custody technology firms, such as Anchorage, BitGo, Fireblocks and Curv (recently acquired by PayPal), are hoovering up this hand-holding business. Meanwhile, large corporate entities are also joining the party, following the likes of Tesla and MicroStrategy.      “We took the decision to create an independent business unit with around 50-60 people, aiming to grow that to about 120 people by the end of the year,” said Ledger Vice President of Business Solutions Jean-Michel Pailhon, who is leading the new division. “The Leger Vault solution we created in 2018 has lived within the larger group, and now it needs to come into the light a little bit more.”    Read more: Ledger’s Vault Scores $150 Million in Crypto Insurance From Lloyd’s Syndicate    Joining Pailhon’s leadership team is newly appointed VP of Sales and Partnerships Alexandre Lemarchand. Beefing up things on the engineering side, Ledger Enterprise has hired former SIX Digital (SDX) developer Alex Zinder as VP of engineering and former Thales engineer Laurent Castillo as VP of technical architecture.      Ledger’s institutional custody tech clients include Komainu, Crypto.com, Uphold, Bank Frick, BitStamp and Nexo.      Komainu, a joint venture between Ledger, Nomura and CoinShares, went live in June after a two-year test period. Komainu’s recent $25 million seed round was led by hedge fund billionaire Alan Howard.      “We were a little ahead of the curve when we launched Komainu during a bearish market cycle, but that also gave us time to grow and develop and we have learned a lot,” Pailhon said in an interview.      Two or three years back, big banks would tell Ledger they wanted to do “blockchain and not bitcoin,” Pailhon said.      “The good news is that it's now time for all the banks and institutional players to enter this market,” said Pailhon. “And guess what?

Having hit a low of $53,350 during the Asian hours the cryptocurrency is trading 1% higher on the day near $56,200 at press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Selling pressure faded near the widely tracked monthly volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $53,000.      The market now looks ready for a fresh move higher, as the bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate – the cost of holding long positions calculated every eight hours – has dropped sharply from 0.124% to 0.08% after excess bullish leverage was wiped out by the cryptocurrency's pullbacks Monday and Tuesday.      Long trades worth $1.16 billion were liquidated on Monday, the most since Feb. 22, according to data provider Coinalyze. And with today's drop, another $368 million-worth were liquidated by major exchanges.      With the lower funding rate, a more sustained move toward record highs could be seen – more so, as global stocks continue to rally with risk sentiment being supported by fundamentals, according to a tweet from Holger Zschaepitz, a markets commentator and economics author.      Further, many U.S. citizens scheduled to receive $1,400 stimulus checks this week could invest part of the cash received into bitcoin, boosting its price. As per a Mizuho Securities survey, nearly $40 billion of the latest round of stimulus checks could be spent on bitcoin and stock purchases.      Technical charts are also suggesting scope for a price bounce.      The 14-hour relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, formed a higher low early today, decoupling from the downtrend in prices. That ""bullish divergence"" indicates the pullback has run out of steam.

Digital asset investment products closed on Friday with a record $55.8 billion assets under management (AUM) following net inflows and positive price action last week of $242 million, according to the CoinShares report.  Ethereum funds took in a net $113 million last week.  Passive investment products with $54.1 billion AUM continue to outperform their active peers with a smaller $786 million in AUM, according to CoinShares. Passive funds simply track the price of digital assets, while active strategies adjust the weightings of their underlying holdings based on market conditions.  “The price action as bitcoin drew closer to $60,000 led to minor outflows of $39 million last week, which we believe is due to profit taking,” according to CoinShares.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/16/cryptocurrency-fund-flows-on-track-for-record-quarter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef1e68f9a129bb78f90cc5a0d0cc021b065b9210-608x428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42433934,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Y9h,1615853261,"Nobody Saw Inflation Coming in the 1960s, but It Could Be Back: Economist","Everything old is new again, and that includes investor complacency when it comes to inflation.      Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, thinks that complacency is due to the anemic pace of price increases in recent years.      The same thing happened in the early 1960s – just before the double-digit inflation that spilled into the 1970s, he wrote in a report Monday.      That potential rise in inflation this time may be caused by the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package recently signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden as well as near-constant money printing by the Federal Reserve.      ""Our point here is that it is possible that the U.S. is now on the verge of a major shift in inflation to the upside, from a starting point almost as low – and with low expectations as deeply embedded – as in the mid-sixties,"" he wrote.      The current pace of consumer price increases isn't remotely troubling, at less than 2%. However, there are investors who are concerned, as evidenced by their buying bitcoin as a hedge.      While not specifically mentioning bitcoin, he warned, ""Very few of today's bond portfolio managers and traders can remember the last inflation shock, but that does not make a new shock less likely.""      Consider what happened 60 years ago, Shepherdson writes:    The inflation trigger in the second half of the 1960s was the cost of the Vietnam War and President Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"" domestic spending, according to Shepherdson. Later, the price increases accelerated due to the oil price shocks of the first half of the 1970s as well as loose Federal Reserve monetary policy.  Core consumer price inflation (CPI), which excludes food and energy, rose from 1.3% in 1965 to 3.5% in 1967, and then powered on to 6.2% in 1970 – a shock to investors who failed to position for higher inflation.  ""Then it happened all over again, as core inflation rocketed to new highs, peaking at 11.7% in February 1975,"" Shepherdson wrote.  ""By the time of the third inflation surprise, in [1979-1980], investors were much wiser. Core inflation was even higher than in 1975, peaking at 13.3% in May 1980, and the recession was deeper.""  The trigger for higher inflation this time around could be the gigantic fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Shepherdson. While an inflation shock similar to that of the 1960s doesn’t happen often, one may be long overdue.  ""Investors usually expect tomorrow to look like today, so major shifts [such as inflation] are often downplayed for too long,"" Shepherdson wrote.  ""We can't go back and read the minds of the owners of [Treasury bonds] in 1964, but we're happy to assume that most of them had no inkling of what was to come.""  ""Anyone who took this view and positioned their portfolio accordingly suffered mightily over the next few years – actually, the next 20 or so years – as inflation soared.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/16/nobody-saw-inflation-coming-in-the-1960s-but-it-could-be-back-economist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b21b364d0ec83801f46e440555cb1188eb84ec59-1500x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
