42414555,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAk9M,1674776320,Ethereum Scaling Tool Polygon's MATIC Token Surges Amid Spike in Transactions,"Ethereum scaling tool Polygon’s MATIC token has surged 12% over the past 24 hours, continuing its strong momentum this year.  MATIC was recently trading at $1.11. It is up 48% since Dec. 31 amid a spike in daily transactions that have made the blockchain the second largest for daily active users (DAU), according to data from Token Terminal.  The rally comes amid a January upturn in the crypto market that has seen Aptos’ APT token skyrocketing more than 400%, Fantom’s FTM jumping about 145% and bitcoin rising nearly 40%.  The Polygon platform ranks second behind Binance’s BNB chain recording 344,000 daily active users (DAU), ahead of Solana and Ethereum.  Polygon’s announced partnerships and launches over the last month that have increased DAUs may also be behind the price increase, along with anticipation of Polygon’s mainnet launch of its zero-knowledge EVM. The mainnet launch is scheduled for early this year. Its zk-EVM public testnet went live in October.  “We’re starting to see users and interest come back to these kinds of networks and seeing activity again,” Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, told CoinDesk.  “There’s also a lot of projects that have built on top of Polygon that haven’t released their tokens yet, which will be coming out soon and add to the already increasing activity levels,” Storry added.  Polygon currently has around $1.1 billion total value locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.  “We are seeing mass TVL increases for riskier projects and early stage applications,” Storry said. “In a bear market investors are more conservative and don't want to take on huge risk, but now prices have picked up a little, they are more open to newer and riskier ecosystems like Polygon.  “We will see more of that come through as the market continues to pick up.”",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/26/ethereum-scaling-tool-polygons-matic-token-surges-amid-spike-in-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88085b61c36ee5e306f327416af538033e8fbd79-3839x2370.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Aegis, which says it holds trust licenses in Hong Kong and and the U.S., offers custodial services for on-chain transactions, while Lido, the largest DeFi app by total value locked, provides staking services to users that want to access liquidity to their staked assets.  The partnership comes as interest in liquid staking derivatives increases, in part because of the Merge, or the Ethereum blockchain’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

With the new Lido partnership, Aegis said clients can now participate in liquid staking.  Aegis CEO Serra Wei said the latest play stems from demand from family offices and regulation-sensitive businesses overall.  “Entities that are subject to regulations specifically want to access staking benefits and services through a secured gateway,” Wei said.  Additionally, by providing custody solutions for Lido’s digital assets, Aegis is able to increase the security of user’s digital assets, said Lido co-founder Vasiliy Shapovalov.  Aegis did not disclose how much capital is stored through its custodial services, while Lido has $8 billion worth of ether staked in its protocol.

Want to receive our daily markets updates in your email inbox everyday? Subscribe to our First Mover newsletter here.  FTX owes money to media companies, universities, airlines and charities, among others, a court filing from Wednesday shows. The document was filed by lawyers for the company as part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  Judge John Dorsey, who is overseeing the proceedings, allowed the names of individual creditors to remain sealed for three months at a hearing in early January, but requested a list of institutions that invested in the company to be filed by FTX lawyers.  Among those listed are media companies including The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Fox Broadcasting and CoinDesk as well as big crypto firms such as exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Binance. CoinDesk isn't materially owed anything and is on the list for ""technical reasons"" over a podcast sponsorship signed in the fall that was never executed, a CoinDesk spokesperson said.  American Airlines Group (AAL), Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Southwest Airlines (LUV), as well as Stanford University – where FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's parents work as professors – and the university's credit union were also listed in the document.  The list also names Gisele Bundchen Charitable Giving as a creditor.

Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin Trades Flat as GDP, Employment Data Signal Mild Growth  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Cryptos' resilience came even as the U.S Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of 2.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 3.2% in the third, although GDP exceeded expectations for a 2.6% increase.  Financial markets appear to be reacting positively to what they saw in the latest data, including an unexpectedly low number of jobless claims. ""Real disposable income,"" which represents personal income after adjustments for taxes and inflation, increased 3.3%, while the quarter-to- quarter change in gross domestic purchase prices increased 3.2%, down from 4.8% in the third quarter.  Signs of economic slowdown were present in the data as well, as a 2.1% increase in consumer spending arrived below expectations of 2.5%. With consumption accounting for 70% of GDP, investors in risk assets, particularly crypto, will likely be monitoring additional weakness in coming months.  Read the full technical take here.

However, the risk/reward for blanket shorting Bitcoin is not as attractive as in 2021-2022. We believe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a closed-ended Bitcoin Trust, with a ~40% discount to NAV is a good hedge for Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin can be shorted through an ETF such as BITI or crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase or Binance. We maintain a strong-sell rating on Bitcoin Previously, Biotechvalley Insights published a short thesis on cryptocurrencies on May 2021. We maintain a strong sell rating on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as the fundamentals behind it have not changed; in fact, we believe it worsened with various negative news flow (i.e., Terra Luna (LUNC-USD), the FTX (FTT-USD) scandal, the bankruptcy of various cryptocurrency-related banks and hedge funds) plaguing the market sentiment and diminishing the trust around the crypto-hemisphere. Long GBTC, short Bitcoin After we published our article, as we expected, cryptocurrencies got obliterated, driven by rising interest rates and changes in market sentiment to risk-off investments, falling below $16,000 per Bitcoin at one point. Even though we do not intend to long any cryptocurrency at this time, we believe it is risky to short it at the current level as there could be a bear market rally considering the fact that Bitcoin price is heavily driven by retail trading. As such, we believe it is important to hedge your risk just in case there could be a volatile movement in bitcoin prices. We believe going long the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and shorting B itcoin through Coinbase ( COIN ) or a Binance (BNB-USD) account or Bitcoin-related ETFs to be an excellent pairs trade because of the following reasons. GBTC is currently at a ~40% discount to NAV, meaning that you can get a 40% discount on Bitcoin by buying GBTC compared to buying it in other vehicles (i.e., Coinbase or other Bitcoin ETFs); this means that if Bitcoin falls further, your short will gain at a similar rate as GBTC loses value, and if Bitcoin appreciates or somehow GBTC successfully converts into a spot ETF structure (with close to 0% discount to NAV), then the discount to NAV would narrow close to zero (in theory), which would constitute a 40% gain from the current level. We believe the chance of GBTC successfully converting to spot ETF is slim based on the recent comment from the SEC ; however, even if that doesn't happen, if Bitcoin appreciates in value, we believe the chance of the discount to NAV narrowing is high, making our thesis actionable for investors. GBTC discount to NAV (Y Chart) Risks to the investment thesis However, this strategy does not come without risk, as there is always a lingering risk of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust or Coinbase defaulting, and investors may lose all of their money. Furthermore, even in a potential scenario of Bitcoin's price appreciation, there is a probability that the discount to NAV does not narrow down to 0% or perhaps fall due to an increase in competition from crypto-related stocks or other cryptocurrency futures ETFs. Considering the fact that both companies and instruments are public companies, we believe it is less likely to go bankrupt than private cryptocurrency-related enterprises such as Terra Luna or Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, which allegedly turned out to be a fraud. Furthermore, in the case of the Bitcoin price collapsing further, the discount to NAV widening more than the decline of Bitcoin price remains a concern; however, we believe the current level of discount to NAV is excessive even if we are bearish on Bitcoin and believe there is a higher chance of the discount narrowing than widening. Conclusion We continue to believe Bitcoin has close to no utility (and value) other than speculation and trading. We advise our readers to read our article on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency that we wrote in May 2021 for detailed analysis as many of the things we predicted have played out. However, due to the recent price decline in Bitcoin, naked shorting Bitcoin became riskier, and we believe going long GBTC and shorting Bitcoin through crypto exchanges to be a relatively low-risk arbitrage strategy for investors. We believe investors can profit or at least not lose money regardless of the movement in Bitcoin prices.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572783-best-crypto-pairs-trade-idea-2023-long-gbtc-short-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8294047.jpeg

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proposed requiring vendors on Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency as payment.  On Wednesday, Cruz introduced a concurrent resolution that, if adopted, would require the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives to only contract with food service contractors and vending machine operators that accept cryptocurrency for the Capitol complex in Washington, D.C.  The text of the resolution was not available on Congress’ website at press time, and representatives for the one-time presidential candidate did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Cruz has been a vocal supporter of the growing crypto mining industry in his home state of Texas, saying last year he wanted the Lone Star State to be an “oasis on planet Earth for bitcoin and crypto.” He has also been outspoken about the need for members of Congress to be more educated when it comes to crypto, and has publicly disclosed his own cryptocurrency holdings.  Despite his reintroduction of the pro-crypto resolution, Cruz is lagging behind other senators including Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) – all of whom have worked on major crypto-related bills.

42414554,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAk43,1674770909,Optimism’s OP Token Hits All-Time High as Layer 2 Adoption Interests Grow,"Layer 2 network Optimism’s OP token surged to its all-time high of over $2.50 on Wednesday amid rising adoption of layer 2 networks.  OP, which ​​launched via a community airdrop on May 31, 2022, was more recently trading at about $2.22, down 10% over the past 24 hours amid declining transaction volumes on the Optimism platform the past few days, but still up roughly 140% gain since the start of the year when it was hovering below $1, according to CoinDesk data. OP was recently up about 30% this week.  “People want layer 2 tokens and they see layer 2 adoptions happening,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca, referring to the tokens associated with companion blockchain systems. “Optimism is the only way to get good exposure to that theme currently.”  The OP token’s jump has outpaced the top two digital assets by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, which have recently risen 39% and 33%, respectively, in 2023.  The funding rates for the token also remain positive, a signal that market sentiment is bullish among traders, according to data from Coinglass.  Despite the price surge, Optimism’s transaction activities recently dropped massively.  According to Etherscan data, daily transactions on Optimism reached an all-time high of 800,000 on Jan. 12, although the volume has subsequently sunk to some 200,000 daily.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, attributed the sharp drop in transactions to the recent completion of Optimism Quests.  The Quests, which ran from September through Jan. 17, encouraged users to interact with a variety of protocols on the network, including minting non-fungible tokens (NFT) after completing a task.  “It isn't necessarily discouraging,” he said. “The Quests were successful in onboarding many new users, but it does show that many transactions were directly related to this initiative.”  Layer 2 adoption  Optimism is a layer 2 scaling system, powered by Optimistic rollups technology, running on the top of the Ethereum network.  Optimism and other layer 2 scaling systems such as Arbitrum are supposed to make transactions on the Ethereum blockchain cheaper and faster. After Ethereum completes its EIP-4844 upgrade, also called proto-danksharding, later this year, it will make transaction fees on layer 2s even “an order of magnitude cheaper,” Marc Arjoon, Ethereum research associate at CoinShares, wrote in a note.  ""2023 is shaping up to be the year of layer 2s,"" Arjoon wrote. ""For years Ethereum has been struggling to scale effectively while preserving decentralization and security and layer 2s have seemingly solved this trilemma.""  He added: “With a first-mover advantage and the most social capital, these advancements in scaling should help the Ethereum ecosystem prepare for the next wave of adoption and regain some of its lost market share.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | OP,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/26/optimisms-op-token-hits-all-time-high-as-layer-2-adoption-interests-grow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1238c65af4153f8bb33b1d0d4780128b7a3ab463-3556x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421398,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzo5,1674770506,Web3 Loyalty Programs Are a Trojan Horse for Good Crypto Policy,"There’s a legal saying that “bad facts make bad law.” Right now, crypto needs better facts. If crypto wants to resonate with policymakers, we should deemphasize the facts and narratives that threaten governments (down with fiat!) and the well-heeled (down with banks!).  Instead, crypto needs to emphasize meat-and-potatoes stories that are simple, valuable and pro-consumer. This is a technology that supposedly benefits everyone, that strengthens communities without dismantling individual rights. Odd as it may sound, one of the clearest examples of this are Web3 loyalty programs.  Josh Rosenblatt is general counsel, chief operating officer and co-founder of Co:Create. This article is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  The benefits of Web3 loyalty programs  Web3 loyalty programs have numerous advantages over traditional loyalty programs, but three will resonate the most with policymakers: ownership, control and interoperability. With a Web3-based loyalty program, users have true ownership of their points, tier status and brand-related collectables – all of which come in various forms of “loyalty tokens.” Users also have the ability to transfer, trade or sell their property – as the brands see fit.  Because companies can make their loyalty tokens subject to transfer restrictions, they have granular control over how their loyalty programs operate and who can participate. Brands can choose what wallets can receive tokens based upon set requirements. This goes far in showing that Web3 loyalty tokens are not securities, because they cannot necessarily be traded for a profit. Instead, they’re a consumable good.  Another benefit of Web3 loyalty programs is that brands can choose to make their loyalty programs interoperable. This means that loyalty tokens can be earned or redeemed by any brand that wants to participate in a particular program.  See also: The Loyalty Revolution / Opinion  Examples of this interoperability exist today but are limited by Web2 technology that requires collaborations to be manual, time-consuming and bi-directional (meaning that Brand A must negotiate a deal with Brand B and pursue a timely and expensive systems integration in order to collaborate).  Web3 loyalty programs make these collaborations partially or completely permissionless, depending on the brand’s preferences. Any participating brand can partner with any other participating brand. Brands with similar audiences and noncompeting products could cross-promote and leverage each other’s brand value - with little to no preplanned coordination. For example, a restaurant could give gold tier members of a product a discount for a limited time, simply by the user providing the NFT that represents their gold tier membership.  Adoption will come via a Trojan horse  If Web3 loyalty programs are successful, they will drive positive outcomes for the entire crypto industry by onboarding new users in a familiar context.  First, they provide a low-stakes introduction to crypto assets and blockchain technology through shared incentives. There’s no faster way to get everyday users comfortable with wallets than providing real-life benefits (i.e., discounts at their favorite stores). Web3 loyalty programs make it easier for people to understand and embrace the technology by getting wallets into people's hands and encouraging them to use blockchain-based tools in a familiar context with clear benefits.  Second, Web3 loyalty programs show the value of blockchain technology in a real-world context. These programs are not trying to revolutionize the world, but they are taking established programs and enhancing them with the added benefits only possible through the use of blockchain technology.  See also: Brand Building On-Chain: Why Marketers Are Shifting Investment Into Web3 / Opinion  Good narratives make good policy  The entire industry will benefit if regulators and the public can think about crypto through the lens of Web3 loyalty programs, as regulatory frameworks already exist. Loyalty programs operate within well-established laws and regulations: consumer protection and privacy standards being among them. There are fewer open questions and less need for new legislation to govern Web3 loyalty programs.  Web3 loyalty programs are “nonthreatening.” Unlike other crypto use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 loyalty programs do not threaten the power of the state or traditional financial systems. It’s very hard to financially harm consumers with a loyalty program. This makes them more politically palatable and easier to regulate.  See also: Birth of the Network Nations  Web3 loyalty programs are also pro-business. They provide businesses with a valuable tool to compete, collaborate and attract customers. It becomes much harder for policymakers to regulate tools that are commonly understood as “good for business.”  If the Web3 loyalty program narrative is widely adopted, then everyday users will feel ownership and allegiance to Web3 technology. As users become aware of their ownership and control over their loyalty programs, they will become more supportive of crypto policies that benefit the entire industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Josh Rosenblatt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/26/web3-loyalty-programs-are-a-trojan-horse-for-good-crypto-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a32d99402704f1b61782afbc0f6bb461049d21e-2947x2027.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the recent rally could spell trouble for optimistic traders and investors waiting for a continuation of the trend. Related Reading: Cardano Adds 50,000 New Wallets As ADA Market Cap Surges As of this writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.08 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours.

Dogecoin’s Rally Stirs The Crowds, Is A Retrace Imminent? Data from Coingecko indicates positive development for meme coins. The sector records around $20 billion in total market cap, a 2% increase in 24 hours, and $1 billion in trading volume over the same period. In addition to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Baby Dogecoin, and Bonk have captured the attention of crypto investors. The second of these assets experience a 23% rally in the past week alone, hinting at the increase in risk appetite from digital asset enthusiasts. The Bitcoin rally deep into the $20,000 territory has flipped the crypto market’s sentiment. As a result, Dogecoin and other meme coins are resurging and outperforming more significant digital assets. Additional data from analytics firm Santiment registered increased levels of positive interaction across social media platforms. This suggests that users are more willing to take long positions, swelling the liquidity to the downside. In other words, people are experiencing fear of missing out (FOMO), as recorded by Santiment, increasing the chances of a pullback. Market makers could squeeze long positions before resuming the bullish momentum. As seen in the chart below, the altcoin sector has recently seen important growth.

The collection, titled Putin’s Ashes, will be available for purchase Friday on Tezos-based NFT marketplace Objkt. All of the proceeds from the collection will be donated to Ukrainian soldiers who have been battling the Russian invasion since February 2022.  The open edition will start minting on Friday at 10 a.m. PT and end on Feb. 3. Each NFT will be priced at 10 TEZ (about $11). Pussy Riot plans to open the collection with a protest and performance Friday in Los Angeles at the Jeffrey Deitch gallery.  Tolokonnikova began creating Putin’s Ashes in August, when Pussy Riot members burned an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a protest. Collecting the ashes from the event, Tolokonnikova bottled them to create the artwork for the NFT collection. The collection also features work by Fairey in his signature style, depicting Tolokonnikova wearing a corset with Putin on the front that appears to be in flames.  Citing the skills she learned when she was in prison for two years following Pussy Riot’s anti-Putin performance, Tolokonnikova is eager to give back to Ukraine.  “I was forced to sew police and army uniforms in a Russian jail. I turned what I learned in my labor camp against those who locked me up,” said Tolokonnikova. “Putin is a danger to the whole world, and he has to be stopped immediately""  Tolokonnikova has also been dedicated to making the NFT space more diverse. Last year, she started UnicornDAO, a collective to empower women and LGBTQ+ NFT artists, which raised $4.5 million in May.

Bitcoin, ether and most of the other major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization continued to hold about where they stood on Wednesday, same time. BTC and ETH both inched up a few fractions of a percentage point. BNB, APT and ADT, among others, were in the green. Bitcoin was recently holding steady over $23,000.  Cryptos’ resilience came even as the U.S Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of 2.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 3.2% in the third, although better than expectations for a 2.6% increase.  The largest contributions to economic growth came via inventory investment and consumer spending, while the smallest contributor to GDP was business investment. Investments in housing declined. Equity markets initially had a more mixed view of the data but later were feeling upbeat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recently jumped 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, were up 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively.  Meanwhile, BTC and ETH trading volume were slightly above average on the day. An uptick in volume in conjunction with higher prices is generally a bullish sign. Flat prices however, signal that bullish and bearish investors are both actively expressing their market views.  In other macroeconomic news, initial jobless claims of 186,000 were lower than expectations for 205,000, indicating that the labor market remains tight and the economy has not cooled enough to satisfy the central bankers trying to tame inflation. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has lowered prices in recent months through a series of steep interest rate hikes, but Fed governors remain concerned about their hawkishness spurring a steep recession.  Financial markets appear to be reacting positively to what they saw in the latest data. “Real disposable income,” which represents personal income after adjustments for taxes and inflation, increased 3.3%, while the quarter-to-quarter change in gross domestic purchase prices increased 3.2%, down from 4.8% in the third quarter.  Signs of economic slowdown were present in the data as well. A reported 2.1% increase in consumer spending was below expectations of 2.5%. With consumption accounting for 70% of GDP, investors in risk assets, particularly crypto, will likely be monitoring additional weakness in coming months.  Still, the data Thursday barely changed expectations for the size of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) next interest rate decision at its two-day meeting starting next Tuesday.

42414539,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAirl,1674767090,"Mango Markets to Resume Crypto Trading, SEC Be Damned","Developers behind the shuttered decentralized crypto exchange Mango Markets say they’re pushing forward with a relaunch of the project – even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges the project’s native token, MNGO, is a security.  The SEC’s labeling of the token raises knotty problems about whether Mango Markets’ “version 4” can proceed without facing regulators’ wrath. The SEC hasn’t alleged wrongdoing by Mango. But the agency last week accused MNGO trader Avraham Eisenberg, who drained $116 million from the exchange in October, of securities market manipulation.  Securities lawyers who aren’t involved in the case told CoinDesk the SEC might be laying the groundwork to bring a case against the exchange that issued MNGO to its investors when it launched in 2021.  “By noting that purportedly ineligible U.S. investors participated in the token sale, the SEC is implying that it also has authority to bring a future case asserting this is an unregistered securities offering,” said Howard Fischer, a former SEC trial counsel and partner at the law firm Moses Singer.  The SEC declined to comment.  On a call Sunday with Mango developers, which CoinDesk attended, project founder Daffy Durairaj pledged to proceed with the software upgrade that will restart Mango Markets, the once-popular venue for trading, borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies on Solana. It went dark in October after one trader drained Mango and its customers of crypto worth $116 million.  That exploiter, 27-year-old Eisenberg, was arrested in December on commodities fraud and market manipulation charges stemming from his self-described “highly profitable trading strategy.” Just last week, the SEC filed its own lawsuit against Eisenberg and alleged Mango’s native governance token, MNGO, is a security. (On Thursday Mango sued Eisenberg over $47 million).  MNGO, a crypto governance token that grants its holders voting rights over Mango Markets’ operations, “was offered and sold as a security,” the SEC said, noting it is investigating “other securities law violations” alongside the Eisenberg case. That ominous pledge could have major implications for Mango Markets’ U.S. team if the SEC decides to sue.  No matter: Mango’s developers are pressing forward with the trading venue’s relaunch. In a developer call on Sunday, Mango Markets founder Daffy Durairaj gave a run-down of progress. It was Mango’s first developer meetup in the wake of the Eisenberg exploit, and Durairaj tried to strike a positive tone.  Reopening Mango Markets  For him and Mango’s other developers, the long-planned version (v)4 upgrade is the protocol’s ticket back to relevance in a radically-altered landscape for Solana DeFi. Solana-based trading protocols have lost over 70% of their total value locked (TVL) since Nov. 1, days before the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, according to DeFiLlama, (Crypto DeFi in aggregate lost some 14% over the same period.)  The SEC’s specter looms over v4. In the lawsuit against Eisenberg, SEC lawyers went out of their way to mention that “Mango has been touting the upcoming launch of version 4 of Mango Markets on its website and on social media.”  The reference looked odd because it had no apparent connection to the SEC’s accusations against Eisenberg, Jeffrey Gebert, a partner specializing in securities at the Canadian law firm McMillan LLP, told CoinDesk.  “There are some concerns that they’re looking at Mango v4’s launch,” Durairaj said of the SEC to the 50-odd attendees on the developer call.  “I don't know exactly what they're worried about,” he said. “I don't know why they added that into the complaint, so there’s something to discuss.”  Those lawsuits are proving to be a costly headache for Mango Labs, the U.S. company that’s positioning itself as MangoDAO’s legal defender. It spent an estimated $400,000 on legal fees last year and anticipates footing an even bigger bill in 2023, Durairaj said on the developer call. He said Mango Labs will ask the decentralized autonomous organization for a $1.5 million grant, in part to pay the lawyers.  “Lawyers are very expensive. Every time you talk to them it's a lot of money, which kind of sucks,” he said on the call.  “We want to make sure that the DAO is defended, legally represented and well defended in case anyone wants to allege, or do a class action lawsuit, even if the SEC wants to file a lawsuit.”  Durairaj declined to be interviewed for this article.  SEC vs. Mango?  The SEC’s case against Eisenberg treats MNGO as a security (if it wasn’t, it would be out of the SEC’s jurisdiction). That distinction, which it had not previously applied to MNGO, could mean big trouble for the project if the agency also asserts the token is “unregistered,” multiple securities lawyers told CoinDesk.  One possible issue stems from Mango Markets’ $70 million token sale in August 2021. It claimed to ban U.S. investors from participating in that sale, a move which CoinDesk noted at the time was likely an attempt to avoid regulatory scrutiny. In spite of this self-imposed ban, the SEC’s lawsuit claims U.S. investors – indeed some of Mango’s creators who live in the U.S. – bought the token.  The SEC, in its suit against Eisenberg, also threw doubt on the degree of decentralization of Mango’s “so-called governance token,” as the regulators referred to MNGO. The SEC alleged MNGO token holders had “limited and minimal” control over the protocol and most sat out of voting, while insiders “dominated the votes.” It called the DAO’s governance rights “illusory.”  The suit also picked at Mango’s “Upgrade Council,” a seven-member group of Solana and Mango insiders who can vote to push through changes to Mango Markets without the general DAO’s input. The Upgrade Council had shut down Mango v3 in response to Eisenberg’s exploit largely based on the votes of two of its creators.  Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg LLP and former attorney in the SEC Division of Enforcement, highlighted the risks of creators moving forward with any project so closely tied to a purported security.  “It is reasonable to expect that the SEC will, in most cases, determine each cryptocurrency offering is a securities offering,” he said. “As such, it is reasonable to expect that the safest course of action is that issuers and related parties comply with the securities laws.”  V4 upgrades  Durairaj, the Mango founder, said in the Sunday developer call that Mango v4 will patch the issues that led to Eisenberg’s exploit. For example, one planned change prevents the risk in one asset’s trading pool from carrying over to another pool, he said.  The one-hour call also included a discussion of the future of Mango’s Upgrade Council. Durairaj said the council “was always meant to be a temporary feature” that could react to security snafus, like the Eisenberg exploit, faster than a full DAO vote. He said the DAO could jettison the council “if we have a situation where Mango v4 is really robust.”  “We’re fine to go ahead and launch Mango v4 under DAO authority,” Durairaj said, though he cautioned some features are still in the works.  Developers are nearly finished building an android version of Mango that will serve as a “Venmo for crypto,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/26/mango-markets-to-resume-crypto-trading-sec-be-damned,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dadba856f8b0d3da21c392cb6729a569d1557d77-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393909,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3aD,1674766408,Japan Embraces Web3 As Global Regulators Grow Wary of Crypto,"“While many other countries are standing still and shrugging their shoulders in the face of the cold wind, Japan is positioned to play a unique role in the crypto industry.”  So reads a proposal by Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party Web3 project team. In other words: Where other nations fear crisis, Japan sees opportunity.  After a recent trip to Tokyo, it’s hard to overstate how out of sync Japan is with much of the world. No one I spoke with seemed particularly fazed by the FTX meltdown or the string of crypto implosions that preceded it. The FTX crash has had “no impact on policy making,” said Masaaki Taira, a member of the House of Representatives and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s Web3 Project Team.  Read more: As part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, reporters covered the regulatory outlook in the biggest financial centers of Asia, including Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.  As lawmakers and regulators from the U.S. to Europe to Asia express increased wariness of crypto, Web3 promotion remains part of Japan’s national strategy. A small but active group of politicians is proposing guidelines for everything from decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to non-fungible tokens (NFT). It’s getting easier for Japanese exchanges to list tokens. One onerous tax requirement has been revised, marking a major win for crypto entrepreneurs. Coinbase and Kraken withdrew from Japan, but Binance, which irked Japanese regulators in the past, managed to acquire a Japanese exchange. And stablecoins, which are currently not allowed on Japanese exchanges, have a new path forward.  Which raises the question: Why is Japan embracing crypto now?  Ghosts of hackers past  The simplest explanation may be that when it comes to crypto, Japan has already been to Hell and back. It proved that it can weather a storm. So now, some of the old fear is gone.  Japan was an early mover in crypto, and the setbacks came soon after. In 2014, Japanese exchange Mt. Gox was hacked. Then, in early 2018, hackers struck again, stealing over $500 million from Japanese exchange Coincheck in what was the biggest hack in crypto history. Not long before the Coincheck hack, Japan was poised to be a crypto capital of Asia, if not the world. But the hack spooked regulators in a big way, and Japan seemed to vanish off the crypto map. For a time it seemed almost impossible to list new tokens on exchanges.  It turns out that Japan had not, in fact, disappeared, it was just taking time to get its house in order. Following these hacks, Japan required that customer assets and exchange assets be separated, and that most exchange assets be kept in cold wallets. When FTX imploded, Japan’s regulatory approach showed its strengths.  “It is likely that FTX Japan’s Japanese customer assets will be returned without a significant impact from the Chapter 11 global bankruptcy filing,” said Ryosuke Ushida, chief fintech officer at the Financial Services Agency, the government agency that regulates crypto.  “In most jurisdictions there is no segregation of crypto assets. In Japan they are legally separated. That makes it easier for FTX Japan to return the money.”  “The reason why we ask for this kind of segregation of assets is because we learned our lesson from past incidents like the Mt. Gox and Coincheck hacks. Fortunately or unfortunately, we got used to this kind of emergency situation in crypto. Compared to other jurisdictions, we are knowledgeable,” Ushida said.  FTX Japan may allow user withdrawals as early as February.  Stablecoins enter Japan  Before the FTX debacle was the demise of Terra’s terraUSD (UST), the algorithmic stablecoin that collapsed in May. All over the world, this led to increased concerns about the stability of the stablecoins that play such a key role in crypto trade. These stablecoins claim to be pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, but there are questions about whether issuers have the fiat reserves to back these claims.  There have been various stablecoin proposals circulating in Washington, D.C. The European Union is in the final stages of approving stablecoin rules in its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Regulation. Singapore has also proposed stablecoin rules. But for the most part, regulation has yet to take hold.  This means that Japan might end up in the lead.  “Japan may be the first country to regulate permissionless stablecoins. America is still debating how to regulate stablecoins. Japan’s stablecoin law will take effect in June of 2023,” said Tatsuya Saito, product manager at the digital planning office of the Japanese bank MUFG. MUFG is leading a consortium of banks and trust banks that will launch stablecoins on both private as well as public blockchains such as Ethereum.The software platform, known as Progmat, is supposed to launch later this year.  So while other jurisdictions are trying to rein in stablecoins, Japan is cautiously moving in the opposition direction. That’s because at present stablecoins are essentially not allowed in Japan at all.  “Tether, USDC are not listed on Japanese exchanges,” the FSA’s Ushida said. “In general because we ensure that a stablecoin is really stable, reserve assets are secure and redemption can be done on request.”  Now, thanks to the new rules, overseas stablecoins have a path forward. Starting in June, Japanese exchanges will be able to apply for a special license to trade stablecoins. This could make it possible for overseas stablecoins like tether (USDT) or USD coin (USDC) to enter the Japanese market. But that does not mean it will be easy. Saito says the dollars that would back the stablecoins circulating on Japanese exchanges will likely require a scheme in which the underlying assets are held in trust at a Japanese trust bank — an unusually strict requirement.  It may seem strange to welcome stablecoins at a time when much of the world is questioning their stability. It’s not hard to imagine why Japanese investors or exchanges would want access to stablecoins – either as a store of value or an on-ramp to other crypto products – but what is the government’s motivation?  One theory is that “the Japanese government wants to bring yen-based stablecoins into the global crypto trading system, and to increase the global usage of the JPY,” Saito said.  NFTs and DAOs  Some LDP politicians are not only embracing the potential of DAOs and NFTs, they have gone to great lengths to provide policy guidelines for them. Last year the project team published a rather detailed NFT white paper.  “Japan has rich, high-quality intellectual property (IP) such as animation and games that are internationally competitive, and has great potential to lead the world in the NFT business and, by extension, the Web 3.0 economy,” the white paper says. The white paper includes policy recommendations on themes such as promoting NFT business development and protecting the rights of content IP holders.  A lot of Japanese content is seriously undervalued, explained Masaaki Taira from the LDP’s Web3 Project Team. Some of this has to do with deflation, but it is also because much of it is in the hands of the content holders and not available on the global market. NFTs provide a path to digitizing this content and bringing it to a wider audience, thus potentially increasing its value.  “Content holders and big companies are still very nervous about Web3 and blockchain. Because there is no clear regulation around it, they are afraid of breaking a law,” Taira said.  “These big companies have plenty of money and they have technology. But if the government does not give them a green light, they will be afraid to enter the NFT space.”​​  DAOs are another area where Japan is positioning itself to emerge as a leader. Japan’s digital ministry is creating its own DAO. The Web3 Project Team views DAOs as an innovation that has the potential to do everything from resolving social issues to revitalizing local communities and the Japanese economy.  ""There is no nation-state that has formal DAO legislation,” said Akihisa Shiozaki, also a member of the House of Representatives and member of LDP's Web 3 Project Team.  “We are planning to introduce a DAO law to allow an option for those who want to do business in the form of a DAO, to be protected under LLC,' said Shiozaki.  The reason for this is basically to give people more peace of mind about entering this new world. ""If you were running a DAO and the DAO made a mistake and caused people damage, you could be sued,” Shiozaki said. “You want a corporation-type shield that would limit your liability.""  Regulatory clarity  One of Japan’s competitive advantages is regulatory clarity, in sharp contrast to the United States. The U.S. has a variety of federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), plus a patchwork of state regulators. Japan has one crypto regulator: the FSA.  In the U.S. there is still much confusion over what makes a token a security. In Japan, the lines are more clearly drawn. “Crypto assets and securities are different categories and tokens currently listed on crypto exchanges are crypto assets, not securities,” the FSA’s Ushida explained. “We have a clear definition of securities. You will find what is defined as securities in Article 2 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.”  “If the underlying asset of the tokenized assets is a security (e.g., bond) or real estate, it is subject to security regulation,” he added. “Utility tokens which do not fall into the definition of crypto assets and other financial instruments are out of the scope or financial regulation.”  Clarity, of course, does not necessarily mean ease of doing business. Taxes remain an obstacle. The LDP’s tax committee recently approved a proposal that said crypto startups that issue tokens no longer have to pay corporate taxes on unrealized gains. But other tax issues remain unresolved.  Furthermore, getting a token listed on a Japanese exchange can be challenging. Tokens must first be approved by Japan’s self-regulatory organization, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, or JVCEA. But the JVCEA doesn’t act alone.  “JVCEA makes a recommendation to the FSA. It’s case by case. We respect the judgment of JVCEA but it also should be checked by us,” the FSA’s Ushida said.  The token approval process has recently been streamlined. In October 2021 there were 86 coins waiting to be listed; now there are only nine. The wait for getting listings approved has gone down from nearly two years to three months, according to a JVCEA representative.  Still, I heard complaints that listings are not moving fast enough. Coinbase Japan, for example, lists under 20 tokens, compared to over 200 in the United States.  Exchange rules  Coinbase, in fact, has just pulled out of Japan, following in the footsteps of Kraken. Coinbase Japan users have until mid-February to make their final withdrawals. Coinbase pointed to “market conditions” as a reason for its departure, but its decision was likely affected by the challenges of profitability in Japan due to strict regulations, as well as the additional challenge of an overseas company breaking into a market where it had no pre-existing user base.  It’s clearly not easy to operate an exchange in Japan. In addition to rules about segregation of assets and cold wallets, exchanges must entrust customers’ fiat to a Japanese trust company or bank trust. And there are regular audits to make sure that exchanges play by the rules.  “We have to hold 100% of client assets (same kind and same amount) in cold wallets every day,” said Takaaki Kato, head of sales and trading at Bitflyer, one of Japan’s largest crypto exchanges. “If this is not met, we have to move crypto assets to cold wallets within five days by regulations, but we basically do this within 24 hours. Client fiat assets are in a trust bank, etc., with periodic reporting to regulators as well as publicly disclosed quarterly – so could be easily checked.”  Japanese exchanges also must hold capital to hedge against risks. “You have to put aside three months’ worth of selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) costs, and our regulatory capital needs to exceed the risk amount, which it does by roughly three to four times,” Kato said.  Some would argue that such strict rules take a toll on profitability. But there are benefits as well, especially in a turbulent market. “Bitcoin could continue dropping significantly and we’d still be well capitalized,” Kato said.  Unshaken  After the drama of 2022, one gets the feeling that some lawmakers around the globe see crypto as something to protect people from. In Japan, the mood is very different. I heard something that sounded almost like optimism.  Not everyone is a crypto enthusiast, of course. Many people probably have little idea of what this whole crypto thing is about. But they’re not necessarily going to get in its way.  ""There’s a small group of politicians that are pro-Web3 and then there’s a lot of people that don’t know,” Shiozaki said. “The good part about the LDP is that the people who don’t know don’t oppose these ideas, but let some of the younger generation politicians take initiative and run around in this blue ocean.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/26/japan-embracing-crypto-industry-web3-dao-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00f41312da39c16147fec4310dd162a1f31f0c92-1500x925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The network has grown tremendously in various sectors, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The blockchain has recorded massive adoption over the past months emerging as the third most active blockchain in development activity. According to data from Cardano Blockchain Insights, this blockchain’s ecosystem has added more than 50,000 new wallets since the beginning of the year. From 3,842,867 recorded on January 1 to 3,894,735 wallets registered as of January 25, a total of 51,868 wallets were added to the network. In the past 25 days, an average of 2,075 new wallets have been created daily, indicating a rising interest and activity from potential new investors on the Cardano blockchain. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Continues To Shine With 15% Gains In the Last Week ADA Market Cap Surges Nearly 50% Following the increasing interest from potential buyers, Cardano’s (ADA) market capitalization has recorded new monthly highs. From the $8.48 billion seen late last year, the ADA market cap has surged to over $13 billion, up by 43% in the previous 30 days. The asset has gained traction and recognition from notable firms. Earlier this week, crypto analytics platform StockTwits ranked ADA as the most trending cryptocurrency, surpassing Bitcoin (BTC), which attained the second position below ADA. CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap have ranked ADA as eighth regarding top cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization. Alongside its cryptocurrency market cap surge, ADA has also rallied in the past weeks, appearing among the top gainers among cryptocurrencies with large market caps. Over the past 30 days, ADA has surged from the $0.25 price tag seen late last year to above $0.35 at the time of writing. Its trading volume has also changed significantly from $161 million recorded at the beginning of the year to $489 million in the last 24 hours. Cardano’s Most Anticipated Catalyst Though ADA’s recent rally seems based on the crypto market’s ubiquitous bullish trend, a catalyst such as the Djed stablecoin could also be a part of the asset’s increasing attraction. Djed is Cardano’s first ADA-backed stablecoin powered by COTI Network. It is an over-collateralized stablecoin with a collateral rate between 400%-800%, according to the description on adapulse.io. Related Reading: Cardano’s Aggressive Development Activity Will Withstand Bear Assault At $0.3?

42414547,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAjSu,1674762801,CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson Urges Congress to Expand Agency’s Authority to Review Crypto Acquisitions,"Following FTX’s swift, stunning collapse in November, crypto industry participants, lawmakers and regulators alike have all been mulling the same questions: Why were regulators blindsided by FTX’s implosion and, more importantly, how can the next crypto crisis be prevented?  In a speech at Duke University on Wednesday, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Kristin Johnson formally called on Congress to modify several pieces of proposed digital asset legislation to expand the U.S. agency’s authority to conduct due diligence on any firm – foreign or domestic – seeking to purchase a minimum 10% share of the equity interest in a CFTC-registered market participant.  “Specifically drawing from the example of LedgerX, I am advocating for regulation that formalizes the obligation to separate customer property, ensure financial resource requirements … and introduce effective governance and risk management controls,” Johnson said.  Johnson’s remarks echoed CFTC officials’ brewing frustration in recent months over the agency’s limitations and calls for more authority.  In December, Rostin Behnam, CFTC chairman , told lawmakers in December that his agency did not have enough authority to properly oversee FTX, which was based in the Bahamas. Instead, the CFTC only had insight into LedgerX – one of the few FTX-owned companies that has remained solvent throughout the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy process.  Behnam and Johnson have used the example of FTX to demand expanded authority for their agency to oversee the crypto industry – something they’ve repeatedly argued could prevent the next FTX from happening.  LedgerX was a CFTC-regulated entity prior to being purchased by West Realm Shires (the legal name for FTX US) in 2021. Johnson noted that less than two years after being brought under the FTX umbrella, ”market participants find themselves navigating the dark and troubling waters of FTX’s bankruptcy.”  LedgerX is currently being auctioned off as part of the FTX bankruptcy proceedings. Preliminary bids for the company were due on Wednesday, and the sale is expected to be finalized by March.  Johnson argued in her speech that the current regulatory requirements around such acquisitions are minimal – and not enough to prevent future collapses. The CFTC must simply be notified of any transfer of equity ownership and is not otherwise involved in a sale.  Instead, she proposed that the CFTC initiate a notice and comment process for proposed acquisitions to give the agency “greater visibility into the financial health, corporate governance and risk management” of any business that wants to buy into a CFTC-regulated entity.  “In times of crisis, with expanding access to retail market participants, and with increasingly diverse markets, relying on other regulatory frameworks such as anti-trust legislation, may prove too limited in scope to prevent crypto-crises,” Johnson added.  ‘A new cautionary tale’  Johnson didn’t hesitate when discussing corporate failures that led to FTX’s implosion, saying the collapsed Bahamian exchange was the latest example in a string of “cautionary tales woven together by a set of common threads.”  “An almost 30-year-old CEO launches an international crypto exchange. Within a few years, the founder and the exchange achieve crypto-celebrity status. At its peak, the exchange captures significant market share,” Johnson said.  Such meteoric rises, Johnson added, are often followed by an all-too-common ending: “Like lightning striking, in an instant the exchange suspends trades, shutters the windows for withdrawals, silences traffic on its website and files for bankruptcy protection, leaving customers infuriated, investors stunned, and creditors scrambling in a footrace to the courthouse.”  After the initial chaos, the arduous, lengthy process of cleaning up the mess of a crypto crisis remains, Johnson said.  “We are years if not decades from untangling the Gordian knot of conflicts of interest, an absolute failure of corporate governance, absence of effective internal controls, and transactions with affiliated entities,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/26/cftc-commissioner-kristin-johnson-urges-congress-to-expand-agencys-authority-to-review-crypto-acquisitions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d2f5b07607053ce71b17b3a2682aea8b29f46e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC sued Ripple Labs in 2020 for selling XRP tokens to the public, which it says were unregistered securities. The SEC has repeatedly classified XRP as securities, with the Ripple defense team objecting to the idea. Garlinghouse stated that the judgment would take some time, but his confidence in Ripple’s chances of a victory is high.

However, he emphasized that a settlement is unlikely since SEC chairman Gary Gensler has labeled all cryptos as securities. Both parties have completed the final step in their motion for summary judgment and are now anticipating the court’s decision. Meanwhile, the lead counsel to the defendant in the XRP case, Stuart Alderoty, said the lawsuit’s outcome would define what tokens are securities in the crypto space. He added that the ruling would impact crypto asset regulations in the industry.

42414551,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBAjip,1674756854,"Stablecoin Regulation Is First on New Subcommittee’s To-Do List, Says Chairman","Stablecoin legislation will be one of the top priorities for the newly formed U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and inclusion, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  “That’s a starting point for the committee,” Hill said. “But we want to also pursue … a privacy statute federally, which I think is important to a digital future [and] part of the foundation of moving from an analog financial services environment to a more digital environment.”  Hill, the chairman of the subcommittee, added, ""We're also going to do oversight hearings on both the regulators and some of the actions of last year so that we can learn from that ...""  One such action was the ""Ugly Baby"" bill, a stablecoin bill worked out by then-Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and raking Republican Rep. Patrick Henry (R-N.C.) of the House Financial Services committee.  Stablecoins, which are backed by an asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold, appear to be the most straight-forward, or “low-hanging fruit,” tied to crypto. Hill said the committee’s current draft on stablecoins will serve as a model of how it will approach digital asset regulation.  Who should regulate?  Hill said “that’s not clear yet” when asked whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should be the primary regulator of spot crypto markets. He said that will be something else the subcommittee will sort through this year.  To that end, he said the subcommittee will work with both House and Senate agriculture and banking committees and the House Financial Services Committee.  Hill said the goal of lawmakers on Capitol Hill is to work together to “pick the right direction” that will help “produce innovation” that is beneficial to developers, consumers and investors.  What is critical to the development of crypto in the broader market now is “accurate [and] timely information,” according to Hill, and that depends on developing “definition and expectations,” to better understand what, when and how crypto-related assets are reported.  “If you want to see financial innovation in this space, you're going to have to have accurate information,” Hill said.

42393904,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3AZ,1674756059,South Korean Lawmakers Are Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto. What Could That Look Like?,"In South Korea’s capital city of Seoul, the 300 members of the country’s National Assembly are currently debating 17 separate crypto-related proposals – ranging from implementing reserve requirements at exchanges to ensuring fair trading – aimed at creating better protections for Korean crypto investors.  The culmination of this debate will be the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), a comprehensive legal framework that will provide regulatory guidelines for the growing Korean crypto industry.  Korean media first reported that lawmakers were working on DABA in June – one month after the swift collapse of the Korean algorithmic stablecoin issuer Terra wiped approximately $60 billion from the global crypto ecosystem.  Read more: As part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, reporters covered the regulatory outlook in the biggest financial centers of Asia, including Hong Kong, India, Singapore and Japan.  The implosion of the once-mighty Terra was the first domino to fall in an ensuing series of other high-profile crypto collapses, including the failure of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and a string of bankrupted exchanges and lenders including Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Genesis and FTX.  As yet more dominoes begin to wobble, regulators around the world have urgently called for comprehensive crypto regulations to be put in place to protect investors. The European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set for a vote in April, lawmakers in the U.S. are weighing several proposed bills that seek to regulate the domestic industry and South Korean lawmakers have said that DABA could be ready as early as June.  Necessary global cooperation  However, regulating crypto country by country isn’t going to be enough to prevent the next FTX from happening.  As European Commissioner Mairead McGuiness recently pointed out in an interview with CoinDesk, individual jurisdictions’ attempts to regulate crypto are useless without global coordination.  “There’s no point in Europe being on its own,” McGuiness said. “This is a global development and we can’t put barriers on it.”  McGuinness is not alone in her opinion. In November, India Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, ""No one single country can succeed individually, being in a silo, trying to regulate the crypto assets.”  As president of this year’s Group of 20 nations, India has announced that how to regulate crypto will be a priority agenda item. Indeed, regulators and politicians around the world, including in the U.S., have called for international cooperation to eliminate opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and effectively regulate crypto.  South Korean lawmakers have heeded the call for international cooperation and coordination, telling local media last year they would only begin working on DABA “in earnest” in October 2022, after the reports ordered by U.S. President Joe Biden in his executive order on crypto (issued in March) was published.  In a translated draft of one of the 17 crypto-related proposals currently being considered by Korea’s National Assembly, Rep. Yoon Chang-Hyun states:  “Despite the rapid growth of the digital asset market and the increase in the number of users, legislation is being delayed in consideration of global consistency.”  Yoon, who is a member of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), has been outspoken about the need to investigate the Terra collapse and provide the Financial Services Commission (FSC) – the country’s top financial regulator – with more power to oversee the crypto industry.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and Luna  However, Yoon and his fellow regulators have stressed that while the country is keeping an eye on international regulations, they’re not just waiting around for regulation to be decided. Instead, international standards will be considered and then gradually folded in where South Korean regulators see fit.  “Rather than blindly waiting for international discussion trends and preparation of global standards, it is necessary to first prepare a regulatory system for user protection through minimum necessary regulations,” Yoon’s proposal reads. “It is a situation where it is judged that it is appropriate to promote gradual and step-by-step legislation to supplement this in the future.”  Bipartisan agreement  The necessity of protection of crypto investors is one of the only issues that both the ruling People Power Party and opposing party agree on, said Thomas Cheong, CEO of blockchain platform EQBR Networks, a subsidiary of South Korea-based EQBR Holdings.  Current President Yoon Suk-yeol campaigned on promises to deregulate the crypto industry – a promise that was made much more difficult in the wake of Terra’s stunning collapse, which has sparked a slew of regulatory actions, lawsuits and investigations both in South Korea and elsewhere.  One promise on which President Yoon has been able to deliver, however, is the expected legalization of securities tokens, which are blockchain-based digital forms of traditional securities. In early February, South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) published guidelines on which security tokens will qualify for regulation under teh country's capital markets rules.  “STOs were not allowed under the legal system, but considering the digital paradigm shift and demand of the times we will permit the issuance of securities tokens and build a safe distribution system,” The Korea Herald quoted FSC Chairman Kim Joo-Hyun as saying in January.  Security tokens have not yet been officially legalized.  Non-security tokens – which include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether – are currently regulated under narrow Korean anti-money laundering regulations and Korean securities regulations, both of which are enforced by the FSC. Under the existing regulations, all but five Korean exchanges have been wiped out of the market.  The FSC acknowledged that regulations for non-securities tokens are shifting, telling CoinDesk in an email that “the government is providing active support for ongoing discussions [on digital assets regulation] taking place at the National Assembly.”  That shift could come sooner than expected, according to industry insiders like Cheong.  “The law will likely pass within this year,” Cheong said. “Both the Korean ruling party and opposing party agree on the necessity of protection of crypto-investors.”  Crypto-friendly culture  Part of that speed is due to the Korean government’s embrace of technology, which turned the once-poor country into an economic powerhouse in a matter of decades.  Under the government’s “Digital New Deal” – a nationwide initiative aimed at helping the country’s tech industry expand, which started under Korea’s previous president, Moon Jae-In – the Korean government plans to pour $8.7 billion into a variety of tech initiatives, from artificial intelligence (AI) to 6G to the metaverse. Through the initiative the Korean government hopes to create 2 million new jobs.  Nearly $200 million of the funds pledged to the Digital New Deal will go towards building out the country’s domestic metaverse ecosystem. When President Yoon entered into office, he announced 110 “national tasks” – 10 of which are related to the metaverse.  Read more: Why Is South Korea Throwing Money at the Metaverse?  Industry insiders told CoinDesk the Korean government is looking for a way to encourage the growth of the crypto industry, which it believes could lead to an economic boom for the country, while also protecting investors.  However, that’s easier said than done – and insiders also said that Korean lawmakers are nervous about making regulatory decisions that could backfire and lead their constituents to blame them for any ill-effects.  Kent Kim, founder of 3D metaverse platform Deother, told CoinDesk Korean lawmakers are skittish when it comes to regulating crypto.  “They’re old, they don’t want to study new things,” Kim said. “I talked to the public politicians in Korea … new things scared them to death.”  Chaebol supremacy  While the South Korean government has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in the name of consumer protection, industry insiders like Kent Kim feel that it’s unfair and “biased” that lawmakers openly embrace NFTs and the metaverse.  “Politicians don’t really care about the blockchain, and they don’t know much about NFTs or metaverse either. They are just populists,” Kim said. “They select purposefully, the topics that are very hot and safe and technology-driven.”  Both President Yoon Seok-youl and the Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung used NFTs as a part of their presidential campaigns to raise donations with young and crypto-savvy voters in early 2022.  Kim told CoinDesk the South Korean government won’t stand against Samsung – which accounts for a whopping 20% of South Korea’s gross domestic product (GDP) and holds serious political sway – or other chaebols for selling NFTs; instead, it embraces them.  “If you talk about a coin in Korea, people instantly [see] you as a scammer,” Kim told CoinDesk. “But, the funny thing is, when Samsung came out with a TV that you can sell your NFTs on, the government cannot attack Samsung.”  “The government will look at it and say ‘I’m going to use that, too’,” Kim added.

42410882,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsDDs,1674755762,Coinbase’s $3.6M Dutch Fine Shows Crypto Will Hit Road Bumps as It Goes Mainstream,"Coinbase’s fine for “very serious” breaches of Dutch crypto registration procedures reveals some of the many pitfalls the industry faces as it works towards operating within the regulatory fold.  The charge sheet from the Dutch central bank (DNB) outlining its decision to impose a sanction of 3,325,000 euros ($3.6 million) for serving local customers without approval shows multiple legal and procedural gray areas – and Coinbase, which is registered with DNB now, argues it is being punished for co-operating.  The size of the fine matches the one imposed on rival crypto exchange Binance last year, and for similar reasons. The DNB argues it’s justified by the gravity and scale of the violation, though Coinbase can still appeal, and may yet do so.  Coinbase originally applied for registration in September 2020 to offer exchange and wallet services – but it withdrew the application a few months later, unable to meet the strictures set by the DNB under an anti-money laundering law which, since 2020, has also applied to crypto.  Registration is a legal requirement to serve the Dutch market, but Coinbase didn’t actually gain the registration until 2022 – during which period it saw huge growth worldwide.  “There was a violation period of almost two years, during which the number of Dutch customers also doubled,” the DNB’s enforcement order said. “DNB therefore regards these violations as very serious.”  “Coinbase, as a globally operating provider of crypto services, should have been aware of the applicable laws and regulations,” it added. “DNB considers that Coinbase's actions are highly culpable.”  The tough stance does not come as a surprise from a country whose officials have been skeptical about retail access to crypto derivatives. The DNB has also issued warnings over KuCoin operating without a registration, and its governor, Klaas Knot, has hit out at underregulated crypto havens.  In a tweet sent Thursday, Paul Tang, a center-left Dutch member of the European Parliament, said the low level of the fine for selling risky products without a license was a “joke,” comparing the $3 million figure to the billions lost by investors in the crypto crash last year.  A spokesperson for Coinbase told CoinDesk it is still committed to compliance, but disagrees with the fine and is now considering whether to appeal. The company “should not be penalized for playing by the rules,” the spokesperson added, implying the DNB has unfairly targeted those who at least tried to engage with the process, and not those who ignored it entirely.  The document the DNB published on Thursday certainly exposes grounds for disagreement. It cites a “difference of opinion” between crypto providers and the DNB about exactly what verification requirements should apply to crypto wallets, and how far the regulator’s powers extend.  There’s also a dispute about whether Coinbase was offering services in the country at all. The company argued it didn’t have a marketing or ad campaign targeting the population, and that existing European Union rules on financial instrument trading should also apply to crypto marketing by analogy – but the DNB dug out a 2020 business plan that, it says, shows the company was focused on the Dutch market.  Such ambiguities are supposed to be resolved by forthcoming EU rules on the transfer of funds and on crypto asset markets. Those laws are supposed to detail what identity checks wallet providers need to carry out on their customers, and exactly when crypto providers can provide services to EU clients from overseas.  But in the meantime, the DNB fine shows regulators may paper over those gray areas with an approach that is resolutely black and white.

Crypto gaming is set for a breakout year in 2023, and one of the industry leaders is Illuvium. The release of Illuvium will be closely watched by many, as it could have a significant impact on the entire gaming industry. Originally posted on January 18, 2023 Can Illuvium (ILV-USD) live up to its hype and become the biggest crypto game universe with its 2023 full release? We review its positive tailwinds and possible risks. Crypto gaming is set for a breakout year in 2023, and one of the industry leaders is Illuvium. Illuvium is an upcoming series of games and the world's first Interoperable Blockchain Game universe offering a triple-A gaming experience. It includes an open-world exploration creature collector called Overworld , a city-builder called Zero , and auto-battler called Arena. All three games are built on the Ethereum blockchain. Scheduled for a full release in 2023, Illuvium aims to become the biggest crypto game universe on the market to date. In the face of a bear market in 2022, Illuvium has managed to maintain high expectations and engagement due to its transparent operations and robust team of creators. The Illuvium game universe is a 'game first/crypto second' project, and it boasts a tokenomics model that supports decentralized ownership and staking rewards. Although Illuvium benefits from positive tailwinds, there are also clear headwinds associated with the game launch tied to both crypto and traditional gaming-related risks and challenges. The Scoop on Illuvium: Interoperability and AAA Gaming We believe Illuvium could become a long-term winner in the crypto gaming ecosystem and even potentially compete directly with traditional AAA web2 games. Illuvium promises to build dynamic and interoperable functionality between three games within its universe, a feat not yet accomplished within the traditional web2 gaming space. VanEck Within the Illuvium ecosystem, interoperability means assets within one game can transfer between other games and therefore impact what happens in those other properties during gameplay. For example, players can collect Illuvials (Pokemon-like creatures that exist in the universe) in the Overworld game and can then use them as playable items in the Arena game. To be able to travel between regions in Overworld , players first need to mine (or buy) fuel in Zero . This would be similar to if items collected in Mario Odyssey could affect the player's race speed in Mario Kart. “Interoperability” is a classic metaverse buzzword with a fair bit of hype but currently lacks execution. Part of the problem is that although the underlying technology of blockchain can prove ownership, the transfer of assets between closed worlds - specifically games from different studios - is not functional. However, the transfer of said assets between games created by one studio - in this case, the studio behind Illuvium - is something that the Illuvium Game Universe aims to pioneer. We consider this the halfway point between a fully realized, interoperable metaverse experience and the currently siloed platforms that exist today. It’s a big step in the right direction. VanEck Illuvium's Successful Fundraising Allows for Focus on Game Development and Art The web2 gaming market is loosely bifurcated between triple-A games and indie games. Triple-A games require a much larger budget, development period, and marketing spend, while indie games are cheaper to make and easier to launch. Consider the difference between games like Fortnite or Call of Duty versus low-fi casual games like Among Us or Fall Guys . The vast majority of crypto games launched so far would be considered indie by traditional web2 video game industry standards. We believe Illuvium represents the first true triple-A game to be launched within the crypto game ecosystem. Naturally, this necessitates a longer runway and more funding. The funding behind Illuvium has come primarily from token issuance and a massively successful NFT land sale. In March 2021, the project raised approximately $5.5 million in a seed round, and $38 million at TGE (Token Generation Event). In June of 2022, Illuvium raised $72 million (amid a bear market) in a land sale of nearly 20,000 NFTs representing plots of land in the game environment. These plots of land hold consumable digital items that need to be mined via Zero to facilitate gameplay in Overworld . Illuvium’s ability to raise such a large war chest gives it a heavy advantage over other crypto-native games. It will allow it to compete directly with the web2 triple-A gaming category. Development and marketing are the two main drivers of the cost that make games so expensive. Because Illuvium has been so successful in its organic marketing strategy, it has allowed the project to focus more on game development and art. Illuvium has 60-70 developers working on gameplay and around 90 artists fleshing out design. Illuvium’s advantage against other crypto games cannot be overstated when it comes to development and art, which is a direct result of successful fundraising and a highly talented and skilled team. The question then becomes – Can Illuvium compete with traditional triple-A video games that are already dominating the market (Fortnite, Pokemon, etc.)? Illuvium's Tokenomics Model and the ImmutableX Partnership Illuvium has the potential to be the first blockchain game to successfully create a token economy that thrives and rewards its gaming community for spending more time in the game. Players and investors may benefit from the growth of Illuvium in multiple ways due to the structure of the in-game economy and the characteristics of the gameplay that the Illuvium team has created. Illuvium will attempt to drive value back to the users through both their ILV token holdings and the NFTs that players will accumulate from gameplay. Illuvium intends to redistribute 100% of the revenue generated by the game back to ILV stakers by using ETH spent in-game to purchase ILV and fund staking rewards. Stakers will also benefit from the revenue generated by trading via the Illuvidex - the game’s marketplace - where a 5% fee on volume is used to repurchase ILV and distribute it as staking rewards. There are 10 million ILV, of which 5% went to pre-seed investors, 15% to seed investors, 15% to the team, 15% to the treasury, 10% to the Illuvium launchpad, 30% for staking rewards, and 10% for in-game rewards. Additionally, players who don’t want to buy the ILV token will still be able to profit from their gameplay, thanks to how the Illuvium team has designed gameplay. Unlike other blockchain games that use NFT characters to breed more NFTs (which can be inflationary), Illuvium is implementing a “fusing” mechanism that allows players to combine three of the same Illuvials into one stronger Illuvial with evolved characteristics (which in turn is deflationary). Furthermore, each type of Illuvial is associated with a bonding curve, making them rarer for every additional illuvial captured. These two mechanisms will help drive the scarcity of Illuvials and bolster Illuvial trading. Eventually, players will seek to buy certain Illuvials rather than capture them due to their rarity in the open world. Illuvium is also launching via the ImmutableX layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This partnership makes sense for Illuvium in many ways. First, they can avoid paying for minting millions of NFTs, which would be economically impossible on most blockchain - ImmutableX’s zero-knowledge rollup technology allows them to provide a gasless blockchain experience for users and supports their goal of becoming the destination for the top web3 games. Second, ImmutableX has partnered with GameStop and their community of over 50 million gamers which can provide Illuvium direct access to one of the largest communities of web2 gamers. Third, ImmutableX is an aggregated liquidity layer for NFTs, meaning NFT items can be sold directly through in-game marketplaces rather than requiring users to purchase or sell their NFT assets in third-party marketplaces such as OpenSea. All Aboard the Illuvium Hype Train? Illuvium is easily one of the most highly anticipated crypto game releases in history. The project has a substantial social media following, its own token, and NFT collections that are actively traded on secondary market websites like OpenSea. Many would argue that Illuvium is the first true triple-A crypto title in that the size and breadth of development far exceed the majority of other live or beta games in development. Illuvium has managed to build successfully, and maintain, a steady drumbeat of sustained hype and attention in the years the game has been in development. As a result of Illuvium's massive social media following, the game already had an organically built player base before its release . According to Illuvium’s founder Kieran Warwick, the project’s marketing strategy focused on organic growth instead of paid efforts. Illuvium focused specifically on DeFi communities by creating promotional NFTs to entice users to join and engage with the Illuvium community. Illuvium’s discord membership grew to over 70,000 members within three months, placing it in the top ten discords of the entire world in 2021. Since then, Illuvium has maintained a steady drumbeat of anticipation and community-building by building the project out in the open. This equates to regular updates on game mechanics, art, and other development-related teasers to keep the community engaged. In addition to a strong social media following, Illuvium’s token ILV boasts a nearly half-billion-dollar market cap. While the token has fallen significantly from its 2021 highs, a fully diluted valuation of $485m indicates that crypto investors are betting that the game shows serious promise.

The position of Illuvium in comparison with its competition is favorable, especially considering the game hasn't launched yet. In terms of social followers and market cap, Axie Infinity is by far the leader. Still, once Illuvium's games are released in 2023, we believe that it has the potential to become the leader in all categories. Four Possible Risks: Illuvium's Success Remains Uncertain Even though there are many positive tailwinds behind Illuvium, there are still risks inherent to launching a new crypto game. A failed launch can happen even to traditional studios - just look at Cyberpunk 2077 in 2020. We outline four possible challenges that could pose risks to Illuvium’s success. 1. The hype train fails to leave the station. Two of the proposed three games are now released in beta form, but the full game hasn’t yet been launched with full functionality. It's possible that the game won't be well received once it's released in its entirety. The tides of popularity and momentum in gaming can change rapidly, and they can change even more often in the crypto gaming world. 2. Regulation in the U.S. classifies ILV token as a security. With the collapse of FTX, many crypto analysts predict that new regulations could classify a large swath of non-bitcoin crypto tokens as securities. If this were to happen, Illuvium’s tokenomics model could fall apart, and US players would not be able to buy the ILV token for staking purposes. 3. The community onboarded months ago isn’t engaged anymore. Illuvium’s token was launched in the first half of 2021, and the NFT land sale occurred in the summer of 2022. Early token holders will be approaching a two-year holding period before a game is launched. Two years of anticipation is standard for triple-A video games, BUT from a metrics point of view, how many of those original players are still engaged? Weekly average users and token price mean much more than social metrics, so the game needs to launch before more meaningful engagement metrics can be analyzed thoroughly. 4. Fortnite (or a web2 equivalent) successfully integrates NFTs. As we saw with the Reddit NFT integrations late in 2022, a successful launch of a web3 product from a web2 platform is going to attract both new and existing web3 entrants. If an existing web2 game successfully launches an NFT, this could theoretically pull players from the Illuvium ecosystem and reduce engagement. Conclusion Overall, we believe Illuvium is poised to be a significant player in the world of crypto gaming in 2023. Despite the challenges of a bear market, the game has maintained high levels of interest, an engaged community, and a robust team of creators. If Illuvium is successful in its full release in 2023, it could serve as a model for other game studios looking to create web3 games that can potentially compete with web2, triple-A games. The release of Illuvium will be closely watched by many, as it could have a significant impact on the entire gaming industry.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial.

42393910,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3fL,1674754272,5 Web3 Marketing Tips to Try in 2023,"With 2023 around the corner, there is a lot to look forward to when it comes to Web3. For both individuals and businesses, 2023 will provide an opportunity to experiment with Web3-related technologies and put down roots in the growing ecosystem.  While several aspects of this emerging technology will come into the spotlight in 2023, this article focuses specifically on Web3 marketing and how it directly impacts adoption. Here, we will highlight some of the Web3 marketing strategies that you should try in 2023.  But first, let us define Web3 and why it is important to consider marketing strategies tailor-made for the Web3 ecosystem.  What is Web3?  Web3 is the emerging iteration of the internet that focuses on three key factors:  Decentralization: Users do not need permission from a centralized entity to post or access content on the internet. Web3 is also trustless, meaning that there are no intermediaries or third parties facilitating interactions.  Privacy: Web3 users have full autonomy over their personal data and can decide how and with whom it is shared.  Optimal content monetization: Web3 users have more say on how their personal data and content are shared. Hence, advertisers and service providers incentivize users to acquire permission to access personal data. Also, content creators who drive traffic can claim a significant share of ad revenue.  In contrast, Web2, which is still the most dominant Web iteration, promotes user-generated content but establishes service providers as gatekeepers.  The prevalence of Web2 gatekeepers often leads to content censorship, unauthorized monetization of users' personal data, incessant privacy breaches and unfair distribution of ad revenue.  Simply put, Web3 looks to do away with Web2's centralized framework so that users have more control over their personal data and content.  Due to the disparities between Web2 and Web3, it is no surprise that Web2 marketing strategies are increasingly becoming obsolete in the Web3 space. In light of this, businesses must evolve accordingly and implement tools and concepts that are compatible with the user-centric model of the Web3 market, which is expected to generate $23.3 billion in revenue by 2028, up from $2.9 billion in 2021.  Web3 marketing strategies ideal for 2023  1. Focus on building a community  Because users own their personal data and content on Web3, they replace service providers as the custodians of data on the decentralized internet.  Therefore, in 2023 brands need to go the extra mile to build a trust-driven relationship with users in order to attract engagement and ultimately access users' personal data. One way to do this is to promote a community-based business model that gives users a sense of belonging. The main factor to consider when building communities is what your brand can do for its users. The goal is to become the glue that connects like-minded individuals. Brands can achieve this by providing a platform that promotes conversations that resonate with individuals who make up their target audience. For instance, a decentralized alternative to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook need to focus on content and conversations that appeal to an audience critical of censorship which prohibits free speech.  2. Implement a reward and privilege-based economy  Considering that community building is the focal point for Web3 marketing, brands that offer special privileges to users are at an advantage. Users tend to go all-out to promote a brand when active engagements yield rewards.  For instance, brands should consider creating a token and distributing it among users based on their levels of participation. This is similar to how Reddit distributes digital avatars to selected Redditors.  Note that these tokens do not necessarily need to have monetary value to be effective. Instead, the tokens can provide access to special events or give holders priority during the launch of items like non-fungible token (NFT) collections and exclusive merchandise.  3. Provide immersive virtual experience  The growing appeal of the metaverse, which incorporates virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and the internet, is one of the major talking points in the Web3 space. Experts believe that it will be at the center of the next phase in the evolution of social networking. If this is the case, brands must stay on top of this trend to remain relevant.  In light of this, it is advisable to start experimenting with the 3D marketing possibilities that the metaverse provides. Below are some of the ways to create awareness via the metaverse.  Buy virtual lands: Brands can start by purchasing virtual lands in the metaverse and building 3D properties.  Host events in the metaverse: Brands can also create awareness by hosting virtual events in the metaverse.  Launch NFTs on the metaverse: It is possible to create 3D-based models of products and make them available as NFTs in the metaverse. For example, a shoe brand can create virtual shoes that can be used to accessorize avatars in the metaverse.  Whichever approach you opt for, the goal is to create immersive 3D content that will appeal to your community. Platforms like Decentraland and Sandbox have already made great strides in this space.  4. Do away with Web3 complexities  When Reddit launched its Collectible Avatars, it intentionally avoided using terms ""NFT"" and ""crypto"" to describe its products, even though the avatars are non-fungible tokens. Although it is impossible to accurately measure the impact of this strategy, the success of Reddit avatars shows that simplicity (and in this case using language that users are already familiar with) breeds adoption.  Hence, when marketing your Web3 project, try to do away with crypto jargon and focus on familiar terms and processes. This strategy is particularly essential for brands targeting an audience that has yet to fully grasp the essence of the Web3 movement.  5. Capitalize on-chain data  Data is critical to the success of Web3 marketing strategies. It eliminates the need for brands to rely on data brokers. Instead, they can source data directly from the blockchain. Armed with users' on-chain data, it becomes easier to implement effective Web3 marketing strategies.  For instance, a sports brand can connect to its target audience by distributing free tokens to addresses that hold sport-related NFTs or coins. This initiative allows the company to prioritize users who have shown interest in sports via their crypto interactions. Additionally, the company can require owners of these addresses to complete promotional tasks, like following the company's social media accounts, to become eligible to claim the free tokens.

8282001,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517643,1674754241,"Ethereum Hovers Above $1,600, What’s The Next Move?","The general crypto market has increased in market cap in 24 hours, up by 2.89%. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto project, is also trading in the green in the same time period. Despite being so early in 2023, ETH has recorded significant price gains in the crypto market. Ethereum is still off its all-time high value, but its price shows resilience with the current upsurge. Related Reading: This Is How The Bitcoin Price Will Be Affected By Macro: Charles Edwards What Is Driving Ethereum’s Rally? The recent gains recorded could be attributed to the notable projects hosted on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most popular blockchain for NFTs. The blockchain is also the pioneer of smart contracts, which is now the widely adopted technology in crypto. These smart contracts enable crypto users to interact seamlessly and securely on the blockchain. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is one of the innovations on the Ethereum network. ENS is a distributed naming system that helps to shorten a cryptocurrency address by assigning readable names to eliminate confusion. Also, ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency project by market cap and the first altcoin. Its innovative proof-of-stake system is more energy efficient and attracts increased participation from the crypto community. The network is renowned as a developer’s hub with numerous Web3 and Metaverse projects. What Next For Ethereum As It Crosses $1,600? ETH recovered from the general market pullback yesterday, trading at $1,605, an increase of 3.81%. The candlesticks on the chart show that ETH has been in an uptrend in the past few days. However, it is currently in a sideways trend and is poised to resume its ascent on the price charts. ETH’s price correlates to bitcoin’s price, just like most cryptocurrencies, increasing whenever BTC is bullish. ETH is now trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is a bullish signal for the asset, so there could be an increase in ETH’s price in the coming days. The support levels are $1,452.32, $1,495.32, and $1,560.14, and its resistance levels are $1,667.95, $1,710.67, and $1,775.77. Ethereum has sufficient momentum in the market today and will likely surpass the closest resistance level of $1,667.95.

Up to 20 stablecoins will be analyzed within the system, which will not represent an official credit rating, based on the quality of evidence on the reserves backing them. A stablecoin is a digital token whose value is pegged to a reference asset, typically fiat currencies (think U.S. dollar) or commodities (think gold). Stablecoin issuers typically achieve the peg by maintaining reserve assets as collateral. The move comes as stablecoin reserve attestations have faced more scrutiny in recent years, coinciding with the increased usage of the tokens. In 2021, dollar-pegged stablecoin tether ( USDT-USD ) was fined by U.S. authorities for being dishonest about its reserves, Bloomberg noted. Tether ( USDT-USD ), the largest stablecoin by market cap, said on Dec. 14, 2022 it will reduce the ""overcollateralized"" secured loans in its reserves to zero throughout 2023.

The FTX founder’s brother, mother and father were his “advisors,” and should be subpoenaed alongside former company executives as the company’s new management seeks to find out what happened to allegedly misappropriated funds, the filing said.  “The Debtors and their advisors have been working tirelessly and nonstop over the last 70 plus days … to implement controls, recover and protect estate assets,” said the legal filing made jointly by FTX and creditor representatives. “Key questions remain, however, concerning numerous aspects of the Debtors’ finances and transactions,"" the filing continued.  FTX wants to know who received potentially stolen funds from FTX, and what communications they had with its executives – but alleges that some potential witnesses aren't playing ball despite requests to cooperate voluntarily.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried, “has ignored the requests altogether,” the attorneys say, while “the debtors have not received meaningful engagement or any response from [former chief engineer Nishad] Singh or Mr. Gabriel Bankman-Fried,” Sam’s brother.  Discussions with lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried's father, Joseph Bankman, are ""ongoing"" and were expected to lead to a consensual outcome, the filing said.  FTX, known in bankruptcy proceedings as the Debtor, alleges that Gabriel Bankman-Fried’s lobbying organization, Guarding Against Pandemics, “purchased a multimillion-dollar property a few blocks from the United States Capital [sic], which the debtors believe was purchased using misappropriated customer funds.”  Fried’s political action committee, Mind the Gap, also allegedly received donations from Sam Bankman-Fried and other FTX staffers, and both parents “resided in a $16.4 million [Bahamas] house titled in their names, despite understanding that the house was ‘intended to be the company’s property’,” the filing said.  In an emailed statement, Marissa McBride, Executive Director of Mind the Gap, told CoinDesk that “Sam Bankman-Fried contributed to some of the programs that Mind the Gap recommended to its network, but he did not make any direct contributions to Mind the Gap,” and that the group publicly discloses all contributions received to the Federal Election Commission.  Sam Bankman-Fried should also be subpoenaed by the court, the filing said, as should FTX co-founder Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, chief executive of trading firm Alameda Research, who, the filing said, “expressly declined to provide the requested information.”  The request will be discussed at a Feb. 8 hearing in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware.

Then again, neither does Elizabeth Warren.  New cryptocurrency laws are likely coming in the U.S. whether the industry likes it or not. A salubrious outcome would be legislation that helps protect consumers without undermining, and maybe furthering, crypto’s promise of financial autonomy.  Here’s an idea.  What if Congress mandated the separation of crypto custody and crypto exchange? In other words, a company could be licensed to match buy orders and sell orders between investors, or it could be allowed to store crypto on a customer’s behalf. No firm would be permitted to do both. At most, an exchange could administer an escrow account holding funds for agreed-upon, uncompleted trades. It would never be allowed to act as a de facto bank.  Marc Hochstein is the executive editor of Consensus, CoinDesk's flagship annual event. The views expressed are his own, so please don't take it out on his colleagues. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week.  Think about it.  From the Mt. Gox debacle nearly a decade ago to FTX’s collapse last year, a lesson that crypto users keep learning over and over again is captured by the alliterative slogan, “not your keys, not your coins.” Bitcoin and its descendants and copycats are digital bearer assets, more akin to physical coins, banknotes or gold bars than to the digital money in a bank account. Once crypto is gone, it’s gone. If you hand it to a third party to hold it for you, you are trusting it to A) not get hacked and lose the funds, B) not misuse or abscond with the funds and C) give your crypto back when you ask for it.  Time and time again we’ve seen exchanges fail at one or more of these jobs. Yet, too many users continue to trust exchanges to hold their money rather than practicing self-custody (storing coins in a wallet whose cryptographic private keys only they control) or using a hybrid arrangement like a multisignature (multisig) wallet (controlled by multiple keyholders).  Segregation of funds  The most obvious reason to separate trading from custody is to prevent commingling of funds, e.g., FTX’s alleged use of customers’ money to bail out its founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm. Already we’re hearing policymakers make noises along these lines. For example, here’s Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler in a September speech:  The commingling of the various functions within crypto intermediaries creates inherent conflicts of interest and risks for investors. Thus, I’ve asked staff to work with intermediaries to ensure they register each of their functions – exchange, broker-dealer, custodial functions, and the like – which could result in disaggregating their functions into separate legal entities to mitigate conflicts of interest and enhance investor protection.  Separate legal entities sounds like a good start, but why not go further and forbid such activities to take place under the same corporate roof? There’s a legendary precedent for this.  Four years after the 1929 stock market crash, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking (the high-risk activities of Wall Street) from commercial banking (the kind of banking Jimmy Stewart’s character practices in “It’s a Wonderful Life”). The restriction was gradually loosened over the course of the 20th century and eventually lifted in 1999 with the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. While the causes of the 2008 global financial crisis were complex and hotly debated, many have argued that the removal of Glass-Steagall’s firewall was a big contributing factor.  Financial regulators in the U.S. have erected similar fences separating banking from commerce and mortgage insurance from title insurance. Just as most people don’t bathe where they cook (though I did once view a flat in London that had a shower in the kitchen – true story), regulators and lawmakers have often concluded there are different types of financial activities that are unhealthy to undertake in close proximity. FTX’s alleged commingling would seem to suggest crypto custody and crypto exchange are two such activities.  I’ve probably already lost the hardcore libertarians in the audience. I respect their worldview but, as noted, in the wake of FTX’s meltdown politicians are out for blood (and photo ops), so some kind of reforms are probably inevitable.  The pragmatic (or, if you prefer, crony capitalist) crypto companies that engage with (or, if you prefer, spend boatloads to lobby) lawmakers may object to my suggestion as well. I imagine they’d balk that it would amount to a ban on centralized crypto exchanges, forcing expensive restructurings of such firms and leaving only decentralized ones operating in the U.S.  To which I say:  Why are we even here?  Why not take the opportunity to incentivize users to do what old hands in crypto have been advising them to do for years? Why not drive them to use decentralized exchanges that don’t custody funds and to either keep their digital assets under their full control or, if they don’t trust themselves to safeguard their keys, use a multisig setup? Isn’t self-sovereignty one of the reasons we’re all here?  One might counter that self-hosted crypto wallets and decentralized exchanges are difficult for everyday consumers to use, and so leaving these as the only permitted on-ramps would slow adoption. Well … tough tiddlywinks. How did “mass adoption” work out last time? For the next few years, whenever most people hear the word “crypto,” they are going to think of Bankman-Fried's casino and the people who lost their life savings.  FTX’s Super Bowl ad pitched the exchange as “the safe and easy way to get into crypto.” Easy, maybe, but it sure wasn’t safe. Maybe the industry should worry less about making things easy (which often entails centralization) and concentrate a bit more on helping people achieve crypto’s purported ends. Stop conditioning consumers to be the helpless Eloi in H.G. Wells’ “The Time Machine,” unless you want them to get eaten by subterranean Morlocks.  Meanwhile, a push toward decentralized exchanges would bolster development and innovation in that part of the industry which is still largely propped up by a few dedicated, idealistic developers. With demand comes investment and growth. One of the biggest pain points in using decentralized exchanges (for bitcoin, at least) is low volumes. More participants would address that problem.  Besides, “this would slow mass adoption!” might be a selling point on Capitol Hill, particularly with lawmakers like Sen. Warren, who is clearly skeptical of the technology’s benefits. A Glass-Steagall-like firewall could even be a bargaining chip to get the more zealous policymakers to back off efforts to enlist software developers, miners and other blockchain network participants as unpaid snitches for the government. Maybe this could give crypto-friendly lawmakers the leverage to stop regulators from applying the travel rule – which requires financial institutions to share senders’ and receivers’ sensitive personal information with each other as part of a money transfer – to wallets controlled by individuals.  Anyway, just a thought. I’m sure there are better ideas. Speaking of which …  Shameless plug time  For much smarter answers to the tough policy questions facing the industry than my half-baked trolling above, Consensus 2023 will include an all-day Crypto Policy Forum on April 28.  Regulators, lawmakers and industry stakeholders will discuss the policy fallout from the 2022 market crash, the advance of central bank digital currencies, the tensions around stablecoin regulation, the widening enforcement of anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism rules against cryptocurrency services and the challenges in applying 20th century securities laws to 21st century decentralized protocols. Check out the preliminary agenda here. There will also be opportunities for more intimate discussions of the thorniest issues offstage – stay tuned for more details on that.

It should also show that the business has policies, systems and controls to manage risk, the FCA said.  Crypto service providers with a registered head office in the U.K. and that run their operations in the country are expected to apply with the FCA and those that do should have a money laundering reporting officer who ""should be fully involved in the preparation of the application,"" the FCA said on its page.

Here’s how this may impact the crypto’s price. Litecoin Transactions Valued Higher Than $1 Million Have Surged According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the last two spikes led to significant rises in the price. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of Litecoin transactions taking place on the blockchain that involve coins worth at least $1 million. When the value of this metric is high, it means there are a large number of whale transactions happening on the network right now. Such a trend suggests these humongous holders are actively trading currently. As the volume of coins involved in transfers like these is very sizeable, a high amount of whale transactions can sometimes cause noticeable effects on the market. Thus, whenever the indicator’s value is high, LTC is likely to see more volatility than usual. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin whale transaction counts over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin whale transaction count has recently spiked and hit the highest values observed since December 28. This would suggest that whales have become active again. Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin PnL Index Forms Bullish Crossover In the chart, Santiment has also marked the trends that the price of LTC followed the last couple of times this cohort showed elevated activity. It looks like the most recent instance was last month when LTC’s price was observing some high volatility. Following these large number of whale transactions, Litecoin soon formed a local bottom and went on to rally around 33%. Another instance of this trend was during the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, where once again high values of the metric accompanied significant volatility in the value of LTC. After this instance as well, the crypto enjoyed some sharp uptrend as the price rose to 37% over the next few weeks. Since the Litecoin whales are active right now, the crypto could soon witness similarly high volatility. Though, which way this volatility may ultimately take the coin’s price is uncertain, as while these whales could be buying right now (which would be bullish), they could just as well be selling with these transactions (naturally a bearish factor).

Polkadot Eco-Friendliness To Drive Positive Momentum January was phenomenal for most cryptocurrencies that are enjoying a price rally, but DOT was seen struggling and was unable to reach its pre-FTX levels. On a positive note, DOT was the only asset that consumed the least electricity when pitted against other cryptocurrencies. This eco-friendly quality of DOT can drive positive momentum for the coin.

Social Metrics Up For DOT The number of people staking DOT has also increased by over 6.2% as seen in the past month which also hints at a positive streak for the asset. More so, social metrics have also increased for DOT. Social mentions spiked by 7.6% with engagements shooting over 26K.

8277236,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517626,1674747022,Cardano (ADA) Continues To Shine With 15% Gains In the Last Week,"Cardano’s native coin ADA has seen many rallies since the start of this year. The token owes its performance to the improving economic condition in the market and the ongoing developments on the Cardano Network. Over the past seven days, ADA has observed more than a 15% price gain in 7 days and an over 17% 14-day gain. But what are the possible reasons for ADA’s impressive performance? Related Reading: CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin PnL Index Forms Bullish Crossover What Is Contributing To ADA’s Price Rally? The hype around the upcoming Djed stablecoin launch, among others, has played a part in driving ADA price up over the past weeks in January. According to COTI developers, the network behind the Djed stablecoins, ADA holders would receive extra rewards when they mint Djed by staking their ADA coins. This information might spur users to buy more ADA and could further push the coin price. Also, the Cardano community is anticipating upcoming launches that would enhance the network and Smart Contract capabilities. Furthermore, Cardano has received a new improvement proposal known as CIP-30. This improvement proposal would allow the integration of web-based wallet bridges that would promote interaction between Cardano wallets and Web2 platforms like Amazon. It would allow ADA more use cases and adoptions and ensure increased growth for Cardano, positioning it to meet more market needs. This development could be among the factors fuelling ADA’s price gain. Another new development on the Cardano network that might be fuelling the ADA price rally is the eTukTuk automotive project launch. According to the announcement, the Cardano blockchain would be hosting the project. The project allows users to earn rewards using the eTukTuk electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Users can access the service using TUK, eTukTuk native token, but they need to hold ADA since the project anchors on Cardano. That also could be boosting ADA prices upward. ADA Price Outlook The Cardano cryptocurrency, ADA, has gained over 6% in the last 24 hours. ADA hit an eleven-week high of $0.384 on January 22 before taking a hit over the past 48 hours. Its price dropped 6.4% on the day while retracing its support levels. However, ADA is currently trading at $0.3833 with a 24-hour high of $0.3866 and a low of $0.354580 after declining over the last six hours. The reversal could present a chance for the bulls to accumulate tokens in anticipation of Djed launch, which might push the ADA price forward. From the technical view, ADA is showing a buy signal. The oscillators fluctuate between neutral and buy, and the Moving Averages show a strong buy signal. The token’s price is currently hovering at $0.3833, representing a 6.43 % increase in its value in 24 hours. It has broken above its 50-day Simple Moving Average, indicating a short-term bullish sentiment for Cardano. However, it is below its 200-day SMA, meaning the asset price can become bearish in the coming weeks. The current support levels are $0.324253, $0.335986, and $0.354289, while the resistance levels are $0.384326, $0.396059, and $0.414363. ADA will likely not surpass the $0.384326 level in the coming days since the bears are sustaining their charge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 68.39, close to the overbought zone. However, a retracement can occur anytime soon. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line but shows convergence, which is a bearish signal. Expect the price of ADA to record slight gains before retracing to the $0.36 price level in the coming days.

42435130,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdorXm,1674746878,Derivatives Body ISDA Hopes New Digital-Asset Norms Will Prevent FTX-Style Losses,"New digital-asset standards could prevent legal messes such as those faced by collapsed crypto exchange FTX, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said in a paper it published on Thursday.  ISDA, whose 1,000 members include major banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and HSBC (HSBC), set out new digital-asset standards and guidance for navigating crypto bankruptcies.  “Recent failures in the crypto market have emphasized the importance of having a clear, consistent contractual framework that spells out the rights and obligations of both parties following a default,” ISDA CEO Scott O’Malia said in a statement, adding that new definitions would help in bankruptcy cases.  Further guidance also seeks to prevent creditors from getting left in the lurch by yearslong bankruptcy cases. While many in the crypto industry believe ownership is determined only by passwords – “not your keys, not your coins,” as the saying goes – judges may take some convincing.  “The FTX collapse indicates that such [ownership] norms are still evolving (or may not yet exist) in the cryptocurrency markets,” the ISDA's document said. “When these issues are not well understood by market participants or the risks are not properly managed, unanticipated and significant loss of capital can emerge.”  The document examines how assets and liabilities can be netted off and how collateral can be enforced when bankruptcies occur, and another paper due in the coming months will look at crypto assets stored with intermediaries, ISDA said.  Multiple crypto firms have filed for bankruptcy in the last year, including crypto lenders Celsius Network and BlockFi, broker Voyager Digital, exchange FTX and last week Genesis, a crypto lender that is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.  In August, the International Securities Lending Association started looking at the parallel issue of the legal risks when crypto assets such as bitcoin (BTC) are used to back loans.

Looking back at the past few months, the renowned expert said those have put the market in a position where Bitcoin offers “a great position for long-term investors.” As Edwards noted, almost every sentiment metric imaginable fell into the “biggest or second-biggest bearish” range in macro, equities, and crypto. “Pretty much anyone would have said on Twitter last year that we are in a recession or it’s coming to a recession,” the analyst continued. While Edwards acknowledged that the risk of a recession is far from gone, many key metrics have come back quite a bit. Among them is the housing market, which is slowing and often leads the overall economy. “So there are a number of metrics which suggest things are slowing down a bit. You got all the big tech names laying off employees and you see this in crypto as well. 10% to 20% cuts have not been unusual in the last months,” the founder of Capriole Investments asserted. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Increase as The Bulls Aim Larger Rally To $25K Furthermore, he pointed out an interesting fact: every time inflation peaked above 5% and then fell by more than 20%, the U.S. central bank pivoted. This observation holds true for the last 60 years. “So I think there is a high probability the Fed stops raising rates or reducing rates,” Edwards concluded and further said: And then we have this deep value situation in crypto which has been playing out the last 3 or 4 months. And all that sets up a great opportunity for long-term investors in crypto and equities, as well, risk assets in general. Fed Pivot Will Propel Bitcoin Upwards Within 6 Months In general, it is difficult to predict when there will be a regime change at the Fed. However, Edwards believes it will happen within the next 3-6 months. After the forced liquidations in the Bitcoin market over the past 12 months, there is currently no longer any significant selling pressure. Therefore, according to the Capriole Investments founder, there will be a liquidity crisis on the sell side once larger amounts of Bitcoin buyers return to the market, leading to a squeeze to the upside. “And we saw that kind of short-squeeze play out in the first weeks of January.” As for the Fed pivot, investors should keep an eye on specific data. While the consensus now seems to be that the Fed will change monetary policy, there are still some risks. Edwards pointed to history in this regard, warning that inflation could rise again. In the 1970s inflation went through a roller coaster ride and that could be the case for the next 5 to 10 years as well. But I do think the base case for me is at least a rate pause this year, at some point in the coming months. Related Reading: Banking Giant Goldman Sachs Ranks Bitcoin As World Best Performing Asset Moreover, investors should be cautious when employment remains very high. This is “probably the single most important factor leading to recessions.” While this data point is still incredibly strong currently, it could change “any month now” given the layoffs in the big tech sector, according to Edwards. Equities are also worth considering, he said. If they hit new highs, or if earnings are very strong, if manufacturing picks up and inflation is still at 5% to 6%, then the Fed might think it can keep going because everything is still fine. However, Edwards’s base case looks different: I think 2023 will generally be a positive year because the Bitcoin price will probably be higher at the end of the year […], but there will be a lot of volatility.

42421401,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzrB,1674743347,Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves,"The failures that have occurred in the crypto space over the past year have led some voices in the ecosystem to prophesy that “regulation is coming,” and that it’s just what the crypto industry needs to mature and evolve.  While I agree more regulation is needed and would be helpful, many in government – our federal prudential regulators in particular – seem intent on the opposite: keeping crypto outside of the regulated system.  Their posture is not, ""We’ve seen what’s happened with FTX and others and think it’s time we bring regulation to the space to make it safer.""  Rather, it seems to be: ""We don’t want to have any responsibility for this space that we think is disreputable and risky, and we certainly don’t want to be seen as legitimizing it by regulating it.""  Matthew Homer, a CoinDesk columnist, is a VC investor and adviser to founders in the crypto space. This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's Policy Week.  What does this mean for founders and companies operating in this space? If the past two years were about educating government, the next two will need to be about earning their respect as a necessary precondition for trust.  This might mean starting to look more like the institutions they already regulate and are familiar with. Rather than saying you deserve to be part of the financial system, you’ll need to show it.  One way to do that is by putting in place time-tested best practices that exist in other areas of financial services: corporate governance, risk management, internal controls and a culture of regulatory compliance.  Some in the crypto space already take these things seriously, but we need more to do so because it will be up to those working in space – not government – to make it trusted and last the test of time.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton - After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  The recent Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a good illustration of the federal government’s regulatory posture.  The key lines are the following: ""The agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored or transferred on an open, public and/or decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.""  And: ""It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system.""  We think crypto is simply too risky to be part of the regulated system. We can’t tell you definitively that you can’t touch this stuff, but please know we’ll be very displeased and make your life difficult if you choose to do so.  Or put more plainly in my own words: We think crypto is simply too risky to be part of the regulated system. We can’t tell you definitively that you can’t touch this stuff, but please know we’ll be very displeased and make your life difficult if you choose to do so.  While this is a broad-brush approach with echoes of Operation Choke Point, it’s hard to argue their fears are unjustified after the events of last year, even if it is ultimately unworkable to keep open, public and/or decentralized networks segregated from other areas of financial services for long. As Somerset Maugham put it in “The Razor’s Edge,” one “might as well try to hold back the waters of Mississippi with [their] bare hands.”  While we may get some regulation through legislation, don’t expect regulators to voluntarily roll out new regulatory proposals accompanied by the notice and comment periods of yesteryear.  See also: Matt Homer – The Infuriating Patchwork of Crypto Regulations Is Good for Crypto  Rather than waiting for that to occur and hoping for a clear road map to emerge, executives and founders in the space should look to the best practices that exist elsewhere in banking and other mature areas of financial services and implement them as quickly as possible.

Towards the end of 2021, the crypto market was at an all-time high, reaching a market cap of $3 trillion. These soaring heights have been met in 2022 with painful lows because the crypto market has sunk to less than a third of its value from the previous year.  Crypto enthusiasts will point to a struggling global economy; crypto skeptics will say that the bubble has finally burst. It is true that the crypto market in 2022 has witnessed some seismic events – the implosion of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem and the bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and BlockFi to name a few.  Laura Navaratnam is director of Gattaca Horizons and the former head of fintech at the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

So what for 2023? The crypto market is continuing to feel the aftershocks. Although the contagion hasn’t spread into mainstream financial markets, policymakers fear that it could. We therefore look set to witness a 2023 marked by regulatory intervention.  The US  In the U.S., we will likely see a continued and strengthened differentiation between different categories of digital assets. The Biden Administration's executive order (EO) on “cryptoassets” published in March made it clear that crypto is “here to stay,” with many federal agencies publishing subsequent detailed responses. The concept of a “digital dollar” received support in these reports, though there was substantial skepticism with respect to broader blockchain-based assets. However, these responses didn’t cover the detailed policy interventions that some had feared, such as banning certain crypto assets or requiring crypto providers to be banks.  Although a relief for many in the crypto industry, the executive order still left the door open for more detailed policy proposals to be brought up through legislation. Most notably, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), the bill championed by none other than Sam Bankman-Fried, remains in progress.  See also: The ‘SBF Bill’: What’s in the Crypto Legislation Backed by FTX's Founder  While the DCCPA has run into some recent opposition for granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) broad oversight over the spot crypto markets (instead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), it will still be a key baseline for debate in the new Congress. The bill is currently backed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and ranking member Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.).  Moreover, it is noteworthy that long-time crypto skeptic and chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) recently sent U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen a letter expressing, for the first time, his willingness to work on crypto legislation. We could finally see bipartisan agreement in 2023 on key issues surrounding stablecoins and broader digital asset oversight and potential regulatory clarity on the allowable limits of banks seeking to engage with crypto.  Across the pond  In the U.K., although mired with its own political problems during 2022, the ambition set in April to be a crypto hub seems to be holding. Current U.K. Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith reiterated the country's commitment to becoming a key center for the nascent industry, saying the collapse of FTX isn't a reason to change course.  With the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB) making its way through Parliament, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is poised to take on broad new powers to regulate crypto markets.  However, firms hoping for a forward leaning approach from the regulator will likely be disheartened by incoming FCA Chair Ashley Alder’s comments at a recent Treasury Select Committee hearing in which he described crypto exchanges as facilitating money laundering and creating “massively untoward risk.” It would appear that the regulator might have its own ideas on how to exercise any new powers it receives once the FSMB is passed into law.  See also: Incoming FCA Chair Calls Crypto Firms Like FTX 'Deliberately Evasive'  In Europe, hopes continue to be pinned on MiCA, or the Markets in Crypto-Assets bill, a comprehensive piece of legislation that would apply to the 27-member nation trading bloc. Initial plans for the European Parliament to vote on the bill in December were abandoned given its length and complexity, with reports suggesting the vote, initially scheduled for February, have been delayed until April due to translation issues.  MiCA may face pressure to be “FTX-proof,” potentially resulting in even further delays – but the European Commission has been bullish on this front, claiming that under MiCA as currently drafted the failings of FTX wouldn’t have been allowed to happen. Even if true, this legislation is still a long way from being enforceable. Even if the final vote is held and passed this spring, there is still an implementation window of 12-18 months.  There are certainly lots of global regulatory irons in the fire, and a new found impetus to wield them for the protection of markets and consumers. Whether these irons will be forged quickly and thoughtfully only time will tell.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Laura Navaratnam,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/26/what-crypto-legislation-could-look-like-for-the-us-uk-and-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ecded1bdc550d49e615c8f659a1c49ec92b7666-4096x3112.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421387,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzaf,1674742975,Chalk and Cheese: When Crypto Assets Meet the Securities Laws,"We frequently hear from regulators that they view most crypto assets as securities and, as such, those crypto assets need to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission if they are to be offered to the general public or held by more than 500 “retail” investors. This latter test, in particular, would likely ensnare most large-cap crypto assets available today on Coinbase and other leading marketplaces, even if the assets were not originally offered to the public.  So what are we to make of this? Is the fact that almost no crypto assets are registered simply the result of intransigence and a desire to evade the law? Or is there more to the story?  Lewis Cohen is the co-founder of DLx Law. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week.  When are crypto assets securities?  We recently wrote a lengthy paper on this topic entitled “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities” for which we reviewed the entire body of appellate case law on the subject of “investment contracts” (a unique type of security defined not by Congress but in a famous Supreme Court case known as SEC v. W.J. Howey and Co.). When crypto assets are categorized as “securities” it is to this definition that regulators and courts generally look.  As we explain in ""Ineluctable Modality,"" the SEC and state regulators have won almost all cases they have brought involving fundraising transactions in which crypto assets are sold to raise money for the development of a blockchain project. However, there have been no significant court cases yet in which the status of a crypto asset independent of a fundraising transaction has been presented to a court.  See also: Are Crypto Assets Securities? / Opinion  Most crypto assets do not create a legal relationship between an identifiable “issuer” and the owner of the asset. We would argue crypto assets are not themselves “securities” under current law. (We also argue that characterizing crypto assets as “temporary” securities until extrinsic factors like “sufficient decentralization” cause them to “morph” into non-securities is not supported by current law and would be bad policy if adopted by courts.)  Compliance conundrum  But supposing that a court were to find a popular crypto asset to be a security, at least temporarily. What would happen next? This is where things get interesting.  Our federal securities laws are built around a fundamental premise – that behind every security, there lies an issuer. Because crypto assets like ETH, AVAX, ADA, DOGE and SOL do not create a legal relationship with any entity, the first task would be to determine which legal entity to treat as the “issuer.” The first place to look would be to the entity that deployed the smart contracts that initiated the network. However, as this is a purely administrative task it is often delegated to an inconsequential company or trust that is frequently dissolved after this one task has been completed.  See also: After FTX: How Congress Is Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto  More likely, regulators would look to the entity that received the proceeds of the sales of the crypto asset and used them to develop or continue work on the related project. However, it is not uncommon for multiple entities to receive proceeds from the asset sale. Although there is commonly one legal entity (frequently referred to as “[Project Name] Labs”) that receives the single largest portion of the sale proceeds, this is not always the case. Moreover, in the future projects may choose to avoid having any one entity receive a significant amount of proceeds, further complicating the task of identifying a proxy issuer for compliance purposes.  Who’s responsible here?  Even if an entity has been deemed the “issuer” of a crypto asset, that entity and the individuals who act as its officers and directors will have to take on responsibilities that will frequently either be of little or no relevance to owners of the crypto asset. This is because, unlike with shares in a company or debt obligations of a company, the value of a digital asset may only be very tangentially related to the issuer’s operations or its financial condition.  Among other things, they will need to:  Prepare audited financial statements (as well as “internal controls over financial reporting”)  File CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) certifications  Hire a compliance team to prepare and file quarterly and annual reports as well as current reports required when unexpected developments occur  Comply with Regulation FD, which addresses the problem of “selective disclosure” of company information (and presumes that this information is relevant to an issued security)  Hold annual meetings of its “security holders” and prepare proxy statement disclosure in advance  Additionally, there are myriad provisions in U.S. securities laws that are at best opaque and at worst nonsensical, when applied to crypto. This includes disclosures for where and how crypto assets would be allowed to trade, how custody rules would be applied, whether a “transfer agent” would be needed (and how that could possible apply), margin rules, settlement rules, broker-dealer rules, investment company and investment advisor rules and many others.  Not only are there numerous practical challenges here in mapping requirements intended for traditional businesses to deemed issuers of crypto assets, there is the larger question of why any company or group of individuals would want to take on these responsibilities when they neither have access to all information relevant to the crypto asset nor are being compensated for taking on these many potential liabilities. In fact, the mere process of imposing these liabilities and then incentivizing those responsible will fundamentally change the dynamics of the project and essentially replicate the current structure of centralized platforms.  Looking for Mr. Goodmarket  Even imaging that an entity can be found to act as issuer and the stakeholders involved are willing to take on all of the responsibilities of an issuer of public securities, a final hurdle remains.  If a crypto asset is treated as a security, it will only be able to be traded on a national securities exchange (basically, New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq) or in an exempt alternative trading system (ATS) approved by FINRA, the securities self-regulatory organization. At least at this time there is no possibility of crypto assets being listed on a national securities exchange and there are only a handful of ATSs approved by FINRA to deal in digital asset securities.  See also: What If Regulators Wrote Rules for Crypto? / Opinion  Even more, as acknowledged “securities” the assets may not be able to trade in offshore crypto asset markets or decentralized exchanges (DEX), functionally eliminating liquidity for the asset and likely tanking the price, ironically hurting the very investors the securities laws were intended to protect.  Practically function  The bottom line is that, without a radical re-imagining of the entirety of our securities laws, it is very difficult to see how most crypto assets can practically function as securities and still keep their intended purpose.  Instead, a solution along the lines of Title III of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act would make much more sense. That Title would add a new section to the securities laws that imposes sensible disclosure requirements on those companies that fundraise through the sale of crypto assets without attempting to treat the crypto assets themselves as securities.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Lewis Cohen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/26/crypto-assets-securities-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac617909f809928849abf2fab1f0201b0b365848-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also, the project rolled out new partnerships and initiatives, according to a new report from the blockchain analytics platform Nansen.  Polygon daily transactions ranged from 2 million to 3.7 million, while daily active addresses ranged from 350,000 to 1.7 million.  The number of daily transactions surged on Polygon in early November, when users attempted to yank out funds from the now-defunct FTX. Daily gas fees paid also peaked at the time, with the highest day at $570,000. The lowest point for daily gas fees paid was at $16,000 in early October.  Compared to Ethereum, Polygon’s daily transactions were almost twice as high and more volatile during the quarter, while daily gas paid was 40 to 100 times cheaper on Polygon.  Yi Jun Lee, the author of the report and a research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk that Polygon’s volatility in the fourth quarter was due to numerous events besides the FTX insolvency.  Non-fungible token (NFT) “launches, partnerships, can all lead to an increase in the number of transactions, not solely moving the native token,” Lee said.  The tremendous addition of daily addresses was partly due to the launch of Polygon’s zero-knowledge EVM public testnet.  Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups is a technology that processes transactions in bundles and uses “proofs,” which are bite-size pieces of data that confirm transactions are “true” and haven’t been altered. The deployment of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Polygon’s ZK rollup means developers can move smart contracts into the Polygon environment from Ethereum without any hiccups.

The concept is founded on the fact that the fast-evolving, deep and broad digital assets space can be too much for all advisors to learn about and advise on in the near term. Therefore, Khelp plans for its model to become the advisor for the 1% to 5% of client portfolios allocated to cryptocurrencies.  Why 1% to 5%?  There are many different views on what percentage of an investment portfolio one should allocate to crypto, but safety is important.  “Sometimes volatility makes sense in a low percentage of the portfolio allocation,” Goeke said. “I don’t think having more than 5% of a portfolio in this asset class makes sense.”  Read more: How Much Crypto Should Be in a Portfolio?  Keep in mind that global wealth management industry assets crossed the $112 trillion mark in 2021, according to a report last year by Boston Consulting Group – which means wealth management potentially brings $5 trillion or more to digital assets.  Khelp offers crypto investment solutions in the form of separately managed accounts (SMA) and a crypto hedge fund.  “Everything is actively managed,” said Goeke. “The market dynamic has changed slightly since the failures of Celsius, Voyager and FTX, but we think there will still be a market. We don’t think the asset class is going away.”  Goeke points out that with one exception, Terra, all of the digital assets failures of the past year have occurred in the realm of centralized players like Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and FTX.  “The blockchain hasn’t failed,” he said. “All those contracts were still working efficiently and the technology behind all of these assets has been effective – but the failures of centralized entities can impact the prices of these assets with there being no issue with the technology that’s driving them.”  Knowledge gap  But traditional finance, including the wealth management industry, suffers from a knowledge gap when it comes to digital assets. Investors – especially younger, newer investors – often come into an advisory relationship knowing far more about cryptocurrencies and even non-fungible tokens (NFT) than their financial advisor.  “I think that investors learn the terminology, but most people do not really understand a lot of the technology they are investing in, they just understand the end thing,” said Goeke.  For example, an advisor or client might stumble upon a token supporting a new blockchain-based payment method that clears in 10 seconds, much faster than the two-day average for credit cards. While it’s easy to understand the value in faster payment settlement, it’s unnecessary to understand how exactly the blockchain works.  Read more: Two Advisor Credentialing Organizations Have Their Say on Crypto  But how much, exactly, does a financial advisor need to know?  At a bare minimum, advisors need to be able to explain why 1% to 5% of a client portfolio should be in digital assets, according to Goeke, and how those assets can be held with the advisor through a separately managed account (SMA) or with an outsourced service like Khelp Financial.  “We still want advisors – who are our clients – to at least understand how to talk about it,” Goeke said. “We don’t even pretend to be full-blown experts. It’s important, though, because if you have a client and they are on the younger side, they’re likely going to have crypto somewhere in their portfolio whether the advisor has sold them on it or not.”  Utility and value  Another important consideration is that advisors need to emphasize the long-term viability of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies themselves.  Though the market is still highly speculative, and there are a handful of coins with no real-world value that grab a lot of headlines, digital assets should be taken seriously as investment opportunities.  “We sometimes take a B2C approach,” said Goeke. “I have a client investing directly in a company building something on a blockchain. Because they are making a traditional, direct investment, their capital is going to be locked up for five to seven years. However, you can take the same kind of investment approach with a coin or token, but end up with similar investment characteristics with a lot more liquidity.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/26/crypto-thaw-may-be-premature-but-advisors-should-prepare-for-winters-end,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141e4c73025451f7aed9d3ce806f0650326612cf-3008x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The options are live on the platform today and will be available on the institution-focused liquidity network Paradigm later, the exchange said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  TON is the world's 23rd-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $3.33 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency doubled in second-half 2022, decoupling from the broader market lull.  The offering adds to BIT's existing product suite of futures and options tied to crypto market leaders bitcoin and ether. The move suggests growing investor interest in derivatives tied to alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. While the crypto derivatives market has exploded in size over the past three years, growth has been mainly driven by demand for bitcoin and ether derivatives.  ""With the advent of dollar-margined products and the addition of various altcoin options, the options market has enormous growth potential,"" BIT co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Lan said in a statement. ""BIT and our trusted partners are devoted to increasing the accessibility of crypto options for both institutional and retail traders.""  Options are derivatives contracts that offer the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option offers the right to sell.

BIT was the world's sixth-largest by volume and open interest, data tracked by Amberdata show.  The options are launched in collaboration with liquidity provider Darley Technologies and blockchain industry market maker and TON-backer DWF Labs  ""With a global community growing at a speed of more than 2% weekly, as well as more than 100 million transactions to date, the TON ecosystem is one of the most promising on the market,"" said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs.

Bitcoin On-Chain PnL Index Has Formed A Bullish Crossover As per data from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the index is indicating a buy signal for BTC right now. The “CryptoQuant on-chain PnL index” is a metric that combines three different indicators into one to point out tops, bottoms, and cyclical shifts in the price of Bitcoin. The first of the metrics that the PnL index uses is the “MVRV ratio,” which is a model that checks whether BTC is currently overvalued or undervalued by comparing the crypto’s market cap with a fair value model called the “realized cap.” The second relevant indicator here is the “NUPL,” which tells us whether the Bitcoin market as a whole is currently carrying an unrealized profit or an unrealized loss. This metric can provide hints about whether there is a buying or selling motive among investors right now. Finally, there is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which tracks whether the average holder is selling at a loss or a profit at the moment. The SOPR shouldn’t be confused with the NUPL, as the quantity being measured by the NUPL is the “unrealized” profit/loss, which is the profit or loss that investors have accumulated but are yet to harvest (or “realize”) as they are still to sell their coins. There are actually two SOPR metrics of interest here; the version specifically for the short-term holders (STHs) and that for the long-term holders (LTHs). The entire Bitcoin market can be divided into these two groups, with the criteria being that holders who bought within the last 155 days fall into the former cohort, while those who bought before that fall into the latter.

The chart also includes the curve for the 365-day moving average (MA) of the metric, and it’s clear that the index has crossed above this MA with the latest surge. Historically, such a crossover during bearish periods has signaled a transition toward an early bull market. If this pattern holds true this time as well, then the current breakout could be good news for the ongoing rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit-Taking Spikes, Will BTC Price Recover? However, back in 2015, an initial breakout like the current one did end up failing, and it was only later that a successful transition took place.

But the 116-page FTX creditor list, which names companies including Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL), still paints a comprehensive picture of the failed crypto enterprise's reach and the impact of its collapse.  Media companies, universities, airlines and charities, among others, appear on the list, a court filing from Wednesday shows. The document was filed by lawyers for the company as part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.  Judge John Dorsey, who is overseeing the proceedings, allowed the names of individual creditors to remain sealed for three months at a hearing in early January, but requested a list of institutions that invested in the company to be filed by FTX lawyers.  Among those listed are media companies including the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Fox Broadcasting and CoinDesk as well as big crypto firms including exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Binance. CoinDesk isn't materially owed anything and is on the list for ""technical reasons"" over a podcast sponsorship signed in the fall that was never executed, a CoinDesk spokesperson said.  CoinDesk may not be alone. In a separate filing on Thursday, FTX said the list was compiled from the company's records ""for the purpose of giving broad notice to, and serving documents on, as many stakeholders and potential stakeholders as possible."" Names could appear for ""any number of reasons.""  ""As a result, inclusion of a name on the Matrix does not necessarily indicate that the party is a creditor of any of the Debtors,"" the filing said.  American Airlines Group (AAL), Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Southwest Airlines (LUV), as well as Stanford University – where FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's parents work as professors – and the university's credit union were also listed in the document.  The list also names Gisele Bundchen Charitable Giving as a creditor. The Brazilian supermodel and then-husband Tom Brady were famously invested in the company, even appearing in one of its Super Bowl ads.  The document doesn't show the amount each is owed, but the company had previously revealed it owed about $3.1 billion to its top 50 creditors. Of FTX’s previously estimated 1 million creditors, the two-largest single claims were for $226 million and $203 million.  Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges levied against him by U.S. regulators in New York. The collapse of FTX has damaged crypto markets and the industry's reputation. Regulators are now clamoring to set up more guardrails to protect against investor harm and risk of contagion. FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware in November.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) praised the country's securities regulator and its chief Gary Gensler's efforts to police the crypto industry and called for lawmakers to give the watchdog the necessary resources and authority to keep things going.  Gensler, who took charge of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, has had to ""put the genie back in the bottle and bring the crypto ecosystem into regulatory compliance"" after former President Donald Trump's regulators ""allowed it to explode,"" the senator said Wednesday in an interview with the American Economic Liberties Project.  The SEC has worked to protect investors from crypto products and prevented ""bitcoin exchange-traded funds from hitting the market,"" said Warren, who has been a vocal critic of the sector – particularly of the impact cryptocurrency mining has on the environment. She also praised the commission's enforcement actions against celebrity crypto promoters such as Kim Kardashian and crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) for alleged insider trading.  ""And, most importantly, it appears that the commission is still ramping up. That's why the industry is scared of a strong SEC. And that's why it's spending millions of dollars each year lobbying to escape SEC oversight,"" Warren said.  Warren has also been scrutinizing the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November, which sent ripples through the industry and prompted regulators to increase their efforts to improve supervision. She has called for FTX's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, to be held accountable to the ""fullest extent of the law.""  ""The SEC should double down and use its tools to enforce the rules, and where the SEC needs more cops on the beat, then Congress needs to step up with the resources and the new authorities that are needed to make sure the SEC can do its work at full strength in every corner of the crypto market,"" Warren said.  All U.S. regulators must work together to police the many facets of industry, including its environmental impact from mining activities, she said.  Gensler has been criticized for allegedly holding meetings with Bankman-Fried, who was once Washington D.C.'s crypto darling and – for a time – the face of the crypto lobby. A CoinDesk investigation this month revealed one in three U.S. lawmakers had received donations from FTX before its collapse.  Warren took aim at the crypto lobby instead.  ""Shady crypto players are lobbying hard in Washington,"" Warren said in the interview, adding that the SEC has been ""loud and clear"" that crypto shouldn't ""get a pass"" to avoid long-standing securities laws that protect investors and market integrity.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Hammond, who has been named as the new chair of crypto custodian Copper, said the U.K. needs to accelerate efforts to establish a more effective regulatory regime for digital assets.  Last year, then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who is now Prime Minister, laid out ambitions of turning the country into a crypto hub with plans such as bringing stablecoins into the country's payment systems. A policy document on how crypto should be governed is now overdue, however financial-services minister Andrew Griffith this week said it would be ready in a ""matter of certainly weeks, not months.""  “The U.K. needs to be leading in this area post-Brexit,” Hammond said. ""It’s allowed itself to slip behind. Switzerland is further ahead. The EU is also moving faster. There has to be appetite to take some measured risk.”  The custodian was among the firms that withdrew its application to register with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last year, pivoting to Switzerland. Hammond blamed the move on the slowness of the FCA and said that Copper hopes to return to the U.K. in the future.  Hammond, who was U.K.'s chancellor – or finance minister – from 2016 to 2019, joined Copper as an adviser in 2021.  Copper is also close to finalizing another funding round, which would value the firm at $2 billion, Hammond told the FT. Copper last raised $196 million in October last year. Its valuation at the time wasn't disclosed.  The firm did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

Investors Should Watch These Levels The ongoing rally for APT is something the bulls relish on, making APT among the top gainers in almost all time frames, according to CoinGecko data. Since January 1st, Aptos found three price levels in case the token faces a strong rejection in the coming days or weeks. As it currently stands, the rally is being supported at $12.32. If the token faces rejection, investors and traders can rely on this crucial support if the $16.01 support is broken.

For now, investors and traders can cash in some gains to hedge against potential downturns in APT’s market. Watching the overall situation in the crypto market is also a must as market movements by major cryptos can have an effect on APT’s price trajectory.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin regains lost ground to trade over $23K again.  Insights: Laguna Labs CEO Stefan Rust wrote in a CoinDesk Q&A that the Genesis Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing prompted a ""sigh of relief"" among many in the crypto industry, and that bitcoin's short-term price prospects depend on the size of the next Fed interest rate hike.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin's Comeback to $23K  By James Rubin  A Tuesday crypto market pullback turned into a Wednesday comeback as bitcoin soared past $23,700 before retreating slightly.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at above $23,180, up more than 3.1% over the past 24 hours. BTC had sunk under $23,500 at one point Tuesday as investors reaped profits from the crypto's recent surges. Bitcoin has risen more than 35% largely thanks to declining inflation and economic data suggesting the economy will avoid a severe tailspin. A slew of unfavorable fourth-quarter earnings, including tech giants Microsoft and Texas Instruments and aerospace company Boeing, seemed to derail at least the latter part of that narrative by Wednesday, sending stocks lower.  ""The January stock market rally might be over and that could drag crypto lower here,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""Bitcoin could be vulnerable to a dip toward the $20,000 level if the tech-driven selloff on Wall Street intensifies over the next couple of days.""  Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, rising from depths near the $1,500 threshold to return to its perch earlier this week above $1,618, a 5.4% gain from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptos were in the green with APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, recently up more than 48% over the past 24 hours to hit an all-time high of $18.62. APT is up over 425% since Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk data. The spike likely due to growth in non-fungible token markets on Aptos.  OPT, the native crypto of layer 2 network Optimism, also rose to a record high of $2.34, a nearly 20% gain from the previous day. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently decreased about 4%.  Traditional markets traded sideways with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 down a smidgen of a percentage point as investors chewed over corporate results. On Wednesday after markets closed, electric car manufacturer Tesla beat expectations for profits and revenue but struck a cautionary note about the impact of a possible economic contraction.  Meanwhile, crypto exchange giant Binance’s BUSD stablecoin extended its recent declines, amid mismanagement issues involving the exchange’s pegged tokens that surfaced earlier this month, and other debacles.  BUSD’s circulating supply fell to $15.4 billion on Wednesday, paring down $1 billion over the past week and $2 billion in a month, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. The latest drop extended BUSD’s decline from $22 billion in early December when anxious users scrambled to withdraw funds from Binance after it botched a report about its digital asset reserves.  The drop has come as stablecoins' overall market capitalization is down for a 10th consecutive month so far in January to $137 billion, according to a report by research group CryptoCompare. Stablecoin dominance within the broad cryptocurrency market dropped to 12.4% from its all-time high of 16.5% in December, suggesting traders have been rotating from stablecoins into riskier assets, CryptoCompare said.

Insights  Laguna Labs CEO Ties Bitcoin's Prospects to the Fed's Next Move  By James Rubin  Crypto markets have risen this year largely because the industry has flushed the mischief and mayhem that sunk it in 2022 from its system, wrote Stefan Rust, CEO of blockchain technology firm Laguna Labs, in a Q&A with CoinDesk. Genesis Global Holdco LLC's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing earlier this month provided a capstone, Rust wrote. Genesis is the holding company of troubled cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital. (Genesis is also a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is CoinDesk's parent).  ""All the baggage from 2022 has been closed out with the filing,"" he wrote. ""This prompted a sigh of relief among many in the industry.""  Rust was cautious about bitcoin's near-term prospects, which he pinned on the size of the next interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank. He was more sanguine about ether. ""ETH to $10,000 by the end of this year retains the deflationary momentum,"" Rust wrote, in the course of answering four questions about crypto markets.  CoinDesk: Has the recent decline in inflation and investor hopefulness about the size of the next interest rate hike driven the recent market upturn? What other factors have been involved?  Rust: A growing expectation that interest rates won't rise at 50 basis points is definitely helping and giving investors confidence. However, I don't think that's the main driver. Crypto has gone through 400 days of a bear market and a lot of the true believers are seeing that the financial markets and decentralized finance institutions have pulled out so much so that even the DCG/Genesis/Gemini saga has not had any impact in the market. That is the main driver of the pump: the fact that all the baggage from 2022 has been closed out with the filing of Chapter 11 for Genesis. This prompted a sigh of relief among many in the industry – particularly those in decentralized finance where the opportunity for transparent verifiable finance is manifest.  Will we hold support at around $22.9K as the market seems to be trying to establish or do you anticipate a retreat? Why?  I'm not sure whether we will hold that support, especially if interest rates go up by 50 basis points, which we at Truflation are predicting given recent CPI numbers – given that wage inflation was 6.6% and unemployment is still at 3.5%. All those factors lead us to believe that US interest rates will go up by 50 basis points at the next FOMC meeting next week despite the fact there now seems to be a belief in the market for another result. If you look at the numbers, inflation is not yet under control.  What are your expectations for ether's price and other major tokens?  Big tokens, especially bitcoin, and any ether are going to do well. We're going to see a faster recovery in the crypto markets than we will see in the traditional finance market. ETH is now deflationary while the chain is seeing hugely increased activity on top of Ethereum developer engagement, faster improvements to the Ethereum network itself, and faster settlement associated with all of the activities. Despite the unlocking of staked ETH coming in with the Shanghai release, a lot of people would be surprised how a large portion of the staking will remain staked. It might move across to liquid staking derivatives that have been a burgeoning market across the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ETH to $10,000 by the end of this year retains the deflationary momentum: less supply, more activity, and faster circulation require better value and more distribution to drive digital exchange and digital trade across the Ethereum Blockchain layer 1 and layer 2's.  You recently noted Binance's growing number of transactions and engagement. But does the increasing amount of scrutiny of exchanges present a threat to the crypto industry this year?  Binance has three or four different entities. It has Binance US, Binance international, and the BNB chain. Binance US is going through the regulatory framework as any other US exchange, while Binance international is already licensed in multiple jurisdictions around the world, and like any large tech company will be scrutinized the very same way that Google is scrutinized, Microsoft is scrutinized and Amazon is scrutinized. All big tech companies always get scrutinized so I think there is no difference in the way that Binance will be scrutinized for this.  Coming to decentralized finance, the BNB chain has a different infrastructure, it is a different beast and has large transaction volume, extremely cost-efficient transaction fees, and fast speeds. Is it fully decentralized? No, but we're seeing the same with Polygon. Distribution is the name of the game. You can focus on decentralizing over time as long as you iron out the kinks and as long as you start the distribution of a decentralization strategy and you're seeing that take place with Polygon and Binance.
