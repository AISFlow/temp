In comments to The Sydney Morning Herald, a representative for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said that an investigation into Igot would only take place if the company had failed – a charge alleged by customers who say their funds remain locked up and that has denied by the company.  The representative told the news source:  ""As with any company, if it were to go into administration or liquidation and there was suspected wrongdoing or breaches of the law, it would be a matter we would look into.”  Scrutiny of Igot, which has been accused of fraud in the past, resurfaced this week following a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Igot founder Rick Day told the outlet that his firm was having difficulties paying customers.  ""I am well aware that customers are affected and customers are really unhappy with this but I would like to show each and every one that we have not lost their money. We have not run away with anything and we will return the money,” he said.  When reached for comment, Day denied that his service is insolvent.  ""Some customers are affected by the delays and are being resolved. Bank related issues have had an impact on our operations,"" he told CoinDesk.  Customers of the service say they’ve been seeking answers for months.  One customer, Australia-based bitcoin company Digital CC, told ABC that Igot owes the firm $180,000. According to a notice published by ASIC, Digital CC is seeking to have Igot dissolved and its assets sold to repay creditors through court action.  Others have claimed to have have as much as tens of thousands of dollars held in the platform.

Airbnb has hired an undisclosed number of the employees of ChangeCoin, which operates the social media tipping service. Among those hired by Airbnb is CEO and co-founder Nick Sullivan, sources say.  Left unacquired is the ChangeTip codebase as well as the developers working specifically on bitcoin projects, though those invested in the firm expressed optimism that the project would continue under a new leadership.  The deal, first reported by Quartz, is the result of an extended process of trying to sell the firm.  The move comes weeks after Airbnb co-founder and chief technology officer Nathan Blecharczyk told City AM in an interview that blockchain was on the startup’s radar. At the time, Blecharczyk suggested that the firm was looking at the technology for possible applications related to reputation and identity.

42426770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdPh,1460484010,Estonian Supreme Court Rules Against Bitcoin Trader,"The Estonian Supreme Court has ruled in favor of restrictions on bitcoin trading activity in the wake of a lawsuit filed by a digital currency broker.  The ruling, which came in the wake of a long-running lawsuit that began as a inquiry into the legality of bitcoin, means that traders face new barriers for dealing in digital currencies in the European state.  The suit traces back to 2014, when bitcoin brokerage operator Otto de Voogd was first contacted by Estonian police in connection with the operation of BTC.ee. De Voogd later suspended the service, citing threats of fines and jail time from the police.  In a Reddit note  , de Voogd declared that Estonia was now ""the worst country in EU for bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets"".  Of particular note are restrictions on how exchange services in Estonia must interface with their customers. The court ruling affirms that regulation of alternative methods of payment include bitcoin, given its characteristics – a move that brings it under the country's anti-money laundering (AML) statutes, even if it is not explicitly spelled out.  De Voogd told CoinDesk:  ""This means that whenever a business trades more than 1,000 euros worth of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, blockchain tokens or blockchain assets, they must meet their customer face to face. In practice this makes any e-business impossible. It also makes it impossible to serve customers that live further away or in other countries.""  Unfriendly territory  Estonia has long been considered an unfriendly jurisdiction for digital currencies, tracing back to a January 2014 statement from an official for the country's central bank, who called bitcoin a ""problematic scheme"".  Estonia later pushed for value-added tax (VAT) in the European Union to be applied to the full value of bitcoin trades, when the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was weighing the issue.  The ECJ ultimately exempted bitcoin transactions from VAT.  Next steps  De Voogd will now be required to provide answers to questions from the Estonian police as mandated by the court – a circumstance he said that would violate his rights against self-incrimination.  He went on to say that he was still parsing through the new ruling, but indicated that next steps include preparing to take his case to the European Court for Human Rights.  ""It means that the struggle is not over and I have to continue to the ECHR,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It also means that I now have to answer the questions through which I could incriminate myself.""

42426783,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdhh,1460477060,CFTC Commissioner: Credit Default Swap Test ‘Proves Merit’ of Blockchain,"Recently completed blockchain and distributed ledger tests at major financial institutions are ""proving the merit"" of the technology, J Christopher Giancarlo, commissioner of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said today.  In a keynote address at an event held today by the Cato Institute, Giancarlo cited a recent ""successful test"" of the use of blockchain in the credit default swaps markets. Announced earlier this month, the trial was organized by the DTCC and involved participation from Bank of America, Citigroup and Credit Suisse, as well as industry startup Axoni.  ""I believe this exercise proves that there is merit to the potential of distributed ledger technology,"" Giancarlo said. ""Other similarly promising projects are underway.""  Involving 85 examples of the distributed ledger network’s functionality and resiliency, Giancarlo used the test as an example of how the technology is outpacing regulators and as evidence of his personal view that regulators should pursue a ""do no harm"" approach to regulation.  Touching on a wide range of subjects from the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the advent of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain, Giancarlo’s speech covered many of the same subjects first introduced in his speech at the DTCC's Blockchain Symposium in late March.  ""For market participants, DLT [Distributed Ledger Technology] may help manage the capital complexity brought about by the disparate mandates promulgated by regulators here and abroad,"" he said.  On the regulatory side, Giancarlo indicated that he believes that global regulators need to harmonize how they share data, and that blockchain could provide a solution.  Still, Giancarlo expressed the worry that regulation could come from ""a dozen different directions"", a prospect that he used to support the idea that global regulators need to unite to provide oversight for the industry while preserving benefits.

42426773,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdVh,1460473878,What Circle's UK E-Money License Means for Bitcoin and Blockchain,"Circle Internet Financial set off a wave of positive press last week when it revealed the news that it had become an electronic money institution registered under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK.  Though enthusiasm was high, there was confusion over the nature of the licensing and how it enables Circle to further its operations. Of note, is that the e-money license is not digital currency-specific, with the E-Money Directive being introduced in the UK in September 2009. The FCA, sources noted, is still debating how it will seek to regulate digital currencies in the UK.  However, the e-money license does now allow Circle to work with the UK Treasury on a process by which it will inform regulators in other European nations of the license in a bid that could find it expanding its fiat money services across the European Union.  For now, the licensure proved sufficient to enable Circle to establish a relationship with UK banking giant Barclays. As such, industry commentators were quick to voice their belief that the announcement would do much to improve the perception of bitcoin and blockchain technologies more broadly.  IDC Financial Insights  research director James Wester, for instance, said the news was perhaps a sign that the idea is falling out of favor that blockchain and distributed ledgers would disrupt payments and banking, and that banks may now become key drivers of the emerging technology’s wider adoption.  Wester told CoinDesk:  ""Banks themselves are [now] exploring the potential for the technology. So over time I think you will see more connections and relationships between the community building up around blockchain technologies and financial service providers, vendors and regulators.""  Wedbush Securities  analyst Gil Luria echoed this view, stating he believes Circle’s license would put pressure on global regulators, an opinion that was widely voiced in the community.  ""I expect other [regulators] to simply feel comfortable regulating the actual financial service provided without caring what network they are provided on,"" he said.  Overall, sources compared the license to Circle’s traditional money services business (MSB) licenses in the US, where it is authorized to provide services in US dollars in all 50 states.  As such, the e-money license, they indicated, serves as a counterpart to its digital currency services, one that more directly relates to the company’s goal of innovating on the payments industry business model with blockchain technology, and that as such, is unlikely to have a wider impact on startups.  Market leader  Most immediately, commentators agreed that the announcement further positioned Circle as a market leader in the digital currencies space. Founded in 2013 by Brightcove founder Jeremy Allaire and its senior architect Sean Neville, Circle has already raised $76m over three funding rounds, boasting investors such as Goldman Sachs and Fenway Summer.  Wester indicated that Circle’s license would now allow it to perform limited cross-border and cross-currency transfers from Europe to the US, a move that would allow them to test a prominent use case for blockchain at scale.  ""[This] is particularly interesting given that those transactions have often been cited as a good use case for blockchain,"" he said.  Circle is also notably the only bitcoin services company to have received a license from New York state since the introduction of its state-specific regulatory regime, the BitLicense, in early 2015. According to CoinDesk estimates, more than 20 companies remain waiting for a formal approval for this designation, though the NYDFS has promised forthcoming news.  BuckleySandler LLP counsel Dana Syracuse, who helped develop the BitLicense application in New York, said that the licensing is an example of how companies in the financial services industry can use regulation to compete for investment and business.  ""Ultimately, compliance distinguishes companies in the market,"" he said.  Circle chief compliance officer John Beccia further stressed that regulation has become a key competitive advantage for Circle, even if other companies may not need a traditional money services license as part of their strategies.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Having taken that approach from day one to be engaged with regulators, to be very comprehensive, it’s been helpful in attracting investors and banks and in being able to get to market quickly.""  UK pulls ahead  In a global context, commentators saw the news as the latest that finds the US and the UK competing for a front-runner position as the leader in global FinTech innovation.  Commentators in the US were keen to stress that the announcement is perhaps proof that the UK’s strategy toward encouraging blockchain industry development is proving more successful in encouraging innovation.  Coin Center director Jerry Brito, for instance, positioned Circle's opportunity to extend services across the EU as one that would not be possible in the US due to its state-by-state approach to bitcoin regulation.  ""If the US doesn’t wake up, it’s going to find itself behind and it’s going to lose the competitive edge,"" Brito told CoinDesk, adding:  “This isn’t by chance, the UK government has identified this as a way they can compete with the US globally.”  Brito cited the recent news that bitcoin exchange itBit had stopped serving consumers in Texas as evidence of how this is harming development of a more robust digital currencies ecosystem, holding it up as an example of state-by-state inconsistencies.  Beccia agreed with this opinion, praising the FCA for a ""reasonable"" approach to the regulatory process.  “The message is that the UK is being very proactive on this, they’re encouraging FinTech,” he said. “It’s been a really encouraging environment.”  The viewpoint that this development was potentially a negative for the US was supported by Consumers’ Research executive director Joe Colangelo, who voiced his belief that the announcement could encourage more innovation abroad.  He concluded:  ""I wouldn't be surprised if this simplified approval from the UK led to more bitcoin and blockchain companies considering setting up shop overseas in the future.""

In an interview with CoinDesk, Skry co-founder and CEO Fabio Federici said the company is working to merge blockchain, big data and artificial intelligence in to a single product.  Federici said:  ""The company itself wants to move beyond bitcoin, so sending out that clear message was important. But in order to do so, and to make it applicable to any blockchain, we needed that expertise to go from a bitcoin analytics application to a blockchain analytics platform.""  Announced today, Dr Akash Singh, IBM’s former chief researcher who worked for 10 years on IBM's Watson computer, joined Skry as its chief technology officer. Singh will focus on helping make Coinalytics ""enterprise-ready"" by ensuring that big banks and law enforcement agencies interested in its services can leverage a blockchain-agnostic platform.  The move to service larger companies also includes a new ""fusion layer"" of the analytics product.  Singh, who was also the CTO of data science at Shenzhen, China-based Huawei, will work to build the service designed to let clients safely analyze in-house data like user accounts and geolocation information but without turning it over to any third-party.  Also announced today, Dr Masoud Nikravesh, was hired as Skry's new chief data scientist. Nikravesh is an artificial intelligence researcher and former computational science and engineering director at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society for the State of California.  Over his 25-year career Nikravesh has specialized in risk analysis and prediction models for credit risk scoring, according to the statement. He also worked on anomaly detection for anti-fraud services.  Nikravesh said in a statement:  ""Skry is at the forefront of applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to turn the blockchain into actionable insights, which will have a crucial impact on the future of this technology, beyond bitcoin.""          A new path forward  Founded in April 2014, Palo Alto-based Skry has raised a total of $1.3m from 500 Startups and The Hive to build its analytics platform for bitcoin.  But as the firm speaks with law-enforcement agencies and privacy-conscious banks, it has joined the ranks of companies like Elliptic, which last month raised $5m for its own set of blockchain surveillance tools.  In interview with CoinDesk, Federici said he wanted the newly rebranded company to help ""bridge the gap"" between the rapidly increasing sets of data available through machine-learning tools and the business use-cases that might only become apparent upon close examination.  In a hat-tip to the company’s name, which means to foretell the future using a crystal ball, Federici added:  ""We believe in the real-time aspect of the service using machine learning and artificial intelligence to let the user get best possible look at the future.""

42426778,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdfh,1460435430,Industry Advocacy Groups Unite to Launch Global Blockchain Forum,"A collection of interest groups focused on bitcoin, blockchain and digital asset-related issues has created a new business forum in a bid to shape how public policy relating to the technology is formed.  Dubbed the Global Blockchain Forum, the group’s supporters include the US-based Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Australian Digital Currency & Commerce Association (ADCCA), the UK Digital Currency Association (UKDCA), and the Association of Crypto-Currency Enterprises and Start-ups (ACCESS), headquartered in Singapore.  The group said that it aims to establish ""international industry best practices"" to encourage global innovation.  Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said that the effort grew out of organic communication between the various stakeholders that focused largely on public policy advocacy.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""We decided that the time was ripe to formalize our engagement to create a this platform and welcome other related organizations to coordinate efforts as well.""  The group’s formation comes as governments worldwide continue to move toward establishing regulatory stances on the technology, with recent policy updates observed in Asia, Europe and the US.  According to Boring, the group will aim to promote communication between its stakeholders; push for “consistent” public policy approaches to digital currency and blockchain regulation; and conduct research to support the development of such policy.  ""There is next no consistency among the various countries looking to regulate bitcoin and blockchain tech,"" Boring explained.  For example, she indicated that anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) laws differ globally, forcing added costs on industry businesses.  Boring said that the group will also seek dialogue with applicable regulatory bodies as part of its goal of influencing public policy outcomes.
