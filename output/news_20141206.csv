42377890,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uJD,1417888023,"Evolution, Not Revolution: How to Sell Bitcoin to Regulators","In a recent article, Jon Matonis stated that ""bitcoin requires forceful and aggressive legal defense, not complicity with governments in crafting policy and regulations"".  The current global political climate has resulted in the development of laws that are increasingly pervasive and intrusive on the rights of private individuals. In many countries, forceful and aggressive legal advocacy is necessary to protect civil rights and civil liberties against draconian laws.  However, the bitcoin community is not fighting a battle against law enforcement. Bitcoin is not a revolution against government. It is an evolution of the way we transfer value, an evolution of the concept of money, and an evolution from centralised opacity to decentralised transparency.  When viewed this way, it is easy to see why bitcoin must be allowed to continue to evolve. But this aggressive and confrontational approach to bitcoin's legal issues only perpetuates an already common misunderstanding of how the legal system works in many countries.  Understanding governmental roles  Government actors usually play one of three roles: policy makers, regulators or law enforcement. Policymakers make the laws and regulations. Regulators interpret the law and administer the framework that is built around the law. The focus of law enforcement is to uphold the law by catching law-breakers and bringing them to justice.  These distinct roles result in each area of government having a different focus when it comes to bitcoin.  Policymakers want to win elections. The laws and policies they make are invariably targeted towards appeasing their electorates and winning votes. This means policy makers usually ask the ""Why?"" questions. Why should the law facilitate the adoption of bitcoin? Why should bitcoin be regulated?  Regulators ask the ""How?"" questions. How does bitcoin affect what we do? How does bitcoin fit within the existing legal framework? How can we effectively supervise the industry?  Law enforcement officials are usually asking the ""Who?"" and ""What?"" questions. Who used bitcoin to break the law and what did they do?  The uncertain regulatory and legal environment for bitcoin has created risks for bitcoin users and bitcoin businesses. However, it has also created a unique opportunity in many countries for the bitcoin community to write their own narrative. Governments all over the world have opened up public inquiries into digital currency and asked for dialogue from the local and international bitcoin communities.  This unique and arguably unprecedented opportunity should not be taken for granted.  In the lead up to the Australian Senate inquiry into digital currency, Senators Matthew Canavan and Sam Dastyari encouraged actors in the digital currency industry to let their voices be heard:  ""If they do not help shape their operating regulations, then regulation will soon shape their operations"".  Regulation of bitcoin use is inevitable  The blockchain can't be regulated, and it is difficult to see how regulation of peer-to-peer transactions could ever be effectively achieved. However, regulation of the conduct of bitcoin businesses is inevitable.  If you strip back the technology, a bitcoin transaction is a financial transaction. Bitcoin as a technology will revolutionise the mechanics of the banking and finance sector. However, bitcoin as a currency is simply a better way to move value from point A to point B.  Regulatory oversight for financial transactions plays an important role in protecting consumers and the economy as a whole. Arguing against any form of regulation for bitcoin businesses is fighting a losing battle.  The Global Financial Crisis highlighted the need for governments to protect the integrity of their financial systems. The crisis is largely blamed on regulatory failure and deregulation of the financial services sector.  Factors that contributed to this crisis include insufficient liquidity and capital reserves, inadequate microprudential supervision, poor corporate governance and risk management practices, and insufficient transparency in the financial sector.  Bitcoin has the potential to address some of these shortcomings, but governments are concerned about the soundness of bitcoin as a payment system, consumer protection issues, money laundering or other illicit activity, and financial transparency and accountability.  Put simply, if a bitcoin business handles other people's wealth, then both internal and external oversight is necessary. Bitcoin technology may have removed the need for trusted third parties, but it hasn't removed the need for consumers and the government to trust bitcoin businesses.  Selling the technology  Instead of railing against the government, the bitcoin community needs to make the most of the current opportunities to influence the government's decision-making process.  If somebody asks a ""Why?"" question, you don't respond with forceful aggression. You take the opportunity to explain why, and to respond with informed and persuasive reasoning.  Policymakers want to hear how bitcoin will win votes. Bitcoin conversations with policy makers need to highlight how this technological evolution will stimulate the economy, create jobs, help small businesses and increase the free flow of capital.  In contrast, regulators aren't trying to win popularity contests. As Charles Littrell, executive general manager of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority described it:  ""Anybody who joins a prudential regulator hoping to become popular has made a serious career mistake"".  A regulator's focus is on doing their job right and ensuring that the businesses are also doing their job right. Regulators need to hear how bitcoin businesses can ensure consumers are protected, and they need to understand how bitcoin can actually make this protection easier – not harder.  For example, bitcoin is desirable to a regulator because the technology itself can facilitate internal self-government and self-regulation.  In its 'BitLicense' commentary, the Institute for the Future's Crypto-Economy Working Group outlined a number of potential technology solutions that can address regulators' concerns.  Multi-signature governance and escrow has the potential to mitigate the risks of mistake or internal fraud. Continuous real-time auditing can ensure operational integrity of bitcoin businesses and include mechanisms to prove reserves or solvency. Blockchain data analytics, fast transaction scoring, and entity identification, can all help to address concerns about exploitation of bitcoin by illicit actors.  Seize the opportunity  Policy makers and regulators don't need to hear about how bitcoin will remove government monopoly over currency or stop the government from collecting tax. They need to hear about how bitcoin can offer the global community a safer, more secure, and more transparent alternative to the traditional banking and financial system.  The bitcoin community needs to engage in informed discussions that directly address the concerns that governments have about bitcoin and offer suggestions for how bitcoin can make a difference. As the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) stated, ""Both regulators and industry must work together to harvest the opportunities, while mitigating the risks"".  Consultation with government doesn't guarantee the bitcoin community will get everything on its regulatory wish-list. But even a small win can have a big impact. Whether it is a submission to the BitLicense proposal, a consultation with the Australian Taxation Office or a one-on-one discussion with a local member of parliament, every discussion counts and every contribution helps shape the overall form.  Be tenacious and determined in the legal defence of bitcoin. Just remember: honey beats vinegar. Hands down. Every time. Don't underestimate the power of persuasive reasoning and don't waste these incredible opportunities to take part in shaping bitcoin's future.

42377900,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uVn,1417879946,BitFury CEO: We're Not a Bitcoin Mining Company,"If knowledge of the BitFury brand was confined to the bitcoin ecosystem prior to this year, the Amsterdam, Riga and San Francisco-based company has done its best in 2014 to change this, raising $40m through two funding rounds and adding executives with experience at Samsung and VeriFone to its newly created strategic advisory board.  BitFury  has dominated VC funding in the bitcoin mining vertical in what has so far proved to be a year shaped by big fundraising announcements. At press time, BitFury accounts for 65% of all investments made in mining companies so far this year, and over 10% of the funding raised publicly by all bitcoin companies, a figure equalled only by bitcoin services provider Xapo.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Valery Vavilov discussed BitFury’s larger strategy in the bitcoin market, while emphasizing that he sees the company as one that can extend its reach beyond the industrial mining and business-to-business (B2B) hardware markets.  Vavilov said:  “We're a technology company, but we're focused on bitcoin now. Our vision in the next three to five years is to move into different areas where computing power is valuable. We plan to expand into other fields of knowledge where humanity needs a lot of computing power.""  Vavilov went on to suggest that he sees BitFury today as a company that first and foremost processes transactions on the bitcoin network. However, he distanced the company from some of the more familiar terms that have long been associated with its operations as well as those of its competitors.  ""We are not a mining company, I don't like the word mining,"" he added.  The remarks come as part of an extensive interview that finds the CEO of one of bitcoin's most secretive companies opening up about its broader goals, the structure of its operations and its role in the bitcoin ecosystem.  A new generation of energy  Throughout much of the conversation, Vavilov emphasized the future, seeking to define his company's objectives in terms of larger, global movements toward peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and the Internet of Things. Key to this strategy, he said, will be BitFury's reinvestment of profits in the bitcoin ecosystem through its VC arm, BitFury Capital.  Launched this summer, BitFury Capital has so far invested in three bitcoin companies, BitGo, GoCoin and an unnamed wallet provider the company revealed to be Xapo, two of which were all-bitcoin investments.  Despite this fast pace, Vavilov suggested BitFury has been ready to invest its profits more aggressively, but has yet to find suitable opportunities.  ""We looked at approximately 60 projects, and for us, we're ready to invest in very, very early stage projects but we didn't find any to invest in,"" he said.  Vavilov indicated that these investments may, however, serve a strategic purpose, stressing that BitFury is looking to provide not only money but expertise to the bitcoin ecosystem as it works to align its industry with macro market movements.  As for BitFury specifically, he noted the company's interest in innovations in renewable energy, developments that no doubt are of interest given the footprint of its three data centres.  ""Every 10 years, humanity consumes two times more electricity,"" he said. ""Now we are going to the era of electric cars. We'll need a new generation of energy.""  In house, full custom  Vavilov also answered questions about the structure of the company's operations, noting that BitFury employs 70 people in a team distributed across the world. BitFury, he added, sells hardware only to the business market, stating that any online product offered to consumers is being resold by one of its buyers.  The reason for this expansive set of personnel, he explained, is BitFury's choice to limit the number of third parties it relies on for its operations. Vavilov stressed that the company strives to keep all of its operations in house due to the speed at which the bitcoin market moves.  ""We are making everything full custom and everything in house, we don't have any outsourcing companies,"" Vavilov explained. ""We're doing our own silicon, everything in house, full custom; we're doing our own servers, in house, full custom; and we're building our own data centers, also in house and full custom.""  Though this attention to detail may seem extreme, Vavilov used the example of BitFury's data centres as evidence that this approach is necessary. For instance, he said that when seeking to build his company's latest 20 megawatt data centre in the Republic of Georgia, he traveled the world to speak to suppliers, but wasn't satisfied with the work estimates he received.  ""If you don't deliver, you lose a lot, and when I communicated with everyone, the fastest one was five months. When we met with our head of construction, I asked, 'How much time do you need to build the data centre?'"" he said, adding:  ""He said, 'I can do it in three months'. I asked if he could do it in three weeks. We were working 24/7 and we did it in one month's time.""  BitFury said it now employs an R&D team that designs its servers and data centres, with the head of its construction department owning his own firm in Georgia.  Sidestepping the consumer market  Another subject broached was the company's emphasis on the B2B market, a decision that has proved advantageous for BitFury, as it has largely avoided the negative public scrutiny given to its competitors.  Though he credits the move only to a ""feeling"" about the market, Vavilov is more specific about the problems BitFury has avoided with this decision.  He said:  ""We decided to not deal with small clients, because it's a headache. We would need a big support team to support all these clients. When you're dealing with big clients, he's paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the headache you're getting from small clients can be much bigger, because for him $5 is like the last money.""  Vavilov said that when looking at this scenario, he determined it would be better to spend energy on developing strong equipment instead of customer service. In addition, he cited the lack of awareness among consumers of the full risks of their investment.  ""It is much easier to work with larger clients with whom you have established a win-win relationship,"" he added.  A native of Latvia and a long-time resident of Ukraine, Vavilov said that BitFury began making chips 2012, but that before this, he and his team had only experimented with CPUs and video cards. The chip won reviews from the bitcoin community, even as the company drew notice for then being run by unknown individuals.  ""It's still the most efficient chip in the market, if we're talking about six-year-old technology,"" he boasted.  Global regulation warming  Vavilov also discussed the topic of global bitcoin regulation, noting that he has been particularly pleased with developments from the US government. Citing last year's US Senate hearing, as well as this year's IRS ruling and the USMS auction of 30,000 BTC, he said ""I have never seen so many positive signs"".  As for BitFury, he said, the company is particularly conscious of potential regulation in Iceland, an area that has proved to be attractive to the bitcoin mining industry as it seeks low-cost and natural cooling methods for its hardware.  More specifically, he voiced his belief that regulation in the US will not adversely affect BitFury as it does not perform the functions of a traditional financial services provider, instead only mining bitcoin and selling computer hardware for such operations.  Rather, he suggested BitFury is indirectly influenced by regulation, to the extent that it affects the bitcoin industry.  ""If you are processing bitcoin transactions you should be a transparent and open company,"" he said. ""All this regulation and corporate governance makes your company more transparent, this is good not only for our company but for our industry.""  Transparency in global mining  Vavilov also discussed BitFury's place in the global bitcoin mining market, addressing what he called the lack of transparency in regards to how the sector operates.  ""We need to create transparency in who holds how much of the hashing power, I think it will be good for everyone,"" he said, suggesting that some bitcoin mining companies, particularly those based in Asia, have been reluctant to offer this information publicly.  ""I don't know what's happening in China. Companies that process bitcoin transactions should be transparent, otherwise people will not trust such a company,"" he stated. ""In China, I see some kind of black box.""  Vavilov said he believes mining companies should make certain data public, including how much hashing power the company generates. When asked more broadly about transparency and what consumers should expect from mining firms, he added details such as how many data centres they operate and how much power they consume.  Vavilov went on to suggest BitFury would support a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for the sector, monitored by a third-party such as the Bitcoin Foundation. He said the company has also reached out to other players in the industry about solutions that promote transparency.  ""The companies which disclose their hashing power could be awarded a 'Trusted Transparency' sign, the quality and transparency award, so to speak. This will help recognize the companies that openly disclose their numbers and will alleviate the 51% threat,"" he said.  Notably, major China-based bitcoin mining companies have levied a similar call to action in the media recently.  The biggest currency in the world  Finally, Vavilov discussed BitFury's planned initial public offering (IPO), which suggested he would like the company to complete as soon as possible.  While still in its early stages, Vavilov suggested that the process of opening up the company to the capital markets could be delayed depending on the outlook for the bitcoin market.  ""It will depend on if market is ready,"" he said. ""Bitcoin adoption will need to have enough speed and institutional investors will need to understand bitcoin. If the capital markets don't understand bitcoin, you won't be able to have a successful IPO.""  Still, despite these obstacles, Vavilov remains confident that his company's public entrance to the market will be as impactful as Google's in 2001 and Facebook's in 2006.  ""Transaction fees coming off blockchain will be massive and we have every intention to capitalize on this,"" he added.  Vavilov suggested that BitFury will be keen to monitor public sentiment on bitcoin as it looks to go public, implying there are some forms of value that he sees as being even more in-demand than bitcoin.  ""For us, reputation is very important,"" he said. ""Reputation is everything and sometimes the biggest currency in the world is trust.""  Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that BitFury was based solely in San Francisco.

42377885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73uFR,1417873940,Can Bitcoin's Price Ever Be Stable?,"If experts are right, one of bitcoin's prevailing characteristics could also be its biggest problem – a fixed supply that helps to send prices yo-yoing. They say that cryptocurrencies with flexible supply would help to avoid scaring everyday users away.  Even in bitcoin's digital universe, the same basic economic rules apply, with price being determined by supply and demand. Bitcoin's algorithm makes the supply of bitcoins predictable, with a constant stream of bitcoins distributed via block rewards that halve at a preset rate. This leaves demand to fluctuate.  Bitcoin's bouncy demand  In bitcoin's case, that demand fluctuates wildly.  ""Daily BTC/USD volatility is around 5%, which is about 5–7 times the volatility of a major forex cross,"" points out Robert Sams, a cryptocurrency economics consultant with 11 years of experience in hedge funds.  This fluctuation in demand isn't a good thing, because it has an effect on the price, making it volatile too. Volatility in price makes it hard for bitcoin businesses to grow, because it introduces too much uncertainty, warns Joseph Lee, founder of Singapore-based cryptocurrency trading platform BTC.SX, who added:  ""This is damaging for the huge array of businesses who simply want to be involved in the space by accepting bitcoins for their products, whether its food or hardware, but unknowingly end up playing a long speculative bet on the price.""  Sure, they can accept bitcoins and get them converted immediately into fiat by someone like CoinBase or BitPay, so that they never have to touch the cryptocurrency. That doesn't make them a bitcoin-invested business. Rather, they're just a business that happens to accept bitcoin.  Making supply elastic  Faced with this problem, which is better: fluctuating demand, or fluctuating supply?  ""My view is that no one cares about supply (how many people even know how many US dollars there are in circulation?)"" said Vitalik Buterin, founder of the Ethereum project.  ""People do care about price, so stabilising price is more important, and that requires having the supply be adjustable based on price via some metric,"" he continued.  What metric could you use to stabilise the price of a cryptocurrency? It's a tricky question, because you're effectively talking about a monetary policy. Centralised monetary policies go against everything that Satoshi's original concept for bitcoin stood for.  Instead, Buterin and others are talking about a decentralised monetary policy, decided by the network. But there are significant challenges to that. The right metric must be picked, and it must be implemented in a way that doesn't let an attacker grab hold of the reins and set the price of the coin.  How to set a coin's supply  So, what metric should be used? Buterin lays out a few suggestions in this blog post, and divides the possibilities into two main kinds. The first is exogenous – using metrics outside the network, such as the price of a fiat currency.  The alternative approach is endogenous (using some internal metric to determine the supply). The internal approach is better for a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, believes Buterin, who said:  ""It doesn't introduce implicit dependencies on specific institutions (eg: targeting USD parity would essentially give the Federal Reserve control over bitcoin).""  Sams also prefers that the information comes from inside the network. There are different internal metrics that could be used, ranging from variable mining difficulty through to transaction fees.  [post-quote]  There have been proposals before that would make the price of a cryptocurrency elastic. Improved Bitcoin (IBC), the proposal from the Institute of Economic Research at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, pegs the price of cryptocurrency to the US dollar, but then uses the reward given to bitcoin miners as a way of adjusting the supply of coins.  The IBC concept has some problems, though, warns Sams. ""Their approach isn't workable for lots of reasons. The main problem with it is that they do not have any mechanism for reducing coin supply, only increasing it in an elastic way,"" he said.  Sams prefers to target a constant mining reward, based on the optimal level of network hashing costs. Then, coin supply can be increased or decreased to maintain that rate, using some alternative channel.  ""In my paper, that channel is the seigniorage shares,"" said Sams, whose theory for stabilising bitcoin price would see two kinds of token.  One token, the coin, would be used for transactions. The other token would be a share in the coin's seignorage (the profit that an issuer of money can make by creating money). Coins are exchanged for shares – and vice versa – when the supply of coins needs to increase or decrease.  Goodbye bitcoin?  Lovely. That's all set, then. We'll just get the core devs to code it into the protocol, shall we? Not so fast, said Sams, who argues that there's no support for such a fundamental change to the bitcoin technology.  Better to treat bitcoin as a good 1.0 cryptocurrency and start over, he said:  ""I don't believe in the thesis that everything rises and falls on backing a single protocol. There's no reason to think that the first protocol got everything right.""  Sams, who also consults to Ethereum, argues that a cryptocurrency designed with stability in mind from the outset will bootstrap with some function other than payments to start with.  ""They buy the coin not because they want to, but because they have to to do the something else that they really want,"" he said.  What that will be isn't clear: some form of decentralised app that can later be boosted into a payment mechanism, perhaps. Or a coin with some other social goal in mind.  Buterin goes so far as saying that bitcoin will never move beyond its current phase as a speculative currency, hoarded by those hoping for a 'to the moon' ending, because an asset will never be stable without variable supply.  A different approach  Not everyone agrees that we have to change supply to reach a more stable price for a cryptocurrency. BTC.SX's Lee things that liquidity and size are key.  ""As a community, instead of trying to control the price via artificially manipulating the supply, why not collectively work on increasing its demand?"" he said.  ""Prevailing consensus amongst economists is that liquidity is an important factor in price discovery, and that it will fuel the growth of any market or asset class regardless,"" Lee added, citing this World Bank report.  He suggests that startups focus on on-ramping consumers and targeting merchant adoption, and argues that watching venture capital flows into these two sectors is a good indicator of rising demand.  ""This will create a feedback loop in which monetary velocity can increase,"" he concluded.  If Buterin is right, and flexible supply is the only answer to volatility, then bitcoin will be stuck in a hoard-and-wait cycle forever. If Lee is right, then there's a future for bitcoin as a cryptocurrency that prioritises transaction over investment.  What do you think? Should people be lobbying for a new, stable coin with flexible supply? Or should the bitcoin community simply try to grow its way out of the problem?  Correction: This article was amended to clarify that, while bitcoin's algorithm makes the supply of bitcoins predictable, the rate at which they are distributed reduces over time.
