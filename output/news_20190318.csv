16284674,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/ripple-prepares-for-its-most-anticipated-breakout-in-eight-months,1552950000,Ripple (XRP) Prepares For Its Most Anticipated Breakout In Eight Months,"Ripple (XRP) is on the verge of its biggest and most anticipated breakouts in eight months. This is certainly a major development for XRP/USD and we could see the price rocket towards $0.50 if Ripple (XRP) succeeds in breaking above the 200 day moving average. However, so far the chances of that happening are decreasing with every passing day. The price has shown extreme weakness in the past few days and continues to remain weak. The Stochastic RSI on the daily time frame has once again neared overbought levels but the price has failed to capitalize on that. A break above the 200 day moving average is still a far cry at this point but a break below the 50 day moving average would be a lot easier. The price did break below the 50 Day MA last week but it climbed back above it before the daily close. The daily chart for XRP/USD looks very bullish but unfortunately the price action does not reflect that. The past three weeks have seen Ripple (XRP) trade sideways practically doing nothing. This has made a lot of bulls worried but it has made the bears even more worried. This is because if you are a buyer, you buy Ripple (XRP) and hodl it on an exchange or a wallet. However, if you want to profit off selling Ripple (XRP) you have to short it. Now, that comes with a lot more risks. If you are shorting Ripple (XRP), not only do you have to pay fees for keeping your short position open for so long, but you are also at increased risk if the price does not fall soon enough. In other words, the longer XRP/USD takes to consolidate, the higher its chances of a strong break to the upside which might easily end up liquidating some aggressive short positions. The 4H chart for XRP/BTC shows that Ripple (XRP) is due for a strong move against Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future even though its prospects on larger time frame do not look as good. That being said, Ripple (XRP) continues to have a more promising outlook on larger time frames compared to other cryptocurrencies. In addition to that, Ripple (XRP) has been known to make its independent moves at times and it would not be surprising if something like that were to happen again. Ripple (XRP) has faced a strong rejection at the 38.2% Fib extension level trading against Bitcoin (BTC) but it has yet to touch the 61.8% Fib extension level. This means that we might see a near term decline to the 61.8% before a retest of the 38.2%. However, larger time frames indicate that there is not much to expect and the probability of a strong move to the upside given the current price action remains low. That being said, the price could drag on towards higher levels until short term conditions turn overbought and the price is prime for a strong decline in the weeks ahead.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/ripple-prepares-for-its-most-anticipated-breakout-in-eight-months,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284674.jpeg

42381725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTKr,1552941024,CoinMarketCap Crypto Assets Now Feature Flipside Letter Grades,"Blockchain analytics startup Flipside Crypto is bringing crypto asset letter grades to a slew of online publishers.  The Fundamental Crypto Asset Score (FCAS) metric – which evaluates factors such as developer activity and a broad set of transaction data – was recently added to CoinMarketCap, along with publishers such as MarketWatch, TheStreet and Stocktwits. The move comes ahead of the launch of CoinMarketCap’s first Android app, scheduled for April.  Carylyne Chan, head of global marketing at CoinMarketCap, told CoinDesk these easy-to-use metrics will give users a more transparent view of how these assets are evolving. According to Chan, the site attracted 125 million repeat visitors in 2018 alone.  She added:  “If I’m a new user coming in with more tools and fundamental analysis like FCAS, the focus will be more holistic as opposed to only looking at the front page with the price.”  Plus, she added this partnership is part of a broader push to add educational content to CoinMarketCap, such as explainers about blockchain technology and how different groups like developers impact the ecosystem.  “It will be a good addition to the price and market data that we already have there,” Chan said. “There is a wider scope of collaboration that we’ll be working on with [Flipside Crypto].”  Flipside raised  a $4.5 million seed round last November and has since launched several products with different types of analysis. These include a portfolio tracker for crypto hedge funds and professional investors, the Hubble Monitor for companies and projects seeking to understand how users interact with their blockchain network, and the Coin Health Library for retail consumers looking for a deeper look at how the FCAS score is calculated and how more than 450 assets grow over time.  According to Chan, the most popular asset pages from 2018 include XRP, bitcoin, Tron and ether, all of which have relatively high FCAS ratings.  Flipside Crypto CEO Dave Balter told CoinDesk that, while dynamic FCAS ratings change according to live input from external exchanges and websites like GitHub, he estimates that only around 18 projects have high ratings like “Superb” or “Attractive.” (The ""S"" grade is actually higher than the ""A"" grade, differing from, say, your high-school report card.)  Roughly 350 projects have the lowest rating, ""F"" for “Fragile.”  Balter said he hopes FCAS will someday become comparable to the price-to-earnings ratio used to analyze traditional stocks.  “Let's look at crypto projects as if they were sophisticated businesses,” Balter added. “2019 is all about helping the market understand how to evaluate these assets beyond price.”  Indeed, MarketWatch general manager Dan Shar told CoinDesk that compared to traditional asset classes, readers often find cryptocurrency has “the least holistic view in terms of being able to compare these assets to each other.”  Now by listing the top 10 assets, as ranked by FCAS, in addition to the FCAS score on articles and pages related to a specific cryptocurrency, Shar said publishers like MarketWatch can strive to offer “as many tools and actionable insights as possible” for more sophisticated investment choices.

42381728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTOd,1552929912,"Overstock Delays E-Commerce Business Sale, Deferring Cash for Crypto Ventures","Overstock has put off plans to sell its flagship retail business, delaying a large cash infusion that it was hoping to get for its portfolio of blockchain ventures.  The company had originally aimed to sell the e-commerce business by the end of February, but on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results Monday, CEO Patrick Byrne indicated it no longer had a firm timeline, telling shareholders:  “It’s like preparing a souffle, and a souffle is ready when it’s ready.”  Indeed, Byrne talked as if Overstock was expecting to hold on to its original business for a while, saying he expected ""a year of explosive growth"" for the retail unit, which will ""spit out cash"" while the company continues to build the blockchain ventures.  Byrne had previously hinted at this change in priorities in an interview last month with CoinDesk, when he said he was managing the retail business ""as if I’m going to own it forever.”  Keeping the unit, for now, means Overstock will not become a pure-play blockchain company as soon as it previously envisioned. Jonathan Johnson, the president of Medici Ventures, the company's blockchain investment arm, said last year that the sale of the retail business would leave Overstock with Medici, its assets and a ""bag of cash.""  But in the risk factors section of its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, released Monday in conjunction with quarterly results, Overstock warned that if it did sell the retail business at this stage, its revenues would shrink ""to an insignificant amount,"" adding:  ""Our retail business is a relatively mature and predictable business compared to our Medici initiatives, which have a short history, minimal revenues, significant expenses, significant losses and significant uncertainties, and conduct business in a new and rapidly changing industry.""  Further, such a sale would make Overstock ""a much smaller company,"" the filing said.  Both tZERO and the retail business of Overstock posted pre-tax losses in Q4: $12.6 million and $27.7 million, respectively — and both net loss numbers were significantly higher than a year earlier.  Crypto trading at tZERO  Overstock also said Monday that tZERO, its security token trading platform, would add cryptocurrency trading in June, though it did not provide further details.  An executive on the conference call reiterated that Overstock is expecting tZERO to see a ""spike"" in volume in August when the regulatory lock-up period for the native TZEROP tokens expires and retail investors will be let onto the platform. So far, the trading volume has been low with the price of the token falling sharply during the first months of trading.  There are also some changes in the C-suite: tZERO has recruited an executive from its partner brokerage Dinosaur Financial Group, which is currently the sole broker-dealer supporting trading on the platform. Dinosaur's former managing director Elliot Grossman has become CEO of retail broker dealer at tZERO, the company announced.  tZERO's alternative trading system (ATS) was launched January 25 only for the accredited investors that participated in tZERO Preferred (TZEROP) security token offering. So far only TZEROP is traded at the platform, though Byrne is expecting more companies to issue their tokens using tZERO's tech. The first of them might be a mini-car manufacturer Elio Motors, Byrne earlier told CoinDesk.  The onboarding of a new token is expected by August, an executive said during Monday's call, though he didn't name the company.  SEC probe ongoing  The annual report from Overstock also disclosed that the SEC had sent a follow-up request for information in December about tZERO's $250 million token sale, as part of a previously reported investigation by the regulator.  The filing warned that this ongoing probe, which began in February 2018, could be a drain on management resources.  ""We are cooperating fully with the SEC in connection with its investigation, which will require the time and attention of tZERO and our personnel and may have an adverse effect on our ability to focus attention on our businesses and our ability to raise capital,"" not to mention bad publicity, the filing said.  Despite such distractions, tZERO is also in the process of getting an in-house retail broker-dealer and partnering with another brokerage company, according to the presentation slides from the call. As announced earlier, a security token exchange for publicly traded companies called BSTX, in partnership with the Boston Options Exchange, is also due to launch later this year.  Byrne didn't spend much time on the Monday call talking about the collapsed deal with the Chinese private equity GSR Capital that had been expected to invest around $404 million in Overstock and tZERO.  After the deadline for the deal expired on Feb. 28, Overstock disclosed that the deal hadn't been completed, but a new memorandum of understanding had been signed with GSR and a third partner, the Singapore company Makara Capital, for a much smaller investment of $100 million.  Overstock is ""really encouraged"" about the partnership with Makara, an executive said during the call.  Summing up the current sentiment and plans for his company, Byrne said:  ""We are going to return retail to spitting out cash and we have a full position in the blockchain revolution.""

42381711,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oT1z,1552924852,IBM Signs 6 Banks to Issue Stablecoins and Use Stellar's XLM Cryptocurrency,"IBM is taking its banking clients a step closer to cryptocurrency.  Announced Monday, six international banks have signed letters of intent to issue stablecoins, or tokens backed by fiat currency, on World Wire, an IBM payment network that uses the Stellar public blockchain. The network promises to let regulated institutions move value across borders – remittances or foreign exchange – more quickly and cheaply than the legacy correspondent banking system.  So far three of the banks have been identified – Philippines-based RCBC, Brazil's Banco Bradesco, and Bank Busan of South Korea – the rest, which are soon to be named, will offer digital versions of euros and Indonesian rupiah, “pending regulatory approvals and other reviews,"" IBM said.  The network went live Monday, although while the banks await their regulators' blessings, the one stablecoin running on World Wire at the moment is a previously announced U.S. dollar-backed token created by Stronghold, a startup based in San Francisco. “We say 'limited production,'” said Jesse Lund, IBM's head of blockchain for financial services, of the project's status.  Indeed, while Stronghold's USD-backed coin currently serves as an on-ramp for greenbacks, there are as yet no pay-in/pay-out locations in the U.S. In this regard, IBM has received “a favorable verbal response” from U.S. regulators, said Lund.  “So we are starting with markets that are outside of the U.S., but it won't be long before we add U.S. as an operating endpoint. It will be sometime this year; we will get to it, third quarter, fourth quarter something like that,” he said.  Still, the World Wire platform has payment locations in 72 countries, with 48 currencies and 46 ""banking endpoints"" (which include banks and money transmitters) where people can send or receive cash, said IBM.  Aside from issuing their own tokens, the arrangement opens up the possibility of banks using lumens, the native token of the Stellar blockchain, which can be used as a ""bridge currency"" when it is hard to trade one type of fiat for another. Also, World Wire “could support other cryptos” but is only supporting lumens for the moment because financial institutions are put off by the volatility of cryptocurrencies, Lund said.  However, as far as growing a bank-backed stablecoin universe is concerned, Lund has a grand vision. He told CoinDesk,  “As more stablecoins come on board, the whole notion of FX changes over time. We are working very hard to expand the ecosystem of stablecoins that will include many more banks and many more fiat currencies – so digital representations of fiat currencies - and even, eventually, central bank issued digital currencies.”  Stellar performance  World Wire may be the first big outing for IBM and Stellar, but Big Blue has been quietly working on this for some time, such as in its pilot in late 2017 with a money transfer operator called KlickEx in the South Pacific region.  It’s all part of former banker Lund’s idea for how IBM will play its part in the future of financial services.  “We are doing a lot of other stuff in the private permissioned space, which is code for enterprise blockchain,” he said. “But this is a different type of system and a different type of network, and IBM is convening this. I mean, this is something IBM has never done before.”  Stellar, created by former Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, has been making plenty of bold moves under its own steam: so what does IBM bring to the table?  Lund said IBM calls itself the “network operator” while Stellar is really the protocol level. In terms of IBM’s role, this includes maintaining the payment API and some core system software that handles accounts and money flow for participants on the network.  It also helps that IBM has relationships with most of the banks on the planet. Lund also pointed out that IBM is “the single most trusted validator on the public Stellar network today,” meaning many other nodes listen to its nodes about which transactions should occur.  “Look at the Stellar dashboard and see the IBM validators out there,” said Lund. “There’s a lot of others, but everyone trusts us. So in the consensus model, we are kind of a big anchor there.”  New revenue model  As well as pushing Stellar and stablecoins into the wheelhouse of numerous banks and regulators, IBM's blockchain division is also exploring a new revenue model with World Wire.  This is probably a smart strategy as the pressure on enterprise players to show at least the possibility of a return on investment is becoming palpable.  Indeed, an IBM spokeswoman told CoinDesk last week about the vendor’s move to a pay-as-you-go model.  “In the next version of IBM Blockchain Platform, we will be moving to an hourly charge based on consumption, so that users have much more flexibility over their costs and infrastructure as they build blockchain,” she said.  In keeping with that, World Wire is free to join; participants pay according to the value they move through the network, said Lund. “That's how we maintain our revenue for supporting the network and so that alone is an entirely new way of engaging the financial services industry that IBM has never done before.”  The aggregate numbers for global payments are pretty staggering, noted Lund, in the hundreds of trillions of dollars per year which transact across borders. As such, IBM intends to “meter the money” and “charge a very, very modest amount of basis points” on the value that flows through this frictionless pipeline, said Lund, concluding,  “I am not talking about selling software here. I am talking about transactional revenue by way of our ownership of a new kind of network that's enabled by blockchain; it's all about new transactional networks.”  IBM image via nattul / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,XLM,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | XLM,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/18/ibm-signs-6-banks-to-issue-stablecoins-and-use-stellars-xlm-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c20c0b298f0a65a075664244ebd40465ea5639d3-1500x1083.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381714,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oT4V,1552921209,A Lightning API for Bitcoin Futures Data Has Launched,"An experimental service that allows users to pay for futures data from exchanges Kraken and BitMEX with bitcoin's in-development lightning network is now live.  Launched by Suredbits Monday, the application programming interface (API) allows developers access to information about available futures contracts, specifically, according to CEO Chris Stewart: ""You will be able to subscribe to market data from those two exchanges with a payment over the lightning network.""  This data from popular exchanges Kraken and BitMEX is normally free. In this way, the new service is not necessarily intended to be used. Rather it's a proof-of-concept for how lightning network micropayments can be used to procure data.  Suredbits thinks lightning will play a big role in the future of developer APIs because the payment network allows for smaller payments (often called ""micropayments""), making it easier for developers to buy small amounts of data - maybe even less than a cent's worth at a time.  Stewart went as far as to call traditional market data and API models ""broken,"" adding:  ""We are using [the new APIs] to showcase that lightning allows [exchanges] to monetize things that are monetized at traditional exchanges. We are pushing the idea that lightning has a multitude of benefits when integrated into an exchange's infrastructure that isn't just related to withdrawals and deposits.""  Lightning is still considered risky to use, with lingering bugs leading some users to lose money. But developers are still building on top of the network, since it's widely seen as the future of bitcoin payments.  Suredbits, a little startup from Iowa, is one of a few companies focused mostly on lightning projects. Yet, it's part of a growing number of bitcoin startups tying the lightning network into their business.  As another showcase, Suredbits (which launched on mainnet earlier this month) recently revealed a “playground” developers can use to test its service for retrieving NFL, NBA, and cryptocurrency market data – all using lightning.

Four representatives and senators from the state jointly filed the bipartisan house bill 1247 on Friday, proposing that the commissioner of the Department of Agriculture assemble an advisory group to study the potential applications for blockchain technology in agricultural operations.  Several blockchain use cases were identified by the lawmakers, including improving traceability of products ""from farm to shelf,"" controlling inventory and monitoring in-field conditions such as weather and soil quality.  Maintaining records for production and transportation equipment, verifying data and certification of organic products, tracking and ordering resources such as fertilizer and seed – all using blockchain – are also some of the other areas that could be studied by the group.  As proposed, the advisory group would eventually report back to the general assembly with its findings and recommendations for any legislation by Jan. 15, 2020.  The prospect of improving agricultural operations through blockchain technology is starting to see widespread interest across the globe.  The area of supply chains is seeing particular attention, with numerous projects having launched to investigate the tracking of products such as coffee, meat, milk, fish and more.  Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron made a strident call for increased use of data technologies such as blockchain across the EU to boost the agriculture industry and address concerns over food traceability following the Polish meat scandal.  And, back in October, the four biggest agricultural corporations, popularly known as the ""ABCD"" – Archer Daniels Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus – were also looking to blockchain and AI to bring the global grain trade into the digital age.

In an announcement, 2gether said customers will be able to use the card to pay with either euros or any of the following seven cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), EOS, Stellar (XLM) and litecoin (LTC). The card “instantly” converts the cryptos to fiat currency and, it said, and can be used fee-free by customers in any of the 19 eurozone nations.  The company said the card would address the hurdles that come with making payments directly with cryptocurrencies. “Currently, spending crypto is a long and difficult process involving exchanges, personal keys, and lots of waiting,” it said.  Following a beta launch in Spain, the firm is now expanding across the eurozone, adding that users can now download the app in expectation of a March 27 launch.  The same day, the firm also plans a pre-sale of its native token ""2GT"" via the app, aiming to raise €5 million (or $5.65 million).

42402691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDmD,1552911943,Coinbase Pro Has Good and Bad News Regarding Fees for Traders,"Coinbase Pro is changing its fee structure later this week, with bottom tier traders seeing a hike and higher value clients paying less.  The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange announced the news in a blog post on Friday, saying that, starting March 22, market makers and takers who fall under the pricing tier of up to $100,000 will be subject to total fees of 0.40 percent, as compared to up to 0.30 percent (taker only) currently.  The $100,000 to $1 million tier will stay with the current total fee of 0.30 percent, but that will be shared between makers and takers, while currently takers pay the full fee. The $10 million to $50 million bracket also sees the 0.20 percent total fee unchanged, but split between makers and takers.  For other tiers, though, there are fee reductions in store. Above $100 million and above $1 billion, total fees are being reduced by 50 percent, while tiers in between are benefiting from cuts of 20-30 percent (see image below). All tiers now see makers taking some of the fee burden.  The new fee structure is designed to “increase liquidity by reducing the delta between maker and taker fees,” Coinbase said.  Economist and trader Alex Kruger set out the changes in a tweet with the following comprehensive table:  “All stop orders must now be submitted as limit orders and include a limit price. All currently open stop market orders will be canceled on Friday, March 22 @ 6:00 pm PDT,” the exchange added.  Both limit and stop orders are orders to buy or sell an asset when its price moves past a specified level. However, stop orders cannot be seen by the market until the trade has occurred.  Both Pro and Prime will also introduce a 10 percent market ""protection point"" for all market orders, according to the blog post, meaning that market orders that move the price in excess of 10 percent will ""stop executing and return a partial fill.""  “Protection points help prevent large orders from causing more than 10% slippage,” the exchange said.

42402695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDpA,1552906886,An Old Resistance Hurdle Is Back and Could Stall Bitcoin's Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin clocked highs above $4,000 over the weekend and closed last week on a positive note, strengthening the short-term bullish outlook.  The ongoing recovery rally, however, could pause around $4,000 or fall back to key support levels lined up at $3,775 and $3,658, as the bearish (downward sloping) 21-week simple moving average (SMA) is currently lined up at $4,073. That SMA served as a stiff resistance last year.  Bitcoin's outlook as per the daily chart would turn bearish if prices see a UTC close below the Feb. 27 low of $3,658. That would open the doors for a re-test of lows near $3,300 seen at the end of January.  Bitcoin's (BTC) four-week price rally now faces a former support-turned-resistance level that repeatedly capped gains in 2018.  The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $3,965, representing a 1.73 percent gain on a weekly basis, according to Bitstamp data. That was the fourth straight weekly gain and the longest winning streak since April 2018.  With strong volumes backing bitcoin's move to a three-week high of $4,040 over the weekend, the case for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally from January lows looks strong.  However, a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change above $4,236 may remain elusive for few weeks, as the 21-month simple moving average (SMA) – a technical line which acted as strong resistance in 2018 – is currently located at $4,073.  More importantly, the average line is still trending south in favor of the bears, and bitcoin is not likely to breach it with a 90-degree rally.  Further, with BTC struggling to hold on to gains above $4,000 for the third day running, the bullish momentum is beginning to wane.  As of writing, the BTC is changing hands at $3,955 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $4,016 earlier today.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, bitcoin printed bullish higher lows along the 21-week SMA throughout the 2016-2017 uptrend. The average support was breached on Jan. 29, 2018, and has reversed rallies ever since.  As such, a convincing move above that SMA, currently at $4,073, could be considered an early sign of a long-term bullish reversal.  It is often observed that markets tend to consolidate post-break above a downward sloping MA and pick up a strong bid once the average has shed bearish bias (bottomed out).  For instance, BTC jumped above the descending 100-day MA on Feb. 19, but the follow-through quickly fizzled out near $4,200 and prices fell back to the long-term MA on March 4. More importantly, bitcoin lacked clear directional bias and rose back to $4,000 only after the average turned flat on March 14.  Thus, any break above the 21-week SMA needs to be viewed with caution as long as the average line is trending south. A repeated rejection at the average line could invite selling pressure, as seen in November.  Daily chart  On the daily, BTC closed above $3,950 (Mar. 9 high) on Saturday, bolstering the short-term bullish setup as indicated by both the ascending trendline and the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs.  So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish, which adds credence to the possibility of a pause in upward momentum suggested by the weekly chart.

42402687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDkF,1552899645,Citi Has Scrapped Its Plan for a JPM Coin-Like Bank-Backed Cryptocurrency,"In light of the splash JPMorgan made recently with its plan for a bank-backed cryptocurrency, it’s worth remembering another big institution first tested a token to connect global payments – back in 2015.  Codenamed “Citicoin,"" the project out of Citigroup’s innovation lab in Dublin was never formally announced by the bank, even as a proof of concept. The idea was to streamline global payment processes. As such, there are obvious parallels with the much-vaunted JPM Coin.  However, having taken stock of the experiment (not to mention the scorn of the bitcoin community at that time) Citi concluded that, while the technology has the potential to live up to its promises, there were other more effective and efficient ways of making improvements in payments.  That’s according to Citi’s current innovation lab chief, Gulru Atak, global head of innovation for treasury and trade solutions (TTS). Regarding the crypto experiments of her predecessors, she told CoinDesk:  “Based on our learnings from that experiment we actually decided to make meaningful improvements in the existing rails by leveraging the payments ecosystem and within that ecosystem, we are considering the fintechs as well or the regulators around the world as well, including SWIFT.”  Taking a measured step back, Atak said when it comes to improving cross-border payments, the bank is looking at effective methods but with a shorter-term impact. “We are trying to make those changes today, rather than just putting all our efforts into future technology,” she said.  After all, to completely change a cross-border payment network with blockchain-enabled technology, one would have to on-board all the world’s banks, Atak said, adding:  “If we are talking about cross border payments, how many banks do we have across the world – and how many of them are already on-boarded on SWIFT? And how long has it taken SWIFT to onboard all those banks?”  As such, Citi’s blockchain strategy in recent years has been about finding ways to integrate legacy systems, said Atak, citing the bank’s 2017 partnership with Nasdaq, CitiConnect, designed to streamline payments around private securities. That project, she said, also has parallels with JPM Coin.  “[CitiConnect] didn't issue stablecoins but the infrastructure that was used was similar to issuing coins on a blockchain platform,"" Atak said. ""But it was purely to integrate into a blockchain-enabled system on our client's end and make it connect to our legacy payment processes real-time.”  From trade finance to FX  While Atak was happy to reflect on previous blockchain initiatives, she also pointed out that Citi certainly continues to explore blockchain, especially in areas like trade finance.  This niche is a more realistic use case, she said, because building an ecosystem for trade finance doesn’t require as many banks as a full-blown cross-border payments system. “Our focus is currently more in the trade space and trade finance and trade letters of credit. We are experimenting with this technology but probably we are a little bit, like, reserved when it comes to making bold public announcements.”  Rival global bank HSBC is not so shy about beating its chest. In January, HSBC announced it had settled $250 billion of foreign exchange (FX) trades using a blockchain over the past year.  Regarding FX, Opeyemi Olomo, blockchain lead from Citi’s Innovation Lab, said there are clear pain points in that market, which has issues around credit transparency. As with global payments, the question of whether to apply blockchain comes down to building an ecosystem and how onerous that process would be in relation to the benefit.  Olomo agreed there is an opportunity.  “There is a niche ecosystem and if you look at liquidity providers in the FX space, the major liquidity providers are not that many. So that's an ecosystem where you could maybe think of it and have like five or six together and you can start actually creating a difference,” he said.  Broadly speaking, Atak said many industries are pushing hard to move existing instruments to a blockchain-enabled platform without necessarily thinking why that instrument exists from the very beginning.  Instead, a close examination of the very nature of financial instruments might be required, she said. “For example, how did a human being come up with a banking instrument called a letter of credit? What were the issues that led to its creation?”  This philosophical approach will guide Citi’s thinking, Atak added, concluding:  “I am challenging ourselves as well: are we looking to this technology to its best potential or are we just trying to get rid of the current friction and operational inefficiency in the system?  This article has been updated to reflect that custody solutions are not part of the TTS business and does not fall within Gulru Atak's mandate.

42402700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDq9,1552889491,Bitcoin’s Price and Network Activity: One is Outpacing the Other,"Bitcoin's user growth, as represented by active addresses, has spiked in the last eight weeks leaving the price far behind, a move that contradicts the popular belief the two tend to move in tandem.  The 30 day average of active addresses on bitcoin's blockchain, or the number of accounts that made cryptocurrency transactions at any point during the last 24 hours, total 664,064 as of March 16– up 17 percent from 569,812 seen on Jan. 20. Bitcoin's 30 day average price, however, has increased just 1 percent during the same time span, according to Coinmetrics.  An uptick in active addresses is taken by many as a sign of the cryptocurrency's increasing popularity or investor confidence. The active addresses count, however, tends to rise even when long-term dormant ""HODLers"" move out of the cryptocurrency and into fiat.  So, betting on a price rise every time active addresses spike could prove costly.  Other network activity metrics like the network volume and the transaction amount to active addresses ratio (TAAR) tend to shed more light on how network activity impacts bitcoin's price.  Active Addresses vs. BTC/USD  As can be seen above, the divergence between active addresses and bitcoin’s price has become quite large, which perhaps comes as a surprise given the two rose and fell in unison for much of 2018.  But while the divergence between the two metrics is indeed growing, it’s hardly been the first time such a development has occurred.  For instance, active addresses maintained notable growth throughout the entire bear market that spanned nearly two years from 2014 to early 2016, which implies active addresses may not be the most predictive fundamental metric for bitcoin’s price.  Since active addresses are only a measure of how many accounts are actively making transactions, other metrics like network volume and TAAR can be used to provide insight into the actual amount of funds the addresses are spending.  Transaction Volume vs. BTC/USD  As can be seen in the chart below, the 30-day average of bitcoin’s network volume, or the amount of funds (USD) transmitted through its blockchain, appears to have a much stronger relationship with the price of BTC/USD than the trend of active addresses.  Perhaps not coincidentally, when viewed on Coinmetrics' semi-log graph, the 30-day avg. of transaction volume has been quite precise in identifying bitcoin market tops and bottoms, as depicted by the average line either falling below or rising above prices.  Upon closer examination, it can be seen the network volume has also seen an uptick over the past couple of weeks.  The 30-day average of network volume has increased from $2.24 billion on Feb. 17, to $2.86 billion on March 16, an increase of roughly 27 percent. In the same time bitcoin’s average price increased just over 8 percent from $3,568 to $3,862.  Indeed, bitcoin's transaction volume appears to track prices more accurately, but since the number of active addresses is also a valid reflection network usage, it’s worth viewing how the interplay between the two impact bitcoin's price, if at all.  Transaction Amount to Active Addresses Ratio (TAAR)  First introduced  by founder of Pugilist Ventures, Chris Brookins, the TAAR metric “acts as an “equilibrium” gauge of bitcoin’s price to fundamentals valuation, where transaction volume and active addresses both represent “quantity and quality” growth of the bitcoin network”  In other words, TAAR represents how the interplay between the two metrics that measure the quantity (transaction volume) and quality (active addresses) of network activity impacts bitcoin’s price as opposed to viewing their effects in isolation.  While the sample size is small, spanning only a few years, it is clear that bitcoin’s market reacts positively when the TAAR is in an uptrend and reacts negatively when it is not.  As can be seen, however, the TAAR is still in an apparent downtrend and has deviated from bitcoin’s price trend, indicating the fundamental metrics that measure the quality and quantity of activity on bitcoin’s blockchain is not at equilibrium with its price.  Conclusion  Active addresses are indeed growing faster than bitcoin’s price is increasing, but the metric only tells half the story. The amount of funds passed through the blockchain, known as network volume, is also a key measure of network activity, as it shows how much is being transferred, not just how many accounts are conducting transactions.  When the interplay between the two is depicted, the TAAR metric shows bitcoin’s network activity has room to grow before confirming a bullish effect on the market.

42402685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcDfK,1552874440,When Bakkt? Bitcoin Futures Market's Approval Appears Stuck in Limbo,"Bakkt was first announced in early August as a bitcoin trading and custody platform, but its launch has been repeatedly delayed  It has submitted a proposal to the CFTC, asking for an exemption which would allow it to custody the bitcoin it uses to settle its futures contracts. While CFTC Commissioners were reportedly given the proposal in December, it now appears to be back before CFTC staffers.  It is unclear if or when the proposal may be published for a mandatory 30-day public review period.  Until the review period has ended – and CFTC Commissioners have voted to approve Bakkt's exemption – the exchange cannot launch its one-day physically-settled futures contract.      More than six months since Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) revealed its vision for Bakkt, the hotly anticipated bitcoin futures market is still awaiting regulatory approval.  ICE, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, originally planned to launch Bakkt in mid-December. Then it got pushed back to late January. Then, on New Year's Eve, the launch was indefinitely delayed, with ICE saying its previous Jan. 24 target ""will be amended pursuant to the CFTC’s process and timeline.""  Now, with the first quarter of 2019 nearly over, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has yet to release Bakkt's proposed exemption for public comment. That means even if the proposal came out today, the launch can't happen until mid-April at the earliest since the commissioners have to give the public 30 days to weigh in and then take another few days to read the comments before voting on whether to approve the plan.  And as of late February, the proposal, which would allow Bakkt to custody the bitcoin trading on the platform, was still being reviewed by the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight, two officials said.  Why the hold-up? The government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22 and lasted a record five weeks, creating backlogs at the CFTC and other agencies, surely didn't help matters. In getting caught up, the agency has prioritized other matters, mostly unrelated to crypto, including more than half a dozen enforcement actions announced since the shutdown ended.  But the ambitious nature of Bakkt's business plan is likely also a factor in drawing out the process.  Physical settlement  To be clear: the issue is not necessarily with Bakkt's envisioned one-day futures contract, which would be physically settled, meaning the buyer would receive the actual commodity – bitcoin – at maturity.  In late February Amir Zaidi, the director of the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight, told CoinDesk that the analysis for evaluating cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts – such as what CME Group and the Cboe offer – is slightly different from the analysis for evaluating physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts.  The different analyses examine whether the futures contracts, once offered, are ""readily susceptible to manipulation,"" Zaidi said. This is a concern with cash-settled contracts, where at the end one party pays the other the difference between the spot and futures prices; if the spot price is determined from a manipulated price feed, one side is getting bilked.  With a physically settled contract like Bakkt's, ""you don’t have to worry about the cash market, so some of [the] concerns [are resolved],"" said Zaidi, who would not discuss the proposal any further.  Yet while the manipulation concerns associated with cash-settled contracts may be addressed by physically settled futures, Bakkt's intent to act as its own custody warehouse appears to have raised other issues.  'Novel and complex'  A former CFTC staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because their current employer has business before the regulator, noted that generally, commodity futures exchanges use a service provider like a bank or trust to manage custody ""under the full control of the clearinghouse.""  The contracts are settled at the bank or trust, but the underlying asset would be delivered ""under the auspices of the clearinghouse, and under federal or state oversight of the bank or trust,"" this lawyer said.  ""It seems to me, without more information, that Bakkt is trying to gain approval as a third-party warehouse similar to a silo where it’s controlled by the requirements put in place by the clearinghouse and the exchange, by ICE's regulated entities in this case,"" they said.  Yet Bakkt's proposal, based on what information has been publicly released to date, could result in the firm not falling under federal or state oversight.  The former CFTC staffer explained:  ""Without knowing more, the hiccup could be that Bakkt's approach is novel and complex and the [question] is do you treat the delivery point like a grain silo or do you treat the delivery point like the clearinghouse itself; and if you treat the delivery point as a grain silo does it have some sort of designation under state or federal law?""  Return to sender?  In December, a source familiar with the CFTC's process told CoinDesk that Bakkt’s proposal to custody bitcoin on its clients’ behalf using its own warehouse had been passed from the agency's staff to the commissioners.  However, it would appear this is no longer the case.  The former CFTC staffer said it is not unusual for proposals to be sent from the Commissioner level back down to staff, particularly ""if [the Commissioners] are not comfortable with the direction or their questions are not answered.""  Late last month, Commissioner Brian Quintenz told a group of reporters at a derivatives conference in New York that he did not have the Bakkt proposal before him at the time, meaning he would not be able to vote on whether to release it for public comment.  When pressed about Bakkt, CFTC commissioners repeatedly referred CoinDesk to the regulator's work with guidance on ""actual delivery"" – a long-standing issue for the agency – to indicate that the agency is still examining the crypto space, if not specifically the Bakkt proposal.  Speaking to CoinDesk in late February, CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkowitz explained that this guidance ""is one of the priorities [for] the agency,"" but that there are also a number of other issues to examine (of the non-crypto-related variety).  Like Berkowitz, Quintenz referred CoinDesk to the regulator’s examination of its actual delivery guidance.  'Not standing still'  For its part, Bakkt appears to have been continuing to build out its product and systems. In January, CEO Kelly Loeffler announced that the company was acquiring select assets belonging to Rosenthal Collins Group, a futures commission merchant.  These assets included former employees of the group, and Bakkt finalized the deal the next month.  In her January announcement, Loeffler stated that the ""acquisition underlines the fact we’re not standing still as we await regulatory approval by the CFTC for the launch of regulated trading in our crypto markets.""  Loeffler did not provide any revised estimates on when Bakkt would launch.  Bakkt declined to comment for this story. But at a derivatives conference in Boca Raton, Fla., last week, chief operating officer Adam White spoke in general terms about the exchange's work with regulators, indicating his team recognized a need for patience.  ""It’s not the world where you fill out an application, you throw it over the fence and you hope you get it back so you can launch your business,"" he said, without mentioning the CFTC or the status of Bakkt's proposal. ""It’s partnering and working with the regulators to help them understand what is hard fork, what a deep chain reorg is, why one blockchain or public blockchain may be sufficient and capable while another one isn’t. It’s very much the approach that we’ve been taking.""  White concluded:  ""And the regulators are going to move at the pace they are comfortable with, so that they are protecting the public.""
