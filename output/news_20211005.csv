42376028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE0x5,1633478024,Brazilian Congress to Consider Bill Regulating Crypto Exchanges,"Brazil’s congress will discuss a bill that regulates companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector and increases penalties for crypto pyramid schemes and other illegal activities.  A special commission of the Brazilian House of Representatives already approved the bill presented on Sept. 29. If approved by the plenary, the legislation, which was introduced by federal deputy Aureo Ribeiro, would force “virtual asset service providers to follow rules of communication of financial transactions, with identification of customers and recordkeeping,” according to a Portuguese-language text published on the Brazil congressional website.  The bill would also increase the penalty for money laundering crimes using virtual currencies, including bitcoin.  Currently, the penalty for money laundering in Brazil consists of imprisonment for three to 10 years and a fine, according to the chamber’s website. If the bill passes, penalties for crypto-related fraud would be four to over 16 years imprisonment, plus a fine.  The proposed law would give companies operating in the sector 180 days to adapt to the new regulations.  The bill comes as more Brazilians are investing in cryptocurrencies and awareness of the sector has widened. João Manoel Pinho de Mello, director of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), recently said that a significant migration from paper currency to digital means of payment will take place in the next few years, and BCB President Roberto Campos Neto has said Brazil could be ready for a digital currency in 2022.  In July, Mercado Bitcoin, the largest crypto exchange in Brazil, raised $200 million in a Series B funding round from the SoftBank Latin America Fund and became the first Brazilian crypto unicorn after it got a $2.1 billion valuation.  Ribeiro’s bill covers a wide range of companies that provide crypto-related services such as exchange and custody.  According to the bill, “only institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil may exclusively provide the service of virtual assets, or accumulate it with other activities.” That will occur within the framework of a regulation issued by an agency or entity chosen by the executive branch of the country, the website text added.  The House of Representatives announced that the proposal must be analyzed at a general session of the lower house but didn’t specify when that debate will take place.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/05/brazilian-congress-to-consider-bill-regulating-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cbafe314d02c7feec433284ec12ba3ba701a0191-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report went through various aspects of Cardano, including its creation, leadership, community, and so forth. Cardano is the third-largest holding of Grayscale in its GDLC Fund (Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund). This is why the asset manager has taken a vested interest in the asset and is educating its investors on one of its largest crypto holdings. In the report, the pros and cons of the network are outlined. Along with the upgrades which are being carried out on the network to put it in a favorable position to compete with other large cryptocurrencies in the market. Competing With The Market As time went on, the way the Cardano network was structured had unveiled a flaw in its design. Once decentralized finance gained popularity, it became obvious that the blockchain would not be able to compete on the same level as Ethereum due to its lack of smart contracts capability. Developers had then begun to work on launching smart contracts capability on the network, which became a reality on September 12th, 2021.

42376042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE1Eh,1633470366,Market Wrap: Bitcoin at $51K as the Bulls Return,"Bitcoin is trading around $51,400, which analysts consider a positive milestone after last month’s crypto sell-off. BTC is up about 22% over the past week and has decoupled from slumping global equities.  Sentiment on bitcoin significantly improved over the past week, signaling a shift away from market panic, according to the Fear and Greed Index. Technical indicators are also showing improving short-term momentum, which is consistent with rising bullish sentiment.  “We expect short-term overbought conditions to be weathered long enough for a test of minor resistance near $52.9K, a breakout above which would target the all-time high,” Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, a technical research firm, wrote in a Monday newsletter.  “The move up was leverage driven, with the end of October being the highest point of the futures curve for BTC,” QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram announcement on Tuesday. “We could potentially see more short squeeze if spot BTC legs up higher.”  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $51,215, +4.0%  Ether (ETH), $3,490, +2.4%  S&P 500: +1.1%  Gold: $1,762, -0.4%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.527%  Fresh off the presses  Check out the latest quarterly report from CoinDesk Research, which outlines growing market interest in crypto from institutions, retail investors and regulators.  Bullish sentiment returns  The bitcoin Fear and Greed index is rising from a low point last month, suggesting that investors are less fearful during the latest price recovery. Historically, extreme lows in the Fear and Greed Index precede price rebounds similar to July, when BTC traders exited short positions.  On the flip side, extreme bullish sentiment could lead to a price pullback, although the Fear and Greed index is still below highs reached earlier this year.  “After three weeks of fear, [the index] shot up during the first days of October when the bitcoin price appreciated and is now signaling a greedy market sentiment,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Bitcoin supply in profit  Roughly 10% of the circulating BTC supply returned to an unrealized profit (above cost basis), according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode.  “We can therefore deduce, that alongside the $29K to $40K range in May-July, the recent lows of $40K to $41K represented a significant ‘value add’ zone for buyers who stepped in and purchased to set a price floor,” the firm wrote in a blog post.  Additionally, short-term holders, or those who purchased BTC within the last 155 days, are recovering previous losses. “As a larger portion of the market returns to profit, it creates incentives for some investors to take profits,” Glassnode wrote. Some BTC investors could also decide to hold long positions for continued upside this year.  Altcoin roundup  Axie Infinity creator closes $152 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz: On Tuesday, Axie’s creator, Vietnam-based Sky Mavis, announced it had raised a $152 million Series B round at a $3 billion valuation, led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The company said it plans to use the funds to build out its own distribution platform to support outside developers in creating blockchain-enabled games, as well as expand its team and scaling infrastructure. Axie’s AXS token was trading at approximately $130 Tuesday afternoon, down from a high of $154 earlier this week.  THORSwap DEX raises $3.75 million as multi-chain DeFi heats up: THORSwap, a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) built on THORChain, has raised $3.75 million in a private token sale led by IDEO CoLab Ventures, reported CoinDesk’s Helene Braun. “Unlocking cross-chain liquidity will be critical to the future of decentralized finance,” Han Kao, founder of Sanctor Capital, said. Funding will go towards the app’s development and expanding of operational resources as well as the launch of new products.  NFT trading volume surges 700% to $10.7B in Q3: Trading in non-fungible tokens (NFT) climbed to $10.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of more than 700% from the previous quarter, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm DappRadar. Growth was powered by a record-breaking August, which saw over $5.2 billion in trading volume, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. DappRadar said that “there is not a single but multiple reasons” for the surge. One of these is the way in which NFT projects are “becoming brands,” with celebrities such as rapper Snoop Dogg and Hall of Fame basketball player Shaquille O’Neal putting their names to communities, strengthening the social aspect of NFTs.

Circle, a key supporter of the USDC stablecoin, said in a regulatory filing that it received an “investigative subpoena” from the SEC’s Enforcement Division in July. That subpoena requests “documents and information regarding certain of our holdings, customer programs and operations,” the filing said.  “We are cooperating fully with their investigation,” Circle said in the filing, which was issued as part of Circle’s plan to go public. In the documents, it didn’t elaborate on what the SEC’s investigation was focused on. Circle told CoinDesk late Tuesday it could not provide additional information.  The subpoena arrived one month after Circle began onboarding corporate USDC holders into its first high-interest yield product, Circle Yield. It pitched U.S. corporations on a “well regulated” crypto yield product in a subsequent announcement that boasted its licenses in Bermuda.  That was more than Coinbase, the other member of the USDC-issuing Centre Consortium, could tout when the SEC effectively iced the exchange’s planned lending program last month. The SEC has come out swinging at crypto this year, repeatedly arguing for more enforcement authority.  Circle first disclosed the investigation’s existence in an August filing that went largely unnoticed at the time.  It’s not the firm’s first disclosed run-in with the SEC as it prepares to go public in a special purpose acquisition company deal that values the company at $4.5 billion.  Circle said in August it agreed to pay the SEC over $10 million to settle charges that its one-time subsidiary, Poloniex, was operating as an unregistered digital asset exchange.

At press time, bitcoin was trading about $50,250, up 5.4% over the last 24 hours.  Given the difficult environment across all other asset classes, bitcoin’s long-term holders are the backbone in this rally above the $50,000 level, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “If momentum buying continues and the price rallies above $52,000, we could confirm the end of this consolidation pattern,” said Moya. (A consolidation pattern is a pause in a stock’s trend that allows the trend to continue further.)  Wall Street is in for a choppy period of dealing with market risks, such as the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its $120 billion-a-month of monetary stimulus, an energy crunch and rising bond yields, according to Moya.  This should only help cryptos over the short term,” he said.  “Bitcoin breaking $50,000 is a confirmation of the bull market being back,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock.  According to the firm, more than 800,000 BTC were previously acquired around $48,000. Sometimes buyers and sellers will target these entry levels for key trading decisions.  “Such high concentration of volume translates into resistance in price action,” Outumuro said. “Now that we’ve surpassed that level, there doesn’t seem to be meaningful resistance up to $56,000.”  The latest surge in bitcoin appeared to lead a broad rally in cryptocurrency prices. The Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether, was up 3%, while Polygon’s MATIC rose 4.8% and Binance’s BNB coin gained 4%.

That sense of rising distrust was validated yet again with the Oct. 3 release of the so-called Pandora Papers, a trove of almost 12 million leaked documents from law firms and other organizations around the world. The documents unmask the previously unknown owners of 29,000 offshore companies hiding billions of dollars in assets from taxation or oversight. The owners include political leaders, celebrities and underworld figures from more than 200 nations, with the bulk from Russia, the U.K., Argentina and China, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which coordinated initial reporting on the documents.  The leak shows that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, singer Shakira and many other familiar faces engaged in, at best, aggressive tax avoidance that was accomplished by hiding assets in extremely complex corporate legal entities. Though in some cases hidden funds seem linked to outright corruption, much of this activity is nominally legal – but the very existence of such structures almost guarantees they’re being used for deeply harmful ends well beyond dodging taxes.  For those in the crypto world, it is tempting to frame these revelations in terms of simple “whataboutism.” And hooboy, what about this: By one estimate, as much as $32 trillion in assets worldwide may be in offshore tax havens. That’s roughly 15 times the total value of all cryptocurrency in existence, and much of it amounts to theft by world leaders from their own citizens. The tax revenues missing thanks to those hidden funds mean immense amounts of missing public infrastructure and services worldwide, at the particular expense of the poorest and most vulnerable people.  Read More: What the ‘Pandora Papers’ Mean for Bitcoin (podcast)  That certainly drives home the absurdity of global regulators’ relentless focus on cryptocurrency systems as vectors for money laundering and tax evasion. Regulators, it seems, find it easier to punch downward at an emerging technology than to challenge the legalized corruption of the legacy banking system, or the hegemony of their bosses.  Focusing on that “what about,” though, is playing the short game. It can be tempting to argue that crypto makes the same tricks available to everyday people, which may be appealing to those of a libertarian bent, but strikes me as nothing but a race to the bottom. More importantly, it’s a false equivalency: What world leaders have accomplished through offshore entities and shady banks simply can’t be replicated by average people using crypto.  On a superficial level, that’s because crypto cannot match the secrecy assured by offshore entities. While much early coverage of bitcoin focused on its “anonymity,” it has become clear that it’s relatively easy to triangulate ownership of bitcoin and many other tokens with a little elbow grease. Even so-called “privacy coins” are imperfect. But if you can afford a private jet to the Caribbean, it appears, you can afford truly anonymous banking.  More importantly, the cross-border asset concealment detailed in the Pandora Papers is part of a much larger and more complex system of shadow influence that relies on institutional political power and generational wealth, not just the ability to hide large amounts of money from monitoring. The same channels used for tax avoidance and personal secrecy are also powerful tools for even more nefarious activities: state-sponsored drug trafficking, murder and anti-democratic violence.  To pick just one well-documented example, consider the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI. Nominally a Pakistani bank, BCCI was revealed in the early 1990s to have been a likely front for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The “bank” was a major funnel for international drug trafficking proceeds, and the CIA allegedly protected those laundering activities from scrutiny by international law enforcement. That protection was extended because the agency allegedly needed a channel to move its own off-book drug-running proceeds to anti-communist South American guerillas. Those guerillas, particularly the Contras in Nicaragua, turned out in substance to be terrorist death squads. The CIA was even alleged, in the pages of the Washington Post, to be running a network of assassins out of BCCI’s headquarters.  Though the scandal triggered some nominal reforms, this kind of international meddling and manipulation would seem to still be quite feasible under the current global financial system. It remains to be seen precisely what sort of activities are revealed in the Pandora Papers: They have been combed by dozens of journalists for more than two years, and reporting on the documents should be trickling out in coming days and weeks. We already know that they further implicate perhaps the most ambitious government kleptocrat and state-backed thug in the world, Vladimir Putin.  Even short of outright criminality, the offshore holdings by world leaders revealed in the Pandora Papers look an awful lot like hedges against the decline of their own countries – and an abdication of responsibility for fighting that decline. The most egregious example of this so far may be from the U.K., where a major supporter of the Conservative Party government in power has apparently been exposed for involvement with a massive $220 million bribe to the leader of Uzbekistan.  This is ironic, of course, because the Tories have been a major force behind Brexit, the U.K.’s separation from the European Union. Among its many impacts, Brexit is threatening the U.K.’s mainstream financial sector by tightening capital controls and strangling trade flows crucial to businesses large and small. Many vocal Brexit supporters had already been discovered to be hiding money offshore via the 2017 Paradise Papers leak. In effect, their attitude seems to have been “Little Britain for thee, but not for me.”  The takeaway is simply this: Global leaders too often consider themselves completely separate from the people they rule. Their aggressive thievery conveys the same attitude towards you or me that alleged sex trafficker and globetrotting heiress Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly had towards her victims: “They’re nothing, these girls. They are trash.” (Maxwell was also closely linked to the CIA through her father, “superspy” Robert Maxwell.)  The global banking system, which grants secrecy to only the wealthiest and most powerful while freely censoring the activities of everyday citizens, can only reinforce that apparent sense of superiority and separation. It’s unclear whether cryptocurrency provides a substantive answer to this rampant elite corruption. But the Pandora Papers at least explain much of the emotional drive behind crypto adoption: the simple desire to quit a system that is rotten to its absolute core.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

42421034,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHcj,1633462081,"Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by US","When the U.S. Treasury Department announced its first-ever sanctioning of a cryptocurrency exchange last month, many industry participants likely scratched their heads when they heard the name. Suex? Who?  But while this Moscow-based outfit, which is more accurately described as an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk than an exchange, is little known in the West, Suex and its founder, Egor Petukhovsky, are prominent in Russian crypto circles.  CoinDesk spoke to seven people in the crypto industry in Russia, including local OTC traders, crypto entrepreneurs and exchange executives, about Suex. Almost none of them would speak on the record, given the sensitivity of the situation. The firm’s alleged financial ties to the defunct crypto exchange BTC-e and its successor, WEX, make Suex a touchy subject because many users of those platforms never got their money back.  Most local market participants interviewed by CoinDesk said Suex has been a reliable OTC broker. Some said they believed Suex didn’t know the money that went through its crypto wallets was tied to crime. Others say that at least in some cases, the firm could have known.  Taken together, their comments paint an inconclusive picture about Suex’s culpability, and underscore the informal nature of crypto business in Russia, where digital coins often trade for bags of cash and formal customer identification is lacking.  On Sept. 21, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) placed Suex and 25 affiliated cryptocurrency addresses on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively blacklisting the exchange from the dollar financial system worldwide. Suex had the dubious distinction of being the first crypto business to receive that scarlet letter.  Officials with the Treasury Department claimed Suex was responsible for processing millions in criminal transactions, including proceeds from ransomware attacks. A blog post by data sleuthing firm Chainalysis found at least $13 million in bitcoin transactions came from ransomware and another $147 million was tied to other forms of illicit activity.  Treasury Department representatives didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions. Suex and Petukhovsky declined to comment for this article, but Petukhovsky declared on his Facebook page last week that he was innocent and is determined to fight for his reputation.  “Neither me, nor a single business affiliated with me has ever engaged in any illegal activity,“ Petukhovsky wrote. “I intend to firmly defend my name in litigation in the United States of America.”  Moscow fixture  Petukhovsky was a regular guest at crypto meetups and conferences in the Russian capital, including at events that Suex co-sponsored. Most people CoinDesk spoke with say Suex was a reliable counterparty to work with. In other words, “you give them a million and they won’t run away with it,” said a founder of a crypto startup who asked not to be named.  Vladimir Smerkis, founder of a crypto firm Tokenbox, said more or less “everyone” dealt with Suex as the firm was well known and “could always provide service for whatever volume [of crypto] was needed, always with a good time frame.”  Clients would come to Suex’s skyscraper office in the prestigious business district known as Moscow Сity to buy or sell crypto for cash. Its website, now offline, advertised Visa and Mastercard payment options.  While Suex tried to keep a low public profile, Petukhovsky was passionate about promoting another business he founded, Chatex, a bot for peer-to-peer crypto trades on the Telegram messaging app.  One of the burning questions circulating in the Russian-speaking crypto community at the moment is the possible link between Suex and Exmo, a London-based crypto exchange with Russian-speaking founders. Exmo founder Ivan Petukhovsky has the same surname as the head of Suex, but the two men are not relatives, Ivan Petukhovsky told CoinDesk in December.  Marina Stankevich, Exmo’s head of business, said that the two Petukhovskys know each other as two of the few early crypto entrepreneurs with Russian roots. “Ivan gave Egor his first bitcoin, $4,000 worth of bitcoin,” Stankevich said.  Ivan Petukhovsky “played a key role in the emergence of Suex, sending $4,000 [worth of] bitcoins to my friend on May 22, 2017,” Egor Petukhovsky wrote in a deleted but archived blog post from 2019.  Stankevich added that Egor Petukhovsky did his first crypto deals on Exmo, but the account, registered under the name Chatex, became inactive in 2017, when Exmo began requiring account verification.  When Suex was hit with sanctions last month, Exmo shut down the account, Stankevich told CoinDesk.  Unlike a typical crypto exchange, Suex didn’t operate its own trading engine that matches bids and offers, according to two blockchain analytics firms that studied the platform. Rather, Suex operated as a “nested exchange,” meaning it used addresses and custody services from larger crypto exchanges.  Binance and Huobi appear to be the main exchanges Suex used, an earlier investigation by CoinDesk found. Binance spokeswoman Jessica Jung said via email that Binance shut down Suex’s account before the sanctions were imposed. Huobi declined to comment on the matter.  TRM Labs, one of the analytics firms, said in a blog post that nested exchanges can take advantage of the liquidity and lower transaction costs of larger exchanges, and mainly provide a front-end interface for users.  Chainalysis, the other analytics firm, noted that some nested services may not have stringent compliance requirements. The company found that around $13 million in bitcoin from ransomware victims flowed through Suex.  Doing business  A Russian startup executive told CoinDesk he was surprised that Suex was sanctioned, because normally, regulators would reach out to a crypto service or exchange to learn about their criminal clients.  “And everybody responds, because everybody understands that otherwise, one day, say, you go for a vacation in Greece – and then the next several years you spend answering the questions in the U.S,” the executive said.  He was alluding to the case of Alexander Vinnik, the Russian national and alleged operator of now-defunct BTC-e exchange. Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 on money laundering charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. This year, he was sentenced to prison in France.  The source, who said he himself had received requests from law enforcement agencies, doubted that Suex could have known where all the alleged ransomware and scam-related money was coming from. “Notable amounts of dirty crypto normally are first laundered on-chain, and only then sent to exchanges and OTCs,” he said.  “With crypto OTC, you inevitably come about some dirty money. But you learn about it when law enforcement knocks on your door at 6 a.m.,” he said, adding that using crypto tracing tools became a must among crypto businesses only in 2020, after the European Union adopted its Fifth Anti-Money-Laundering Directive (5AMLD).  Smerkis similarly said that Suex could have touched criminal crypto somehow, but that he doesn’t think “it was initiated or encouraged by the platform itself.”  However, some of the people who know Suex and its staff say that at least in some cases, Suex must have understood it was laundering criminal money.  Another crypto entrepreneur said Suex helped its clients get money out of Russia to the Western financial markets with crypto.  “That money went through wallets and fiat gateways of crypto exchanges,” he said. Suex’s office in Prague (where the company is officially registered) could also provide a “source of funds” document for its clients, so their fiat currency would be accepted in Swiss banks, this source said. This service, the source said, generated the most profit for Suex.  Another source who works in the OTC market said Suex was far from the only firm that provided this way of transferring money out of Russia, but Suex was a big one. “This is the cheapest way to transfer the money [across the border],” the source said.  Peer pressure  Several crypto businesspeople in Kyiv told CoinDesk that Suex used to be a notable player on the Ukrainian crypto market, too. The firm’s co-founder, Maksim Subbotin, traveled to Kyiv regularly and represented Suex there.  (According to Russian news outlet The Bell, Maksim Kurbangaleev, whom TRM calls a co-founder of Suex, is a founder of a company named Finstor, which the Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank, put on its list of fraudulent financial companies. TRM suggested Kurbangaleev and Subbotin may be the same person, but The Bell stated they were two different people.)  According to one broker, a Ukrainian OTC desk once asked Suex for help when a client didn’t deliver their part of the deal and disappeared, and later started trading with Suex.  Because there was no regulation regarding cryptocurrency deals in Ukraine at that time, that kind of conflict could be reconciled only with a personal agreement, and so the Ukrainian OTC desk asked Suex to encourage the client to come clean, but Suex refused.  As the story spread in the local crypto community, the entire Ukrainian OTC market stopped working with Suex and cut communications with Suex, the source said. Three months later, Suex decided to cooperate, and the Ukrainian OTC desk ended up getting its money back, the source said.  An OTC broker in Moscow, who also asked not to be named, said that sometimes, the crypto a broker processes gets a criminal label after the fact, and there are no common rules for what a know-your-customer (KYC) process should look like.  “In Moscow, there is no regulation at the moment, so everyone decides for themselves what information on their clients they collect,” the source added.

42376039,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE1CB,1633462000,"US Lawmaker Proposes Safe Harbor Bill, Echoing SEC Commissioner Peirce","A top Republican in the House of Representatives is looking to make it easier for crypto startups to raise funds without running afoul of U.S. securities law.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, unveiled a safe harbor bill on Tuesday ahead of a committee hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.  The “Clarity for Digital Tokens Act of 2021″ would effectively codify SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s Token Safe Harbor proposal, a pitch the regulator made in 2020 and 2021 to create a pathway for crypto startups to launch token sales to fund their projects without fear of SEC enforcement.  McHenry has quietly proposed a number of crypto-friendly bills, including calling on federal agencies to create a working group to fully define crypto regulations.  Under the Peirce proposal, these businesses would have three years to either register with the securities regulator or meet a set of requirements to prove themselves fully decentralized.  McHenry’s bill echoes the tenets of Peirce’s proposal, with provisions addressing when startups would have to register or or how they can verify that their projects no longer meet the federal definition of a “security.”  “Unfortunately, our current regulatory framework threatens to push this technology – and the jobs created by this rapidly growing industry – overseas,” McHenry said in a statement. “My bill, which builds on the great work of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, will help provide the necessary legal certainty to digital asset projects when they launch.”  The bill includes a number of provisions around disclosure, including requiring businesses to share information about transactions and the secondary platforms on which their tokens trade.  There is also a provision that would require startups trying to launch via an initial coin offering that they must warn investors “the purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk and the potential loss of money.”  Industry proponents praised the effort in statements on Tuesday. Perianne Boring, the president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said the bill “has the potential” to create a path for startups in the crypto industry.  Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, noted that the bill would modify existing law to “account for the new realities of these technologies.”  Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith added, “This regulatory uncertainty has been stifling innovation for years and thereby resulting in an exodus of innovators from the U.S. to jurisdictions with a clear regulatory framework.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/05/us-lawmaker-proposes-safe-harbor-bill-echoing-sec-commissioner-peirce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd3855a0c8c60827a9a3627743444014985840d9-1999x1499.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376032,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE13N,1633461961,Republican Congressman Demands Clarity From the SEC on Crypto Regulation,"Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, is urging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide clarity and consistency in its plans for crypto regulation.  In a letter to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on Tuesday, McHenry laid out a timeline of Gensler’s public statements on the SEC’s role in the regulation of crypto exchanges and stablecoins, which he describes as “concerning and apparently self-contradicting.”  McHenry’s letter to Gensler comes hours in advance of the committee’s oversight hearing of the SEC, during which several committee members are expected to ask Gensler about crypto regulation.  Crypto has come up in several recent hearings with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, but Tuesday’s hearing is the first chance a committee in Congress has had to question Gensler in weeks. Tuesday’s hearing is also the first oversight hearing focused solely on the SEC. Previous hearings where members of Congress could question Gensler were focused on other topics like the GameStop trading frenzy.  Gensler’s stance on crypto regulation has seemingly intensified since his Senate confirmation to head the SEC in April. In May, Gensler told the members of the House Financial Services Committee that “it’s only Congress that could really address [the regulation of crypto exchanges]” and that there was “no federal authority to actually bring a regime to the crypto exchanges.”  Gensler has indicated in several hearings and interviews that the SEC already has the authority it needs to regulate crypto exchanges and stablecoins. In a September interview with the Washington Post, Gensler said that most cryptocurrencies have the attributes of securities, and he urged crypto exchanges to register with the SEC.  Gensler has also indicated that the SEC has authority over stablecoins. In the Post interview, he said the SEC is working with banking regulators to get expanded authority from Congress to regulate stablecoins.  A presidential advisory group led by the Treasury Department is expected to release its report on stablecoins in late October, which will call on Congress to enact a special purpose bank-like charter for stablecoin issuers.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/05/republican-congressman-demands-clarity-from-the-sec-on-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3432b1da80497fd390d1bdde141241d78f9f33c-4250x2833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421721,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGTV,1633460697,Web 3 Is Where the Young People Are,"Centralization is a single point of failure. That was clearly on display yesterday when Facebook’s entire operation – from its subsidiaries Instagram and Whatsapp to its physical plant – went down for over five hours.  The technical malfunction, stemming from a routing issue in the deep levels of the internet, served as a reminder for how integrated the web has become in “nearly every facet of existence,” New York Times reporter Raymond Zhong wrote. There were disruptions to retailers, newsmakers, medical providers and even religious services the world over.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Crypto influencers took the opportunity to take potshots at the centralized social media juggernaut. The outage certainly strengthens the case for decentralized alternatives, which may offer more resilience or promise the ability for users to own their data and port it to another platform whenever they want.  But there’s another lesson in the meltdown: Facebook is a corporation in decline and so is the entire Web 2 business model. It’s ironic that Big Tech “walled gardens” – Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google – have escaped their bounds to become so integrated into the world but at the same time are mattering less day by day.  This was an argument New York Times columnist Kevin Roose put forward yesterday in the aptly timed article “Facebook Is Weaker Than We Knew,” based on new whistleblower testimony that Facebook knew its harmful effects on users. Putting aside calls to break up Facebook or to regulate its sketchy business practices, the company is struggling to remain relevant.  “Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and its older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about politics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while others are merely making their users angry or self-conscious,” Roose said.  Facebook gained prominence during the early days of Web 2, the sea change to the web that allowed users to not only read content but interact with it. Its namesake platform was once a fun environment in which to spend time. It offered ways for creators to build reputations and businesses and for “the world to connect.”  But as the Wall Street Journal reported in “The Facebook Files,” this era is coming to an end. In one poignant example, Facebook executives reportedly held meetings on how to integrate its platforms into playdates to capture that “valuable but untapped audience” of children.  In a digital context, attention is key. Facebook has long used nefarious practices to keep people logged on, often at the expense of their mental health and sometimes democracy at large. Its algorithms incentivize self-promotion, “hallmonitorization” and fake news. It’s no wonder Facebook is struggling to maintain its market share.  As mind-blowing statistics and valuations show, much attention has been redirected towards the exciting world of crypto. This is especially true for millennials and zoomers, who used their downtime during the coronavirus pandemic to figure out how to yield farm tokens, chat in crypto-specific rooms (on Discord and Telegram) and express themselves with non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Bitcoiner laser eyes and Bored Ape PFPs (profile pictures) are just the beginning. Facebook’s downfall may not translate directly to the success of decentralized alternatives. Distributed platforms like Mastodon and Minds have struggled to attract and retain users, and no one knows what Twitter’s decentralized “Blue Sky” protocol will look like.  But there’s a significant trend happening where users are choosing to decentralize the web on their own. Alternative platforms are growing in popularity, even if they have fewer users in aggregate (Facebook self-reported an average 2.76 billion people used at least one of its products each day this June). Crypto is at the heart of this movement.  Read more: How Do You Know Crypto Is Winning?

Audius’ blockchain-based streaming platform is a serious player in the music industry.  User-owned doesn’t always mean crypto.

42376043,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE1Fx,1633460400,NFT Market Too Frothy? Now You Can Short It,"Decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures is launching NFTures, a product that lets users bet on the future prices of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Targeted toward retail investors, NFTures uses a user interface similar to what’s used by the Tinder dating app to streamline the trading process, while bringing game-like elements and leverage to NFT markets. The decentralized protocol is based on SynFutures’ existing synthetic automatic market maker (sAMM) model to match counterparties.  “Every healthy financial market needs a way for participants to take both sides of the market, and NFTs are no exception,” said Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures. “By providing a way for users to take long or short positions in NFTs, we’re enabling more robust trading strategies that allow users to maximize profit opportunities while hedging risk and exposure.”  NFTs have seen rapid growth in recent months, generating $10.7 billion in trading volume during Q3, an increase of 704% from the previous quarter, according to data from DappRadar.  Projects such as CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club have notched sales in the millions of dollars, with NFTs even drawing in sophisticated investors such as NFT-focused hedge funds.  Prior to NFTures, collectors could only “buy and hold” NFTs in hopes they would increase in value, according to SynFutures.  “Those who wanted to speculate on downward trends had to bet against entire markets, shorting the native tokens of NFT-centric products like Axie Infinity ($AXS) and SupeRare ($RARE),” the company explained in a statement. “With NFTures, SynFutures has created an intuitive platform for traders to long or short specific NFTs at any time and take advantage of better price discovery.”  NFTures bases its contracts on spot price oracles from decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, as well as NFT fractionalization protocols such as Unic.ly and Fractional. Similar to traditional futures markets, the spot and futures prices eventually converge on a set periodic schedule.     However, risks of oracle price manipulation remain as the nascent NFT market grows in size and liquidity.  The project also highlights the current renaissance in NFT-related decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, including NFT-backed collateralized lending or the tokenization of physical assets.  “NFT-specific derivatives products will add more depth to the nascent NFT market, just as options and futures contracts play an important role in established financial markets,” said Lauren Stephanian of Pantera Capital, an investor in SynFutures.  “It’s still early, so we want to help create the financial framework for what will inevitably become a major asset class at the intersection of crypto and art,” added SynFutures’ Lin.  In June, SynFutures raised a $14 million Series A round led by venture capital firm Polychain Capital.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/nft-market-too-frothy-now-you-can-short-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeaff729c4e491eae6c7428b364ec37bd0dcd55a-1252x1248.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stocks, which often move in tandem with the largest cryptocurrency’s price, have steadily advanced since hitting lows in September, when prices for bitcoin slumped to near $40,000.  Marathon Digital rose 6.2% and Hut 8 Mining advanced 4.5%, leading gains in the sector. Bitfarms Ltd. climbed 4.2%, Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. was up 2.5% and Riot Blockchain, Inc. increased 2% in U.S. trading. The Canadian-listed miner Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. gained 2.3%.  A key gauge of bitcoin mining activity, the hashrate, has recovered from a steep plunge in early July, when China began a sweeping crackdown on the crypto industry. The hashrate measures the total computational power being applied on the Bitcoin blockchain to secure new data blocks on the distributed ledger.  The hashrate recovery has added to the positive investor sentiment for the miners.  “The bitcoin mining industry experienced the most dramatic short-term disruption in all history, with over 50% of the network hash power coming offline throughout May,” according to an Oct. 4 report by analytics firm Glassnode. The report added that the Bitcoin hashrate has been on a “consistent path to recovery” since.  Meanwhile, the mining difficulty, a variable gauge that automatically adjusts under the Bitcoin blockchain’s code to keep the network running smoothly, has also been ramping up since the July slump.  “After bottoming out in late July, protocol mining difficulty has risen by 39%, with a further additional upwards adjustment of around 3.9% expected this week,” the Glassnode report said. Generally speaking, a higher mining difficulty tends to tamp down profits in the sector because new bitcoins become harder to find for the mining computers known as “rigs.”  Future profitability  MicroStrategy Inc., often seen as a proxy for bitcoin, climbed 4.3%, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global, Inc. gained 3% and Robinhood Markets, Inc., where many users trade crypto, rose 2.8%. The wider S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite were also in the green on Tuesday.  The gradual recovery in cryptocurrency prices over the past few months, combined with rising hashrate and network activity, suggests that mining firms could stay profitable even as the market remains volatile.  “Despite dramatic shifts in the mining market, multiple deep price corrections and a halving event in May 2020, the Bitcoin block reward value continues to rise, creating incentives for the market to adapt, innovate and recover,” Glassnode report said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/crypto-miners-marathon-digital-hut-8-rally-as-bitcoin-tops-50000,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79eff14bcf4c9941df510c167521b592018e87d9-3330x2223.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Among them are FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, Coinbase’s Fred Ehrsam and Brian Armstrong, Gemini’s Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Ripple and Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb. Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, has once again made the list after more than doubling his 2020 net worth from $2.7 billion to $6 billion in 2021.  The group of crypto billionaires on this year’s list is worth a combined $55 billion, and features three of its youngest members. The 29-year-old Bankman-Fried, worth an estimated $22.5 billion, is the richest billionaire under 30 since Mark Zuckerberg, according to Forbes, while Coinbase co-founders Brian Armstrong (38) and Fred Ehrsam (33) are also part of the group of 15 members under 40 to make the list.  The presence of these seven entrepreneurs on Forbes’ list reflects the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in mainstream culture, and how much capital institutional investors have put into the future of the industry.  Here are the crypto billionaires who qualified for the list, in descending order of wealth:  1. Sam Bankman-Fried  Bankman-Fried’s net worth more than doubled to $22.5 billion thanks to a recent $900 million funding round for his crypto exchange FTX, which valued the company at $18 billion.  2.

Minnesota-based U.S. bank agreed to serve as administrator for NYDIG’s planned bitcoin exchange-traded fund in April, as CoinDesk previously reported.  “Our fund and institutional custody clients have accelerated their plans to offer cryptocurrency and, in response, we made it a priority to accelerate our ability to offer custody services,” Gunjan Kedia, vice chair of U.S. Bank Wealth Management and Investment Services, said in a press release.

According to the Ethereum blog, the upgrade represents a “low stakes warm-up” to prepare Beacon Chain developers and client teams for the coming Merge, when Ethereum will transition from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  It will provide the Beacon Chain with “light client support, minor patches to incentives, per-validator inactivity leak accounting, an increase in slashing severity, and cleanups to validator rewards accounting for simplified state management.”  Anyone operating a Beacon node or validator is required to update the client version to the new standard or risk being stuck on an incompatible chain.  Validators who do not update won’t be able to participate in the new consensus mechanism and will also face the risk of being slashed and paying penalties.  Because the upgrade only affects the consensus mechanism on the Beacon Chain, it will not affect end users of the current Ethereum proof-of-work blockchain.  In order to encourage robust code review of the Altair upgrade, the bug bounty bonus has been doubled until Nov. 27.  More information on how to update nodes and validators is available here.

Since the game was launched in March 2018, total sales volume is close to $2.3 billion, according to CryptoSlamhttps://cryptoslam.io/axie-infinity/sales/summary.  On Tuesday, Axie’s creator, Vietnam-based Sky Mavis, announced it had raised a $152 million Series B round at a $3 billion valuation, led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The news was first reported by The Information.  The company said it plans to use the funds to build out its own distribution platform to support outside developers in creating blockchain-enabled games, as well as expand its team and scaling infrastructure.  Founded in 2018, Axie Infinity is a non-fungible token (NFT) game where players battle, collect and trade digital pets called “Axies,” earning rewards in $AXS and $SLP tokens that can be redeemed for real-world money.  Axie Infinity’s AXS token hit a record high on Monday after Axie announced last week it would distribute over $60 million worth of tokens to its early adopters, and also launch staking capabilities.  The latest fundraising news comes as “play-to-earn” crypto projects like Axie are getting attention from gaming enthusiasts and venture capitalists alike.  “Axie Infinity is a category-defining game that is changing history by creating an entirely new digital economy,” said Sky Mavis CEO Trung Nguyen in a statement.  “We are on a mission to create economic freedom for gamers and are making this happen by turning players into owners of in-game assets unlike the traditional model where publishers, distribution platforms and game developers retain control and benefit the most,” Nguyen added.  The company says the game has brought economic freedom to developing nations hard-hit by COVID-19 related unemployment. Over 25% of players are unbanked, and 50% have not previously used cryptocurrencies, according to Sky Mavis.  “Sky Mavis’ marquee game, Axie Infinity, has introduced a new way for anyone to turn their time into money through Play-to-Earn, a new mechanic that allows gamers to transform their skills and time into earnings and distribution rights for tokenized in-game items,” said Arianna Simpson, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  “The Axie team has unlocked a new way to build and play games that is already completely redefining this category. The game’s growth is a phenomenal testament to how deeply this model is resonating with people around the world,” Simpson added.

42376296,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4WN,1633445833,Higher Education Needs a Michael Saylor,"In 2018, a Harvard expert named Clayton Christensen predicted that 50% of the 4,000 colleges in the U.S. will be bankrupt in the next 10 to 15 years. The cause will be that online education will disrupt traditional face-to-face institutions, coupled with a decline in the number of college-aged students. There is just too much supply and not enough demand, and online education just exacerbates that imbalance.  My guess is that some of these colleges, their faculty, staff, students and communities would love to keep their doors open. Having worked in higher education for 20 years and experienced the cycles of enrollment, the playbook for survival is to add and/or subtract new academic programs or sports, shrink the number of faculty and staff, divest unnecessary physical space and find new sources of revenue. That last one right there is the Holy Grail that we have been dreaming about for decades.  Craig Ross is the Cross Divisional Budget and Facilities Officer and teaches the Finance of Higher Education Master’s course at State University of New York (SUNY) at Brockport. This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2021 universities package.  The problem with this strategy is the approximately 4,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. are fighting for the same pool of students, projected to decline an additional 11 to 15% by 2025. As a result, the colleges and universities that survive will not do so based on new academic programs or sports, but the ones that right-size and have the greatest reserves to weather the storm.  I have been at the table for these conversations or in the room at budget town hall or committee meetings, and in my head I have been screaming, just buy bitcoin!!! The harsh reality is that it is probably better for me to just keep that locked up right there in my head. If not, the silence in the room would be deafening unless there was laughter, which is nearly as plausible depending on the audience. If I suggested just buy bitcoin, it’s possible my office might be located in the basement before I knew it. I hope that I have a stapler, at least.  Eventually, I would have been proven right, as we know anyone who has held bitcoin longer than four years has never lost. Higher education is notoriously slow to adopt new technology or change, widely described as glacial. I’m not suggesting that higher education alter its entire business processes around cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, but in Michael Saylor-like fashion hold all of their cash reserves and endowment funds in bitcoin. As bitcoiners know, adoption is inevitable; by the time higher education catches on, the opportunity for large bankruptcy avoiding gains will be gone.  Read More: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  Other than higher education’s inability to enact change quickly, there are environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that will make most colleges in higher education the last to act. Nearly every college in the United States incorporates environmental sustainability into their strategic plans, or have committees charged with doing so. This is a noble endeavor, but bitcoin and the FUD around mining is intractable and in direct conflict with the institution’s sustainability goals. Furthermore, approximately 1,000 higher education institutions happily subject themselves to the organization named the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) and their Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS). They proudly advertise on their websites a rating of bronze, silver, gold or platinum.  One of the criteria for how well an institution scores is based on how much of the endowment is invested in fossil fuels. In September, Harvard dropped all investments in its endowment related to oil and gas. Can you imagine the criticisms if they confirm that they have already bought bitcoin! Institutions that disinvest from fossil fuels in the name of environmental sustainability are making a monumental strategic error that will be hard pressed to unwind, thus delaying their entry into bitcoin. (To be clear, I’m not talking about the small investments schools have already made in bitcoin; I mean Michael Saylor-sized outlays.)  My favorite quote from MicroStrategy CEO and bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor is “you don’t have to invest all of your money in bitcoin, just the money you don’t want to lose.” If higher education institutions don’t invest in a Saylor-like fashion, Christensen will be right. In August of 2020, Wells College, located in upstate New York, and 200 other small, private colleges were in danger of closing due to the pandemic. At the end of 2019, Wells College endowment was valued at $27 million if its president had invested it all in bitcoin on Jan. 1, 2020, the endowment would be valued at $180 million today, give or take a few million. Anyone can be a Monday morning quarterback, and yes Bitcoin is volatile, but over time it is only volatile in one direction. Just buy bitcoin!  Another challenge in delaying bitcoin purchases is the endowment fund managers’ overall lack of understanding of bitcoin and self preservation. I say self-preservation because every fund manager thinks they can outperform the market, if not then why would we need them? If you were paying attention, bitcoin was the best-performing asset from 2010-2020 and is likely to be the best performing asset for the next decade. It’s going to be tough to beat.  Read More: Do You Need to Go to College to Work in Crypto? | David Z. Morris  In addition, there’s evidence colleges don’t understand the opportunity. For example, a recent article in Inside Higher Education reported that colleges are “lining up” to accept bitcoin, but one college is quoted as saying it “immediately liquidate the cryptocurrency gift, which mitigates any risk involved with this type of donation.”  I wonder if they have seen this website, which compares stupid stuff you bought at a date in the past and what it would be worth in bitcoin today. For example, if you bought bitcoin in 2011 instead of a $249 Nintendo 3DS, your bitcoin would be worth $13,458,000 today. I had that moment in 2017 when I offered to donate $500 in bitcoin to a college (which will go unnamed). The only stipulation was for them to HODL, to avoid their stupid moment. Well, thankfully, they didn’t take me up on the offer, and it’s worth about $4,000 today.  So, where is the Michael Saylor of higher education? Personally, I am hoping he or she is at a small, private college in a community somewhere in the Rust Belt or Appalachia, the underdog, like most early bitcoiners. It would be me – but I’m tied up at the moment moving my office to the basement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT,Craig Ross,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/05/higher-education-needs-a-michael-saylor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16be9b8fe534bd3e5d2691e582d3619e4734e575-5472x3080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421728,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGaj,1633444623,Want Cleaner Bitcoin Mining? Subsidize It,"In philosophy, some of the best results come when intuitions clash with logical chains of reasoning. You might call those counterintuitive. The result we discuss today certainly fits the bill. Put simply, there’s a compelling case to be made that policymakers looking to ameliorate the emissions associated with bitcoin should subsidize, rather than ban, the act of mining bitcoin. How is this possible?  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  Well, a new paper from philosophers Andrew Bailey and Troy Cross lays out this argument. In steps:  Bitcoin mining is a single global market; that is, miners compete with every other miner. One miner gaining market share means another is losing share.  It follows that a new unit of hashrate (computing power) economically disadvantages every existing unit of hashrate.  Individuals who want to reduce the carbon intensity of bitcoin mining ought therefore to simply mine bitcoin sustainably, at a loss if necessary.  If you assume miners are economically rational and some miners are unsustainable, a new unit of sustainable or “green” hashrate definitionally reduces the carbon intensity of the Bitcoin network.  In lieu of directly mining, interested bitcoin holders looking to offset their emissions could simply invest in a renewables-only, publicly traded miner, like Iris Energyhttps://irisenergy.co/news/.  By lowering the cost of capital for a sustainable public miner, holders advantage green-powered mining at the expense of default mining, offsetting the emissions associated with their bitcoin held.  A Pigovian tax discourages transactions that create negative emissions. A tax on sugar (obesity-related illnesses consume finite health-care resources), tobacco (causing negative primary health outcomes plus risks from second hand smoke) or carbon dioxide (climate change) would be examples. In this instance, mining sustainably is a de facto Pigovian tax because it disadvantages all other miners, who presumably mine with nonzero emissions.  This is an incredible feature of Bitcoin, which exists only because it is a single market, in which every miner competes for the same exact finite resource (new units of bitcoin). Thus, a new unit of hashrate no longer empowers existing miners, economically, speaking. If enough sustainable units come online, especially if they are subsidized (and so the equilibrium for hashrate is higher than it otherwise would be, at normal breakevens), some regular miners with a generic energy mix will no longer be profitable and will shutter their operations. Few other industries are this directly open and competitive.  Thus, you can imagine financial products for those concerned about their bitcoin-related emissions that bundle a unit of bitcoin and a proportional share of a sustainable miner. These are far superior to bundled bitcoin plus offset products, because offsets are non-standardized and their effect is generally unclear and in fact quite controversial. In the case of an investment in a public miner that is provably sustainable, your investment lowers the cost of capital (some of these mining firms actually fund their operations entirely by issuing new stock), directly advantaging the miner relative to its dirtier competitors. The second-order effect of this market emerging is that certain miners will orient their operations towards full sustainability to cater to this new demographic of motivated buyers.  Read More: Ethereum’s Design Choices Are Inherently Political | Nic Carter  This logic applies at the policy level, too. The state of New York has recently considered banning bitcoin mining, but they state should be considering the precise opposite if it cares about bitcoin’s emissions. Upstate New York offers abundant hydro resources. I’ve personally visited the Coinmint mining operation in Massena, N.Y., which is an old hydro-powered Alcoa aluminum smelting facility perched on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. It would take some work to fully determine this, but I believe that bitcoin mining operations in New York are more sustainable than the generic energy mix of the rest of the Bitcoin network. Thus, banning mining there would actually drive up Bitcoin’s emissions footprint. Instead, the state should consider subsidizing its largely clean local bitcoin mining operations.  A few forward-looking policymakers have already begun to act according to this logic. Just recently, the state of Wyoming created a tax incentive supporting mining with otherwise-flared natural gas. Since methane associated with oil well operations is flared anyway (it’s often uneconomical to capture or store), putting it into a generator and powering a bitcoin operation is at worst net neutral from a greenhouse gas perspective. (In practice, it’s generally favorable because a controlled burn in a generator is cleaner than a simple flare.) If miners take Wyoming up on its offer, a new portion of hashrate will emerge that is fully carbon neutral, displacing dirtier energy. The converse is also true.  And this idea has already been implemented at the national level, by none other than El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. In response to a question by human rights activist Alex Gladstein in a historic Twitter Spaces chat, President Bukele mused about mining bitcoin with otherwise-untapped – and carbon-neutral – geothermal energy. The president kept his promise and, as of this week, mining operations have begun. By subsidizing mining with fully sustainable geothermal energy, El Salvador is disempowering every other non-sustainable miner out there. So El Salvador can claim two firsts: the first nation to ratify bitcoin as legal tender, and the first nation to impose a market-based Pigovian tax on dirty bitcoin miners.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/05/want-cleaner-bitcoin-mining-subsidize-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e01d273643a5581522343e38defe9a4e97dc6263-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE3Mn,1633444342,"Bitpanda to Offer Its Digital Asset Investing Product to Italian Banks, Fintechs","European cryptocurrency exchange Bitpanda is collaborating with Italian open finance provider Fabrick to offer digital asset trading services to Italian banks and fintechs.  The firms announced the agreement on Tuesday at the Milan Fintech Summit 2021. According to a press statement obtained by CoinDesk, the partnership will give local customers of traditional Italian banks as well as fintechs access to more than 170 digital assets through Bitpanda’s White Label product.  Founded in Austria in 2014, Bitpanda claims to be one of the fastest growing fintechs in Europe. In March, it became Austria’s first unicorn startup after closing a series B funding round at $170 million. In August, it raised another $263 million, bringing the company’s valuation up to $4.1 billion with over 3 million users outside the U.S. Bitpanda moved into Italy less than six months ago, and has an office set up in Milan.  Fabrick is a part of Sella, Italy’s largest group of banks, and has 510 application programming interfaces (API) available on its platform that allow banking applications to communicate with each other. The APIs connect over 500 Italian banks.  Fabrick will connect its services to Bitpanda’s backend through a set of APIs, according to the statement.  “All of Bitpanda’s White Label partners, including customers of Fabrick users, can still interact with the front end that they are familiar with, this encompasses the entire user experience, from researching an asset via Bitpanda’s tools, to investing in it, as well as portfolio monitoring and future asset trading,” the statement said.  This isn’t the first crypto integration that Fabrick has enabled.  Fabrick currently has a 50% controlling stake in HYPE, a Sella project that enabled about 1.2 million Italian customers to buy, sell and store bitcoin through its app last year through the tech provided by the U.S.-based crypto custody platform Conio.  “The goal is to simplify and accelerate innovation in that space,” said Paolo Zaccardi, CEO of Fabrick. “The interesting part of the platform model is that when we will have a digital euro, we will add similar APIs to manage it. That’s a way to accelerate the adoption of digital assets, and we are seeing very terrific demand for customers, particularly from the young generation in this space.”  The European Central Bank is currently conducting a two-year experiment into a digital euro.  Bitpanda co-founder and CEO Eric Demuth told CoinDesk that the partnership with Fabrick will enable Italian banks and fintechs to incorporate all of Bitpanda’s solutions to their platforms, including digital asset custody and fractional trading.  Bitpanda currently lets people invest in cryptocurrencies, commission-free fractional stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETF), and precious metals through its platform, according to Orlando Merone, country manager for Bitpanda Italy.

In addition to the gamut of anti-money laundering (AML) checks, the FCA grilled Trustology about the custody firm’s speciality in decentralized finance (DeFi), said CEO Alex Batlin.  “The engagement was really good when we started talking about what we do for DeFi,” said Batlin. “They were very open, listened a lot and asked questions in order to understand how we do AML checks around DeFi.”  Getting DeFi institution-ready with added AML and know-your-customer (KYC) checks is now the focus of a number of firms, with solutions ranging from Aave whitelists to decentralized identity plays and even hardware security modules.

Trustology is adding more features for 2022, such as a transaction decoder, said Batlin.  “If someone has compromised a website where you use a dapp, if it’s been hacked, instead of sending something to Uniswap you could just be forwarding funds to a thief,” he said, adding:  “So we decode the transaction you are about to sign, and then we look it up in our registry, and instead of a load of binary, we give you a text saying, ‘You are about to do a swap of ETH for DAI on Uniswap,’ for example.”",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | UNI | DAI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/defi-custodian-trustology-gets-green-light-from-uks-fca,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11462d8971dfb55d43514cda1ad33f4021854f51-1500x1046.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

THORSwap currently only offers coins that are supported by THORChain, including BTC, LTC, ETH (and ERC-20 tokens) and BNB, but it is looking to integrate more coins outside of THORChain’s liquidity.

42421028,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHVV,1633442146,The Educator-Entrepreneurs of Crypto,"Why is it that professors interested in cryptocurrencies so often build their own blockchains? This isn’t a setup for a joke. In the crypto milieu, there’s a particular type of public figure who is often known as much for his or her academic accomplishments as for being a supreme coder.  Take Cornell University’s Emin Gün Sirer , one of the founders of Avalanche, a layer one, or base, blockchain looking to complement and compete with Ethereum. There’s Dawn Song of the University of California, Berkeley, and the privacy-focused chain Oasis. David Mazieres, a tenured professor at Stanford University, helped build both Ripple and Stellar.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s Best Universities for Blockchain package. See our ranking of 230 schools here.  “If you want to develop new capabilities, then either you have to work within those constraints,” like the scalability or cultural issues of existing blockchains or start from a “clean slate,” Song said in a phone call. It’s less a matter of ego, than expertise.  The reason the earlier question sounds like it might have a punchline is because of the notorious anti-establishment mentality in crypto. People who build (mostly) open-source protocols and tools might just be hardwired to be skeptical of centralized institutions – including banks, governments and the media.  Said another way, if “a wallet is your resume” then credentials matter less. Whether you’re an Ivy League dropout, a former Goldman Sachs exec or an unemployable stoner, you can make it in crypto so long as you bring something to the table.  Song, 46, a former MacArthur Foundation fellow, is the type who heard, “Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach,” and decided to do both. After taking some time off to focus on Oasis, she’s now back full-time at Berkeley, teaching a massive open online course ( MOOC) on blockchains and privacy tech.  “I spend my time doing research, writing papers, brushing up on privacy and also teaching in the space,” she said. It’s hard to see where she and the other crypto “educator-entrepreneurs” find the time. Or the will.  The university, in particular in crypto, is often derided as an out-of-touch institution. Although academics, funded by government defense spending, were essential to building the cryptographic primitives on which the current web stands, crypto is showing how the next generation of the web often occurs outside the ivory gates.  That was one of the central issues CoinDesk wrestled with when producing this year’s Top Universities for Blockchain ranking. What’s the use of a computer science degree when you can learn Solidity on your own? But that’s only one way to look at it.  “I mean, I think the academy is anti-establishment,” Stellar’s Mazieres said over Zoom. Today, big tech companies Apple, Google and Facebook represent the “walled gardens” of computing. “If you want to do something that these companies aren’t, or that isn’t good for their bottom line, then you pretty much have to do it in academia,” he said.  It’s the university system or a startup, he added, “but [universities] don’t have the same sort of like profit constraints.”  Read more: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  Of course, crypto has its own economic foundations that encourage research and development. Launching a “commodity money” – like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH), used to secure and pay for the underlying blockchain computation – is like issuing your own grant. Crypto protocols like Zcash have found ways to deploy and integrate cryptographic techniques like zk-snarks that were once only theorized, and have the money to advance that research. Likewise, a host of wallet companies have made commercial use of similarly-experimental multi-party computation (MPC).  For Mazieres, academia represents another path for builders looking to reinvent the world through cryptocurrencies. The peer-review process may be slow, but a professorship provides insulation from market volatility, a modicum of job security and the benefit of being surrounded by some of the smartest people on the planet.  “It’s very hard for me to imagine leaving Stanford before I retire,” he said. In fact, it’s the same interest in “egalitarian” technologies that keeps his feet in the private world of cryptocurrencies and the somewhat-democratic university system. “Certainly one of the draws is the fact that I can do everything open source and publish everything,” he said.  But the profit motive is strong.  Avalanche, the smart contract blockchain, is an almost $50 billion enterprise. Noted venture firms Three Arrows Capital and Polychain Capital recently led a $230 million funding round into Avalanche Foundation, a major organization that builds and maintains the blockchain.  In a conversation last month, Ava Labs founder Gun Sirer revealed he’s stepping away from Cornell, where he’s taught for the past two decades. It’s there where he conducted his first investigations into the blockchain economy – unearthing the “the selfish mining attack” on Bitcoin and other bugs in Ethereum.  In addition to the less-than-ideal situation of teaching during an ongoing pandemic, Gun Sirer noted the value proposition of spending his entire day coding and building Avalanche. “I’m stepping down to step up,” he said.  “I have skin in the game and decided: Hey, if somebody is going to take our ideas and commercialize them, then it should be me,” he said.  He’s not alone in taking a sabbatical to work full-time in crypto. OpenLaw’s founder Aaron Wright is also leaving his teaching perch at Cardozo School of Law to focus on his decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) incubator.  Wright said one of the reasons he’s stepping back is because he thinks it might be time to monetize The LAO, which was “really in core research and development” this past year. Although there are clear rules that seek to prevent conflicts of interest between professors and their businesses while teaching, sometimes the best move is to step back.  Read more: Do You Need to Go to College to Work in Crypto?  Although these rules vary from institution to institution, conflict of interest (COI) rules generally try to prevent professors from exploiting the work of their student or favoritism. Gun Sirer, willing to speak off the cuff, said he thinks “COI” rules have gone too far and often prevent two like minded individuals that want to work together from doing so.  “There is an inherent conflict whenever you’re commercializing things, it’s there, that that conflict is going to be there,” he said. And room for abuse. But providing an opportunity for students to work on a live project, build a portfolio and publish their research in an open-source environment is a net benefit, he said.  Oasis’ Song noted this “hands-on experience” is a bit like an internship under ideal scenarios.  “That’s what makes universities special,” Wright said. “They’re not wedded to particular companies and they’re not protecting the public if it was like a government.  “There’s just a lot of latitude to explore and try to come up with the right answer.” Including building new blockchains.",NEUTRAL,BTC,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/the-educator-entrepreneurs-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75d2c8380719872619a92702e672732ba121bbc1-2400x1606.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421733,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGdp,1633440600,The US Inches Closer to Stablecoin Rules,"We’re starting to get a sense of how the Biden administration will try to regulate stablecoins. The short version seems to be: A regulatory framework that would mandate more transparency and oversight from issuers (versus one focused on the stablecoins themselves).  Side note: I’m at The Trading Show Chicago today and tomorrow. If you’re also here, let’s say hi.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Stablecoins as not-securities  The narrative  The Biden administration is moving beyond vague hints on how it will regulate stablecoins to more concrete descriptions. There’s still a lot we don’t know yet.  Why it matters  Stablecoins have exploded in popularity over the past year or two, with some $130 billion worth of these fiat-pegged tokens in circulation as of Sunday night, according to CoinGecko. Regulators have been eyeballing this specific sector of the broader crypto industry for nearly a year, and we’re finally seeing their response. The final regulations will determine whether some issuers have to shut down or block U.S. users, as well as what sort of transparency we can expect to see from these issuers.  Breaking it down  Stablecoins! Yes we’re still talking about this. The Biden administration has gotten very busy around cryptocurrencies in general. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will start approving or rejecting bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the next few weeks, the Office of Foreign Assets Control just sanctioned a crypto trading firm for the first time and regulators have been talking a lot about regulating the market.  Stablecoins have taken on a particular importance. The Trump administration even convened a President’s Working Group for Financial Markets meeting to discuss the issue, so it’s no surprise the current administration has been looking to enact regulations.  “What isn’t clear is what sort of regulatory framework would make the most sense for stablecoins,” I wrote in July.  We now have the first glimmer of how the Biden administration plans to answer this question: Treating stablecoin issuers in a similar way to banks.  The administration has a two-track plan here and the first depends on Congress. Should that not work out for whatever reason, officials will look to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an interagency body established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to monitor risks to the system.  The congressional path seems fairly straightforward at first blush. Team Biden intends to ask Congress to draft a law that would authorize a special-purpose, bank-like charter for stablecoin issuers. This would create a federal framework for stablecoin issuance while assigning a regulator oversight authority over these businesses.  This would also impose bank regulations and supervisory requirements on stablecoin issuers, which I’m guessing would include some specific reporting or backing requirements.  Regulators have espoused the need (in their view) for any sort of regulatory oversight over stablecoins at the federal level. While some U.S.-based stablecoin issuers are regulated by state financial regulators (cough, NYDFS) there’s no one agency formally assigned at the federal level.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this view in a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee hearing last week.  “Stablecoins are like money market funds, they’re like bank deposits but they’re to some extent outside the regulatory perimeter and it’s appropriate that they be regulated – same activity, same regulation,” he said.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has likewise compared stablecoins to money market funds, as have lawmakers in the House of Representatives and Senate.  Bank regulations are something else.  We don’t yet know the specifics of this special-purpose charter the Treasury Department is pitching. Matthew Homer, executive in residence at VC firm Nyca Partners and formerly the fintech lead at the New York Department of Financial Services, said one of the major questions is why the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) current trust bank or full bank charter framework would not suffice.  Another question is whether the OCC, a federal bank regulator, would indeed be the chartering entity here, or if a different federal agency would be given oversight of stablecoin issuers.  “Would banks with normal bank charters be able to issue stablecoins? Will this have implications for other areas like the issuers of prepaid cards?” Homer asked. “In some ways a stablecoin is no different from a stored-value product like a prepaid card where you have a third-party program manager with a bank holding the deposits.”  It’s also unclear to me how stablecoins tied to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects might fall into this new framework.  Given the attention on DeFi though, I’m sure this is an area we will see addressed.  Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of policy at Circle, which manages the USDC stablecoin, said in a statement that the rumored framework “is encouraging.”  “The time has come to address the risks and seize the significant opportunities of dollar digital currencies like USD coin (USDC),” he said. “Circle has already been working toward becoming a full-reserve national commercial bank, and we strongly believe that a full-reserve banking model built on digital currency technology can lead to a more efficient, fair, inclusive and resilient financial system.”  Tether’s trillion-dollar lawsuit  Last week, stablecoin issuer Tether announced it won a partial dismissal of a lawsuit it is fighting.  The case has its origins almost two years ago to the day, when a handful of crypto investors sued Tether, Bitfinex and DigFinex, as well as various current and former executives (and later adding Bittrex and Poloniex) on allegations the businesses manipulated bitcoin’s price; the investors claimed damages upwards of $1.4 trillion.  The amended complaint, filed in June 2020, filed causes of action alleging monopolization (count one); attempted monopolization (count two); conspiracy to monopolize (count three); agreement in restraint of trade; another antitrust allegation (count four); market manipulation (count five); agent liability (count six); aiding and abetting legal violations (count seven); racketeering (RICO) i.e., wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, etc. (count eight); two more RICO counts (counts nine and 10); fraud (count 11); and deceptive actions (count 12).  Tether and the other defendants filed to dismiss the case in September of last year.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla, of the Southern District of New York, dismissed the third, eighth, ninth, tenth and twelfth counts and dismissed the sixth count for Bitfinex, Tether, DigFinex, Bittrex and Poloniex. The defendants now have until Oct. 28 to respond to the rest of the amended complaint (i.e., counts one, two, four, five, seven and 11).  In other words, Tether et al. will have to respond to the allegations of monopolization, market manipulation and fraud by the end of the month.  For its part, Tether seems pretty pleased with the current state of affairs.  “Even for the remaining claims, the Court’s order raises substantial issues that will ultimately be fatal to the plaintiffs’ case. With half their case now dismissed, their primary expert debunked, and their lead law firm embroiled in its own internecine war – with its partners and former partners trading allegations of fraud and ethics violations – this case is doomed,” Tether said in a statement posted to its website.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Rohit Chopra, Biden’s nominee to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, officially took office after the full Senate confirmed his appointment last week. It will be interesting to see if and how the CFPB takes on crypto businesses under Chopra’s direction. A quick glance at the CFPB’s consumer database shows that crypto exchange customers are filing complaints, though the numbers are small when compared to major banks like Wells Fargo. It’s also worth noting that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) praised Chopra’s nomination back when Biden announced it in January.  Elsewhere:  Coincidence or Insider Trading?

42410975,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttnp,1633439074,"Markets Shine, Scaling Projects Thrive, Regulators Flex: CoinDesk’s Q3 Review","The “Q3 2021 Quarterly Review” by CoinDesk Research looks at driving trends in digital asset markets, focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi and more.  Click to download the report here.  Q3 was characterized by conversations around scalability and broader adoption. With bitcoin officially becoming legal tender in El Salvador, the Lightning Network found its way into headlines as the Bitcoin network sought to transact value cheaply without needing to wait hours to confirm a transaction.  The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caused transaction fees on Ethereum to rise so much that new blockchains were able to scoop up some of its market demand. That said, Ethereum still performed well in spite of potential substitutes, given how intimately tied it is to DeFi and NFTs more broadly.  Bitcoin trends  Bitcoin returned to price gains in Q3 on the back of relatively muted volatility. Bitcoin also broke its correlation to the main macroeconomic assets, such as stocks, in Q3, allowing it to reclaim its title as a macro asset unlike any other.  Bitcoin’s positive price trend can be at least partially attributed to two key factors: recovering the hashrate (computing power) that went offline following China’s crackdown on miners in Q2; and the explosive growth of the Lightning Network, a popular Bitcoin overlay network that enables cheap and instantaneous bitcoin payments.  That said, Bitcoin transaction fees in Q3 were the lowest we have seen in some time, which could be cause for concern if the lack of transaction fees can be tied to lack of demand on the blockchain.  More broadly, bitcoin left exchanges in droves in Q3 and on-chain liquidity continued its downward march as investors continue to “HODL” their coins.  Ethereum trends  Meanwhile, Ethereum can credit its Q3 performance to the EIP 1559 upgrade and the immense growth of DeFi and NFTs.  EIP 1559 introduced a fee burn mechanism that resulted in slashing the yearly inflation rate by 75.5%, which the market viewed favorably.  “DeFi summer” trudged on as total value locked in the ecosystem grew, but NFTs did their best to steal the show. The huge demand for NFTs led to huge spikes in gas fees. The spikes gave fuel to the “alternative layer 1″ narrative, which led to impressive asset price appreciation of potential substitutes, such as Solana, as users looked for cheaper smart contract blockchains on which to experiment and build.  Regulation  Lastly, Q3 was characterized by a reintroduction of regulators and institutions to the digital asset space. China doubled down on previous bans; Binance navigated regulations; and the U.S. proposed new crypto tax rules, which were met with heavy criticism from crypto supporters.  On top of that, stablecoin issuer Circle announced plans to go public and in doing so sparked conversations about transparency, which led to stablecoin issuers disclosing what exactly was backing their pegged coins. Those disclosures left some skeptics and investors unsatisfied.  This and much more in CoinDesk Research’s Q3 2021 Quarterly Report.

42376048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE3FF,1633438816,VC Fund NFX to Go Deeper Into Crypto With $450M Seed Fund,"Venture Capital firm NFX has lined up $450 million to invest in seed-stage companies of all stripes, including crypto.  The fund, perhaps best known in crypto as Libra co-creator Morgan Beller’s post-Facebook landing spot, is double the size of the San Francisco-based VC’s previous early-stage war chest from 2019. It’s also the first fund NFX has organized since Beller became a general partner (GP) in September 2020.  NFX was already “all in” on crypto when Beller joined, Pete Flint, another GP, said in an interview with CoinDesk. But her “unique network expertise” from the Libra project (now Diem) could help her master the VC’s crypto fluency.  That fluency has translated into a bigger allocation for crypto startups. NFX is “increasing investment” in crypto as well as biotech, a press release said. It also invests in gaming, fintech, marketplaces and tools supporting the real estate sector.  The $450 million pie will be split across some 70 early-stage companies from those sectors. A common theme is their potential for “network effects”: to exponentially increase in value as their user base grows.  For Beller, it means searching out crypto companies that can convince “the muggles” (or those unfamiliar with crypto) that using their internet money to participate is worth a shot. And not just some of the newcomers; she wants the lot.  “We are broadly looking for companies, products, platforms that are going to onboard the next billion users into crypto,” Beller said, massaging Google’s oft-borrowed vision for future internet growth.  Crypto’s VC moment  Plenty of VCs and founders have searched for crypto’s “killer use case,” Beller said. Facebook’s Libra project was founded on the ambitious belief that hundreds of millions of people could use cryptotech and stablecoins to unlock global finance. It hasn’t succeeded yet.  “I think early hypotheses were like, ‘Well, Bitcoin,’ but then stablecoins or various wallets;” all had their turn under the sun, she said. “It feels increasingly clear that that answer might actually be NFTs – more so than DeFi – or gaming.”  Indeed, non-fungible token (NFT) gaming has exploded in popularity as the core notion of digital jpeg ownership spreads globally. Axie Infinity, a crypto-gaming crossover, saw its revenue explode 48x last quarter, according to Messari, as tens of thousands of play-to-earn gamers piled in.  “We’re trying to look a lot more in gaming. Stay tuned, we’re gonna be doing something cool in gaming,” Beller added.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/vc-fund-nfx-to-go-deeper-into-crypto-with-450m-seed-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77be0b8f6b21fea5492655cfa482f8ab5a717b4d-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE3Y7,1633438200,What to Expect From CoinDesk’s Bitcoin for Advisors Conference,"On Wednesday, Oct. 6, starting at 9 a.m. ET (6 a.m. PT), CoinDesk will host Bitcoin for Advisors 2021. Focused on the changing financial landscape, the annual event aims to equip advisors with the tools to best understand how bitcoin, ethereum and other digital assets can successfully impact their clients’ portfolios.  Once again, Bitcoin for Advisors will be an online-only event. Like with other recent online events from CoinDesk, we anticipate some exciting announcements and insights from our guests.  Subscribe to Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  While the sessions will mainly focus on the basics of bitcoin, they’ll take a deep dive into practice management, portfolio theory, and even decentralized finance (DeFi). We’ll be live-tweeting the event as it happens on Wednesday, of course.  Bitcoin’s changing narrative  In many ways, bitcoin has become less of a speculative asset since the first Bitcoin for Advisors conference in 2020 — certainly when compared to years prior, during which the industry rallied around the “institutions are here” narrative only to have been met with a bear market that brought bitcoin from ~$20,000 to ~$3,000 in 2018.  Yet, somehow in the midst of a black swan event that spurred a global pandemic, lockdowns and unfettered quantitative easing, the institutions are, indeed, finally here. Which means financial advisors (FAs) and registered investment advisors (RIAs) are not too far behind, right?  Well, the headlines may say one thing, but what’s top of mind for advisors right now when it comes to looking at crypto assets for their clients? What’s the biggest challenge they face as we sit here today? We hope to answer these questions and more at Bitcoin for Advisors. Here’s some of what we’re looking out for at the event:  Highly acclaimed financial advisor Ric Edelman is the event’s first keynote. Edelman built the biggest independent advisory firm in the nation and is on a mission to be the face and bridge between old money and new.  Delays on a Bitcoin ETF  According to Edelman, a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is inevitable, and it’s already arrived in other jurisdictions (notably Canada). However, delays in the U.S. as well as other significant barriers have led financial managers to sit on their client’s cash as the dust settles. In his talk at Bitcoin for Advisors, Edelman hopes to remove the mystery about blockchain and digital assets and help advisors to “get off zero.”  But advisors need more than a man on a mission, they need a multifaceted approach that resonates with their practice and clients. That’s why the conference will explore compliance, practice management and tax implications – the whole package.  How advisors can approach digital assets  Another keynote speaker will offer a nerd’s perspective on the financial planning world. (Yes, we’re talking about Michael Kitces.) Kitces, who is famous for his “Nerd’s Eye View” blog, takes a bit of a more cautious approach to bitcoin. On one hand, he notes, advisors can’t fall behind and not learn about digital assets; on the other hand, the jury is still out.  Nonetheless, advisors will leave this event with a new vocabulary and a better understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape. With the ever-expanding crypto market attracting the attention of Janet Yellen, Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, the financial planning world has no choice but to adapt or be disrupted.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephanie Izquieta,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/05/what-to-expect-from-coindesks-bitcoin-for-advisors-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a767546fee610d21a84b16eb5506e873bc54550-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE3ad,1633425210,4 Factors Helping Bitcoin to Decouple From Falling Stock Market,"Bitcoin has recently decoupled from the weak stock markets, reviving speculation that the cryptocurrency may be beginning to draw demand as a haven or inflation-hedge asset.  Since Sept. 29, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen 20% to trade near $49,300 while the S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark equity index, has dropped by 2.6% to 4,300. Bitcoin’s positive price action is in stark contrast to previous price corrections this year, which coincided with an S&P 500 decline of 2% or more.  Industry experts said bitcoin’s latest resilience stems from the cryptocurrency’s store-of-value appeal, continued institutional inflows into the crypto market, speculation that the U.S. will soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and positive seasonality.  Let’s look at the each factor in detail:  Inflation hedge  “Inflation is here to stay, and every household is starting to see prices skyrocket for goods and services nationwide,” Carlos Betancourt, co-founder of BKCoin Capital, said. “Many savvy investors look for asymmetric opportunities and a hedge against inflation, and there is always one common asset that comes to mind ... remember, bitcoin is the only asset that governments or central banks cannot manipulate.”  A recently released New York Federal Reserve survey showed year-ahead inflation expectations increased for the 10th straight month to 5.2% in August. Inflation expectations are also rising across the eurozone.  Bitcoin gets its store-of-value appeal from programmed code called mining reward halving, which reduces the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years. That’s in stark contrast to the Fed’s never-ending money printing exercise. Several firms, including Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy, have adopted bitcoin as an asset to preserve the value of their treasuries.  Marcie Terman, chief operating officer of crypto hedge fund Panxora Group, said both rising price pressures in the global economy and the uncertainty about the U.S. debt ceiling are negative for stocks but positive for bitcoin because “people are using the cryptocurrency (like gold) as a hedge against inflation.”  Stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks, on concerns the Fed will scale back stimulus at a faster rate to control inflation and the debt-ceiling saga.  “Inflation fears are lifting expectations of the future path of interest rates by the Federal Reserve,” said Max Boonen, founder of crypto market-making firm B2C2. “As usual, that could weigh on stocks. On the other hand, bitcoin is seen as more insulated against inflation than equities thanks to its fixed supply.”  Institutional flows  Institutions and venture capital firms are pouring money into the crypto ecosystem, having shown no signs of relenting during the recent bearish price trends.  “New quarterly months have typically seen a lot of new fund inflows into the ecosystem,” Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “So funds need to put capital to work, which has helped in this case.”  “A few funds we’ve spoken to have seen very strong new capital inflows this quarter,” Tang said. Data from ByteTree Asset Management shows European and Canadian exchange trade funds (ETFs) and U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds have accumulated over 3,000 bitcoin in the past four weeks.  According to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, bitcoin and the broader crypto market’s beginning-of-the-month rallies are “primarily driven by untrackable fund flows – venture capital investments, hedge funds and direct purchases of digital assets via Fidelity, Coinbase and others.”  “Ask any OTC (over-the-counter) dealer who specializes in digital assets or any liquid digital asset fund manager, and they’ll all point to significant and constant monthly inflows,” Dorman wrote in his weekly research note.  According to data from research firm PitchBook, crypto companies raised a record $7.5 billion in the July-to-September period, surpassing the previous record raise of $7 billion seen in the first quarter.  Seasonality  Some investors could be buying the cryptocurrency on expectations that the final three months of the year will bring a more substantial rally, as they have often done in the past.  The seasonality chart above shows September is typically the worst month of the year while October, and the fourth quarter generally, is the strongest.  “Seasonality could be a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent,” BKCoin’s Betancourt said. “However, particularly regarding crypto, the recent news flow is definitely [the primary] driver over historical charts.”  Panxora’s Terman said that seasonal effects could have some influence; however, they are not reliable. “Since we take it as given that BTC was a viable market starting in 2013, we’ve only had eight data points to make that prediction. That’s too few data points for a rational assessment,” Terman noted in an email.  ETF speculation  As discussed last week, a newfound optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon approve futures-based ETFs also seems to be driving the market higher.  “Canada officially approved a crypto ETF that includes both bitcoin and ether, and U.S. SEC Chair Gary Gensler showed support for a futures bitcoin ETF recently, and that’s certainly been digested by investors as a bullish sign,” Betancourt said. “The SEC is reviewing over 20 applications for ETFs and futures ETF products linked to bitcoin and ether.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/05/4-factors-helping-bitcoin-to-50k-as-stock-market-declines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62f95c59a8228633c8bae87a70559d1c3341e432-2408x1143.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411904,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwqR,1633423556,What Is a Perpetual Swap Contract?,"A perpetual swap is a type of derivative trading product that has become increasingly popular among crypto traders over recent years, with data showing daily trading volumes of over $180 billion.  Launched on May 13, 2016, perpetual swaps offer traders a chance to take on large positions in a cryptocurrency with little money down. This opportunity to win big on small movements tends to entice a lot of people to use them, but with such big rewards come a likewise enormous amount of risk.  What are crypto derivatives?  Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset.  Like other types of derivatives, including futures and options, perpetual swaps provide a means to speculate on the value of assets while the contract is held.  This is similar to futures contracts which allow investors to speculate on a cryptocurrency’s future price in the future by taking on the obligation to buy or sell an asset on a set date at a predetermined price. Options, on the other hand, give its purchaser the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price at a predetermined date.  Generally, crypto derivatives offer traders a flexible method of profiting off the price movements of digital assets without exposing them to the security risks or technicalities associated with storing or holding cryptocurrencies.  As a trader interested in betting on the price of crypto assets, you could either purchase an asset at an exchange or trade a derivative product anchored to the value of the digital asset. In the former, the process involves holding crypto assets. In other words, when you invest in a digital asset on an exchange, you have to take the instant delivery of the specified amount of the digital asset you buy and hold them until you decide to either sell it for a profit or loss. This is also known as spot trading.  In contrast, trading crypto derivatives do not come with any custody requirements for the investor. Instead of holding the asset directly, derivatives traders simply buy and sell digital contracts.  What are futures contracts?  As its name implies, a futures contract is basically a financial contract between two parties to sell and buy an asset at a set price in the future. In other words, future contracts allow two parties to agree on the price at which they will exchange an asset in the future. Although the duration of future contracts varies, the settlement dates of each contract are always fixed. In essence, before two parties can enter into a crypto futures contract, they must agree on closing the contract on a predefined settlement date.  For instance, the expiration of a quarterly BTC futures contract is three months from the day it is issued.  How do crypto futures contracts work?  To illustrate the core workings of futures contracts, let’s assume that the price of bitcoin is $40,000, and Alice, a crypto derivatives trader, believes that the price will be higher in a month.  She could bet on this possibility by entering into a deal that allows her to purchase 1 BTC for $40,000 a month from now. All she needs to do is open bitcoin futures contracts that collectively indicate her commitment to pay $40,000 for 1 BTC next month, regardless of the price at which the digital asset is trading on the spot market.  On the flip side of this trade is Bob, who believes the price of bitcoin will drop below $40,000 at the proposed settlement date. He is committed to selling $40,000 worth of contracts to Alice next month. In other words, Alice is “longing” bitcoin, while Bob, on the other hand, is “shorting” the digital asset.  Assuming the price of bitcoin rose to $45,000 at the expiration date of the contract, Alice would have generated a $5,000 profit since she would be purchasing BTC from Bob at a discount. In a scenario where the price of BTC dropped below the $40,000 mark at the settlement date, Alice would have to buy bitcoin from Bob at a higher price compared to the current market and subsequently incur a loss.  What are perpetual swaps?  A perpetual swap is somewhat similar to a futures contract in that it allows traders to speculate on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies. The core difference is that, unlike a typical futures contract, perpetual swaps do not have expiration dates. In essence, this eliminates the need to constantly re-establish a long or short position. For this reason, the price of perpetual contracts must be anchored to the spot prices of their underlying assets. In the case of futures, there is no need for maintaining a price peg since the value of the contract and the underlying asset automatically converge as the expiration date nears.  Due to the absence of expiration dates in perpetual swaps, exchanges implement a price anchoring system called the funding rate mechanism. This mechanism balances the short and long positions of perpetual swaps by either incentivizing or disincentivizing trades. Think of it as a rebate or fee that helps balance out the demand for the short and long side of perpetual contracts.  How do exchanges calculate funding rates?  The funding rate mechanism helps keep the prices of perpetual futures contracts at par with the market prices of the underlying assets they track. For example, if bitcoin’s current market price across a range of exchanges is $50,000, the funding rate mechanism will help make sure the perpetual swap contract price is also priced around the same $50,000 level.  Generally, exchanges use an oscillating price marker to determine whether long or short traders need to pay fees or receive rebates. When the price of a perpetual swap is above the spot price of the underlying digital assets, then we say that the funding rate is positive. In this case, traders holding long positions would pay a small fee to those shorting the digital assets.  In contrast, a perpetual swap trading below the spot price of its underlying asset has a negative funding rate. Here, those shorting perpetual swaps would pay traders holding long positions.  The exact amount paid or received depends on the size of each trader’s position. For instance, if the funding rate of a BTC/USD perpetual swap is +0.010%, a trader longing $40,000 worth of this particular perpetual swap would have to pay a fee of $4 – derived from multiplying $40,000 with 0.010%. Note that funding fees are paid at fixed intervals. On some exchanges, the funding period is set for every eight hours.  How do perpetual swaps work?  Traders can long bitcoin by purchasing perpetual swaps and selling them some time in the future for profits. For example, Alice buys 2 BTC/USD perpetual swaps by depositing $80,000 as collateral. As such, each BTC/USD perpetual swap is worth $40,000. Assuming the price of bitcoin rises steadily to $50,000 the following month, and Alice decides to close her position, she would have generated a $10,000 profit on each perpetual swap purchased. Her total profit would be roughly $20,000.  profit = number of perpetual swaps * (current price - entry price)  profit = 2 * ($50,000 - $40,000)  profit = $20,000  It is worth noting that this calculation does not take into account the effect of funding rates on the profitability of Alice. The fees paid and the rebate received by Alice as part of the exchange’s attempt to peg the perpetual swap to bitcoin’s spot price would determine the exact figure that Alice generates.  Also, Alice could take advantage of the leverage opportunities available to perpetual swap traders to multiply profits. To do this, she could purchase perpetual contracts worth double the amount she initially deposited as collateral. With this strategy, the size of her position would be $160,000 (or 4 BTC/USD perpetual swaps), even though her collateral is half of the value of perpetual swaps she is trading. In such a scenario, Alice has taken advantage of a 2x leverage. Assuming she closes her position when each BTC/USD perpetual swap is selling for $50,000, her profit will be roughly $40,000.  profit = 4 * ($50,000 - $40,000)  profit = $40,000  Interestingly, some exchanges allow traders to access up to 125x leverage in order to maximize profits. However, just as leverage amplifies profits, it also amplifies losses. From our example, using a 2x leverage exposes Alice to liquidation risk if the price of the perpetual swaps falls by 50% from the initial price she bought them.  profit = 4 * ($20,000 - $40,000)  loss = $80,000  When a trader’s unrealized loss equals the collateral deposited, exchanges automatically close the trader’s position. As such, the entirety of the collateral would be lost. Therefore, the risk that comes with using margins or trading with leverage is significant and should NOT be attempted by novice traders.  In summary, while trading perpetual swaps contracts is highly risky they are appealing because they allow traders to speculate on the short-term or long-term price movements of digital assets without time constraints. The possibility of generating profits even when the prices of cryptocurrencies fall is also one of the added advantages of perpetual swaps.  Nevertheless, it’s advised traders should always perform their own due diligence and seek professional advice from a financial advisor before making any investment in cryptocurrency. When trading perpetual swap contracts, it’s possible a trader may lose their entire invested capital – especially when leverage is used.

Growth was powered by a record-breaking August, which saw over $5.2 billion in trading volume, the report said.  DappRadar said “there is not a single but multiple reasons” for the surge. One of these is the way in which NFT projects are “becoming brands,” with celebrities such as rapper Snoop Dogg and Hall of Fame basketball player Shaquille O’Neal putting their names to communities, strengthening the social aspect of NFTs.  The growth in NFTs is part of a broader expansion of the blockchain industry. The number of unique active wallets (UAW) climbed 25% during the quarter, reaching an average of over 1.5 million daily.  Another growth driver is the rise in blockchain-based gaming, which attracted more than750,000 UAW, 140% more than in the previous quarter.  The popularity of blockchain gaming was highlighted this week by news that play-to-earn game Axie Infinity is reportedly raising around $150 million in a Series B funding round at a $3 billion valuation, with the round led by venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz.

The decentralization movement does not only prevent fraud, but for those living under authoritarian governments, it can provide a medium of exchange resistant to censorship, giving a crucial means of financial freedom. Although cryptocurrency has been lauded for its technological advancements, it hasn&apos;t come without its moments of scrutiny. In May, Elon Musk decided to stop accepting Bitcoin as payment for Tesla, tweeting that he was concerned about the &apos;rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining.&apos; This is because the top cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum—require large amounts of energy consumption to function. In 2020, a report showed that Bitcoin was on track to use more energy than that of 159 countries combined. It&apos;s no wonder that people like Musk are advocating for greener alternatives. Despite the fact that most new technology comes with trade-offs, the issue has sparked a conversation about how blockchains can further move towards environmentally friendly practices. This is where Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) gets interesting regarding the environmental impact of a blockchain. Both PoW and PoS algorithms can have a direct effect on energy usage.

42376061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwE3Wr,1633416097,Hong Kong Monetary Authority Releases CBDC White Paper to Study Prospect of e-HKD,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s de facto central bank, has released a white paper on retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) while it continues to explore the potential of a digital Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) for its domestic and cross-border markets.  The HKMA serves as the central bank of the city whose official title is the Hong Kong Special Administration of the People’s Republic of China.“  Under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework under which Hong Kong is governed, Hong Kong maintains its own financial and judicial systems, among others, separately from the Chinese mainland.  The paper, titled “e-HKD: A technical perspective,” explores potential architectures and design options as it relates to the construction of the infrastructure for distributing e-HKD.  “The knowledge gained from this research, together with the experience we acquired from other CBDC projects, would help inform further consideration and deliberation on the technical design of the e-HKD,” HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said in a press release on Monday.  The bank said its white paper is “the first” among similar papers published by central banks that details transaction traceability while preserving privacy as a key technical feature.  “The architecture proposed in this white paper is most notable for its ability to flexibly and efficiently instantiate different two-tier distribution models of rCBDC while achieving breakthroughs in privacy-preserving transaction traceability and cross-ledger synchronization of decoupled ledgers,” the authority said in its paper, referring to a retail CBDC.  HKMA’s research consisted of seven major areas of concern, analyzing the benefits and shortcomings of CBDCs as they apply to privacy, interoperability, scalability and performance, cybersecurity, compliance, operational robustness and resilience as well as their technology-enabled functional capabilities.  Under Project LionRock in 2017, the HKMA began researching CBDCs and says it has since “actively collaborated” with other central banks in broadening its knowledge of wholesale CBDCs.  The paper also examined four major distribution models, including a “variant of direct CBDC model,” a “hybrid model,” an “intermediated model” and “CBDC-backed e-money.”  The bank said it is seeking opinions from academic and industry experts by year’s end under a formal request for a comment document. HKMA also underscored its intent behind its research was to collect views, not to push ahead with infrastructure development at this stage.  “It should be noted that the proposed architecture is not a blueprint for e-HKD, nor does it approach a decision on the CBDC distribution models chosen for implementing e-HKD”, the bank said. “Suggestions and ideas of better designs are also solicited.”  Read more: BIS and Hong Kong Monetary Authority to Experiment With Tokenized Green Bonds",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/hong-kong-monetary-authority-releases-cbdc-whitepaper-to-study-prospect-of-e-hkd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4d22924c482ce1f13e00666b529a336f1430574-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to an announcement on Tuesday, Credit Suisse has tokenized shares in adventure sports company Alaïa SA, which owns chalets and a hotel in the Swiss Alps.  Credit Suisse is working with Switzerland-based crypto custody and trading platform Taurus to create tokens in accordance with Swiss Capital Markets and Technology Association (CMTA) standards. The law in Switzerland was updated in February to allow tokenized securities to trade on a blockchain with the same legal standing as traditional assets.  “The blockchain is recognized in the law as a valid ledger whereby you can register shares,” Taurus co-founder Lamine Brahimi said in an interview, adding:  “I think that’s a very important move for large regulated institutions because now there’s zero ambiguity.”  The next step for the bank is to organize a private placement for Alaïa tokenized shares. The shares will begin to trade on the Taurus Digital Exchange (TDX) in the first quarter of next year to provide liquidity to Alaïa investors and employees. (Earlier this year, Taurus received a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to run a marketplace for digital assets.)  It’s not the first time the realm of tokenized real estate has played host to blockchain-based shares in a ski resort.  In 2018, regulated trading platform Templum touted tokenized shares in the St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado, so-called “Aspen coins,” which later found their way onto the Overstock-owned tZero trading platform. More recently, a resort in Indonesia was tokenized and auctioned using non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “I think what’s interesting is that this project is not just about tokenizing shares and booking them in the system,” Brahimi said. “It’s also making a private placement, i.e. capital increase, based on tokenized securities, with the objective to provide secondary market trading for those. And both the bank and Alaïa are committed to doing so.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/credit-suisse-creates-ethereum-based-shares-in-swiss-ski-resort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9eb006c0f44647a62c858833877b0e1868b711a-1600x1060.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Decrypt article cited two unnamed sources “familiar with the matter,” and said that FTX would “advocate for crypto interests” through the PAC.

The network’s mempool – a chamber where all valid transactions wait to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network – is beginning to fill as each transaction awaits processing. The last transaction occurred over four hours ago, according to Liquid’s web page.  Liquid said it was aware of an issue on its network that related to “block signing” because of a recent “functionary upgrade,” according to a tweet late Monday.  On Tuesday, the Liquid Network Oversight Board issued a detailed statement saying that the problems arose from the planned hard fork upgrade to the Dynamic Federation feature to the Liquid network. The statement said that developers quickly delivered a fix for the issue, and 10 of the 15 functionaries have already deployed the patched Liquid software.  Block production ie expected to resume within the next 24 hours, as soon as additional network functionaries can upgrade their nodes, according to the statement.  Block signing is a type of digital signature used to verify the authenticity of transactions on a blockchain.  While not nearly as popular as other non-bitcoin platforms, Liquid has 3,291 Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) in circulation and sees roughly 500 transactions processed on the network each day, according to Liquid’s web page.  L-BTC is an asset that claims to be verifiably backed 1-to-1 with bitcoin held by the Liquid Federation on the Bitcoin mainchain.  The Liquid network was launched in 2018 after three years in the making, and at the time, it touted the potential to carry large volume of transactions at a higher speed for several of bitcoin’s largest companies.

The exchange said it wants to “protect the rights and interests” of its users and is recommending the transfer before 24:00 UTC Dec. 31, according to a blog post on Sunday.  “KuCoin has always complied with the laws and regulations of various countries and insisted on operating in compliance,” the exchange said.  On Sept. 24, KuCoin said it “immediately” conducted a “technical self-inspection” to make certain its business process complied with China’s regulatory requirements.  Late last month, Chinese authorities ordered a fresh crackdown on crypto mining and outlawed virtually all crypto trading activities in what some defined as its toughest measures against crypto in years. The market experienced a modest sell-off on the news as bitcoin fell roughly 4.5% from around $45,159 to $40,693 before clawing back some of the losses and closing the daily trading period at $42,848.  Four days after the news of the crackdown, Chinese media reported at least 18 platforms providing services related to crypto either announced they were exiting the market in China or were inaccessible.  KuCoin said it will continue to prompt users to take action “as soon as possible.”  In a separate matter, KuCoin said it has suspended its SMS notification service and told users to “beware of fraud.”  Read more: China’s Longest-Running Crypto Exchange Closes Bitcoin Business Following Crackdowns",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/05/kucoin-tells-users-in-china-to-move-funds-to-other-platforms-before-december,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed15967ad5d1a01eeee39d4d2e6094173b137e7e-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
