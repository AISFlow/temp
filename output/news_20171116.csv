42428104,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5xJh,1510868429,Coinbase Courts Hedge Funds With Storage Service,"Cryptocurrency wallet and exchange startup Coinbase is launching a new storage service aimed specifically at institutional investors.  Coinbase Custody, CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a new blog post published today, is aimed at those who have a minimum of $10 million in deposits. In order to utilize the service, users would need to pay the initial $100,000 set-up fee, along with a 10 basis point fee per-month on the coins stored within the system (although these prices could change over time, Coinbase added).  The idea, according to the company, is to appeal to an institutional audience that harbors concerns over the security of wholly digitized assets.  Armstrong wrote:  ""When we speak with these institutions, they tell us that the number one thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely. his is why I’m excited to announce Coinbase Custody. The next step to accelerating the world’s adoption of digital currencies is to unlock the institutional money preparing to enter the space.""  Coinbase's service isn't opening for business immediately, however. The company said that it would begin ""gradually rolling out access to our early access product in 2018,"" inviting prospective clients to get in touch.  That the firm would move to create such a service is perhaps unsurprising, given the rising interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional investors, as well as the proliferation of hedge funds focused specifically on digital assets. Indeed, recent reports and statements suggest that major hedge funds are eyeing the market, though how that interest translates into actual investments remains to be seen.  Founded in 2012, Coinbase has raised more than $200 million in funding to date, including a $100 million Series D round closed in August.

VMWare, which focuses primarily on cloud computing and virtualization services, is behind the application published Nov. 16 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The application details a ""hybrid-blockchain"" approach, which would see computers connected via a distributed network exchanging ""tokens"" that contain ""metadata regarding a data set to be transferred.""  As the application explains:  ""The token can be transmitted using a blockchain network that is accessible to the first and second computer systems via a public network. The first computer system can then upload the data set to the one or more cloud storage service addresses via the public network, and the second computer system can download the data set from the one or more cloud storage service addresses via the public network.""  The preference for a public blockchain – versus a permissioned one in which participants are limited – is a notable one. The application cites how tokens within such a network ""cannot be forged without having control over the majority of the computational power in the network,"" pointing to this as an area for strength if used as part of a data-transfer system.  The application offers a view into how Dell might be looking at potentially applying the tech, but it's not the first intellectual property-related move from the firm. In September 2016, the USPTO published an application from Dell Products focused on computing device management using a distributed ledger.

The price of bitcoin is spiking, climbing above $7,700 for the first time since Nov. 8.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is at an average of $7,741.44, representing a gain of more than 6% since the day's open of $7,279. That figure also signifies a gain of over $450, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of the time of writing, the price hit a high of $7,769.84 today – a figure that brings it close to bitcoin's all-time high of $7,879.06.  The moves – notably seen in the past two hours of trading – continue an advance that saw the price of bitcoin exceed $7,500 earlier today. By contrast, just days ago, the price of bitcoin fell beneath $6,000, hitting a three-week low below $5,600 at the time.  Though the $8,000 milestone may be in sight – a possibility floated by analysts at Goldman Sachs – additional market data reveals a notable achievement.

A new report published today by LendEDU – which has conducted several similar studies in the past year – details the responses from 564 poll-takers. Of those, roughly 40% of participants said that they invested in bitcoin because they believe it is ""a world changing technology.""  Twenty-one percent of those involved say its because bitcoin is ""a long term store of value, like gold or silver"", with roughly 15% of those saying they bought in because a friend or family member recommended it. Those who said they think the price is ""too low"" accounted for 14% of respondents, while just 8% said they planned to use bitcoin as a payment method.  Notably, the survey also asked at which price participants would choose to sell their holdings. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the average of the amounts cited came out to a whopping $196,165.79 per bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $7,680, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Plan to HODL?  Further, many of those who responded to the survey don't appear to be in any rush to sell off their investments anytime soon.  ""We found that about a third, 32.62 percent, of respondents have sold some of their Bitcoin since investing. However, we found that the majority of investors, 67.38 percent, ​have not sold any of their Bitcoin investments since purchasing,"" LendEDU wrote in its report.  On average, investors owned just under $3,000 in bitcoin. While 16.5 percent of these owners plan to sell within a year, 20 percent plan to hold the cryptocurrency for at least seven years.  Another noteworthy data point: just over a third of survey-takers have no intention of reporting their trades to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which declared in 2014 that it would consider bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as a kind of property for tax purposes.  ""We found that the majority, 64.13 percent, of respondents are planning to report or have already ​reported their bitcoin transactions to the IRS. Although, it was interesting to see that over a third, 35.87 percent, of our respondents are not planning to report their transactions to the IRS,"" LendEDU wrote.

The latest to join the fray is Katsunori Sago, chief investment officer of Japan Post Bank, who said he believes the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is in bubble territory.  Speaking to Reuters today, Sago argued that the true fair value for bitcoin is around $100, adding that the current high value of the cryptocurrency is worse than the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.  Sago said if bitcoin did drop to $100, the bank might consider buying it, but due to high volatility there are no plans to short-sell the cryptocurrency. According to the news source, the CIO also predicted that the bitcoin rally could top out around $10,000 when CME Group launches its bitcoin futures product – a move expected by the end of 2017.  However, he also aired a positive sentiment on blockchain technology and predicted that, in years to come, bitcoin could come to be widely used in settlement.  ""The best thing to do here is to stay away from it [until then],"" he said.  Sago's take on bitcoin mirrors views of other big names in finance.

42428090,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5snh,1510848010,YouTube Stars Can Now Earn Brave's Browser Tokens,"Users of the Brave Browser can now donate cryptocurrency, including the company's Basic Attention Token (BAT), directly to YouTubers.  With today's release of version 0.19.x, the ad-blocking browser built by Mozilla co-founder and Javascript creator Brendan Eich now allows automatic and anonymous cryptocurrency donations to individuals on YouTube, an expansion of its service which before now was limited to domain-level projects, such as websites like CoinDesk.  With Brave's update, however, views of YouTube videos no longer count toward Google's page views. Instead, the browser will start logging viewing time on behalf of the creators who made the content. Previously, the site only credited URLs specifically, so it couldn't track individual accounts on the video-sharing platform.  But ""YouTube was squarely in our sites from the beginning,"" Eich told CoinDesk in a phone call.  In a blog post, the company wrote:  ""Previously, YouTube creators could not be listed as individual publishers in Brave Payments. This change allows BAT contributions to flow directly into their wallets. The Brave browser determines the YouTube creator name from a YouTube video, no matter what site embeds it.""  There are approximately 243,000 Brave browser wallets that have been opened so far, allowing users to hold crypto funds, originally bitcoin, for later distribution to publishers and video creators. But in order to create a faster, less invasive internet browsing experience, Brave held a $35 million initial coin offering for its Basic Attention Token (BAT).  Within the new version, Brave's wallets will hold either BAT token or bitcoin that can be used to donate to YouTubers, which could disseminate the cryptocurrencies to a wider user base.  The average funded wallet amount has roughly $45 worth of crypto in it, though this could be largely due to the growth in bitcoin's value after users deposited funds in their wallets. Older Brave users automatically have bitcoin as their default currency, but the company is actively working to get users to update their browsers to a new version that automatically converts funds to BAT.  Potential appeal  And YouTube is just the beginning. Basically, all video sites use the same protocol, OAuth, to verify that publishers are who they say they are. Brave will be able to tap into that as well, in order to make sure it pays the right people.  Once it knows that process is working for YouTube, it can roll the payments out to creators on other sites, for instance Vimeo.  ""This is an induction exercise. We're really trying to disintermediate the unfair and fraud-prone ecosystem,"" Eich said.  Should the system work, YouTube is likely an influential one to get right.  YouTube stars have incredible reach and influence with their followers, yet many of them have been dissatisfied over the last year with automated demonetization of their videos.  While Brave blocks YouTube ads natively, it will give videomakers a way to continue to use YouTube and still earn money off their videos, whether YouTube thinks the content merits it or not.  And at the very least, if some popular YouTubers start talking about the system, it will educate a lot of young fans about cryptocurrency and ad-blocking.  ""We hope they'll promote Brave to their followers,"" Eich said.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.

As of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1,007. As per CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate has depreciated by 20 percent in the last 24 hours.  The widely cited movement of money out of bitcoin (BTC) and into bitcoin cash following the suspension of the controversial Segwit2x software upgrade appeared to push BCH to record highs near $2,500 on Sunday. However, the bull run looked overdone as per technical studies, and BCH soon lost altitude while BTC made a sharp recovery from $5,500.  Despite the losses today, so far the BCH has defended the new base level of $1,000 as expected.  The price action analysis and the volume analysis shows a potential for a move higher to $1,300-$1,400 range.  Bitcoin cash chart  The above chart shows:  The upward sloping 10-day moving average (MA) has helped prices defend the psychological level of $1,000.  Despite confirmation of a bearish doji reversal (Monday's doji and a bearish follow-through on Tuesday), BCH is holding above the $1,000 mark.  The 4-hour and 1-hour charts also show potential for a recovery.  4-hour chart  1-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Bullish doji reversal is confirmed  The relative strength index (RSI) is oversold  So, the stage looks set for a recovery, however, the falling channel is still intact. A break above the falling channel resistance around $1,115 would validate the bullish doji reversal and oversold RSI, and would open up upside towards $1,400.  Volume analysis: Pullback from record highs lacks substance  As per CoinMarketCap, total trading volumes for BCH have dropped 84.2 percent over the last four days, indicating that the pullback from the record highs is largely ""corrective"" in nature.  View  BCH is likely to defend its new base level of $1,000 and move higher to $1,400 over the next 24-48 hours.  Only multiple 1-hour closes below $1,000 would weaken the bull market case and could yield a deeper pullback to $700 (Nov. 3 high).

42428085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sdh,1510837203,American Express Opens First Blockchain Corridor With Ripple Tech,"Back in 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh could have flown cash across the Atlantic Ocean faster than most payments happen over that same body of water today.  Whereas Lindbergh completed his historic solo flight from New York City to Paris in 33 hours and 30 minutes, a typical bank transaction today takes one to two days using Swift, and a typical ACH transaction can take twice as long.  So, the news today that American Express has opened up a payments corridor using Ripple that can send money from England to the U.S. in just a few seconds has been a long time coming.  A partnership with Spanish bank Santander, the new corridor is being positioned by Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, as an obviously faster, but also safer way to send payments across the Atlantic.  A former Swift board member, Treacher told CoinDesk:  ""Whereas beforehand Amex had to send Swift messaging to the banks to request the payment to happen, now Amex is connected directly to the banks using Ripple and Ripple's cryptography, so that the movement of value happens immediately.""  Run by American Express's foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) business, the corridor connects Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the UK using British pounds – all via Ripple's blockchain, RippleNet.  According to Treacher, the integration routes non-card payments through the shared payment network for nearly instant, auditable cross-border payments.  Direct connections  The project marks the latest development for Amex in a year that has seen the credit giant join the Hyperledger blockchain consortium and partner with the bitcoin app provider Abra.  And for Ripple, which is coming off its recent Swell conference, the new work is another step toward letting its blockchain platform, tested throughout the first half of 2016, fly free.  For example, Ripple recently connected Europe and the U.S. via its work with Swedish bank SEB, which late last year revealed its intentions to connect Stockholm with New York City using Ripple.  Treacher said the SEB platform has already conducted $630 million-worth of transactions since it launched into production in Q2 of this year.  While that project is advancing and is able to transact in nine seconds or less, according to Treacher, it is for now — like the American Express project — restricted to what he calls a ""pure"" blockchain that doesn't require a cryptocurrency.  What both these projects have in common is ""a direct connection,"" he said. ""There's no intermediary cryptocurrency.""  Crypto on board  Going forward, however, Treacher expects that other banks will increasingly follow in the footsteps of financial services firm Cuallix, which last month became the first Ripple partner to convert cross-border fund transfers into the blockchain's native XRP token.  Instead of holding dozens of what Treacher called ""exotic currencies"" in so-called nostro accounts around the world, Cuallix took the first step toward freeing up those funds otherwise trapped for new uses by holding the XRP itself.  With Ripple's main competitor, Swift building its own blockchain using Hyperledger, and a rising tide of upstarts with their own variations on the cross-border payments use case, it's this use of Ripple's native cryptocurrency that Treacher thinks will elevate the company above the competition.  ""Where these two come together is that as banks and users of banks, like American Express, adopt Ripple and start to connect up, XRP becomes an option they can use for liquidity purposes,"" he said, concluding:  ""And that's where it really comes to life.""

Having taken the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level yesterday, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to eight-day highs above $7,520 today. As of writing, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $7,459 – a 2.54 percent gain for the session, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index  Stepping back, prices had dropped 29 percent after the developers suspended a controversial software upgrade, known as Segwit2x, on Nov. 8.  However, the sell-off was cut short near $5,500 by the 50-day moving average (MA) on Nov, 12. A rally in the subsequent days all but erased the likelihood of a drop to $5,000 levels. Then, yesterday, a move above $7,000 improved the odds of a continued rally to record highs above $7,800. Currently, BTC is just $312 short of its Nov. 8 record of over $7,800.  Possibly exerting influence on prices in recent days, comments on social media show the investor community has started analyzing the effect of a potential rotation of money out of stocks and bonds and into bitcoin. CME Group's recently announced BTC futures contract is likely to begin trading as soon as December.  The new offering will allow institutional investors to diversify into a high yielding asset like bitcoin – especially if the equity markets respond negatively to increased odds of a Fed rate hike.

42428074,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sHh,1510833646,Kik Might Just Move Its ICO Tokens to a New Blockchain,"Kik, the first mainstream company to complete an initial coin offering (ICO) on ethereum, is reportedly considering whether it might migrate its token network to a new blockchain.  The social messaging platform, which raised $98 million in its token sale earlier this year, first broached the subject late last month on the Kin Foundation's Telegram tech channel. There, Kik's head of blockchain engineering and security, Leonid Beder, said the firm was interested in ""kin"" token buyers' views on possible alternative blockchains that could replace ethereum.  ""Since we first and foremost want the Kin ecosystem to scale to many participants and huge transaction volumes sooner rather than later, we realize that ethereum might not be the right solution,"" Beder said at the time.  In statements to CoinDesk, Kik representatives cautioned that ""nothing [is] confirmed"" in regards to the potential move, but that the company is indeed exploring the idea of how such a transition might be executed.  A spokesperson said:  ""We're exploring our options as part of due diligence. If we did make this move, we'd ensure there's a process in place to ensure all Kin holders have the new token for the correct amount.""  The move, while notable given Kik's role in popularizing the ICO concept, is not unique for blockchain startups. For example, in the past, startups architecting token networks on top of the bitcoin network have migrated to other alternatives, most often ethereum.  If carried out, though, the decision could do much to impact the perception of ethereum – widely seen as the go-to blockchain on which to launch new tokens. At time of publication, nearly 13,000 tokens have been issued via smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.  Cost concerns  According to those involved, one of the chief reasons for the exploration are the costs inherent in using the ethereum platform, as well as Kik's specific goals for its token.  Early applications for the kin token are likely to monetize what people already do on Kik for free. For example, artists currently create stickers that users can send with messages on the Kik platform. With kin, artists might then be able to exchange stickers for value.  At press time, the median cost of transaction fees on ethereum is $0.14, according to BitInfoCharts.  And while ethereum developers have discussed technical solutions that execute transactions off-chain to scale the protocol and lower transactions fees, those have yet to go live.  In his Telegram message, Beder wrote that neither networks like Raiden nor alternative blockchains like EOS are ready for kin, but he added, ""Stellar is indeed one of the directions we're investigating.""  The kin ICO attracted 10,026 people who invested 168,732 ether in the sale.

42428082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL5sXh,1510822922,Lightning Only? Scaling Bitcoin Might Require A Whole 'Nother Layer,"Researchers are putting new effort into developing bitcoin's Lightning Network.  With the Segwit2x hard fork – which looked to increase the bitcoin block size parameter to 2MB – suspended, ETH Zurich researchers Conrad Burchert and Roger Wattenhofer and Blockstream engineer Christian Decker have proposed a more scalable version of the payments channel scheme, believed by developers to be the best way to expand bitcoin to accommodate more users.  Sometimes called bitcoin's ""layer two,"" Lightning hasn't yet been pushed live onto the bitcoin blockchain, but proponents of the idea see it as a way to boost bitcoin's transaction capacity without increasing the block size (as bitcoin cash, which forked off bitcoin in August did).  In a new paper called ""Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment Channel Networks,"" however, the three developers now envision even another layer, one that would be sandwiched between the bitcoin blockchain and Lightning, which they think would overcome Lightning's existing limits.  Perhaps most notably, the researchers argue that limit is somewhat defined by the bitcoin blockchain itself, which, capped at 1MB, can't support infinite Lightning channels. After all, users must complete bitcoin transactions and record them on the blockchain each time channels are opened and closed.  In this way, Decker, pointing to existing research, suggests there's an upward bound on just how many Lightning Network transactions are feasible today.  He writes:  ""It turns out, it's not that many. It's a few million every week, which is still a long ways from serving the full Earth's population.""  And while this isn't a problem right now, it could lead to issues in the future – scaling issues that continue to be a hot, and contentious topic in the crypto community.  Channel 'factories'  To understand what the new layer would provide, it's helpful to compare the proposed layer to the way Lightning functions currently.  Today, a user must open a new Lightning ""channel"" with another user through a regular blockchain transaction. Once that's established, the two users can make as many off-blockchain transactions as they want or are able to with the initial amount of value they put into the channel.  The new proposal, which Decker called ""Lightning extended,"" utilizes so-called ""hook transactions"" to move funds into a multi-party channel capable of supporting more than just two users. The paper calls this a ""channel factory.""  The method allows two people in a multi-party channel of say four or six, or as many as 15, to start a separate isolated channel within the main channel.  While it sounds a bit complex, the mechanism allows the two users in the isolated channel to close that channel and be dropped back into the multi-party channel, where they could then open another isolated channel with someone else. And all this is done without going back to the blockchain and incurring the transaction fees associated.  In this way, users could hypothetically open and close channels several times without ever making an on-chain transaction.  ""The only thing the blockchain needs to know in the end is where the money ends up. So, if we have many intermediate states, we don't have to publish them ever. Instead, we just make a transaction that everyone signs. This is the only thing that goes to the blockchain,"" Buchert, the lead author of the paper, explained.  He continued, ""It offers more flexibility, basically.""  According to the authors, the channel factories will lead to reductions in cost, comparable to the number of people in the multi-party channel. For instance, a 100-person group would lead to a 90 percent reduction in costs, compared to 100 traditional payment channels, the paper explains.  Still far away?  While the benefits seem attractive, the authors say there's still a way to go before the project could see real-world use.  For one, the developers said, the technology would perform better with if another long-proposed technology, Schnorr signatures, was added to bitcoin.  Whereas channel factories are currently limited to groups of 15 people, with Schnorr signatures, users could open up groups of an unlimited size – scaling Lightning even further.  Although there could be downsides to larger groups, in that one user could spoil the channel for everyone else by sending a transaction from the inside to the bitcoin blockchain. According to Burchert, developers and users will have to experiment to see how many members per group works in a real-world setting most effectively.  Plus, with Lightning still in the testing phase, Burchert said that channel factories can't jump to the front of the line.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There are far more important things to work on right now, like getting the Lightning Network online. We'll need [channel factory] technology when we have millions of channels, but we're far from that right now.""  And when that time comes, Decker said it can be integrated more easily because Lightning sits on top of the bitcoin protocol, and so shouldn't give rise to much conflict when upgrading.

Three justices issued a notice to the central bank, the market regulator, the tax department, and several other agencies, asking them to answer a petition on the matter, the Hindu, an Indian newspaper, reported Tuesday.  The original petition to the court expressed concern that bitcoin can be used to conduct transactions across borders without a trace, making it an attractive tool for ransomware attackers and tax cheats.  According to the petition:  ""The lack of any concrete [control] mechanism pending the regulatory framework in said regard has left a lot of vacuum and which has resulted in total unaccountability and unregulated Bitcoin (crypto money) trading and transactions.""  The petition goes on to state that bitcoin exchanges in India add 2,500 users per day, and that some 500,000 residents now hold bitcoin. As of 3:00 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, the exchange rate between Indian rupees and bitcoin was more than 470,000.  As a result of its adoption, bitcoin usage may affect ""the market value of other commodities,"" according to the petition, which pleaded with the court for an ""urgent direction"" for the government to intervene.  The petition noted that some countries are beginning to either regulate or ban bitcoin, citing China's crackdown on exchanges and Russia's attempts to block bitcoin websites.  India has typically adopted a ""wait-and-see"" stance on cryptocurrencies, discussing their role in the world's largest democracy but not taking concrete steps to regulate or prohibit them.  In April, the government formed a committee to study cryptocurrencies and propose new regulations.  Correction: An earlier headline on this article misdescribed the Indian Supreme Court's action.
