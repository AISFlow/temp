42425408,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTph,1391558236,Bitcoin Millionaire Olivier Janssens Books Private Jet Trip with PrivateFly,"Less than one month after announcing its decision to accept bitcoin, UK-based private jet charter service PrivateFly.com has revealed its first celebrity bitcoin passenger completed a flight from Brussels to Nice, Cote D'Azur on 27th January.  The more than 700-mile flight was taken by tech entrepreneur, Bitcoin Foundation lifetime member and bitcoin millionaire Olivier Janssens.  While such an extravagant bitcoin purchase may seem surprising, Janssens said that because his investments require him to travel extensively, he was keen to support PrivateFly in its decision to accept bitcoin:  ""The flight was the biggest bitcoin payment transaction I have made, but it was very easy and efficient, particularly as I wanted to fly at very short notice.""  PrivateFly CEO Adam Twidell  noted that the same-day nature of the payment showcased one of the primary benefits of the emerging virtual currency. The former Royal Air Force pilot said:  ""Mr. Janssens' flight was booked on the same day as departure, which is not at all unusual for us - and across our industry. With bitcoin payment being fast, flexible and not subject to banking hours, it's a good fit.""  His biggest purchase to date  Twidell noted that the purchase puts Janssens in a rare category as ""one of the world's first private jet customers"" to pay in bitcoin, and the first to go public regarding the purchase.  While neither Janssens nor PrivateFly commented on the size of the transaction, a look at similar flights offered on the website suggests that the total cost could have ranged from €5,980 (9.5 BTC at press time) to €34,260 (54.95 BTC), depending on the size of the plane Janssens chartered.  PrivateFly.com accepts bitcoin through BitPay, but does not list prices in BTC on its website. A more detailed overview of the payments it accepts, including bitcoin, can be found on its Payment & Pricing FAQ page.  Who is Olivier Janssens?  Janssens is an active member of the Bitcoin Foundation, frequently weighing in on issues such as the privacy rights of bitcoin holders on discussion boards. The Monaco resident obtained all his bitcoins through mining in 2010 when the price was still a fraction of its current value.  Janssens later became a PrivateFly customer in 2013, after learning of features such as its price comparison via web and mobile platforms and 24-hour phone support. He added:  ""PrivateFly's service suited my hectic business lifestyle. When they started to accept bitcoin, I was the first in line.""  Industry impact  Though PrivateFly formally announced its decision to accept bitcoin this January, CEO Twidell said he has been following the bitcoin space for more than a year. He went on to suggest that the move is indicative of the company's tech-friendly approach to the travel industry, adding:  ""PrivateFly's aim is to make choosing and buying private jet charter as fast, efficient and cost-effective as possible, using technology. So after considerable research, we came to the conclusion that it was a logical addition to our payment options.""  More recently the company began to receive requests from clients to accept bitcoin, suggesting that contrary to claims that many bitcoin millionaires are ""hoarding"" their coins, some at least are willing to spend big on luxury purchases, provided they meet their needs.  While he didn't say for certain, Janssens also suggested he may need PrivateFly's service again going forward, noting he is busy with several bitcoin projects that are competing for his attentions at the moment.

42425392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTHh,1391548398,"Alleged Silk Road Ringleader Ross Ulbricht Indicted on Drugs, Money Laundering","Ross Ulbricht, the 29-year-old alleged mastermind behind the now-defunct online black market Silk Road has been indicted on charges related to computer hacking, drugs and money laundering, federal prosecutors revealed on 4th February.  Notably, prosecutors found that Ulbricht engaged in ""continuing criminal enterprise,"" a charge typically reserved for mafia members and high-profile gangsters, and sometimes referred to as ""the kingpin statute"".  The charge adds 20 years to Ulbricht's minimum sentence, and carries a potential life sentence.  Ulbricht faces a maximum life sentence for the crimes relating to his involvement with Silk Road, a largely illegal marketplace that generated an estimated $1.2bn in annual sales, if convicted. His minimum charges carry a combined 30-year prison sentence.  The announcement means that a grand jury has deemed that sufficient probable cause has been established to take action against Ulbricht, who was arrested in October on charges of possessing and distributing controlled substances, conspiring to commit computer hacking offenses and money laundering offenses.  Next steps  Now that the indictment against Ulbricht has been returned, an arraignment can take place. At this event, Ulbricht will be read his charges, advised of his rights and will enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If Ulbricht pleads not guilty, a trial date will be selected as well.  Speaking to Forbes  , Ulbricht’s defense attorney Joshua Dratel indicated that Ulbricht plans to enter a ""not guilty"" plea:  “Ross will be pleading not guilty at the arraignment. The Indictment was expected and does not contain any new factual allegations. We look forward to beginning the discovery process and preparing Ross’s defense.”  Recent events further indicated a not guilty verdict was likely, as Ulbricht is contesting the government's attempt to sell his 144,000 bitcoins that were seized along with Silk Road.  The development is only the most recent event in the ongoing saga that is Silk Road's demise. Just last week, Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman Charlie Shrem was arrested for his alleged criminal association with the online marketplace in an event that is still shaking the industry.

42425393,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTLh,1391543542,RealtyShares Enables Crowdfunded Property Investment With Bitcoin,"Crowdfunding real estate venture RealtyShares is now taking bitcoin-based investments.  The site, founded in June last year, enables small investors to get into real estate by pooling their money with others. The crowdfunding investments include family homes, commercial properties, and apartment complexes.  Each property is purchased under a separate limited company (LLC), and investors in the property are given a share of the rent on a monthly or quarterly basis, based on their investment. When the property is sold, they are also awarded a share of that profit.  CEO Nav Athwal said that the decision to take investments in bitcoin was driven by a significant base of non-domestic investors. 10-15% of the people investing in US property through RealtyShares are from outside the country.  ""10-15 countries are represented, and the process for them is a little daunting. If they transfer money, then they face wire transfer fees and delays,"" he said. ""The fees and delays don’t make the solution as streamlined for international investors.""  The company signed with Coinbase as its payment processor, and integrated with its API. ""Some international investors specifically asked for the feature,"" Athwal said.  RealtyShares is treating the bitcoin investments as pure currency, and will not be holding a position in bitcoin. As it does with Overstock, Coinbase will immediately convert incoming bitcoin payments to fiat currency based on the current market exchange rate.  For the first million dollars in bitcoin-based investments, Coinbase is providing its conversion service for free. After that, it will charge a 1% conversion rate for all bitcoins sent to RealtyShares.  When transaction fees are charged, the crowdfunding real estate investment site will swallow the transaction fee itself, although depending on volume, it may reconsider that in the future, Athwal said.  There is no secondary market for shares, and investors are committed to a contract for at least six months, and up to seven years.  Returns on property investments will vary according to a number of parameters, including the type of property, and the type of investment. One option is to be a direct owner of a property, for which Athwal forecasts (but doesn't guarantee) returns of 8-9% annually.  The other option is to take a debt position, in which you invest in the LLC rather than the property directly. The LLC then takes a mortgage or promissory note, which reduces the investor's risk, as they are investing in the company rather than directly in the asset, Athwal said.  ""We’re the first platform that lets you use bitcoin to invest in something other than bitcoin,"" concluded Athwal. ""Bitcoin is generally treated as an asset as opposed to a currency. We enable investors and BTC holders to put it into something tangible like real estate.""

42425406,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTnh,1391539862,Of Mice and Shrem,"Charlie Shrem's arrest could not have have come at a worse time.  The BitInstant founder and Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman was charged last week with conspiracy to commit money laundering, failure to report suspicious financial activities to authorities and for operating BitInstant without a money transmitter license just days before the BitLicense hearings, EDC breakfast and Wells Fargo panel in New York City.  While news of his arrest stole headlines across the major news media, a larger debate raged within the community regarding Shrem: how should the Bitcoin Foundation, the industry's lone advocacy group, treat one of its own in the face of a serious criminal complaint?  This was the community's first real identity crisis. This wasn't Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road. This was Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin pioneer, entrepreneur and spokesperson.  Three camps emerged in a matter of hours. The first (and perhaps most vocal) group on reddit consisted of supporters who cried foul at the timing and weakness of the allegations, and railed against government conspiracy, prosecutorial hypocrisy and even the validity of money laundering and drug trafficking laws themselves.  The second emerged from industry insiders and friends who revered Shrem as a visionary, and firmly believed that the Bitcoin Foundation should throw its full support behind its Vice Chairman in order to send a message that bitcoin would defend its leaders.  The third consisted largely of those Foundation members who demanded that the organization quickly and clearly distance itself from Shrem in order to preserve its reputation. These groups debated furiously while Shrem was detained incommunicado.  Three camps  The crypto-anarchist backbone of the bitcoin community quickly presented itself in full force, even defending the rightness of Shrem's alleged illegal activities.  Many disparaged the law enforcement community for its double standard in indicting Shrem for relatively mild offences, in light of the government's toothless criminal case against convicted money launderers at Wall Street firms like HSBC.  [post-quote]  Others scoffed at the charges themselves, comparing money laundering to financial ""thought crime"" and defending the actual drug peddlers one-degree-removed from Shrem with assertions that individuals had the right to put whatever ""they want into their own bodies.""  As one commenter angrily noted, there seemed to be three degrees of separation between Shrem and any illegal activity associated with Silk Road.  Still, the intensity of the ideological debate paled in comparison to the practical one. Insiders fretted that Shrem's arrest might be a sign of things to come for others in the space.  Some felt that defending a high-profile member of the community was a necessary battle for the Bitcoin Foundation to wage in light of the fact that many of its members operated under the same lack of regulatory clarity.  If the Foundation refused to defend one of its highest profile members, the organization's value as an advocacy organization would be diminished. Any knee-jerk condemnations and collective hand-washing of all things Shrem would set a dangerous precedent, and weaken the community to additional ""witch hunts"".  Others, including myself, were quick to disagree. The Foundation represents the entire bitcoin community and as such, we felt it shouldn't embroil itself in a personal criminal matter. The longer the directors of the Foundation waited to sever ties with Shrem the more damage we felt would be done during bitcoin's high-profile week in front of regulators.  Bitcoin simply couldn't afford the bad press at a time when it was attempting to correct misconceptions about its utility as a black market currency. While no one wanted to see Shrem behind bars for 30 years, many wanted him suspended on a temporary basis at the very least.  The possible costs of having a potential felon maintain his seat on the Foundation's board overwhelmed the benefits of demonstrating a united front.  The Bitcoin Foundation (and Charlie) respond  The consensus from over a dozen members of the Bitcoin Foundation that I spoke to was that the easiest path for all involved would be an immediate resignation by Shrem.  The only question was whether that would even be feasible. How could he be expected to tender his resignation from behind bars when he had more pressing personal concerns?  The Foundation's directors recognized the gravity of the situation, but simply didn't have a contingency plan in place. Handling such a scenario hadn't ever been discussed, much less incorporated into the Foundation's bylaws. As one source told me: ""We were taken off guard just like everyone else. We just want to be thoughtful in our response.""  And so they waited.  By a stroke of good fortune (given the circumstances), Shrem made bail the next day and tendered his resignation within hours of his release. Contrary to some speculation, he was not forced out, but rather resigned on his own accord. In a private note to his supporters, he said:  ""I officially resigned from the foundation this morning within hours of being released. It's difficult resigning from something you started. When I sat with Gavin [Andresen] two years ago in Austria and presented my plan for a foundation, I told him the foundation needs to set the right precedents, always stay focused, and be an independent and strong organization. Given that, I felt if I stay on the board the foundation may lose focus and get dragged into a mess.""  Shrem's prompt and professional response was lauded by members of the Foundation, and cause for relief among the directors. Yet although the bleeding was staunched, the situation produced fresh debates.  How should similar situations be handled by the Foundation if they do occur? Was there a need for a second advocacy organization, which could provide the personal advocacy complement to the Bitcoin Foundation's regulatory focus? Who should ultimately replace Charlie Shrem as vice chairman?  These are just three of the tough questions that will be answered over the coming months.  It would be easy, but inaccurate, to characterize the flat-footed response of the Bitcoin Foundation as the result of under-preparation. Instead, the behind the scenes chaos of last week reflects the harsh reality that the bitcoin community must act decades older in preparation and maturity than would otherwise be expected of a five-year-old industry.  Bitcoin is in its lab rat phase of evolution, and yet it will be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny (or more) as century-old financial institutions. We can only hope that the Bitcoin Foundation and derivative advocacy groups are up for the challenge.  Because we've seen firsthand how the best laid schemes of mice and Shrem can quickly go awry.

42425397,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTVh,1391534101,Heartbeat-Sensing Wristband Doubles as Bitcoin Wallet,"Canadian wearable-tech startup Boinym has launched a biometric bitcoin wallet that relies on its Nymi smart wristbandhttp://www.getnymi.com/ for authentication.  The Nymi wristband has a clever way of confirming the user’s identity: it scans the wearer’s heartwave using an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and matches its pattern to the one stored in its database. This offers ’always on' authentication, as it doesn’t require any input from the user, and should function for as long as the user has a pulse.  Bionym released the Nymi software development kit (SDK) last November and said at the time that it already had in excess of 7,000 pre-orders.  Tap to spend  The combination of a simple wallet and sustained authentication means that users can authenticate their private bitcoin key on the fly.  The wallet is physically stored on the Nymi, says Bionym’s Chief Cryptographer, Yevgeniy Vahlis, and thanks to its multi-factor authentication system, ensures secure bitcoin storage. All the user has to do to make a transaction is tap the wristband, no additional input is necessary.  It is also possible to back up the key on an offline device, just in case the user happens to lose the wristband.  Bionym’s President, Andrew D’Souza, points out that people who have heard about bitcoin tend to associate it with risks and the Nymi should address some of them. He also makes a bold claim:  “Every Nymi will ship with the most secure Bitcoin wallet – it could be the killer app.”  Incidentally, the wristband can also be used to do what smart wristbands do best – track your physical activity and integrate with fitness apps.  Seamless authentication  D’Souza says Bionym is looking at the bigger picture and working to develop seamless check-in procedures for hotels and airlines.  The ultimate goal, he says, is to do for personal identification what the iPhone did for phones. However, unlike the iPhone, Nymi is an open-source platform and could be used to add more applications without moderation from the manufacturer. In other words, if the concept takes off, it could be integrated with existing bitcoin wallets, as well as other services requiring secure authentication.  ECG readings are practically impossible to replicate and are unique, like fingerprints. This makes them an ideal biometric signal for authentication, unless you happen to wear a pacemaker, perhaps.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/02/04/heartbeat-sensing-wristband-doubles-as-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50e2b7a9a4e920b3e7b4ee1c2340e27866adcef4-1000x642.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425400,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTbh,1391527963,Real-Time Bitcoin Price Tag Hits the High Street,"For most brick-and-mortar bitcoin merchants, collecting payments is as simple as selecting a processor and advertising to the bitcoin community.  Pain points still persist though, most notably when it comes to converting fiat prices to bitcoin prices.  As our Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) illustrates daily, it's not the kind of task you want to handle with a chalkboard.  That's where BitTag aims to provide support. The brainchild of London-based hardware prototype designer Samuel Cox, BitTag attempts to solve this existing bitcoin pricing issue by automatically updating the price of bitcoin on its display using wireless technology.  Cox announced the launch of the project on 30th January via Twitter.    Have a look at my latest project, BitTag. A #Bitcoin price tag for retail shops: http://t.co/KMoJ1FLxB8 - pic.twitter.com/49isVGYOqd      — Samuel Cox (@SamuelCox) January 30, 2014    The release marks the first time that a device has been dedicated to in-store bitcoin pricing, and could improve on the paper QR codes favoured by many merchants in the established ecosystem.  ""If the bitcoin value suddenly fluctuates, the price on BitTag will instantly reflect this. The customer, therefore, instantly knows how much the item is worth, whilst the retailer does not incur any financial loss if the value of the bitcoin changes,"" the company's website reads.  To assist customers further, the price can be displayed in BTC as well as local currencies. In addition, buying is straightforward: to make a purchase, customers simply shake the BitTag.  This motion will enable a QR code to display on the screen, which can then be scanned with the customer's smartphone app.  Design  Like an increasing amount of in-store merchant tools, BitTags rely on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology, which allows devices to wirelessly communicate.  BLE is perhaps most notably a major component of Apple's iBeacon device, a relatively new release that allows merchants to send push notifications and custom deals to in-store shoppers.  The BitTag also features a microprocessor, OLED display and a rechargeable LiPo battery. However, no details were given on how long a BitTag can operate between charges.  In-store management  Merchants manage their BitTags through an accompanying iPad app. The app is used to set up the BitTags, and can process transactions when the device is placed against its screen, as shown below.  The BitTag prototype costs £40, though Cox has stated that the product's final price will be ""far less than that"".  This means, for now at least, the tag's appeal may be limited. Cox acknowledged this point in an interview with BBC news, saying that the product is more likely to appear in ""quirky"" shops than mainstream outlets.

42425394,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwTNh,1391520237,Marc Andreessen Predicts Bitcoin Will Change Chip Design Forever,"Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen believes digital currencies could change the way processors are designed.  Andreessen  doesn’t exactly need an introduction. An avid bitcoin advocate, he tends to be quite outspoken – putting his money where his mouth is through investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.  Turning data centres into mining rigs  Speaking at the Open Compute Summit last week, Andreessen said that mining is at the heart of bitcoin, as it handles all computation needed to maintain the trust network, reports TechWeek Europe. He added:  “The press reports on mining as a waste of time, but in reality it’s all the proof of work computation that makes a distributed trust network work.”  Andreessen added that cryptocurrency mining is a “very big thing” and that we are still in the very early stages of it. This is where Andreessen sees an opportunity for chipmakers.  Custom mining chips are nothing new, but few people expected the rise of ASICs to transform the mining scene in such a short time. Andreessen believes custom chips will dominate mining for quite a while, but things could take another unexpected turn.  Andreessen told the gathering that his company has already received pitches for bitcoin optimised data centres. However, it is unclear what such pitches would entail in terms of hardware.  Using standardised server racks to add a bit of mining power to existing data centres is one option, as it would essentially add a few ASICs to a huge data centre.  Another farfetched scenario would be the emergence of custom chips that can deal with standard workloads and mining. In theory, this could be done by adding specialized circuits to x86- or ARM-based server parts, but it is simply not practical for the time being, either on-die or in the same chip package.  Opportunities and pitfalls  Although Andreessen is rather optimistic, there are quite a few problems with bitcoin mining hardware that may keep it out of data centres for a while. Economies of scale are the most obvious challenge, the sheer pace of development is another.  Using existing infrastructure for mining is a tantalizing prospect, but with huge performance gains offered by every new generation of ASICs, deploying bitcoin mining hardware in a server setting would be a rather risky investment.  Once the hardware goes out of date, it would practically become a useless drain. Chipmakers go to great lengths to shave off a few watts from their server processors and to increase their life cycle by making them future proof, thus reducing the total cost of ownership. Adding bitcoin mining features to them could have the exact opposite effect.  In addition, the market for bitcoin mining hardware remains limited. Wedbush Securities estimates that the total market for bitcoin mining hardware stood at $200m in 2013.  It isn't a small market, until you compare it to overall semiconductor sales. To put things into perspective, Gartner puts the revenue generated in the server space in 2013 at more than $12bn a quarter.

42422927,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymZh,1391511507,eBay Views BitPay and Coinbase as Potential PayPal Competitors,"According to its latest annual regulatory filing, eBay views bitcoin platforms as potential competitors to PayPal.  Annual reports filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rarely make for compelling reading, but the latest report filed by eBay is a bit different.  The company’s 10-K is bland, but the section on PayPal might cause some buzz in the bitcoin community. In the report eBay outlines the scope and operation of PayPal, and it goes on to itemize competitive challenges faced by the service.  Such challengers include: providers of digital wallets, payment card processors, Amazon payments, providers of mobile payment services and card readers for mobile devices, as well as omni-channel POS (point of sale) solutions.  In addition, PayPal faces competition and potential competition for money remitters, bill payment services, issuers of stored value targeted at online payments, providers of online account-based payments, various payment services and digital currencies.  Merchant services  BitPay and Coinbase are named as examples of “services that help merchants accept and manage digital currencies such as bitcoin.”  Of course, this does not necessarily mean that eBay views bitcoin as a serious threat or a disruptor, but it’s no longer under the radar.  PayPal is in a different league altogether. It boasts more than a quarter of a billion accounts (including inactive ones) and it supports 26 currencies worldwide.  The value of transactions carried out on PayPal easily dwarfs the market cap of bitcoin on its best day.  In spite of that, it is easy to see why eBay would list digital currencies as potential competitors. PayPal transaction fees are roughly 2%, but they are somewhat lower for high-volume merchants.  The company has taken steps to reduce fees for micropayments, but PayPal defines all transactions of $12 or less as 'micropayments'. Much smaller transactions (ie less than $1) remain impractical.  Digital currencies can offer affordable microypaments, even under the $1 threshold, which could potentially render them attractive for various content providers.  A recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers described paywalls as the “logical first choice” for bitcoin deployment and as similar approach could be used for in-app purchases, online gambling and just about any industry that would benefit from cheap micropayments.

Last month a number of sites and forums published a set of amendments put before Russian lawmakers, wrongly implying that Russia could move to ban digital currencies altogether. Last week the Bank of Russia issued a statement saying that the issuance of alternative currencies in the Russian Federation is prohibited.  In both cases the statements were misinterpreted in some circles of the bitcoin community, either through ignorance or intentionally. In fact, the proposed amendments and the latest Bank of Russia statements did not bring anything new, they merely reiterated existing laws. However, they did generate plenty of concerns.  The price of bitcoin on BTC-e showed a correction of about $10 last night when the news came to light, but it has since rebounded and is currently trading just above the $800 mark.  BTC-e was right not to be concerned  Shortly after the 'hoax' was published at the Prosecutor’s Office of the Volgograd website, BTC-e moved to reassure investors, saying that it was not concerned by the statement, as the exchange is not headquartered in Russia and does not have any offices in the country, nor does it work with Russian banks. In other words, even if there was an investigation, Russian prosecutors would have a tough time proving that they have jurisdiction over the matter.  BTC-e told CoinDesk on Monday that it was not worried by any potential actions by Russian authorities.  Anonymity  Although from its Google search description, BTC-e appears to be headquartered in Bulgaria, it uses Czech banks and the managing company is in fact based in Cyprus. Its founders are not Russian citizens and they prefer to remain anonymous, although they revealed their first names recently.  So why don’t BTC-e founders Aleksey and Alexander simply reveal their identities and put an end to speculation? They insist they are running a legitimate operation and at the moment it seems that anonymity is hurting their cause rather than helping it.  There might be a down-to-earth explanation though, but we can only speculate. It is one thing for a couple of young coders to make a heap of cash in the West, but in some parts of the world going public could simply paint a big bullseye on them. Organized crime syndicates are known to target (and recruit) coders and hackers in many Eastern European countries, including Russia and Bulgaria.  For example, the Bulgarian “Mutra” has a tradition of doing just that. The country has the unflattering distinction of being the world leader in ATM skimming devices and it has plenty of cyber gangs willing to offer their services to the highest bidder – and they usually go after foreign targets. What’s more, most hacking charges simply don’t stick and authorities have a hard time prosecuting cyber criminals.  With that in mind, it is not easy to blame the BTC-e founders for wishing to keep their names out of the news.

42425369,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOnh,1391486222,Senator: Government Report Shows US Not Lagging on Bitcoin,"Bitcoin advocates may lambast the US government for being slow to clarify its position on bitcoin, but Senator Tom Carper doesn't think it's all that bad. The chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released a report today exploring the legal status of virtual currencies in 40 countries. The findings? Most countries are still fumbling their way towards clarity, if they're bothering at all.  “This report has some good news – namely that the United States may not be as far behind the curve on virtual currencies as some have argued,” Carper said. “In fact, the United States might be leading the way for a number of nations when it comes to addressing this growing technology.""  One notable thing stands out about the report, written by the Law Library of Congress. That there are a lot of governments that haven't regulated bitcoin yet, but who are nevertheless grumbling about it. These include France, the EU, and Estonia.  The Dutch National Bank, Turkey, and Taiwan have warned of the risks associated with virtual currencies, and Portugal, while also keeping its hands off of bitcoin, nevertheless called digital currencies in this class ""unsafe"".  [post-quote]  The Russian Federation said that there may be a need to regulate virtual currencies globally in the near future. But perhaps the strongest warning came from India, which while not explicitly regulating bitcoin made an official anti-virtual currency statement strongly-worded enough that it caused the country's biggest exchange to shut down.  The report lists each country's current stance on bitcoin, but these break down into three broad categories: those who are actively regulating virtual currencies, those who have declared, officially or unofficially, an interest in taxing it, and those who haven't issued any regulation or tax guidance yet.  Active regulators  Among those actively regulating digital currencies, according to the report, are Brazil, and China, the latter which stopped financial institutions buying, selling, or pricing services in bitcoin, and from providing bitcoin-related services.  Iceland forbids bitcoin from being traded in foreign exchange. Thailand was said to have issued a statement saying that bitcoin was illegal, the report suggests, but adds that the ruling was preliminary, and that bitcoin exchanges there are running.  Taxation policies  Those not actively regulating or forbidding bitcoin use, but who are nevertheless moving in the direction of taxation, include Australia, which is warning people to keep good records, and Canada, which has said that bitcoin is subject to the same taxation rules as bartered goods.  Other countries at various stages along the tax route include Finland, Israel (which wants to tax it, but isn't sure how yet), and now Singapore, says the report.  Slovenia will tax bitcoin on a per-case basis, depending on the type of income, and the UK recently issued a note saying that bitcoin would be treated as single-purpose vouchers, meaning a value-added tax of 10-20%, the report said.  Waiting and seeing  Then, there are the countries that have next-to-no position on bitcoin. Notable among these are Germany, the EU's major economic engine, which sees virtual currencies as legally binding financial instruments known as units of account that don't need licensing, the report says. Germany makes bitcoin-based capital gains exempt after a year.  Italy doesn't regulate virtual currencies for individual use, but the use of electronic currency is limited to institutions registered with the central bank there.  Argentina doesn't recognize the currency as legal tender, but the report points out that the country's citizenry are using it anyway, to get around controls on foreign currencies.  Others that have taken little-to-no action on bitcoin yet include Japan, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and Spain. South Korea is also keeping its powder dry on regulation, but may impose laws on virtual currencies in the future, the report added.  Carper may be bullish about the USA's global positioning on bitcoin regulation, but that still doesn't explain why the top eight exchanges by volume are non-domestic. Only Kraken makes it onto the chart.  And then, there's the tax issue, which is particularly important for encouraging bitcoin adoption by businesses. Carper acknowledges the need for work here, acknowledging that the IRS has not yet delivered clear guidance.  ""This report shows that other countries have addressed how virtual currencies are taxed, and I urge the Internal Revenue to glean the findings from this survey to help determine its own treatment of virtual currencies,"" he said.  ""Our Committee will also continue to work closely with the Internal Revenue Service to get greater clarity as to their timelines and thought processes on dealing with the potential tax vulnerabilities of digital currencies,"" Carper added.

42425387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPHh,1391473277,"200,000 Hotels Now Accept Bitcoin Through Online Travel Agency CheapAir","California-based travel agency CheapAir.com has announced that it is expanding its service to allow bitcoin users to book hotel stays with the cryptocurrency.      CheapAir has been accepting bitcoin for flight bookings since November when it partnered with Coinbase, however until today, users have not been able to pay in bitcoin for its extensive hotel inventory.      Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO and founder Jeff Klee voiced his enthusiasm for becoming the ""first company in the US"" to allow bitcoin users to book hotel stays with the virtual currency:      ""Bitcoin gets a bad rap in mainstream media. What I found is that the people who use bitcoin are great, they're passionate and they're looking to solve a lot of the problems inherent in the economic system and the world.""              The news garnered a largely positive reaction on reddit and the BitcoinTalk forum, with ambitious bitcoin users even suggesting they would pass the news along to other travel companies that have expressed a cautious interest in bitcoin.    Better-than-expected return    [post-quote]Klee indicates that the decision to expand its program to include hotels was due to a ""better than anticipated"" response from the community after it began accepting bitcoin payment for flights.      ""We had no idea what to expect, however, it generated a nice enthusiasm,"" Klee recounts.      Klee did not share specific numbers, but did say that bitcoin customers are more likely to become loyal than traditional customers, and that his company receives ""a nice volume of emails from bitcoin customers"". Still, despite these benefits, he won't call bitcoin a game-changer for CheapAir just yet, though he thinks CheapAir's position could change as the currency gains more loyal users.    How CheapAir pays hotels    For CheapAir, paying hotels and flight providers is still a challenge, but one they find worthwhile given the currency's dedicated customers and engaged base. Klee noted that in order to process transactions, CheapAir must accept the bitcoin and exchange it for fiat currency before paying hotels. This means certain hotels, those that require patrons to pay at checkout, will still be off limits to bitcoin customers.      Klee notes that ""once in a while you'll see a hotel on our site that won't have a bitcoin logo by it"", but that the majority of properties on the site will see the bitcoin logo clearly displayed on its listings.    CheapAir's next stop    Klee noted that CheapAir is not specifically seeking out partnerships with the bitcoin-accepting hotels that are increasingly popping up near major destinations. But, the CEO didn't exactly close the door on the possibility, noting ""We're open to anything"". He did mention, though, that this could mean eventually broadening its bitcoin acceptance yet again.      Klee suggested that CheapAir is looking to add cruises to its catalog of hotels and flights, but that the company is ""pretty far away"" from implementing these new offerings at present.
