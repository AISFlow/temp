42434548,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPE3Ph,1623368389,Texas State Regulator Greenlights Banks to Custody Crypto,"State-chartered banks in Texas have been given the green light to custody crypto assets on behalf of their customers, a state regulator announced Thursday.      The guidance is not representative of new law, but an affirmation that state-chartered banks are allowed to provide crypto custody services as long as there are adequate protocols in place and the banks are complying with existing legal frameworks, according to a June 10 notice posted on the Texas Department of Banking’s website.      According to the notice, the types of custody services offered by state-chartered banks may differ depending on each bank’s expertise, risk appetite and business model. Banks may offer either fiduciary and non-fiduciary custody services, which could range from safely storing copies of a customer’s private keys to directly controlling crypto assets, including holding private keys, on behalf of its customers.      The Texas Department of Banking’s notice comes amid a booming presence from the crypto industry in Texas. Miners and crypto startups have been moving to Texas in record numbers to take advantage of the state’s relatively cheap energy and crypto-friendly regulatory environment.      Texas lawmakers, including Governor Greg Abbott, now must provide legal clarity to crypto companies and investors in the state.      The regulator’s notice looks much like the guidance published for federal banks by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last July. However, according to Marcus Adams, assistant general counsel at the Texas Department of Banking, the state is not taking its crypto guidance from the federal government, but making decisions based on the growing popularity of crypto in Texas.      “Both at the state and federal regulatory agencies, we’re seeing a rise in the virtual currency industry as it continues to evolve,” Marcus said. “We expect our banks to start seeing demand from their customers and we want them to be prepared for that.”      ”The point of the notice is to make it clear to banks that under the existing law, they can provide these services,” Marcus said. “How soon we see Texas state-chartered banks actually start offering these and get these products and services in place is really dependent on the individual banks and what kind of resources they have available.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/10/texas-state-regulator-greenlights-banks-to-custody-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de8835eaead6647e9a67866de34fde131f9f1049-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an emailed investor bulletin obtained by CoinDesk, staffers “urge investors considering a fund with exposure to the bitcoin futures market to weigh carefully the potential risks and benefits of the investment,” the note said, warning investors that the cryptocurrency as an investment is “highly speculative.”      This is the second recent warning the SEC has sent out in regards to bitcoin’s risk. Last month, it sent out a note to investors highlighting that it may not be safe yet to support an exchange-traded fund under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 because of Bitcoin’s volatility.      Most bitcoin ETF applications are filed under a different law, the Securities Act of 1933, due to differences in how these laws treat such applications. The SEC has long warned against filing bitcoin products under the 1940 Act.      This warning comes at a time when large traditional banks and investment funds increasingly announce their interest in cryptocurrencies, both personal and corporate. In March, investment bank Morgan Stanley started offering clients access to bitcoin funds and in May Wells Fargo announced it would introduce a cryptocurrency fund.

Speaking at an online news briefing on Thursday, Rakiya Mohammed, an information technology specialist at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said that the entity had been exploring a possible CBDC for over two years, according to local media reports.      “Before the end of the year, the central bank will be making [a] special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,” Mohammed was quoted in Today, a local news outlet.

Earlier this year, the CBN ordered all local banks to seek and shut down accounts tied to crypto platforms, although the governor of the bank later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.      Meanwhile, cryptocurrency usage as a store of value and remittance tool is soaring in Nigeria, with Ray Youssef, the CEO of peer-to-peer lending platform Paxful saying last week that the African nation is its biggest market.

Analysts call it a “fear of missing out,” or FOMO, as traders rotate from one hot market to the next.      “We continue to see the rotation out of crypto and back into stocks favored by the Reddit crowd,” Lev Borodovsky, editor of the The Daily Shot newsletter, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""I’ve noticed this connection a couple months ago.""      With bitcoin under pressure lately, meme stocks are catching a bid. Stocks such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC), BlackBerry (NYSE: BB), GameStop (NYSE: GME) and even Wendy’s (NASDAQ: WEN) have rallied strongly over the past month.      Borodovsky uses an equal-weight basket of seven popular meme stocks overlayed with the price of bitcoin. His chart demonstrates the occasional rotation over the past few months.      “Meme stocks are rising beyond their reasonable valuations based solely on the retail enthusiasm of investors who are often in it more for the lulz than to make a buck,” wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, in a newsletter published Wednesday.      More than 63% of all new trades executed by U.K. traders between May 23 and June 2 involved financial derivatives linked to shares of AMC, according to David Jones, market strategist at Capital.com, a European trading and investing platform.      “The volatility is really off the charts and chances are, a little like the cryptocurrency rout in May, when the price turns, then a lot of fingers will get burnt,” Jones wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

42406552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5bC,1623356895,Market Wrap: Bullish Basel News Causes BTC Jump to Week-High $38K Level; ETH Slips,"Bitcoin has returned to the spotlight on positive cryptocurrency banking news out of Europe. Ether’s shine is diminishing a bit Thursday based on some volume, volatility and options data.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $36,732 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Up 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,250-$38,200 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,465 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 3.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,462-$2,617 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin over $38K, then loses momentum    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday by 1% as of press time. The price was below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.      The price of bitcoin climbed from $36,304 at 09:15 UTC (5:15 a.m. ET) to $38,200 by 10:45 UTC (6:45 a.m. ET), a 5.2% gain in less than two hours based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then lost steam, down to $36,732 as of press time.      One factor that may have had an impact on bitcoin’s briefly surging price: The Bank for International Settlements' Basel Committee, a European regulatory agency, attempting to place much-needed rules Thursday around banks being allowed to hold various cryptocurrencies.      The last time BTC was able to get over the $38,000 level was on June 3.      It is possible BTC prices are currently more beholden to big balance holders, known as whales, than retail activity, at least according to one trader.      “Whales are causing waves that right now seem to counter the breakouts bitcoin has seemed to attempt for weeks now,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader.    Bitcoin gyrations up, but nothing like ETH    From Tuesday to Wednesday, bitcoin’s annualized 30-day volatility increased by eight percentage points to 97%. That may seem significant, but ether tops the list of 10 major crypto assets tracked by CoinDesk, with a volatility reading of about 162%.      “The market seems to have settled somewhere in between downside fear and a wait and see approach,” the quant trading firm QCP said in a recent investor note. “Retail volumes have thinned out and movements from whales are dominating the price action.”      Ether’s sky-high volatility is caused by its recent higher volumes than bitcoin, at least according to one analyst.      “The extreme volatility drove ETH to have higher volumes than BTC,” said Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR. “Now that there is less leverage in the system, I see BTC volumes outpacing ETH for the next few weeks, as BTC's larger market cap plays a bigger role"" than volume.    Bitcoin volume beats ether for once    On Wednesday, ETH volumes exceeded those for BTC, a reversal from the recent trend. Prior to Wednesday, when $53 billion BTC changed hands compared with ETH’s $43 billion traded, ether had an 11-day run of more volume than its larger rival.      Kugelberg, the over-the-counter trader, thinks BTC may be due for a return to the spotlight.      “ETH is, of course, enormously important and always seems to go three times the length of any bitcoin bull run,” Kugelberg said. “Bitcoin is building for another run, as I see it, and that is always starting with a rise in volume. El Salvador [and its plan to make bitcoin legal tender] may well be the igniting thing here.”      Read More: Volcano-Powered Mining Goes From Twitter to State Policy in El Salvador    Ether bearish?    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,465 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining 3.8% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish indicator for market technicians.      Ether went from $2,600 at 10:30 UTC (6:30 a.m. ET) to $2,451 by 05:30 UTC (1:30 p.m. ET) Thursday, a 5.7% tumble based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has slightly trended upward a bit since, at $2,465 as of press time.      Ether’s drop in volume and in price recently certainly has exuded some bearishness for the asset. In addition, the options market is forecasting more ether price exhaustion, according to data aggregator Skew.      Probabilities for ETH spot price at July 21 expiration based on options orientation expects a 44% chance of ether over $2,400, at 31% possibility over $2,800, and only a 21% expectation of spot ether over $3,200 by that time.      Some long-term crypto traders sense fundamental bearishness with ether because the asset is reliant on a lot of unknowns in a complex Ethereum ecosystem to remain successful.      “I have stupidly not gotten into ether since I very early on felt that the governance issues and from time-to-time extreme gas prices would not be competitive in the long run,” noted crypto trader Kugelberg.      Ethereum’s gas prices, or fees for using the network, have actually hit a three-month low this week.

42406550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5ZE,1623356844,"Gold Tokens Take Off as Inflation Accelerates, Bitcoin Retreats","As bitcoin loses some of its luster as “digital gold,” some cryptocurrency investors are apparently seeing value in tokens backed by the physical version of the yellow metal.      According to data compiled by Arcane Research, the total market capitalization of gold-backed tokens has grown 30-fold since the start of 2020, reflecting a surge in demand.      In particular, pax gold (PAXG), a token launched in September 2019 by the New York-based stablecoin issuer Paxos under the Ethereum blockchain’s ERC-20 standard, has seen steep growth in recent months. Its market capitalization has surpassed that of tether gold (XAUT), another gold-backed cryptocurrency from Tether, the dominant stablecoin issuer.      Tether gold made its debut in January 2020, and the two gold-backed stablecoins were in a close race until May – around the time when pax gold was listed on India-based exchange Wazirx, which is a unit of the giant cryptocurrency exchange Binance.      “India is home to the world’s largest retail gold,” Arcane Research said. “This could be the major explanation for the growing demand for pax gold.”      But according to Carl Vogel, senior product manager at Paxos, the recent success of pax gold is due to rising demand from investors and traders looking to hedge risks from both rising inflation and the highly volatile crypto market.      The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday that consumer prices in the U.S. rose about 5% in the 12 months through May, the fastest pace since August 2008, as the economy reopens from coronavirus-related restrictions, and as stimulus money continues to make its way into consumer purchases and financial markets.      Many investors have put money into bitcoin over the past year on the belief that it could serve as an inflation hedge, a type of ""digital gold"" as it were. But bitcoin’s price has tumbled in the past couple of months, changing hands at $36,525 as of press time, well off the all-time high near $65,000 reached in April.      Gold futures have climbed about 4% over the past month, and currently trade at about $1,896 an ounce.      “If you are an institutional money manager, when the market starts to become volatile and the crypto market starts to become volatile, you may need to allocate your portfolio to compensate for that to make sure you are meeting your certain risk thresholds,” Vogel said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Therefore, gold tends to be, in very volatile times, a very natural and great asset class to go ahead and diversify into.”      Binance accounts for most of the trading volume of PAXG, according to data from CoinGecko.      Paxos and Tether alike said they were seeing growing demand from institutional investors for the gold-backed stablecoins.      In the past six months, according to Vogel, there have been more institutional investors who are buying Pax Gold directly from Paxos for “large order sizes.”      “Tether gold may appeal to institutional investors in the digital token space that want exposure to gold,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. “People may prefer the digital version of physical gold instead of the physical gold itself because of its portability.”      Both PAXG and XAUT claim to be backed by one fine troy ounce of a 400-ounce London Good Delivery gold bar. The gold backing each PAXG is stored in Brink’s vaults, and yet Tether said the underlying gold for XAUT is stored in an unnamed Swiss vault.      Tether gold is also issued on the Tron blockchain as a TRC20 token.      Tether’s U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin, USDT, is the most popular and successful stablecoin in the world despite its lack of transparency in almost everything.      It makes sense that some cryptocurrency investors might seek to readjust their portfolios and increase their exposure to gold, said Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane Research.      “Gold-backed tokens are very convenient tools for investors who want to be invested in crypto and gold,” Lunde said. “The gold tokens are listed on some of the most liquid market places in crypto,” including Binance as well as rival exchanges like FTX, Bitfinex and Kraken, he noted.",NEUTRAL,USDT | XAUT,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | USDT | XAUT,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/10/gold-tokens-take-off-as-inflation-accelerates-bitcoin-retreats,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6c8a3c5b293ceef124bc6153b87ac74835e2dd4-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5UJ,1623356718,Republican Senator Asks FinCEN to Reconsider Controversial Crypto Rule,"Proposed U.S. regulation around cryptocurrencies might be counterproductive, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said Thursday.      A proposed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) counterparty rule would impose a heavy burden on cryptocurrency firms but may not actually combat illicit activity, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.      He also described draft Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance as “concerning,"" noting it contradicted existing FinCEN guidance.      “Cryptocurrencies stand to dramatically improve consumers’ privacy, access to financial services, and power to make decisions for themselves,” the letter said. “Some have argued that cryptocurrency is a technology that could be as revolutionary as the internet.”      A FinCEN spokesperson said the agency does not comment on open rulemakings, noting the regulator has already extended the comment period twice.      ""We appreciate Sen. Toomey’s recognition of 'existing FinCEN guidance, which has successfully provided regulatory clarity in the United States,'"" the spokesperson said.      The statement comes a day after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) railed against bitcoin as a potential tool for criminals that also carries environmental and consumer-protection issues.    Read more: Civil Liberties Group Calls FinCEN Crypto Wallet Rule ‘Unconstitutional’    The controversial FinCEN rule was proposed by Yellen’s predecessor, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in the waning days of the Donald Trump presidency. Under its provisions, any crypto exchanges or financial institutions would be required to keep name and physical address information for transactions above $3,000, and file reports for transactions above $10,000.      Opponents to the rule say this could impact decentralized finance (DeFi) products, as many smart contracts that store funds do not require names or addresses. DeFi aside, simply maintaining excess records beyond typical know-your-customer (KYC) requirements may prove a burden to smaller exchanges. A public comment period was extended immediately before Trump left office, and again after current President Joe Biden took over, but the actual proposal is still pending.      “While I recognize that FinCEN and FATF’s proposals are seeking to address the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activity, if adopted, they would have a detrimental impact on financial technology (‘fintech’), the fundamental privacy of Americans, and efforts to combat illicit activity,” Toomey wrote. “I urge you to make significant revisions to them.”      Malicious actors may find it easier to act outside the regulated financial sector should these rules be implemented, Toomey argued.    Read more: DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF’s Guidance Would Stifle Growth    FATF’s proposed guidance, which would also impose reporting requirements on DeFi, could likewise harm the sector by imposing “onerous recordkeeping requirements” that don’t apply to the U.S. dollar, the senator wrote.    FinCEN rules    Beyond the burdens on the crypto sector, Toomey suggested FinCEN look at modernizing currency reporting requirements placed around the dollar. The reporting requirements around U.S. dollar transactions are 40 years old and based on thresholds from the time they were implemented.      Law enforcement officials can more effectively track funds and analyze suspicious activity today, the lawmaker said.      Crypto is included in this bucket: Toomey pointed out that the FBI was recently able to recover much of the crypto paid by Colonial Pipeline in a ransomware attack.      “Instead of seeking to impose onerous regulatory requirements on cryptocurrencies, FinCEN should collaborate with stakeholders and analytics firms to understand what existing and emerging capabilities exist for identifying illicit cryptocurrency activity,” he wrote.

42406534,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5IV,1623355293,Okcoin Awards $100K Grant to Bitcoin Development Non-Profit Brink,"Cryptocurrency exchange Okcoin is continuing its rash of grants to support the open-source development of the Bitcoin protocol.      Announced Thursday, the exchange has awarded a $100,000 grant to Brink for the non-profit organization to continue funding Bitcoin developers and researchers.      Brink’s first round of grants allowed developers to work full time on projects ranging from the security and privacy of second layer protocols to overall Bitcoin Core coding and code review.      Bitcoin, a network that captures $685 billion in value, only has around 30 full-time core developers, whereas more traditional tech firms have thousands.      As Bitcoin continues to scale, grants such as these help more developers work on ensuring the protocol can handle the challenges ahead.    Read more: Kraken’s First Brink Grant Goes to Bitcoin Rust Developer    Brink supports newer developers through fellowships as well as more mature ecosystem developers through grants.      Last week, Okcoin awarded João Barbosa, a highly respected code reviewer in the industry, with a grant for an undisclosed amount. His work helps with the overall privacy and security of the protocol.      Barbosa had previously returned a grant awarded to him by Coinbase, citing personal reasons.      “We partnered with Brink because as well as sponsoring individual developers with specific roadmaps in the last year, Brink is growing the Bitcoin Core developer ecosystem: mentorship, education, connecting and collaborating with peers,” Okcoin CEO Hong Fang said in an email. “Brink allows us to extend the reach of our grants, while we work with individual devs whose work we support.”      As for Barbosa, Fang said the grant was to support the development of Bitcoin Core’s user experience on mobile.      Barbosa said it makes sense to contribute to support on mobile devices given that mobile usage has been increasing steadily compared to desktop computers.      “People tend to judge software by its look, and the existing GUI is pretty much outdated,” he said in the post. “With better UX, we can push people to run their own Bitcoin node from their pockets. This is especially relevant for people who can’t access a desktop computer.”      Brink co-founder Mike Schmidt said Brink is grateful for the generous contribution from Okcoin.      “We have recently closed submissions for our latest round of grants and will be evaluating applications and announcing grants soon,” he said in an email to CoinDesk. “We are excited for this next round of grants and will be funding impactful developers similar to our first round of grants.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/10/okcoin-awards-100k-grant-to-bitcoin-development-non-profit-brink,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42406542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5TK,1623354066,A Big Carbon Footprint Compared to What?,"One often discussed topic lately has been the carbon footprint of blockchain ecosystems. Proof-of-work systems are enormously successful in securing transactions and preventing fraud and collusion, but they consume an enormous amount of energy. Current estimates are that a single bitcoin transaction has a carbon footprint of over 350 kilograms (772 pounds) and a single Ethereum transaction consumes about 39 kg.      Compared to centralized transaction processing systems, these are hundreds of times less efficient. The same carbon footprint for a single Ethereum transaction would power more than 80,000 transactions on a centralized credit card payment network. If the desire is to replace all banking systems and small payments with blockchains, we are in trouble. That would be true even after a shift to proof of stake, which is thought to be 99% more efficient. In my view, it is unlikely that blockchains will replace most banking and credit card transactions today. As a result, the comparisons in carbon footprint don’t make sense either. As I have previously argued, blockchain transactions offer no benefits and many costs compared with most simple consumer transactions – or even many smaller enterprise transactions, like payroll.    Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.    Where blockchain-based transactions have a compelling advantage over alternatives is when they are put in the context of the total carbon required for a complex multi-party transaction that’s part of a larger business process. In these scenarios, the alternative isn’t an efficient credit card transaction, it’s the cost and complexity of having a human being in the loop – and the carbon-cost of the working time involved.      The best example I have is a typical business purchase order. There are many estimates out there, but on average, it seems that large enterprises typically spend between $50 and $100 to raise a single purchase order or pay an invoice. Almost none of this is related to the information technology cost. Instead, the big driver is the cost of human time required to verify that the purchase order or invoice complied with the company’s rules for payments and any existing contracts. In other words: we’re talking about labor here. At current average rates in professional and business services, we’re talking about one to two hours of work.      The real comparison, then, isn’t between an Ethereum transaction and a credit card transaction, it’s between an Ethereum transaction and an hour of labor. In the U.S., a typical employee (using California data from Buffer.com) requires about 4,000 kg carbon to cover the office space and commute each year. Spreading that across 2,000 working hours (I’m rounding up and down to keep the math simple.) means we can assign about 2 kg of carbon to each working hour here in the Golden State.    Read more: Paul Brody: The Future of Everything Is Free          All of this is, for the most part, highly speculative. Estimates of carbon footprints are built on SWAGs (Scientific Wild-*** Guess), multiplied together and scaled up. Errors and incorrect assumptions get magnified in these types of projections, which can lead to results that are very far off from reality. Big questions, like the amount of energy in the mix that is renewable, are not easy to answer because they are so variable and few authoritative data sources. A shift to more renewable energy will further reduce the footprint of these systems.      The bottom line is that it is impossible to give a precise answer, but what this little thought exercise does show, is that just comparing one transaction to another by system isn’t useful. You cannot compare a business purchase order with shared rules and multiple participants to a credit card transaction.      Trustworthy data is costly — from a human time or computation standpoint. We can use blockchain technology to reduce the carbon footprint of our industrial world while eliminating operational complexity and redundant human work.

Whether it be YouTube’s recommendation algorithm or Spotify’s weekly playlist offerings, these systems often rely heavily on tracking your behavior online – meaning, essentially, gathering and analyzing your data.      Brave Today allows users to “anonymously subscribe to RSS feeds of their favorite news outlets and stay up to date with all the latest news in a single place.” Users are able to choose from 15 different categories of curated sources and then customize their stream further by adding or removing them (including CoinDesk).      “Starting with on-device recommendation for Brave Today, we want to start offering Brave users a level of personalization powered by models that are trained locally, all while keeping user privacy our first priority,” said Pete Snyder, senior privacy researcher at Brave.    Tracking without the ick factor    To avoid collecting users behavior data in the service of recommendations, Brave is proposing “a new framework for making on-device privacy-preserving recommendations that doesn’t require user interaction data to be collected on a server.”      Brave is using a technique it calls “Federated Learning With Privacy.”      Federated learning is a machine-learning technique that trains prediction models (algorithms) while keeping data locally on devices, rather than feeding that data to a central server (whether that be on the premises of a company or in the cloud) that hosts the model.      “Users train local models on their private data and share only their local model updates with a central server,” said a blog post announcing the proposal. “The central server computes a global model as the aggregate of all local models and sends it back to the users, where the process repeats.”      Snyder said while typical federated learning systems have important implications and risks for user privacy, there is a large and active research community working to improve the privacy of federated learning systems, so that users can collaborate to improve the system’s accuracy, without revealing their private information and behaviors.      Privacy is quickly becoming something large tech firms value. Google, for example, has introduced and implemented a system called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), albeit with mixed results. Various browsers, such as Brave, have refused to adopt FLoC and, in fact, have disabled it in its browser.      Snyder said FLoC and federated learning are categorically different. FLoC is a privacy-harming behavioral advertising system proposed by Google and implemented in some Chromium-based browsers, he said.      “While the ‘FL’ in FLoC stands for ‘federated learning,’ this is now a palimpsest of Google’s original implementation plans for FLoC; FLoC doesn’t actually use any federated learning in current implementations,” Snyder said via email. “Google mentions this in their documentation too, where they note ‘no Federated Learning is used (despite the ‘FL’ in the name).”’    Next steps    Snyder said Brave’s ultimate goal is to improve the user experience on the Brave browser through federated private learning with the private on-device recommendation framework for Brave Today is merely the first step.      “We plan to get there gradually and in measurable steps. Our focus at the moment is building the federated learning infrastructure,” he said, adding:    “Once this is up and running, we are planning on testing it on smaller optimization problems that have practically no privacy cost. If our tests are successful, we can use our federated private learning framework to power user-facing features like Brave News, and optimize already existing ones, such as our local ads targeting machine learning.”",POSITIVE,없음,RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/10/brave-browsers-next-trick-privacy-preserving-news-recommendations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44c984afdb15469126c6d21d59fe3a65b9bc9306-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5aD,1623346527,Bitcoin Futures 'Backwardation' Points to Weak Institutional Demand: JPMorgan,"An unusual condition known as ""backwardation"" that has developed recently in the bitcoin futures market should be seen as a sign of weak demand for the cryptocurrency on the part of big institutional investors, JPMorgan wrote in a new report.      Bitcoin's recent price slide has prompted institutional investors to pull out of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, leading to the backwardation, which is when futures trade at a discount to the spot price. The condition is in contrast to the ""contango"" that's more often seen in commodities markets, where futures trade at a premium.      The JPMorgan report published Wednesday noted that the bitcoin futures backwardation has recently emerged. To wit, the 21-day rolling average spread between the futures contract expiring in two months and the spot price has now turned negative. It's the first time that's happened since 2018. The CME launched the bitcoin futures contract in late 2017.      ""This is an unusual development and a reflection of how weak bitcoin demand is at the moment from institutional investors that tend to use regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure to bitcoin,"" the JPMorgan analysts led by global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said.      Backwardation is often taken to represent demand outstripping supply in commodities markets, though as a caveat, the bitcoin futures market might be different because the cryptocurrency is, at least for now, mainly a speculative asset rather than a physical commodity like oil or pork bellies, analysts told CoinDesk last month.      The 21-day moving average of the second-month bitcoin futures spread over spot prices remained negative for most of 2018. The cryptocurrency witnessed a bearish trend throughout the year, falling from nearly $17,000 to $3,200.      The trend reversed higher after the CME futures switched back to contango in early 2019.      While bitcoin has stabilized in the $30,000 to $40,000 range over the past two weeks, the CME futures remain in backwardation. The JPMorgan analysts wrote that they would want to see futures flip back into contango before reversing their negative outlook.      The analysts also cited bitcoin's low share of the total crypto market capitalization as a bearish signal.      ""We had argued previously that the sharp decline in the bitcoin share during April/May from around 60% towards 40% was a bearish signal carrying some echoes of the retail-investor-driven froth of December 2017, when the share of bitcoin had fallen from around 55% to below 35%,"" the analysts wrote.      ""We believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us,"" they added.

42406543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5PO,1623340882,The Node: Warren Versus the Volcano,"In Senate hearings yesterday, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) inveighed against cryptocurrency, saying it had failed in its functional goals while enabling crime and harming the environment. The points about criminal use are tiresome and easily dismissible, especially just days after the FBI leveraged blockchain’s transparency to track ransom payments in the Colonial Pipeline hack. Criminals don’t particularly like to be tracked, which is why bitcoin is proportionally less utilized for crime than dollars (how the FBI then clawed back some of those ransom payments is a separate, more intriguing question).      But the environmental concerns about the Bitcoin system and proof-of-work mining can’t be dismissed quite as easily. Bitcoin really does use a lot of energy, by design. Even if you think that energy use is well worth it, the current reality of global warming means the future of humanity depends on eliminating greenhouse gases from the energy-production process.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    That, of course, applies to all energy use, not just Bitcoin, so on that level the critique is disproportionate. But proof-of-work crypto mining actually has a major and perhaps unique advantage in the quest for green energy. This was also on display yesterday as Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said his country, which has just adopted bitcoin as legal tender, would make it easy for miners to harness green geothermal energy from the country’s volcanos. (Mega-hat tip to Nic Carter, who hosted the discussion that birthed the idea.)      The move isn’t just significant because the energy source is renewable, but because much of that renewable energy is currently underutilized or “stranded.” Unlike nearly every valuable commodity on Earth, electricity is very hard to move over long distances. El Salvador’s geothermal plants are a sterling example – the country has a moribund economy thanks in part to decades of corruption leading up to Bukele’s presidency, and many of its power plants reportedly go underutilized. Bitcoin is a way to utilize this sort of hard-to-use energy, as has already been demonstrated with bitcoin mines powered by China’s underused hydroelectric plants and natural gas flaring in the U.S. and elsewhere.      All of this should be of extreme interest for those who believe in the promise of cryptocurrency, even if they care not a whit for the environment. That’s because, while Warren is likely sincere in her environmental critique, it is simultaneously a potential weapon for those who oppose cryptocurrency for unrelated reasons.      El Salvador’s official adoption of bitcoin is a particularly terrifying landmark for U.S. leaders who, it is increasingly clear, fear the displacement of the dollar as a global currency. That dominance provides a huge subsidy to the U.S. economy, what’s known as America’s “exorbitant privilege.” Its erosion could have grim domestic consequences. U.S. politicians have mostly downplayed that concern for years, arguably to avoid giving it legitimacy, but former U.S. President Donald Trump this week yet again said the quiet part loud when he declared “I don’t like [bitcoin] because it’s another currency competing against the dollar.”      With so much at stake, defenders of dollar hegemony will grasp at any straw available to undermine competitors. That’s why Bukele should convene with the miners organized by Elon Musk and Michael Saylor to establish international and independently-monitored standards for ""green"" bitcoin certification, an agenda I previously outlined here. Real progress towards greening bitcoin would be a good thing for the world – and it would take away a tool of misdirection from those who oppose it entirely out of geopolitical self-interest.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,David Z.

AAGF adds to a growing list of crypto funds now pumping over $500 million into cryptographer Slivio Micali’s proof-of-stake blockchain. The fund will help pay for investments ranging from non-fungible tokens to a partnership with Miami to use Algorand in municipal projects – all in an effort to accelerate the development of Algorand's ""ecosystem.""      “Our LPs (limited partners) include several parties who align with the Algorand vision and want to support the expanding ecosystem with new offerings,” Arrington said. “We may also bring on additional investors. Additionally, I am personally investing in the fund.”      Algorand, like other protocols, is eager to gain an edge in the lucrative decentralized finance (DeFi) arms race. Its 11 million addresses pale in comparison to sector leader Ethereum’s 157 million, but the blockchain is far more nimble, both in terms of transaction processing power and speed. Even so, Algorand lacks an established DeFi ecosystem that other chains enjoy.      However, that may start to change. Yieldly – a “no-loss lottery” (akin to PoolTogether) and Algorand’s first native DeFi application – has amassed over $11 million in total value locked (TVL) following its debut on Saturday. Keli Callaghan, Algorand's head of marketing, said the app, which launched with backing from the Algorand community fund, is already becoming a hit.      But the network is also courting opportunities on the more centralized side, Callaghan said. That includes projects that will allow financial institutions to use DeFi infrastructure and provide central banks with ways to transfer digital currencies.      “Our perspective is not that one is going to overtake the other, that one's going to win or make the other irrelevant, but they sort of converge,” she said. “We see ourselves as sort of helping with this bridge” between banks, firms and DeFi.      Arrington Capital may be best known in the cryptosphere for its XRP fund, which launched in late 2017 also with $100 million in capital. The firm has remained true to Ripple Labs’ embattled token even as other companies in the market flee.      “We are extremely loyal to Ripple and to XRP and we believe in that ecosystem,” Arrington said, “but it's a multichain world.”      As for how the XRP army will react: “I’m interested in the answer to that myself – we’ll see,"" he said.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | XRP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/10/arrington-capital-launches-100m-algorand-ecosystem-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f779e68bbe2a226900637443f4b3a903dbcdf1ae-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406537,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5MR,1623340075,Paraguay prepara un proyecto de ley para atraer empresas de criptomonedas,"El diputado paraguayo Carlos Rejala planea presentar en julio un proyecto de ley para atraer a ese país empresas mineras internacionales y otros negocios de criptomonedas.      El proyecto busca permitir que empresas de criptomonedas —ya sean de minería u otro segmento, como exchanges— financien sus operaciones paraguayas con criptomonedas, remitan dividendos al extranjero y capitalicen sus ganancias en criptomonedas en bancos locales, dijo Rejala a CoinDesk.    Read this article in English.    Rejala, un empresario de 36 años, descubrió el bitcoin (BTC, +10,94%) en 2017 y comenzó a operar en 2019, un año después de asumir como diputado por el partido independiente Hagamos, dijo.      El lunes, tras el anuncio de que El Salvador presentaría un proyecto de ley para permitir que el bitcoin fuera una moneda de curso legal, Rejala tuiteó una foto suya con ojos láser y una frase sobre el proyecto.      ""El anuncio me impulsó a no tener miedo y a pensar que esto puede ser real en mi país"", dijo.      El proyecto busca posicionar a Paraguay como el hub de criptomonedas de América Latina y un modelo para otros países de la región, dijo, y agregó que si el proyecto de ley es aprobado, buscará presentar un segundo que promueva el uso del bitcoin como moneda de curso legal.      Ha sido un objetivo de larga data para los líderes empresariales locales, que ya habían pregonado la energía barata de Paraguay ya en 2018.      ""Sin embargo, primero queremos darle a Paraguay un estatus amigable con el blockchain"", dijo.      Según Rejala, una de las condiciones más atractivas para las empresas mineras es el costo de la electricidad en Paraguay, que ronda los $ 0,05 por kilovatio-hora y es el más bajo de la región. Casi el 100% de la producción proviene de fuentes hidroeléctricas, agregó.      ""Es una energía renovable, no contaminante, lo que es sumamente importante para las empresas mineras"", dijo.      En diálogo con First Mover en CoinDesk TV, Juanjo Benítez Rickmann, CEO de la empresa minera local Bitcoin.com.py, dijo que la minería en Paraguay solo requiere el registro en la actividad y el pago de impuestos, a los que consideró más bajos que en el resto de la región. Actualmente, el país cuenta con un sistema conocido como triple 10, que consiste en un 10% de impuesto a la renta, un 10% de IVA y un 10% de impuesto a la renta personal, agregó Rejala.      El país no ofrece restricciones a los flujos de capital extranjero ni al pago de dividendos en el extranjero, añadió Rejala. ""Eso también lo convierte en un país atractivo para los cripto inversores"", dijo.      Paraguay no utiliza toda la energía que produce, dijo Rejala. En la central hidroeléctrica de Itaipú, que Paraguay comparte con Brasil, el país sólo toma el 26% de los 6.067 megavatios que le corresponden mensualmente, entregando el resto al país vecino, agregó.      ""Tenemos mucha energía que vendemos a Argentina y Brasil casi gratis porque sólo podemos vender a nuestros vecinos"", dijo Benítez Rickmann.    Próximos pasos    Un proyecto de ley, apoyado por diferentes actores del sector de las criptomonedas, fue presentado en varias oficinas del gobierno paraguayo, como la oficina contra el lavado de dinero, dijo Benítez Rickmann.      Actualmente, Rejala busca atraer apoyos para lograr la mayoría requerida de 41 votos en la Cámara de Diputados y pasar el proyecto a la Cámara de Senadores, dijo. Si se aprueba en ambas cámaras, entonces tendrá que ser promulgada por el Presidente del país, que también tiene la facultad de emitir un veto.      Benítez Rickmann dijo que durante la conferencia Bitcoin 2021 celebrada en Miami habló con varios operadores de pools de minería de China que pidieron 100 megavatios de espacio.

UND is derived from liquidity pool tokens (LPTs), which investors receive in exchange for providing liquidity on automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. The token can then be used by liquidity providers to take out loans in fiat currency, or just as a tokenized receipt of their investment into the pool.      ""The liquidation-free collateralization platform allows users to borrow interest-free loans against liquidity pool tokens as collateral,"" Unbound said in a press statement, making the project somewhat akin to MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin.

The new unit, State Street Digital, will be led by executive vice president Nadine Chakar, who will report to Lou Maiuri, the bank's chief operating officer, State Street said in a press release Thursday.      State Street said it is expanding its digital reach to include crypto, central bank digital currency, blockchain and tokenization, and will upgrade its existing GlobalLink platform into a multi-asset digital trading system.      In April, CoinDesk reported that State Street was working on a new trading platform for digital assets set to go live midyear through a partnership between the bank’s Currenex trading technology provider and London-based Pure Digital, which develops infrastructure for foreign-exchange trading plaforms.      But at that time, State Street representatives played down the possibility that the bank would use the platform to trade crypto.      That seems to have changed.      “Digital assets are quickly becoming integrated into the existing framework of financial services, and it is critical we have the tools in place to provide our clients with solutions for both their traditional investment needs as well as their increased digital needs,” State Street CEO Ron O’Hanley said in the press release.

A shift to wider use of stablecoins and CBDCs ""does not inherently constitute a financial stability risk as long as it happens in an orderly manner,"" Christina Segal-Knowles, executive director of financial market infrastructure at the BoE, said in a speech Thursday.  Segal-Knowles played down concerns that holding stablecoins and CBDCs would undermine the traditional banking model if consumers chose to use them rather than depositing their money into a commercial bank.  ""In fact, findings show that the implications of this in the long term for the ability of households and businesses to get a loan are relatively modest,"" she said, although she acknowledged there is some uncertainty about that.  Stablecoins don't pose any new issues, Segal-Knowles said. They are similar in nature to traditional forms of private money that is deposited by consumers and businesses in commercial banks.  ""This means that we will hold them to standards similar to those applicable to existing private money. It doesn't matter what type of technology you're using or the legal form of the firm.""

42406536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAev5LS,1623330040,"Dapper Labs Unveils Flow-Native Stablecoin, FUSD, With Other ERC-20-Like Tokens to Follow","Digital collectibles will always have volatile prices, but the money used to buy them shouldn't.      Dapper Labs, the game company behind the Flow blockchain, has announced a new dollar-backed stablecoin made in partnership with Prime Trust, the financial infrastructure provider.      Called FUSD, it will work much like familiar stablecoins Circle's USDC and Gemini's GUSD in that it will simply be one-for-one backed by U.S dollars deposited at Prime Trust.      ""That's the first fiat-backed stablecoin on Flow,"" Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs, said in a phone interview. Dapper’s flagship product, NBA Top Shot, has used a USDC integration to date.      Gharegozlou explained that FUSD is happening now simply because it's needed by non-Dapper Labs companies that are building on the Flow blockchain to give their users a non-volatile way to pay for digital products, one that will also be easily available in the United States and Canada.      So far, most of these third-party apps have accepted payments in the network’s native FLOW cryptocurrency, which is not available on exchanges in those countries. FLOW is trading at $12.56 per token, according to CoinGecko.    New token standard    Notably, Gharegozlou said FUSD also represents the first ERC-20-like token on Flow, enabled by the Flow Client Library (FCL), a new tool that will enable faster development on the network.      ERC-20 is the Ethereum standard that allows the world's second-largest blockchain to support other tokens beyond its native ETH cryptocurrency.      ""FCL unlocks the ability of anyone to make their own ERC-20-style token on Flow,"" Gharegozlou said, calling it the ""Flow equivalent of Web 3.""      Further, he added that other stablecoins are in the works to come to Flow, such as a Flow-native ETH cryptocurrency.      Such tokens are crucial, Gharegozlou explained. ""In order for you to use a token in a non-custodial payment method, it needs to be on the blockchain your payment is on,"" he said.      In a non-custodial system, a user's assets never have to leave their control until they make a payment and trade one asset for another. That protects the user from third-party risk, a key principle of blockchain technology.      More stablecoin options should be good for both developers and users, because with decentralized exchanges wired directly into applications, users will be able to pay in any token they want and the payment will finalize in any token the developer wants, in one transaction.      Further, Dapper Labs is promising Stripe-like simplicity for crypto payments.    Why a new stablecoin?    According to data from Messari, the total market capitalization of the stablecoin market is over $100 billion.      Despite a plethora of options on other blockchains, FUSD is needed now because Dapper Labs wants to get such a payment method to developers building today. Others will come to Flow, but that timeline is not in Dapper Labs' control.      That said, the vision for FUSD is to enable the Flow ecosystem – not to compete with the giant cross-blockchain stablecoins such as USDC and USDT.      The payment app Ramp will be ready to provide fiat on-ramps immediately and Moonpay will do so soon, according to Dapper Labs.

42387031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWNlL,1623329284,US Consumer Prices Rise Faster Than Expected in May,"The U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped by 5% in the 12 months through May, marking the largest yearly increase since August 2008, and exceeding the 4.7% increase expected by economists.      Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 3.8% year-over-year, also higher than economists' expectations of a 3.5% increase.      The figures, reported Thursday by the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), shows an economy that’s working through supply constraints while trying to meet increasing demand as the country reopens, with business lockdowns ending and coronavirus vaccines reaching more people.      On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices rose 0.6% after increasing 0.8% in April, according to the report. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.7% on the month.      ""Our U.S. economists are of the view (shared by the Fed’s leadership) that this current episode is likely to prove temporary thanks to one-off factors such as those associated with the economic reopening and base effects,"" Deutsche Bank wrote in a newsletter published on Thursday.      Deutsche Bank, however, also published a report on Monday issuing a stark warning that inflation could send the global economy into a recession as central banks lose control. The report was part of a research series highlighting risks to the firm's house view.      The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.      Since most of 2020 saw inflation of about 1%, the Federal Reserve has yet to meet its target of seeing 2% inflation on average on an annual basis before it raises rates.    The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 7.3% in May, which accounted for one-third of the seasonally adjusted increase for all items, according to the BLS.  Prices for food, gasoline, household furnishing and airline fares were all up during the past month as the economy reopens.  One soft spot was the medical care price index, which declined 0.1% in May after rising in each of the previous four months.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Damanick Dantes, Nate DiCamillo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/10/us-consumer-prices-rise-faster-than-expected-in-may,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b21b364d0ec83801f46e440555cb1188eb84ec59-1500x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jump joins a group of existing supporters of the platform that includes Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, Multicoin Capital and Genesis Trading (owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group). The firms backed Oxygen in a $40 million round of fundraising earlier this year.      Oxygen aims to make DeFi more accessible to retail investors, but with transactions handled and settled on the 50,000-transaction-per-second Solana blockchain and using the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX).      Carissa Felger, a representative for Jump Trading, said Jump’s role would be as a market maker on the Oxygen platform. “Jump is going to be a liquidity provider on Oxygen, collaborate on risk management and market data tools, and invest in the ecosystem,” Felger said via email.      Solana Labs itself just raised $314 million to build out the network’s DeFi capabilities.    DeFi portal    In addition to providing brokerage services to institutional crypto clients, Oxygen will be integrated into Maps.me, a mobile alternative to Google Maps with about 140 million users (Bankman-Fried’s Alameda led a surprise $50 million investment in Maps.me earlier this year.)      In terms of the mass adoption of DeFi, Oxygen’s co-founder Alex Grebnev said 47% of 27,000 Maps.me users surveyed liked the idea of integrating the app with a financial services component.

If a pullback occurs, bitcoin should find initial support around $34,000. Lower support around $30,000 was tested multiple times over the past two weeks as buyers return.

42387046,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWO4D,1623323998,Bitcoin Peeps Above $38K on Basel News,"Bitcoin hit highs above $38,000 on Thursday after the Basel Committee's proposal gave banks a green light to hold the leading cryptocurrency and other digital assets.    The top cryptocurrency hit a high of $38,461 during the European hours, extending Wednesday's double-digit rally to above $37,500, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which sets international banking standards, recommended stricter capital requirements for holding bitcoin than stocks and bonds.  The committee proposed a risk weight of 1,250% for bitcoin, ether and all other cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins that are fully backed by reserves.  It means a bank would be required to hold capital equivalent to the face value of the bitcoin exposure.  ""A $100 exposure would give rise to risk-weighted assets of $1250, which when multiplied by the minimum capital requirement of 8% results in a minimum capital requirement of $100 (ie the same value of the original exposure, as 12.5 is reciprocal of 0.08),"" the proposal said.  While Basel has categorized bitcoin as a high-risk asset, bitcoin's reaction suggests the market was likely expecting worse.  As cryptocurrencies begin to make their way into the traditional financial ecosystem, it is only normal to expect various regulatory bodies to begin to set and then also try to coordinate regulatory initiatives to protect savers and investors,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said.  ""Risk is over-regulation, but equally lack of regulation will also prevent further adoption en masse. Basel's proposal to split assets into groups makes logical sense given the different volatility and risk parameters,"" Vinokourov added.  The recommendation comes as regulators across the globe are stepping up plans to regulate the still-nascent market.  On Wednesday, China stepped up its crackdown on bitcoin, asking miners based in Qinghai province to shut down operations.

Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies would fall under the latter category because ""these pose additional and higher risks,"" according to an announcement Thursday.

The total held by the rich list hit a three-month high of 7.91 million earlier this week.  ""Whales aren't slowing down their accumulation,"" Santiment tweeted early today. ""This is a strong vote of confidence for bulls, seeing top key stakeholders are increasing their bags.""  The increase by long-term holders signals accumulation during the bear trend, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The data show whales and long-term holders remain confident of the cryptocurrency's prospects.  Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency may see short-term losses if the U.S. consumer price index, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET) on Thursday, exceeds expectations, boosting concerns of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Federal Reserve.  ""Large upside scare to the [CPI] print will make the downside below $30,000 very vulnerable, and we are most concerned with that now,"" QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel.  The impending death cross, or the bearish crossover of the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, is also hinting at the scope for deeper losses.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $36,300, a 3% drop on the day.  Prices rose more than 10% on Wednesday, hitting highs above $37,400 even as China announced a ban on virtual-currency mining operations in Qinghai province.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, payment was made to a group, REvil, which left no trace as to how it managed to infiltrate the company's systems. The attack shares similarities with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that occurred on May 14.      Based on the forensic analysis conducted by JBS, no customer, supplier or employee data was compromised in the attack.      Payment was made as an attempt to cushion the impact the attack placed on business procedures and JBS partners, including restaurants, grocery stores and farmers, according to Andre Nogueira, CEO of JBS SA’s U.S. division.      “It was very painful to pay the criminals, but we did the right thing for our customers,” said Nogueira. The company head also said the ransom was paid after most of the JBS plants were functioning and operational.      JBS learned of the attack on May 30 after staff began to notice irregularities with their servers. A message demanding a ransom in bitcoin soon made it clear that JBS was dealing with a sinister actor, per the report.      See also: State of Crypto: Ransomware Is a Crypto Problem      Shortly thereafter, JBS alerted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation while the company’s technology staff began closing down the meat supplier’s systems to stymie the attacker’s advance, said Nogueira.      Luckily for the meat producer, JBS manages secondary backups of its data that are encrypted, Nogueira told the Journal. But while restoring its systems, JBS admitted to paying the ransom to ensure against further attacks from REvil.      “We didn’t think we could take this type of risk that something could go wrong in our recovery process,” Nogueira said. “It was insurance to protect our customers.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/10/worlds-largest-meat-company-pays-11m-in-bitcoin-ransomware-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1cb82162afab7bd3ceff5161e702e0f74126efca-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWO2x,1623283818,"Elizabeth Warren, US Lawmakers Put Bitcoin on Trial in Senate CBDC Hearing","U.S. lawmakers may be warming to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).      But while CBDCs drew some of the attention during Wednesday’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, the issues around bitcoin drew far more attention from the group of lawmakers, led most vocally by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).      The Subcommittee on Economic Policy, chaired by Warren, is likely going to hold further hearings on the cryptocurrency sector as well, the lawmaker told Bloomberg.      The hearing presented one of the sharpest criticisms of bitcoin from U.S. lawmakers to date, even as smaller countries like El Salvador move to accept the cryptocurrency as legal tender. Warren’s views are likely a preview of how the issue may be discussed in other upcoming hearings, with counterparts in the House of Representatives holding a similar discussion next week.    Pros and cons    “If you want to send money to somebody else, digital currency can be easier and faster,” Warren said as she opened the hearing. “But in order for those advantages to be realized, the digital version needs to be secure, stable and accepted everywhere.”      In response, MIT Digital Currency Initiative Director Neha Narula pointed out that bitcoin's value is not stable, pointing to the recent market drop of about 40%.      Warren then likened cryptocurrencies to wildcat notes issued in the past.      Warren's view is markedly different from Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), the pro-bitcoin lawmaker who launched a Financial Innovation Caucus last month.      Lummis contrasted nations using bitcoin, naming El Salvador’s recent bill to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, with the U.S.’ possible approach.      Warren also took aim at bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies’ environmental cost, saying it draws as much energy as The Netherlands, and could use as much energy as every other data center on Earth by the end of the year. (Whether bitcoin indeed uses an excess amount of energy compared to other technologies or monetary systems is hotly debated.)    CBDCs may be good    All four witnesses – Narula, Columbia Law’s Lev Menand, Stanford University’s Darrell Duffie and Digital Dollar Foundation Director Chris Giancarlo – argued that a well-built digital dollar would prove useful to the U.S.      Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the full Senate Banking Committee, expressed support Wednesday for the idea of a Federal Reserve-issued CBDC, saying it could complement a no-fee bank account plan he has proposed.      “Americans shouldn’t have to pay exorbitant fees just to use the money they’ve already earned … a central bank digital currency can work with these no-fee accounts to make sure working families have access to the payment system and full participation in our economy,” he said. (Brown has also recently come out strongly against provisional banking charters granted to crypto-native firms.)      Arguments in favor of CBDCs varied. Menand said they could allow for large companies to find new ways of storing value.      “Offering non-defaultable money with no maximum amount would be stabilizing for the U.S. financial system in ways that people haven’t thought about,” Menand said, adding:    “It would be very helpful to large companies to be able to hold very, very large cash balances in non-defaultable amounts and this could crowd out a lot of unsafe and unstable alternative products that those companies use right now.”  China looms large    A digital dollar may also help the U.S. keep pace with China, which has been working on both its own Blockchain-based Services Network and a CBDC of its own, the digital yuan.      Giancarlo pointed to China’s work in arguing a CBDC would help the dollar maintain its role as the global reserve currency.      ""It's only a matter of time before China will combine its latest blockchain technology with its new digital currency and its futures markets,"" he said.      His remarks came a day after the full Senate passed the Endless Frontier Act, which if implemented as is would require the federal government to study the national security implications of the digital renminbi, after an amendment sponsored in part by Lummis.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/10/elizabeth-warren-us-lawmakers-put-bitcoin-on-trial-in-senate-cbdc-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0424aa2650cf64735481534fa4e7538c71c03da-1500x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
