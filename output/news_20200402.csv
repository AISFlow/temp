42404349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwQk,1585864806,Chinese Financial Watchdog Warns of Manipulative Crypto Exchanges,"The National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA), a major Chinese financial watchdog, warned investors of rising risks in crypto investments.      While manipulation is a longstanding concern for crypto investors, NIFA's warning is notable for also pushing back on the narrative of digital currency as a safe haven during a time of global turmoil.      NIFA, a self-regulatory organization affiliated with China’s central bank, said Thursday that foreign-based crypto exchanges have faked trading volume, according to its own data analysis. It also noted some trading platforms compared digital currencies to safe haven assets like gold and silver, but a recent tumble in the crypto market caused significant losses for investors.      “In our sampling analysis based on trading data from some of the exchanges, the daily trading turnover rate for more than 40 coins is over 100 percent, while more than 70 coins’ rate exceeds 50 percent,” NIFA said. “Despite the relatively low price and small market value, there have been massive trading volumes.”      The trading platforms have created the “false prosperity” in the crypto trading market by tempering statistics and using robots to increase trading volume. Some platforms have completely made up trading volume by copying other exchanges’ data, NIFA claimed.      See also: ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap      The authority also accuses the trading platforms of misguiding investors by claiming virtual currencies are even safer than gold and silver to mitigate the volatility in the international financial market.      “After tricking investors into investing in crypto, some exchanges will manipulate the market through a range of trading techniques to take the investors’ assets,” NIFA said.      For example, exchanges can stop investors from trading by shutting off their systems, freezing assets or staging a system breakdown. Some investors would not be able to close a position and suffer a lot of losses, especially for those that trade with high leverage.      According to NIFA, the vast majority of crypto exchanges are based outside China since the government banned trading activities in 2017. As a result, it has been difficult for regulators to track down such institutions and retrieve losses for investors.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/02/chinese-financial-watchdog-warns-of-manipulative-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b71dfde24cc8a49fa4e26308bc1c9c432dccee64-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwSi,1585863062,"As Governments Rush to Track Coronavirus, Honduras May Offer a Privacy-First Model","The coronavirus crisis will certainly have lasting impacts, but some measures may prove less harmful than others.      While countries like Israel and China implement coronavirus emergency measures that digitally track civilian location data and health records, an entrepreneur in Honduras developed a blockchain-powered equivalent with an acute focus on privacy.      The bootstrapped startup Emerge is working with the Inter-American Development Bank, the tech company Penta Network and the Emergency Response Unit of the Honduran government to launch an app this week called Civitas. This software program will associate people’s government ID numbers with unique blockchain records they can use for telemedicine and permits to leave the house on specific errands. Roughly 3.2 million people are currently living in lockdown-affected areas of Honduras.      “It’s to better manage how people who are experiencing symptoms circulate,” said Emerge CEO Lucia Gallardo. “The last digits on your ID number determines which days you circulate.”      Just like in Israel, Hondurans who live in lockdown areas can be fined or face criminal charges if they violate quarantine protocols, she said. In the capital city, Tegucigalpa, Gallardo said people are only allowed to leave their homes at designated times or for specific tasks. There are time slots each week, such as Monday and Wednesday from 7-9 a.m., when people in each category are allowed to shop for groceries or go out without a permit. Otherwise, civilians require a permit for outdoor errands like visiting the health care clinic.      So the Emerge team is rolling out Civitas this week to roughly 25,000 Hondurans, then quickly expanding to all 18 regions of the country with confirmed cases.      If someone feels ill, they will engage with health care specialists from the National University of Honduras to determine if the symptoms could be related to the coronavirus. People with such cases are directed to facilities that specialize in treating the virus, to reduce exposure among vulnerable populations in other hospitals.      “The health center validates the permit that proves they were assigned to this health clinic,” Gallardo said. “Each time they go to the clinic, if they have to go more than once, is recorded and it’s all tied to the [Civitas] ID. It’s not a full history of the person’s life. It’s the history since they started the telemedicine file.”    Blockchain features    The mobile app’s blockchain records serve multiple functions in a region accused by critics of having a particularly corrupt public health care system.      The Civitas record cannot be easily altered nor denied, at least not electronically, so censorship resistance can help establish trust in public health care options. Even if you’re poor or from a vulnerable minority, this record shows when and where the user has the right to access care. Users who don’t get care won’t go unnoticed.      When doctors scan the app, they can see the symptoms and notes described via the telemedicine service, which streamlines care. The plan is to eventually include outdoor shopping schedules and other logistics as well, which is automated based on ID numbers and employment type. Most importantly, this data isn’t shared with agencies beyond the healthcare system.      “The government doesn't view the health records, it’s a patient record for the health care provider,” Gallardo said. “Police don’t get to see your profile. [On the permit] they just see a yes or no question about whether the person is allowed to be circulating at that time.”      If law enforcement wants to monitor who is breaking quarantine, they need to patrol neighborhoods. This app doesn’t track location data nor keep lasting records of social graphs. There’s no social credit scores, unlike the tracking programs in China or the program NSO Group is working on in Israel. Instead, Civitas is used for emergency alerts, telemedicine, verification and other similar functions.      “We can guarantee, probably, a phone per household but not a smartphone,” Gallardo said. “For those without [internet] connectivity, they can interact with the app via text messaging.”    Global insights    The variety of emergency coronavirus programs raise legal questions in each jurisdiction, which offer lessons for countries still crystalizing their response plans.      The United Nations is relying heavily on the same Chinese technology companies known for censoring information about the coronavirus, like WeChat’s parent company Tencent, for emergency communications despite free speech concerns. However, from the perspective of eToro CEO Yoni Assia in Israel, at least surveillance programs are merely a public acknowledgement of existing government powers.      “People are naive to think governments weren’t doing that [mass surveillance] or having that capability before,” Assia said. “The only difference here is they want people to engage with that data to keep people safe.”      Both Emerge and the Israeli tech company NSO Group are in talks with several governments eager to implement national tracking programs to curtail the virus.      “It would require minimal adaptation to suit other countries, especially in emerging markets,” Gallardo said.    USA    In the United States, companies like Apple and Google are involved with developing the Trump administration’s screening program.      Google, in particular, owns a staggering amount of behavioral user data. There are other companies researching more privacy-forward coronavirus tracking models as well, according to Nym Technologies CEO Harry Halpin, although such efforts aren’t connected to any government and are still in a theoretical stage.      Privacy experts are concerned about the long-term implications of these programs. Yet, attorney Preston Byrne of Anderson Kill's technology group said there’s reason to believe Americans have legal protections other nations may not.      “With regard to cellphone location data specifically, in the U.S. citizens enjoy a substantial expectation of privacy in relation to their physical movements,” Byrne said.      With regards to subscriber data, like IP addresses and metadata in text messages or emails, Byrne added companies are “not free to provide these communications voluntarily to the government except in very limited circumstances including an emergency involving death or serious bodily injury.”      In short, Americans can generally choose which apps to use. American police can’t use mass surveillance to show up at someone’s house if a phone is turned off, as reportedly happened in Taiwan. Even in Israel’s case, courts promptly ruled on which organizations can access and collect data. Plus, Israel’s consumer-facing mobile app, called “Shield” in Hebrew, is open source so anyone can review it.      If the White House adopts a comparable software initiative, Americans have a right to choose their connectivity tools and advocate for open source apps. They can also protect their privacy rights in court, according to Byrne.      Back in Honduras, Gallardo argued technologists should design software programs to specifically do certain things and not allow other types of data collection. Rather than waiting for litigation to assert privacy rights, this can help prevent government overreach in the future.      “What might it look like if, later down the line, whether you’ve tested positive for coronavirus has an impact on how people view you?” she said. “When you’re designing inclusively, these are questions you’ve asked yourself from the beginning.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/02/as-governments-rush-to-track-coronavirus-honduras-may-offer-a-privacy-first-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed64e9760825ce136b533d0da91a9d7b416ff753-1400x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404345,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwOm,1585859145,Brazilian Financial Regulators Will Vet Companies and Political Appointees on a Blockchain,"Brazil’s financial regulators launched an information-sharing blockchain platform called PIER on Wednesday.      At launch, the blockchain pulls data from three of Brazil’s four major financial institutions: the private insurance superintendent (SUSEP), the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) and securities regulator (CVM), PIER’s main backers. Social security supervisor PREVIC also plans to join.      Once it does, PIER will unite Brazil’s entire financial oversight ecosystem in what CVM called “a vast integrated database” that accelerates the speed with which each can administer its slice of Brazil’s $1.9 trillion economy – Latin America’s largest by far.      One use of the platform would be to conduct background checks on political appointees, according to BCB.      “Our objective is that this system promotes gains to the market, given the more efficient, safe and adequate supervision and enforcement to the new technological scenario that we are experiencing” said CVM President Marcelo Barbosa in a press release.      PIER grants bureaucrats access to their sister agencies’ real-time records on company sanctions, financial performance and business associates “in seconds,” according to BCB. It’s an easy, online bridge between previously siloed data troves.      ""This makes it possible to drastically reduce the time period for assessing requirements,"" said Daniel Bichuette, deputy head of the BCB’s Financial System Organization Department, in the press release.      Each agency envisions using PIER to improve their oversight efficiency. For example, BCB said in a press release that PIER can streamline its vetting of elected officials appointed to financial institution posts – specifically the examination of their qualifications and business reputation. The central bank is charged with conducting such investigations.      CVM, for its part, said PIER can boost corporate investigations.      The project is expected to reduce the time it takes to conduct cross-regulator investigations as well as the cost. CVM did not immediately respond to requests for hard numbers.      It's also being seen as a more secure means of storing information.      ""Building PIER, using blockchain, allows the use of decentralized, tested technology whose native functionalities mean that there is no need to build the system from scratch,"" BCB software manager Eduardo Weller said in the press release.      Based on BCB’s description of PIER, the underlying blockchain appears to utilize a consensus-based mechanism with multiple nodes and a digital signature system. BCB did not immediately respond to requests for a deeper technical overview.      BCB will add yet more government databases to PIER over time, saying the system ""has the potential to aggregate databases from outside the financial system,"" the press release said. Possible additions include data from: ""judiciary, trade boards and international financial stability bodies.""      PIER’s debut is two years in the making. BCB, which first developed PIER and now administers it, disclosed PIER's existence in June 2018. Project lead Gabriela Ruberg did not respond to a request for comment.      Brazil’s financial sector often looks to blockchain’s potential. Private banks have issued security tokens on the Tezos blockchain and minted Brazilian real-backed stablecoins on Ethereum. As the PIER press release notes: “The use of Blockchain in financial services has been growing in the market.”      The regulators, and especially BCB, have been similarly bullish. The four now running PIER launched a blockchain sandbox in June 2019.      This embrace of blockchain’s technological potential comes in striking contrast to its wider views on cryptocurrency. BCB officials have likened bitcoin to a pyramid scheme. Even so, they have stressed that the tech is different from its individual applications.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | XTZ,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/02/brazilian-financial-regulators-will-vet-companies-and-political-appointees-on-a-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e15221f4b9cb42c466db58c8fc29154b64819b1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwbZ,1585851483,Bitcoin Briefly Tops $7K as Traders Say Worst of 2020 Sell-Off May Have Passed,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose Thursday for the fourth straight session and briefly climbed above $7,000 for the first time in three weeks.      The bellwether cryptocurrency was up 2.5 percent to $6,821 as of 19:22 UTC (3:22 p.m. in New York.) Earlier, the price rallied as high as $7,236 before pulling back.      The four-day increase has helped bitcoin claw back some of its losses during the first three months of the year, when the spreading coronavirus and increasingly dire economic prospects sparked a flight for cash among investors in both traditional and digital-asset markets.      Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, a San Francisco-based hedge fund specializing in cryptocurrencies, said he saw no clear driver of Thursday's move. Market signals show a growing conviction among bitcoin traders that prices won't fall below $6,000 in the short term, but rallies above $7,000 appear to be drawing in sellers, he said.      See also: Crypto Wants Stronger Public Response to Coronavirus, CoinDesk Survey Shows      ""You have so many people trying to swing trade on crypto,"" DiPasquale said in a phone interview.      Traditional financial markets were whipsawed again as Wall Street investors speculated that major oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia might agree on production cuts to help to stabilize prices. Oil jumped 22 percent to $24.77 a barrel, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 2.3 percent.      The S&P 500 is still down 22 percent for the year to date, while bitcoin has now trimmed its 2020 losses to just 5.5 percent.      DiPasquale said many bitcoin traders are looking ahead to May's expected ""halving,"" when the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency issued by the underlying blockchain network is scheduled to drop by 50 percent. The once-every-four-years-event was coded into the 11-year-old bitcoin's original programming as a way of minimizing inflation.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained.      The halving comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to inject an estimated $4 trillion of new liquidity into the global financial system to help stabilize markets, roughly equivalent to the total amount of money created on the central bank's balance sheet since its founding in 1913. Investors including Mike Novogratz, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Galaxy Digital, say such moves could ""debase"" the value of the dollar.      ""That literally is a printing press,"" Novogratz told CNBC on Thursday. ""I'm getting calls from real big investors we've never seen before, saying, `Tell me about this bitcoin.'""      Novogratz said he expects bitcoin's price to double within the next six months and potentially climb above its previous record near $20,000 by the end of the year.

42404354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhwVf,1585846812,Makers of Keep Protocol Raise $7.7M to Bring Trustless BTC to DeFi,"With a forthcoming product that may entice more decentralized finance (DeFi) players to incorporate bitcoin-backed tokens, Thesis has closed a $7.7 million deal by selling its Keep tokens to some of crypto’s top investors.      Announced Thursday, Thesis will shortly debut TBTC, a trustless platform for making bitcoin-backed tBTC tokens on Ethereum. The private keys guarding the BTC are stored using Keep, the firm’s system for storing secrets in a usable fashion on the world computer. Few secrets are more useful and valuable than bitcoin private keys.      That said, a vocal cohort of bitcoin partisans has been very publicly skeptical of DeFi, but TBTC's creator doesn't think that represents the broader view. After all, more people hold bitcoin than ever before.      ""The silent majority of most bitcoin and ETH people aren't maximalists,"" Matt Luongo told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Luongo is the CEO and founder of Thesis, a blockchain development studio. The idea for Keep arose out of building bitcoin rewards app Fold, which needed ways to store data in public, privately. While not committing to a precise timeline, Luongo said both Keep and TBTC will go live at the same time – in a matter of ""weeks not months.""      The new funding round was led by Paradigm Capital, with participation from Fenbushi Capital, Collaborative Fund and others. In December 2018, Keep had a prior round that included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Draper Associates.      ""Decentralized financial applications on Ethereum have seen clear demand,"" Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam said in a statement. ""Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency. Building a bridge that allows Bitcoin to interact with DeFi makes a lot of sense, and tBTC is a credible attempt to do exactly that.""      Luongo is himself extremely long BTC, but he's not one of those bitcoin diehards who dismisses DeFi.      ""I think the whole Bitcoin-Ethereum cultural split has outlived its usefulness,"" he said.      What's different about tBTC    Bitcoin is already on Ethereum, most notably with wBTC, an ERC-20 token created by BitGo.      Naturally, wBTC builds on its creator's strengths. BitGo serves as the custodian and lets anyone check its BTC balances against outstanding wBTC. But having a centralized, identifiable custodian could potentially introduce censorship risks in the eyes of some users.      Conversely, TBTC is an application built to allow trustless storage of the bitcoin backing tBTC tokens. To mint one tBTC, a user contacts the Keep network, which designates a wallet for storing the bitcoin. The keys for that wallet are held in a multi-sig structure across several nodes on the Keep network that have staked KEEP tokens.      This is just what Keep was built for, Luongo explained. ""It let's you operate with private material and choose people to hold it randomly,"" he said.      The chosen nodes collateralize the BTC with ETH at 150 percent of the value of the underlying BTC. Then the tBTC token gets minted to the bitcoin owner's wallet.      That token can be used in DeFi apps that accept it (more on that later). Anytime they want to unlock their bitcoin, the tBTC creator simply needs to return an equal amount of tBTC to the smart contract, which will burn the tBTC and return the bitcoin to a wallet the user controls.        BTC’s DeFi advantages    Interestingly, Luongo said, ETH is likely to work better for collateral for BTC than a stablecoin, because the two cryptos tend to be fairly correlated. So if BTC price makes a big move, ETH will probably make a similar move, making it less likely for the ETH collateral to get liquidated.      There's very little reason to have bitcoin on Ethereum if there's nothing to do with it, though, so the product will only work well if DeFi applications adopt tBTC. In part, Luongo explained, that's why Thesis sought a fresh round of funding.      ""As TBTC is the first app on Keep we want to make sure it lands,"" Luongo said.      Stani Kulechov runs Aave (formerly ETHLend), the number four application on DeFi, according to DeFi Pulse. Aave has a half-million dollars worth of wBTC on the application, which is fairly small compared to other tokens its users stake.      ""I think DeFi is still alien to Bitcoin holders,"" Kulechov told CoinDesk in an email.      That said, he also believes that the yields found in DeFi are attracting more and more hodlers. His company has been watching tBTC along with other projects working to get BTC onto Ethereum, such as Ren and pTokens.      ""These new alternatives are actually bringing quite innovative solutions to reduce trust and custody,"" Kulechov wrote. ""That might be another factor that could accelerate BTC liquidity into Ethereum.""",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/02/makers-of-keep-protocol-raise-77m-to-bring-trustless-btc-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21d12dcdb3bed7b4aa77efebaadb39044a6458b4-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuYe,1585844478,Ripple Engineers Publish Design for Private Transactions on XRP Ledger,"A new proposal specification from Ripple's software developers would allow users to send private transactions to one another using the XRP ledger.      In a GitHub submission earlier this week, Ripple engineer Nik Bougalis said he and a group of other Ripple developers had designed a new private payment system for the XRP ledger to protect exchange users from malicious third parties.      Bougalis, who is responsible for XRP's server software, said a system of ""blinded tags"" would make private transactions possible on the ledger. They would present a string of numbers that would be meaningful only for the intended recipient and appear random to everyone else.      ""[I]f blinded tags are in use, an attacker capable of observing every payment transaction will be unable to isolate a pair of transactions that refer to the same unblinded tag,"" Bougalis said.      See also: Digital Custodian Anchorage Adds XRP Storage for Institutional Customers      Cryptocurrency exchanges hold users' XRP in the same wallet address, which is separated into various sub-wallets. To differentiate between the different holdings, sub-wallets use 32-bit source and destination tags to identify a transaction recipient.      At present, tags are publicly viewable and, if used frequently, can be associated with a particular user. Some exchanges already generate new tags for every transaction, but there are only a finite number of tags available. Although this isn't an immediate issue, there comes a point where exchanges will be unable to generate any new tags.      Bougalis' proposal would also mean users could toggle blinded tags on or off. They would work as a single function so the network doesn't become overburdened.      Using blinded tags not only protects users' identity, but it also acts as an effective ""workaround"" for preserving the number of destination and source tags available to exchanges, Bougalis added. As blinded tags leverage an existing tag infrastructure on exchanges, it's uncertain whether users sending XRP between standalone wallets would be able to do so privately.      See also: Amended Lawsuit Against Ripple Now Offers Theory That XRP May Not Be a Security      It was not immediately clear if Ripple intends to add blinded tags in the near future or if this is a more exploratory suggestion. A spokesperson said they were receiving feedback and would review it if 80 percent of trusted validators supported the proposal.

The Y Combinator-backed firm built by former Google employees was added by crypto derivatives platform ErisX as service partner on Wednesday. That came alongside five other business relationships added in recent weeks, including bitcoin security firm Casa, crypto finance protocol Compound, trading platform Crypto.com, decentralized Ethereum exchange IDEX, and bitcoin rewards platform Lolli.      With reporting taxes on cryptocurrency transactions notoriously complex even for experts, the firm aims to simplify that process within its tax calculator tool that automatically outputs reports for users.      CoinTracker also has an existing integration with TurboTax, the tax-filing software offered by Intuit Consumer Tax Group, both of which partnered with prominent crypto exchange Coinbase in 2019.      Talking of the new partnerships, Chandan Lodha, co-founder at CoinTracker, told CoinDesk ""the breadth of integrations means we can serve more crypto users and more types of crypto users from hobbyist dipping their toes into crypto via bitcoin rewards like Lolli all the way to advanced traders.""      Also read: Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds      With over $600 million in capital losses claimed on behalf of their users, the new partnerships were providing solutions for many different types of clients, he added.      The company also says it recently passed what it considers to be the major milestone of more than 100,000 active users, with more than 175,000 connected wallets and exchanges, as well as $20 billion in transaction volume tracked so far.      Ultimately, CoinTracker says, by helping people report their taxes with simple tools, those in the mainstream who view crypto as a tool used for illicit activity will start to understand it's a legitimate means of value transfer among law-abiding citizens.      ""As more users and regulators see that the vast majority of cryptocurrency use is by everyday people for completely legal transactions and people are crypto tax-compliant, this only helps increase faith and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,"" Lodha said.      ""Our hope is to show people that cryptocurrency is actually regulated and you can be tax compliant pretty easily,"" Lodha added.

42404329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuVh,1585832403,'They Have the Users': Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap,"Binance just bought the top of the funnel.      The largest cryptocurrency exchange by market volume has acquired popular data site CoinMarketCap (CMC) for an undisclosed price, the companies announced Thursday. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao told CoinDesk the deal closed March 31, although a verbal agreement had been reached “a few months ago.”      With its extensive (although often questionable) data on prices, volumes and other metrics for 5,290 cryptocurrencies, CMC has served as a dragnet for retail investors since its launch in 2013.      “It’s a really good website and I think we can help grow it further,” Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk Thursday, adding he had no immediate plans for CMC. Zhao said the domain will remain independent from Binance under a holding company, perhaps staving off concerns over potential conflicts of interest.      Industry veterans told CoinDesk they see a future where CMC could serve as a marketing channel for Binance, steering prospective customers toward the exchange. Zhao, on the other hand, characterized it as a simple, albeit large, purchase of a cash-flow positive asset.      “It’s by far the largest we have done so far,” he said of the deal.      The acquisition shows that while many firms looked to institutional players as crypto's messiah in 2019 and even today, Zhao is pinning his hopes on a mass audience of individual investors after buying the most heavily trafficked website in the space.      Amazon’s Alexa ranks CMC as the 570th most visited website globally in the last 90 days. That’s compared to Binance and rival exchange Coinbase at 1,688 and 1,562, respectively. The next closest data provider is CoinGecko at 7,350.      Zhao’s purchase also caps CMC’s journey, from a scrappy outfit run out of founder Brandon Chez’s apartment to a property coveted by an industry leader. In fact, Zhao said he had pursued Chez for years. With the sale, Chez is stepping down.      “CMC was not for sale,” CMC interim CEO Carylyne Chan said in an interview. “Opportunity came along.” (Chan now joins Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley as one of two female chief executives running firms connected to the exchange in a historically male-dominated industry.)      Earlier this week, The Block reported the acquisition was in the works, and put the price tag at $400 million in cash and stock options, citing unnamed sources. Founders and investors interviewed by CoinDesk gave differing opinions on the plausibility of the figure; some said it sounded too high, others thought it was too low. While both Chan and Zhao declined to give actual figures for the acquisition, citing non-disclosure agreements, Zhao confirmed it was Binance’s biggest acquisition to date.      “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said. “Even though their money generation mechanism is not as strong as Binance, they do have the users – it’s a very valuable platform.”      Read more: Crypto’s King Midas: Backstage With CZ, the CEO Who Can’t Be Stopped    Early talks    Earnest conversations between CoinMarketCap and Binance date back to the data provider’s conference for investors in November 2019, said Chan.      Zhao hinted at the coming acquisition, along with one other unannounced purchase, in a New Year’s Day blog post. Binance bought nine separate entities last year alone and plans to onboard 180 fiat currencies by the end of 2020 in an aggressive push to sign up retail customers. The company’s tagline is “exchanging the world.”      It’s easy to see, then, why CoinMarketCap’s status as the first landing page for retail investors would be attractive to Zhao despite his past criticisms of CMC for its data quality.        If reports about the price are true, the deal stands as one of the top M&A deals in crypto history. Circle, now a shell of its former self, purchased Poloniex for $400 million in 2018 but has since spun off the exchange and pivoted to focusing on stablecoins.      For CMC, the acquisition follows a ride through choppy waters. The firm quickly became both the dominant data source and go-to platform for asset pricing in the nascent industry.      It also became a lightning rod for controversy after a 2019 report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by digital asset manager Bitwise found artificial trade volume from 95 percent of the crypto exchanges that provide data to CMC.      Startups such as Nomics, Messari and CoinGecko seized the Bitwise report to chip into CMC’s lead, particularly among institutional investors, which require robust data and can’t expose their clients to manipulation.      Read more: For $15K, He’ll Fake Your Exchange Volume – You’ll Get on CoinMarketCap    Competitors react    Rival exchanges reacted with mixed emotions at news of the deal, which could firmly outdistance Binance from the pack.      Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKEx, said it was good to see such large M&A deals in the context of a “bearish market in crypto.”      Big players investing back into key infrastructure is healthy for crypto, Lai said, even if warranting skepticism.      “People might have doubts about whether or not CMC could maintain its independence afterward. It’s fair. But I think we should give the team a chance,” he said.      Andy Cheung, former chief operating officer at OKEx and founder of crypto derivative platform ACDX, was more critical in his assessment.      The acquisition “is not very good for the industry” given the conflict of interest between the parties’ missions, he said, pointing to Binance’s exchange token, BNB, as an example.      “I can understand the business or potential profit,” Cheung said. “But honestly, how are you going to convince people that the rankings and volume are true when you’re operating an exchange and also probably the biggest holder of BNB?”      Cheung even saw it as a blow to Zhao’s cult of personality.      “CZ has been telling everyone, ‘We are not here for the money and building something bigger and meaningful for humanity.’ Now I’m disappointed, I hope I am wrong and he has a better reason behind” the purchase, he said.      One Silicon Valley crypto investor speaking on the condition of anonymity doubted the reported $400 million buyout figure and said the overall deal “feels like a favor” to CMC founder Chez.      “The founder is very stealth and I think has the majority of the cap table. And he's struggled to monetize for years,” the investor said.      That’s not to say Binance doesn’t have loose change to throw around. Two sources said Binance is “flush” with cash, with one pointing toward futures trading customers departing BitMEX following a critical error on March 12 as a recent boon.    Big data, small markets    CMC sits in an awkward spot after its acquisition.      Although it is typically the first port of call for small retail buyers, institutional investors spurned the website, particularly after Bitwise’s SEC report. At the same time, CMC has some of the best data in the industry because of its sheer volume: exchanges have always used CMC, so why change now?      Nomics founder and CEO Clay Collins told CoinDesk that a certain degree of trust is necessitated between an exchange and a data provider; trust that “is likely to be eroded here” with CMC under the same roof as Binance.      If rival exchanges feel threatened by the possibility of Binance harvesting data from CMC, those firms will be “much less willing to provide low-latency and high-granularity data,” Collins said.      “That data is now being given to a competitor with surveillance abilities. It’s unlikely that other exchanges will want to see Binance aggregating and monetizing their own data,” he said.      Collins’ concerns were seconded by Alexei Andryunin, head of Gotbit, a Russian token and exchange promotion service. That’s a polite way to describe the business, which Andryunin has candidly admitted inflated volumes on CMC for small-cap coins via wash-trading bots.      In Andryunin’s view, the purchase will provide Binance with “data on all their competitors, plus some of the best expertise for traffic generation in the crypto industry.”      However, leveraging or altering data would be equivalent to sending the investment to a burner address, Andryunin said. “Binance is incentivized to keep this service transparent so that they don’t lose their investment. I think they’ll try to preserve CMC’s reputation.”      He also said that CMC’s summer 2019 capitalization was estimated at $650 million, suggesting the reported $400 million offering was a bargain.      Read more: We Still Don’t Know Bitcoin’s Real Volume    Maturation    Binance aside, CMC’s Chan said data concerns continue to be a key part of the firm’s focus.      The firm is launching both “qualitative data as well as quantitative data” features in 2020, Chan said. “Stronger agreements” could be put in place to “protect [exchanges’] interest as well,” she acknowledged.      “In a sense, it’s in our interest to continue to be neutral and to be transparent and independent,” Chan said.      Zhao acknowledged CMC’s shortcomings, saying the firm “needs to resolve” numerous issues and “make the product better over time.” That responsibility falls to Chan and her team, though, he said.      “I’m not dictating it,” Zhao said.      Meanwhile, the purchase frees up elbow room for other data aggregators, particularly on the institutional side of the market, said Messari co-founder and CEO Ryan Selkis. In an email to CoinDesk, and in his own newsletter and Twitter feed, Selkis described the buyout as a win for everyone, including data companies that won’t receive a check.      “It’s great news for other crypto data companies, and information businesses. Audience and influence matters. Quality data matters,” he said in a company newsletter.      Yan Liberman, principal at research and consulting firm Delphi Digital, said these larger acquisitions are good for the sector and show overall maturation. He added that it’s best to wait and see on Binance’s relationship with CMC rather than cast stones early.      “The initial reaction might be to look at other data providers/platforms as comparables, but because of all the nuances/differences among them, I don’t think it’s very useful to do that until we get a better understanding of what the plans are for CMC,” Liberman said.      Not much will change for CMC once the acquisition takes place, Chan said. All of the firm’s roughly 40 employees – minus Chez, who will stay on as an advisor – will join the 930-person Binance staff, Zhao said.      Chan said the firm will continue to alter its infamous advertisement structure, but will still host paid-marketing for other exchanges.      Since the firm will operate separately from Binance, Zhao will have to dish out more money if Binance wants to advertise on CMC, she said.      For his part, Chez – the sole shareholder of CMC – walks away from crypto with a big chunk of change in his pocket – fiat or otherwise. Chan said Chez’s focus remains on his family during the coronavirus crisis and subsequent quarantine he and his family currently live under.      “We would love to keep him, but he wants to take a break and, given the size of the deal, it makes total sense,” Zhao said.

42404331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuWg,1585831231,Factom Inc. 'Faces Liquidation' After Investors Refuse Request for More Funding,"Update (April 6, 10:35 UTC): This article has been updated with new information from Factom Inc. CoinDesk has also clarified the distinction between the firm and the protocol.      Factom Inc. has entered financial difficulties after an appeal for additional funding fell on deaf ears, according to its main investor.      Built on Factom Protocol, which was one of the first blockchain projects to ever host a token sale in 2015, the company said March 31 it had begun the process of dissolution, according to a London Stock Exchange announcement from largest backer FastForward on Thursday.      ""[FastForward] has been notified by the directors of Factom that in a board meeting on 31 March 2020 they concluded that, in the absence of further funding, they now needed to begin the process of assignment of assets for the benefit of creditors,"" reads the statement.      Although Factom Inc.'s Twitter page had fallen silent in the middle of January, alarm bells started ringing in March after the company told investors it would enter liquidation by the end of the month unless it received additional funding.      FastForward, which had the largest stake in Factom Inc., said it was prepared to renegotiate its $6 million simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) to try and attract outside investment. Although it was willing to participate in another investment round, FastForward told Factom directors that it was not prepared to lead. Previously announced talks with investors were also unsuccessful.      See also: Polish Crypto Exchange Bitmarket Suddenly Shuts Down      Following a board meeting on March 31, Factom finally told investors it would consider beginning the process of liquidation. As its biggest investor, FastForward said in their announcement that they will now become receiver and will take the lion's share of the company's assets and intellectual property. A timetable for when Factom will eventually be wound up has not been disclosed.      Factom Inc. COO Jay Smith denied FastForward's claims that the company had entered receivership. Saying the press release contained many ""misstatements of fact,"" he said the board of directors were, at the request of FastForward, putting ""a motion to take such an action before shareholders,"" who would have to pre-approve a dissolution event.      ""However, we do not expect the motion to be approved,"" he added.      Based in Austin, Texas, the Factom Protocol started in 2014 as a trustless data-provenance layer on the Bitcoin blockchain. Just last year, data security firm TFA Labs received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to use Factom's open-sourced blockchain to secure the country's power grid.      Factom Inc., which launched in 2015, announced high-profile partnerships and grants with government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to secure or verify data.      The closure of Factom Inc. will not have any impact on the running of the Factom Protocol, said Factom Inc. chairman David Johnston.      FastForward, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has invested in a diverse range of tech startups, entered into a $6 million SAFE with Factom Inc. in 2018. In its near-six-year history, Factom raised more than $18 million from investors.      See also: London Block Exchange Placed Into Compulsory Liquidation      In an announcement, FastForward director Ed McDermott admitted the company was not altogether certain how Factom Inc. ended in such dire financial straits.      ""We are extremely disappointed with this news from Factom,"" he said in a statement. ""As we go through the Receivership process and understand more of the events that led to this position our position as investors in Factom is expressly reserved.""

42404361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhufX,1585827519,Bitcoin Enters Historically Strong Quarter With 3% Price Gain,"View  Historical data suggests bitcoin could put in a positive performance in the second quarter.  Bitcoin is currently trapped in a pennant pattern on the daily chart. A breakout will likely yield a rally toward $8,000.  A pennant breakdown would put the bears in a commanding position and open the doors to $5,000.    Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the historically strong second quarter on a positive note, scoring gains overnight despite further losses on Wall Street.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose 3.5 percent from $6,420 to $6,650, having closed Q1 2020 with a 10 percent loss, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      See also: Looking for a Halving Payday? Quick Wins in Investing Are Rare      The cryptocurrency remained bid even as the U.S. equities began Q2 on a weak note with the S&P 500 falling 4 percent. Investors shunned risk as President Trump's stark warning on the coronavirus pandemic raised the specter of a prolonged shutdown and deeper economic recession.      Bitcoin printing gains amid the risk-off action in traditional markets is a welcome change for observers who believe the cryptocurrency is a haven asset like gold. The cryptocurrency largely tracked the S&P 500 in March as fears of a coronavirus-led recession triggered a global dash for cash.    Bullish season    Historical data shows bitcoin has put in a positive performance in six out of the last eight years, as seen below.      Sellers had an upper hand in the second quarter of 2013 and 2018, but the losses were restricted to single digits. The 161 percent rally seen in the second quarter of 2019 is the third biggest quarterly gain on record.      Many analysts are of the opinion that the massive money-printing efforts recently announced by global governments and central banks amid the Covid-19 crisis could boost bitcoin's appeal as an inflation hedge.      And, while it's far from certain, the mining reward halving – the programmed-in 50 percent reduction in rewards for bitcoin miners due in May – may put upward pressure on prices. ""A bitcoin emission cut of 50 percent is a fundamentally bullish even,"" said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      So bitcoin may repeat history by ending the April to June period in the green. Gains, however, may remain elusive if stock markets see another massive price sell-off, again triggering a liquidity crisis like we saw last month. In that case, investors will likely stay away from the crypto markets.      With the virus outbreak showing no signs of slowing down, the possibility of a deeper stock market crash shouldn't be ruled out. ""The impact of the coronavirus on economies will not be over quickly because there’s been a lot of damage. A gigantic amount of debt has been added and another stock market rout looks imminent,"" said veteran investor Jim Rogers.      From a short-term perspective, the cryptocurrency appears on track to extend the recent rally from lows under $4,000.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has created a pennant pattern on the daily chart, which comprises trendlines connecting higher lows and lower highs. Pennants are considered continuation patterns, meaning they tend to accelerate the preceding bearish or bullish move.      In this case, the pennant has appeared following a rise and could end up paving way for further gains.      A high-volume UTC close above $6,750 would confirm a pennant breakout and open the doors to a re-test of highs near $8,000 seen on March 12.      The outlook, however, would turn bearish if the pennant is breached to the downside. In that case, more sellers may join the market, pushing prices down to $5,000.

42404337,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuca,1585818000,SEC Seeks More Feedback on tZERO's Proposed Security Token Exchange,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is extending the timeline for it to approve or disapprove operations by a security token exchange affiliated with Overstock’s tZERO.      In a letter dated April 1, the SEC presumably wasn't joking when it said it was looking for analysis and input on the BOX Options Exchange’s proposed rule changes to commence operations of its new Boston Security Token Exchange (BSTX).      BSTX, a joint venture between BOX and tZERO, filed rule change proposals detailing its operations last year. BOX more recently filed an amendment to one of its proposals, increasing the number of market makers and heightening its listing standards.      In Wednesday’s document, touching on one of these proposals, the SEC said it specifically wants feedback on whether the proposed exchange’s operations are consistent with parts of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as whether the information it has provided so far are sufficient to make a ruling on approval.      The commission warned that if not adequately addressed, these hurdles would be grounds for disapproval.      Third parties can weigh in on the proposal either online or by emailing the SEC (those who email should include “File Number SR-BOX-2019-37” in the subject line). They have three weeks from the document’s publication in the Federal Register to submit initial thoughts, and a further two weeks to offer any rebuttals to others’ comments.      “The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange’s statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice,72 in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change,” the document said.    Headwinds    A number of concerns have been raised around the BSTX proposal by third parties. On March 27, Nasdaq Senior Vice President Joan C. Conley wrote a letter to the SEC raising concerns about how the proposal placed an “unreasonable burden on competition” due to the underlying blockchain technology (distributed ledger).      Conley stated the technology used to track ownership of the security token would not share a common distributed ledger. Instead, BOX would be the sole user, retaining exclusive ownership that would place other exchanges at a competitive disadvantage.      ""The most salient characteristic – indeed, the only unique characteristic – of the security token is its use of blockchain technology,"" Conley wrote. ""To avail itself of blockchain technology, the purchaser must be a BSTX Participant. Non-BSTX Participants would be subject to 'omnibus' blockchain reporting.""      This would, in effect, allow BOX to promote trading of some securities in its own favor because other exchanges would be unable to trade these tokens, she wrote.      The Nasdaq stock exchange also questioned what it saw as insufficient detail relating to digital securities infrastructure and its compatibility with existing equities market infrastructure as well as the impact on anti-fraud, customer protection and possible investor confusion.      “Nasdaq recommends that BOX submit additional detail addressing these concerns before the proposal is approved,” the exchange said.    Market Impact    The comments follow other concerns expressed by David Shrader of the Paykin Krieg & Adams law firm, Ellen Greene with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and Benjamin Connault of the IEX stock exchange, among others.      Greene and Shrader both indicated the filing documents around the exchange had not been widely disseminated to the broader securities market. All three wrote that more time is needed to consider the proposed rule changes.      In her letter, Greene wrote that “SIFMA remains concerned that approval of the collective filings could be a significant change for the equities markets,.""      Shrader, writing on a client’s behalf, went further, saying that BSTX needs to provide more clarity around how security tokens would settle, how market participants would verify ownership of a security token in compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules, as well as a number of other issues.      Indeed, BSTX needs to clarify why a blockchain-based exchange would be superior to a traditional one, he wrote.      “It seems likely that the introduction and use of ‘Security Tokens’ will create undue burden on market participants, exchanges, custodians, clearing firms, retail and institutional investors,” Schrader wrote.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/02/sec-seeks-more-feedback-on-tzeros-proposed-security-token-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/792e42a01f6a058beaa40bb99316fc04aab31dad-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404348,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhuhV,1585814400,Looking for a Halving Payday? Quick Wins in Investing Are Rare,"Osho Jha is an investor, data scientist and tech company executive who enjoys finding and analyzing unique data sets for investing in both public and private markets.      Many bullish investment theses for bitcoin are grounded in expectations that the upcoming halving of block rewards will cause the bitcoin (BTC) price to increase. Previous supply constrictions, from 50 BTC to 25 BTC and 25 BTC to, where we currently stand, at 12.5 BTC, have had that effect. Still, given the rare nature of these events, our data points are limited and increase the anticipation and speculation around upcoming halving some time in May 2020.      There are many great pieces on the mechanics of a BTC halving and how they were described in the original white paper and subsequently coded into the structure of bitcoin. So I will assume familiarity with these concepts going forward as we try to understand the supply constriction narrative of the halving thesis.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Unfortunately, many investors are pointing to the halving as a catalyst for a price increase in the face of a difficult bitcoin market, which has had three straight quarters of negative returns, and have set sky high expectations for what sort of price action we may see after. I certainly believe that the halving will have a positive impact on price, but I am concerned by investors expecting parabolic gains in the fashion of 2017.      As it currently stands, the bullish thesis around the halving is that as block rewards get cut in half, the number of miners able to sustain their operations will decline. Since fewer BTC are being brought into circulation, there should also be some reduced sell pressure as miners often sell BTC to fund operations in their local currency. One could then conclude that the supply constriction will allow the price to appreciate.      While I generally believe this thesis to be sound, I think it hinges on the assumption that a drop in block rewards will force miners offline, and that demand for bitcoin will not decline and this merits further analysis.    Miner breakdown    Mining is a difficult game of balancing BTC inflows with fixed cost outflows of hard dollars. Their most prevalent cost is electricity. In order to cover this cost, miners sell BTC, creating a consistent sell pressure in the market.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      Next-gen miners are more efficient on a hashes-to-electricity-consumption basis helping alleviate some of concerns around electricity cost. According to recent research piece by BlockWare Solutions, a large distributor of mining rigs in North America, roughly 62 percent of miners are using new-gen miners (the Bitmain S17 and up) and 38 percent are using old-gen miners (the Bitmain S9 and below). The table below, from BlockWare Solutions, shows a breakdown of the mining landscape based on their internal data, which has insight into 20 percent of the total hash rate on the network.      I believe the recent downward price action has already caused a miner capitulation, which is reflected in the recent drop in hash rate and the compensating downward adjustment of difficulty. At current bitcoin prices (roughly $6200), 19 percent of bitcoin miners are operating at a loss. With the halving being a doubling of break-even price, we can see that roughly an additional 38 percent of miners will join them. That’s roughly 57 percent of the market in. And while that constitutes a majority of the hash power, the reality is that miners can and often do operate below break-even prices. To sustain themselves, they sell bitcoin from their own treasury, adding to the selling pressure.      See also: CoinDesk Report - Bitcoin: The Halving and Why It Matters      While the halving will certainly take miners offline, I believe this will be a gradual change as opposed to an instantaneous change. It will likely be preceded by additional selling pressure from miners operating below break-even costs, unless there is a substantial spike in price or consistent decline in difficulty allowing these miners to stay online.    Price action as a gauge for demand    “Isn’t it priced in?” is the most common question I hear from both short term traders and long term investors. I find this question to be shallow because it is nearly impossible to answer for any asset, let alone one as nascent as bitcoin. Despite the steady press coverage, I feel that the true impact of the halving is not priced in – certainly not outside the core long term BTC holders.    Investing is a matter of patience. The halving will bring a positive impact to price but we should be measured in our expectations.    Current futures price would suggest market participants are unaware of a halving or do not expect it to have a big impact on price with post halving expiry contracts trading in line with pre halving expiry contracts.      Historically, bitcoin has had large run-ups in the year leading into the halving followed by parabolic gains in the year after.    Mature markets require patience    While this narrative was certainly compelling in the summer of 2019 with bitcoin peaking around $13k, bitcoin is currently up 20 percent on a year over year (Y/Y) basis. This is still a phenomenal return, especially compared to the -13 percent Y/Y return in SPY – the exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500. Since the returns leading into the 2020 halving are compressed compared to the parabolic returns leading into the past two halvings, the returns after the 2020 halving should be positive but more constrained.      A measured response is in no way a condemnation of the halving thesis. It is the natural evolution of an asset class that is becoming understood by a broader market. Recent price action has been encouraging as the market has been able to absorb the selling pressure created by miners in the face of a large price decline due to a global flight to USD. While the price decline was substantial and primarily driven by short-term holders, the ensuing stability in the $6,000 range is positive and shows that demand for bitcoin has remained strong. With stablecoin capitalizations at an all time high, there is plenty of capital on the sidelines, but as markets mature, a singular, well broadcast event rarely causes outsized impact on price after the fact – certainly not one as talked about as BTC’s halving.      See also: How Financial Models Could Move Bitcoin’s Price After the Halving      Early in its life BTC traded like a venture investment. Even in 2017, the crypto boom was fueled by a belief that distributed ledger technology would revolutionize all industries and that adoption of digital cash was close. But bitcoin is unique in being both a technology and a representation of strong money principles – digital gold. Its strong money principles are encompassed in a self correcting system incentivizing miners while slowing the rate at which this fixed supply asset is trickled out. I believe we will look back at bitcoin’s third halving and instead of parabolic gains see bitcoin come into its own during a period of global macro distress.      Quick gains usually turn into quick losses. Investing is a matter of patience. The halving will bring a positive impact to price but we should be measured in our expectations. Current actions by central banks around the world have given more positive catalysts to bitcoin than a singular event. Macro trends (such as the debasement of the U.S. dollar by the Federal Reserve) occur slowly and we have yet to see the impact of these events in traditional markets, let alone bitcoin. Patience and measured expectations are key in this market. After all, no asset has rewarded those two principles as handsomely as bitcoin.

The intergovernmental standards group published its assessment of the U.S.’s compliance with its banking rules, evaluating laws and regulations around digital assets and other areas on Tuesday.      That’s not to say the U.S. is completely in line with the current “New Technologies” standards, known by FATF as “Recommendation 15,” though. The most powerful member of FATF’s global financial crimes network retains “minor deficiencies.”      For example, U.S.-registered money services businesses need only keep detailed records for transactions of $3,000 or more. That’s three times higher than FATF’s required due diligence trigger, and could, in the watchdog’s view, let bad actors slip through.      “This higher threshold is not clearly supported by low ML/TF risks,” FATF wrote.      U.S regulators also lag in their investigation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) businesses, according to FATF. Their strategy “does not specifically identify higher risk virtual asset service providers (VASP),” making their “various” examinations of high-volume exchanges and peer-to-peer networks insufficient.      “Therefore, it is not entirely clear whether the current approach is sufficiently risk focused, especially since only 30% of all registered CVC providers have been inspected since 2014,” FATF wrote.      Legislative gaps could also allow extremely niche VASP activity to evade detection and enforcement. A U.S.-registered VASP that only did businesses with non-U.S. persons would not, apparently, be subject to current law.
