42426124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIil3h,1412890593,BitFury Raises $20 Million to Power New ASIC Chip Development,"UPDATE (10th October, 14:30 BST): Updated with comment from BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov.      BitFury has raised $20m in additional funding to complete development of its 28nm ASIC chip capable of achieving energy efficiency of 0.2 joules-per-gigahash (J/GH) and first announced in September.  The pre-Series B round marks the second time this year BitFury has raised $20m in new funding, following its initial Series A in May. The funding was largely contributed by existing investors including venture capitalist Bill Tai, current BitFury board member and former VeriFone CFO Bob Dykes and the Georgian Co-Investment Fund. Google Maps founder and noted software developer Lars Rasmussen also participated in the round.  BitFury founder and CEO Valery Vavilov indicated that the new funding will allow the company to complete production of its 28nm ASIC chip without selling the reserve bitcoins it has mined from its three industrial-scale data centres.  Vavilov stressed in statements that the funding round, as well as the speed with which the capital was acquired, should do much to position BitFury as an industry leader in the bitcoin mining space, saying:  ""Building on the success of our Series A funding, it was great to witness continued investors’ trust and excitement in BitFury. The fact that we closed this funding round in less than a week is a testament to investors’ trust in our business model and execution capabilities.""  Vavilov told CoinDesk that it decided not to tap its bitcoin reserves as it remains bullish on the long-term value of bitcoin.  ""We believe in the long-term perspective [the price of bitcoin] will grow and we decided to not to sell [our bitcoin] at such a low price,"" Vavilov added.  The news notably follows KnCMiner's $14m Series A announced in September, a figure which accounted for all of the mining sector's third-quarter fundraising, according to the CoinDesk State of Bitcoin Q3 2014 report.  Data center competition  BitFury further indicated it would use the funds to increase the capacity of its data centers to 100 megawatts, up from roughly 40 megawatts, a move it suggested would allow it to maintain its competitive edge in a transaction processing market that is developing at a rapid pace.  Vavilov said that BitFury's industry expertise and current electricity access will enable this transition in what he described as a ""very short period of time"".  The company first announced its ambitions for the enhanced data centre production in September, as part of its ""roadmap for sustained industry leadership"" which sought to chart its development path into next year. As suggested by the company at the time, the 100 megawatt goal would do much to ensure it remains a leader in the bitcoin mining space.  By comparison, competitor MegaBigPower provides bitcoin mining hardware for franchisees who, in turn, operate industrial mining centres with between 1 megawatt to 5 megawatts of power.  The company, styled as a decentralized alternative to other industrial mining companies, enrolled its first franchisee in May, with the facility aiming to hit 50 megawatts of mining power.  Similarly, research from Data Center Knowledge suggests rival KnCMiner had deployed only 5 megawatts worth of mining gear as of July, and planned to only add another 5 megawatts at that time.  ASIC development update  The funding will be used to power the company's development of what it hopes will be industry-leading ASIC chips, as well. BitFury announced in September that it is seeking to achieve energy efficiency of 0.2 J/GH by the fourth quarter of 2014, and sub-0.1 J/GH efficiency by mid-2015.  At the time, BitFury noted that it was focusing on the energy efficiency of its chips, as the metric is key for determining the cost of bitcoin transaction processing, impacting capital costs and operating expenses.  BitFury further promised that it would rely on a new execution methodology that would enable it to more rapidly deliver its chips, ensuring the products arrive at market in a timely fashion.  The chip announcement was notably followed by updates from mining hardware manufacturer CoinTerra, which on 18th September revealed it planned to issue one of the first commercial chips based on 16nm technology in the first quarter of 2015.

42426130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIilBh,1412886505,Philippine Government Bill Could Pave Way for Bitcoin-Backed Money,"A member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines has introduced a bill that would seek to create a government-backed ""e-peso"" that would serve as an official medium of exchange for domestic online payments.  Introduced as part of the E-Peso Act of 2014, the payments tool would be considered legal tender for debt, taxes and goods and services, according to a report by The Philippine Star.  Most notable for the bitcoin industry is that the current version of the bill would mandate that Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country's central bank, study bitcoin and its related technological applications when determining how it will build the proposed platform.  The bill states:  “The BSP will also choose a system that uses peer-to-peer processing of the log chain and shall exert its utmost to leverage existing hardware being used by the other leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.""  Introduced by Pangasinan Representative Kimi Cojuangco, the law would also make the e-peso available at all domestic bank branches. It would further limit the total number of e-pesos in circulation issued in the first two years of operation to P1 billion.  Boon for bitcoin in Philippines  While it is unclear if the bill will gain any traction in government, the fact that bitcoin has been mentioned as a potential solution to the country's payment problems marks a step forward for the technology in what is increasingly being viewed as a key market.  Ron Hose, CEO of local bitcoin exchange and processing provider Coins.ph, told CoinDesk he believes that the e-peso offering could boost bitcoin's credibility domestically, and that both bitcoin and the e-peso could co-exist in the market.  Hose told CoinDesk:  ""The borderless nature of bitcoin will augment the e-peso perfectly. The e-peso could help provide a locally stable currency, while bitcoin will provide connectivity to global merchants and financial services.""  Further, Hose promised Coins.ph would do everything it could to encourage the country's Congress to consider the measure.  ""This is an incredible opportunity for the Philippines financial system to leapfrog even the most advanced economies, and it will have tremendous impact on improving the financial inclusion landscape here,"" Hose said. ""It’s going to set the Philippines lightyears ahead of other countries.""  CoinDesk has reached out to Cojuangco, the lawmaker who introduced the bill, but at press time had not received a response.  Emerging markets seek payment solutions  Though still in its early stages, the emergence of bitcoin as part of the country's national payments conversation starkly contrasts approaches taken by other governments seeking to adopt similar initiatives.  For example, this July, the South American nation of Ecuador announced that it would introduce its own digital money. However, in the process it sought to effectively ban decentralized alternatives such as bitcoin and other digital currencies.  There, local bitcoin advocates have told CoinDesk that while they are seeking to engage lawmakers about the potential benefits of bitcoin, such conversations have not yet lead to any formal discussions about larger changes in policy.  Likewise, Peso Digital, a Mexico-based project, is seeking to encourage the country's central bank to explore block chain technology, though discussions are allegedly in very early and exploratory stages.

42426120,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIil1h,1412881854,Star Korean VC Invests $200k in Bitcoin Startup Devign Labs,"Devign Lab has closed a $200,000 seed funding round it will use to build a suite of applications including a peer-to-peer marketplace and merchant payments tools for the Korean market.  K Cube Ventures  , a Korean venture firm chaired by Brian Kim, one of the country's most successful Internet entrepreneurs, provided the investment. Kim helped start KakaoTalk, a popular mobile chat application that reported 140 million users last year. This is K Cube's first bitcoin investment.  Devign Lab has built a peer-to-peer marketplace called Coinone. The marketplace allows users to trade for free with an order book that's updated in real-time.  The company's chief executive Myunghun Cha said that Korean bitcoin startups could continue to see strong interest from venture capital firms due to the technological proficiency of the country's consumers.  Cha said:  ""Korea has optimal conditions for bitcoin. Smartphone [penetration] rate is the highest in the world and Internet population is also [among] the highest levels. Moreover, Koreans are the fastest responders to new technology, that's why many global companies use the Korean market as a testbed.""  The round brings total investment in bitcoin startups in the country to $7.1m across three companies, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin venture capital tracker  Fee-free model  Cha said Devign Lab's goal will be to build its userbase by offering free transactions on Coinone, with revenue coming from future applications built on top of the platform. One of those applications is a merchant tools platform called Coinpay.  Coinpay would be linked to Coinone and allow merchants to easily accept bitcoin payments in exchange for South Korean won. The platform is still in development, Cha said, and is planned for a November release. He said no merchants have been signed up yet.  Cha, however, is keen to talk up his technical credentials. He led a team of hackers to a third-place finish in 2009's edition of Capture the Flag at DEFCON, the top hacking convention. The competition involves securing or breaking into a machine on an isolated network.  He has competed in the final rounds of that competition in 2011 and 2012.  Booming investment environment  Devign Lab's funding round comes on the back of funding announcements from local rival Coinplug, a 'universal' platform provider that runs an exchange, merchant payments tools and deploys bitcoin ATMs. Coinplug raised $2.5m in a new round this week that included Tim Draper and the venture capital arm of financial services giant Mirae Asset.  Coinplug is targeting younger consumers who don't qualify for credit cards with prepaid bitcoin credit cards that will be nationally distributed at the end of the month, its chief executive said.  Another firm, Korbit, which also provides a universal platform, closed a $3m Series A round in August from a host of investors with financial markets pedigree, including Pantera Capital, Softbank Ventures Korea, Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp and Tim Draper.  Korbit claims to have 25,000 users and 400 merchants on its platform, and it counts big brands like Nescafe among its users.  High-tech sophistication  Devign Lab's Cha further attributed investors' growing interest in the space to favourable local technology infrastructure.  Korea is ranked second in global smartphone penetration, behind the United Arab Emirates, according to research commissioned by Google. Korea has among the largest Internet-connected populations on Earth, with 41 million Internet users, placing it 12th on the global ranking in 2012.  Cha admitted that using bitcoin is not a mainstream activity in Korea yet, although he pointed out that this provided startups like his with plenty of room for growth.  ""The current bitcoin market in Korea is small, considering its high potential. That's why bitcoin startups in Korea can raise good funding [rounds],"" he said.

42426116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikph,1412872297,Russia's Startups Seek Refuge Abroad Under Threat of Bitcoin Ban,"Due to Russia's status as the ninth-largest economy in the world, its rising interest in non-cash transactions and its evolving payments ecosystem, the country has unsurprisingly been a market of interest for the bitcoin community, both domestically and internationally.  However ripe for disruption the Russian market might be because of these factors, though, the country's parliament may soon cast the deciding vote as to whether bitcoin will play any role in country's ongoing payments upheaval.  On 1st August, Russia's Ministry of Finance announced a draft bill that, if approved, would standardize the country's definition of 'money surrogate', banning all forms of value that may fall into this category, including bitcoin and alternative digital currencies.  Last week, the regulator doubled down on its restrictive stance toward bitcoin, revealing monetary penalties for those who use or even advocate for bitcoin in the full text.  Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at Tolkachev & Partners, a law firm that has long advised regional startups, told CoinDesk that this looming threat has led him to actively encourage his clients to take their businesses to safer jurisdictions.  Tolkachev told CoinDesk:  ""Due to the negative attitude of Russian authorities to cryptocurrencies, we're advising most of our clients to structure their business in foreign jurisdictions. Most of our clients are starting to operate outside Russia.""  Tolkachev, who rose to prominence in the local bitcoin community as the author of an early and influential report on the industry, said that many of his clients are taking his advice, basing their operations in other countries to avoid the potential impact of the bill.  ""The adoption of the bill in [its current] wording will literally mean that bitcoin is illegal in Russia and one can hardly help bitcoin business after this step,"" he said, adding:  ""Actually, the only possibility that will be left for them is to move to a better jurisdiction, to one of the emerging bitcoin paradises.""  Seeking refuge abroad  Tolkachev connected CoinDesk with two startups lead by Russian entrepreneurs, who agreed to share their stories about their struggle to serve the market.  Vladimir Chelpanov, CEO of bitcoin stealth startup ALFAcoins, for example, has opted to incorporate his business in the British Virgin Islands as it seeks to identify new target markets for its services.  ""We started the business as [a] cryptocurrency payment processing service for stores in Russia, but, under huge changes in the market, we were forced to reorientate the company to international markets,"" Chelpanov explained.  For now, he believes the draft bill will lock not only ALFAcoins, but other entrepreneurs out of what he called the world's fourth-largest bitcoin market after China, the US and Europe, although this may not result in a substantial migration.  ""No Russian companies are officially involved in bitcoin business,"" he said.  Anton Vereshchagin, founder of bitcoin exchange InterMoneyExchange Corp, has been more active at trying to engage regulators in dialogue, though his company is now registered in Belize.  Vereshchagin said his attorneys had been writing letters to the Bank of Russia, seeking clarity, but suggested that communications have stalled.  ""The answers were not exact, but it was before the recent updates,"" he said.  An alternative market  Vereshchagin, however, is still watching the Russian market, which he cited as a potential target due to the large amount of underbanked citizens and the rising popularity of alternative online payment methods.  ""The Russian market is quite interesting, so we were hoping for better news,"" he said. ""I always hope for the best, but am getting ready for the worst. I will be glad to be mistaken, but right now the chances are pretty low.""  InterMoneyExchange Corp has now turned its focus to the European market, recently adding Sofort Banking as a payment method to enable users in 10 European countries to purchase bitcoin, a move that could be embraced by other Russian bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Pavel Ivanov, a Russian native and the PR manager of digital currency exchange platform, EXMO, for example, is following a similar path.  Launched in 2013, the UK-based company seeks to provide a full suite of brokerage and trading services to appeal to European miners, traders and consumers, and has grown from its roots in Russia to serve the wider European and global market.  While EXMO has a diversified market presence, it still provides its service to the Russian ecosystem. It also sponsors and appears at conferences such as the recent CryptoForum, held in St Petersburg this August.  Unlike many of his peers, Ivanov was personally dismissive of the new law, seeing the draft bill as an early and uniformed reaction from the government; one that will eventually give way to greater understanding of digital currency and its utility.  Hopefuls soldier on  Still, reactions to the latest statements from the country are mixed, with some startups choosing to continue with their go-to-market strategies until the laws are finalized.  Intercoin Bank  (ICB), for instance, launched its universal bitcoin services platform on 29th August. The startup estimated it had registered 700 users before the most recent Ministry of Finance warning, although it says it has struggled to translate this interest into deposit activity.  ICB told CoinDesk that it has a 10-person team based in Moscow and Kazan. The platform, which has been in development for seven months, styles itself as a bitcoin bank, offering exchange, payment processing and deposit services – sophisticated offerings that could be transitioned to other markets.  Speaking through an interpreter, the company said ICB is currently only targeting the Russian market, although its legal team is exploring potential backup plans.  ""Territorially they are located in Russia, but the laws [there] are constantly tightening, so the lawyers are trying to find new ways of operating in these conditions,"" the interpreter said in an interview held before the most recent Ministry of Finance statements.  Bitcoin media unperturbed  Even in the face of potential monetary damages, local community news sources and blogs maintain that they will keep publishing up until and after the bill is passed.  Russian news blog Coinside.ru, for example, said its business has nothing to fear from the new laws, as its website is located in Europe.  ""We're not afraid. If they ban Coinside.ru in Russia, we'll just move to another mirror,"" the company told CoinDesk.  Ivan Tikhonov, founder of popular and influential bitcoin security forum BTCsec, was similarly dismissive of the draft bill before the latest penalties for bitcoin promotion were included. He explained that BTCsec has no servers in Russia and that it doesn't use Russian registrars or other services.  Tikhonov said:  ""If the site will violate any laws, authorities can simply close the access to it in Russia, this practice is now widely used.""  BTCsec.com, he claims, has been the largest Russian-language information resource on bitcoin since it was founded 2011, serving Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia, Lithuania and many other countries in addition to Russia. The website leverages a unique publishing model, rewarding users in bitcoins for publishing popular news.  BTCsec will respond to any regulatory changes as they arise, Tikhonov suggested, and may be open to changing its publishing behavior if necessary.  When asked about the latest addition of monetary penalties, Tikhonov said optimistically: ""This law is not in force. Terms are subject to change.""

42426111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikdh,1412858411,Hackers Hijack Retailers' Showroom PCs for Cryptocurrency Mining,"Dutch hackers have started hijacking laptops showcased in retail stores and using them for cryptocurrency mining, according to a report.  The stores involved have admitted that an undisclosed number of display samples were affected by malware and said they would take steps to eliminate the practice.  Dutch tech publication Computerworld reported the problem on 7th October after a computer science student revealed that laptops in the Media Markt chain of shops have been exposed to mining malware for some months.  Computerworld found that a total of 105 laptops were part of a botnet and that an estimated €500 had been generated in mining revenue over that time.  Media-Saturn Netherlands, owner of Media Markt, said it should not be possible to run malware on the machines as ""a display model should require the password of an administrator"", adding:  ""We will consult with our locations and suppliers [...] Where necessary, we will come up with new or more stringent protocols.""  Several other stores were found to have a risk of malware, namely Paradigit, MyCom and Computerlandhttp://www.computerland.nl/default.aspx, according to the report.  Seeking solutions  Upon further examination, the reporters found that the retail stores in question suffered from lax security that made it easy for malicious individuals to access the computers and install malware.  In addition to mining cryptocurrencies, the attackers also used the infected machines to steal personal data and spy on visitors using the webcams.  BAS Group, the owner of MyCom, Dixons and iCentre stores, said it was not surprised by the problems, but that it was seeking solutions that ensure the malware would not be accessible to consumers.  BAS CIO Lub Ten Napel described the problem as a ""delicate situation"", since the stores have to provide Internet access on showroom computers, meaning they cannot offer maximum security without undermining the customer experience.  ""We once taped webcams, but customers want to test everything and therefore the tapes had to go off. Also, we have posted memos that warn visitors of the dangers, but those kinds of warnings scare off consumers too,"" he said.  Boosting security  The BAS Group currently operates 200 stores and caters to 160,000 shoppers each month. Ten Napel said the company is looking into ways of improving security, while at the same time allowing shoppers to try potential purchases  It is possible to run some laptops in 'kiosk mode', which limits access on display models. However, that functionality is only available on relatively new Windows 8.x systems and is not necessarily installed on store PCs.  The company indicated it plans to start running more showroom samples in kiosk mode as soon as possible.  The student who originally tipped off Computerworld argues that Internet access on store samples could be restricted, along with USB functionality. Furthermore, hard drives could also be wiped overnight, rendering the machines safe the next morning.  Low returns  Bitcoin mining malware has been around for some time and it is still spreading, despite the fact that it is practically obsolete.  A recent McAfee report found that mining botnets were rendered futile due to the increase in bitcoin mining difficulty, but cybercriminals are still opting to use them in the hopes of easy gains.  Bitcoin mining malware is widely available online, and many malware designers choose to integrate it in their malicious software as an option for buyers.  However, the heat and noise produced by illicit bitcoin mining is easy to spot, leading to greater botnet attrition rates, while at the same time generating little in the way of profits for the attacker.

42426115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiklh,1412833834,'Bitcoin Guru' Andreas Antonopoulos Appears Before Canadian Senate,"Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos today appeared before the Canadian Senate to make the case for bitcoin's freedom, touting the promise of decentralized financial systems and calling for a better understanding of the technology before regulation is considered.  It was the 11th meeting of the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce's special study on the potential threats, risks and advantages of digital currencies. So far it has seen presentations by members of the bitcoin community and the existing financial and payments industries.  Described by committee chairman Senator Irving Gerstein as an individual ""considered to be the bitcoin guru"", Antonopoulos made a 15-minute introductory presentation before fielding questions from other committee members.  ""He has literally [...] written the book on bitcoin,"" Gerstein quipped.  Opportunities in decentralization  In his introduction, Antonopoulos spoke mainly of the advantages and opportunities presented by a decentralized financial system, over the multiple failings of the current centralized model.  Centralization, he said, made the current financial system fragile and impenetrable to new players, and introduced systemic risks through the multiple layers of regulation required.  This created ""cosy relationships between regulators and industry insiders"" which has led to corruption and financial crises.  Uncharted territory  Pointing out that ""there has never been a large-scale, decentralized, secure network before,"" Antonopoulos said there is a risk that many will try to apply familiar models of past, centralized systems to bitcoin which would prove inefficient and unsuitable, thus weakening security and disempowering its users.""  ""The combination of decentralization and security is the novelty at the heart of bitcoin.""  Most negative experiences in bitcoin to date were the result of trying to apply centralized systems that introduced single points of failure into a network and removed control from users.  Regulated by maths  A decentralized system, Antonopoulos suggested, is actually more secure. Unlike 'pull system' credit card transactions where customers trusted merchants with full access to their accounts, bitcoin's 'push system' left control with users.  Bitcoin transactions could be sent in the clear and unencrypted over open networks without fear of compromise, which allowed the infrastructure to be open to any participant or software application without vetting, authorization or identification.  Contrary to popular belief, he added, bitcoin is not unregulated. It is ""regulated by mathematical algorithm"" and puts core security functions into its users' hands.  ""The ability to innovate without permission at the edge of the bitcoin network is the same fundamental force that has driven internet innovation for 20 years at a frenetic pace, creating enormous value for consumers, economic growth, opportunities and jobs.""  This would in turn drive innovation by providing the opportunity to invent whole new decentralized security mechanisms ""based on innovations like smart contracts, multi-signature escrow, decentralized audits, hardware wallets, and algorithmic proof of reserves"".  Response and questions  Although the Canadian senators' questions were generally positive, they joined their legislative contemporaries around the world by expressing concern that digital currency technology could be used for nefarious purposes like money laundering, terrorism financing, or as Senator Larry Campbell put it, ""ISIS or other whack jobs.""  Antonopoulos' responses to these queries stayed on message: bitcoin is not anonymous, transparency and accountability features are easier to implement than anonymity, and the opportunities to empower people through better access to international financial infrastructure far outweighed the potential for misuse by a tiny minority.  He gave the example of mobile phone technology, which had allowed millions in the developing world to leapfrog over landline technology and its limitations.  To Senator Douglas Black's question about what is needed to allow innovation to continue, and what regulation would he recommend, Antonopoulos replied that it would be best to wait until the technology is better understood by everyone – there are nuances that even those in the bitcoin community don't yet understand, he said.  He asked that digital currencies not be ""contorted into structures made for banks"", as they presented an entirely new financial paradigm.  Mainstreaming bitcoin  Senator Campbell asked if his (age 67) generation is capable of ever understanding bitcoin, when younger ones seemed to get it easily, saying:  ""I don't understand it still and we're on our 11th meeting [...] I've been told to keep my old nose out of it.""  Antonopoulos reminded him that the Internet was initially esoteric and difficult to access. Bitcoin would beat its slow path to user-friendliness, given there is no need to roll out physical infrastructure and the Internet already exists as a medium to distribute the new technology.  He believes it will take about eight years to see mainstream applications that consumers will feel comfortable using.  Network stability  ""There has been no shortage of people trying to hack bitcoin,"" Antonopoulos replied to Senator Stephen Greene's question about whether bitcoin itself was indeed impervious to hacking.  The risks were more to individual wallets than the system as a whole, he explained, and that no-one in five years had been successful at hacking bitcoin itself.  ""A dynamic system that is constantly exposed to threatening stimuli will develop resistance [...] a concept often called 'antifragile'.""  Skepticism and curiosity  Senator Paul Massicotte was more skeptical, querying whether it was wise to reject identification requirements for bitcoin users. ""What you don't see is who's behind the chain,"" he said, pressing the issue in an attempt to get Antonopoulos to admit bitcoin's anonymity could be exploited by criminals.  Antonopoulos pointed out that Visa fraud protection had been contacting him regularly since his arrival in Canada, merely because he was using his credit card in another country. Tying identity to transactions exposes individuals to personal risk, he said, especially when there have been multiple security breaches at companies that possessed such information.  Other questions fielded included the viability and purpose of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, and whether a nation state could conceivably adopt a cryptocurrency as its official currency.  There were also discussions on whether bitcoin's advocates might eventually be proven wrong on economic issues, and how Canadian consumers would be protected from unscrupulous actors if bitcoin were adopted by the masses.  Canada's Senate hearings  The Canadian Senate committee has already heard presentations from the Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency, and the Canadian Payments Association.  Payments industry representatives have included Interac (Canada's national direct-debit network), PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard.  It has also questioned companies and advocates from the bitcoin ecosystem, including BitPay, Canada's Bitcoin Embassy, the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, the Bitcoin Foundation, the Bitcoin Strategy Group, exchange CAVIRTEX and ATM manufacturer BitAccess.  Chairman Gerstein noted he had used a BitAccess machine to purchase 0.18 BTC for himself in the course of the study and appreciated the experience, ""even though I have a substantial loss at this point"".",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/09/bitcoin-guru-andreas-antonopoulos-appears-before-canadian-senate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e74d2c71a1cfed1eee99d12be1576953b04b183-1456x1093.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
