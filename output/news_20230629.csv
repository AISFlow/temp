The recent surge in the price of BTDR shares has seemingly been in response to a $1 million share repurchase plan. The company makes money from self-mining Bitcoin, hosting services, and from selling cloud hash services. Cloud hash appears to be more profitable for Bitdeer than self-mining, which does raise concern about the sustainability of the segment. One of the newest Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners available to investors in the US equity market is Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR). The company has a blended approach that derives revenue from three main sources; self-mining, hosting, and hash-rate sharing. Since my initial coverage of the stock in April, we've received Q1-23 earnings and a share repurchase announcement that has helped double the stock from under $7 at the time of publication to just under $13 per share earlier in June. Data by YCharts That boost to the stock price has catapulted Bitdeer to a market capitalization of well over $1 billion. BTDR is now the third largest public miner by market cap. In this update, we'll look at one of the company's core revenue segments and what might be driving this price action. Q1 Earnings Breakout In Bitdeer's Q1 earnings report , the company reported $72.6 million in revenue for the quarter - a sector revenue figure that is second only to the $73.2 million posted by Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) in the quarter. However, Bitdeer's operating loss for the quarter was just $10.4 million, significantly better than Riot's $66.4 million loss and better than smaller industry peers like Cipher ( CIFR ) and Hut 8 ( HUT ) as well: Data by YCharts A $13.5 million gross profit from revenue was nullified by $18.4 million in SG&A, $12.3 million of which was share-based compensation. However, given the company's operating loss against peers with similar revenue figures, Bitdeer's performance is clearly better by comparison. The company has seemingly benefited from a more diversified business model that pulls well from each of Bitdeer's revenue segments. $13.2 million from self-mining $18.0 million from cloud hash mining $22.1 million from general hosting $16.5 million from membership hosting Against Q1-22, total revenue declined by 19.7% year over year. The company attributes this loss to declines in the price of Bitcoin and a reduction in cloud hash mining orders. The biggest individual segment drop was in the cloud hash mining segment. That was down 55% from $40 million a year ago. I suspect that business segment declining more than the others is due to the unprofitability of the agreements for some of the company's cloud hash customers. The interesting tell from the Q1 report comes from how the company's propriety hash figure breaks out. Of the 18.3 operating EH/s as of March 31st, 5.7 is proprietary - or non-hosted. Of the 5.7 proprietary EH/s, 3.9 is used for self-hosting and 1.8 is used for the cloud hash rate business. Which means that 1.8 EH/s in cloud hash generated $18 million in revenue for Bitdeer while 3.9 EH/s in self-mining only generated $13.2 million. In reading some of the reviews of the service online, I came across many examples of experiences that articulate something similar to this quote from a YouTube review last year: My first plan I bought was a 30 day plan. It cost me in total, I think about 180-185 US dollars and I got back about $150 US dollars. That's not a recipe for success for cloud hash buyers and anyone with a smaller cloud hash plan may be better off simply buying BTC directly rather than gambling on mining returns. It appears somewhat apparent that selling the company's hash rate is a more profitable business than actually mining with the machines. Given that, I could understand keeping more of the proprietary mining capacity for the company if Bitdeer was actively trying to scale a BTC treasury. However, that doesn't appear to be the case. Balance Sheet Despite keeping more of the company's propriety capacity for self-mining even as the cloud hash business is seemingly more profitable, Bitdeer doesn't have any real cryptocurrency treasury to speak of. Though it has more than doubled crypto holdings since the end of 2022, that doubling is coming from a low starting point: Assets (Bitdeer) On the balance sheet, there's a large cash hoard of $173.9 million. The company holds just $4.5 million in crypto and as far as I can tell a breakout of those holdings was not provided in the Q1 report. Though in the company's prospectus there was previously a large allocation to FileCoin ( FIL-USD ) which was recently designated an unregistered security in the SEC's lawsuit against Binance. Liabilities (Bitdeer) On the other side, the company has a $315 million in total liabilities; the majority of which is deferred revenue. Share Repurchase Plan On June 16th, Bitdeer announced a $1 million share repurchase program effective through September 15th of this year. The response to that announcement was substantial as the company's stock rallied from a June 15th close of $7.56 all the way to $11.41 the following day. Given the company's $841 million market cap on the 15th, this was a rather exuberant response to such a small share repurchase agreement and is likely attributable to BTDR having one of the smaller floats in the sector: BTDR RIOT MARA HUT CIFR CLSK Shares Outstanding 111.29M 178.16M 169.97M 221.28M 248.94M 112.69M Float % 24.38% 95.32% 99.42% 99.34% 16.58% 95.69% Insider Shares 84.16M 8.33M 989.05K 1.47M 5.74M 4.85M Insider % 75.62% 4.68% 0.58% 0.66% 2.31% 4.30% Source: Seeking Alpha With a just a 24.4% float, BTDR's shares have the potential to be more volatile than many of the other BTC mining stocks. For instance, consider the 50% intraday price move on June 16th following the repurchase plan announcement. That move came on just 712k share volume - or just 2.6% of the float and 0.6% of the shares outstanding. By comparison, RIOT generally trades anywhere between 10-15% of the company's shares outstanding in a normal session. Furthermore, the idea that the company would be buying back shares at this juncture is somewhat perplexing. I would understand it more if BTDR shares were trading considerably under book value or if there was a meaningful level of positive earnings that the market wasn't respecting. Neither of which appear to be the case here. Investor Takeaways Bitdeer is a fairly unique mining business in the public equity markets because it does have a fairly well-rounded revenue split from multiple different streams. It has a large amount of insider holdings and a management team that appears to have incentivized higher stock prices. I do question how sustainable the cloud hash rate business is long term, though. Cloud hash appears to be a more profitable use of the company's proprietary hash rate but it's coming at the expense of Bitdeer's customers. I think it's telling the segment is down more than 50% over the last year. Churn in that category isn't unexpected given the very different sentiment in Bitcoin from early 2022 to early 2023. It is possible that cloud hash revenue could rebound if Bitcoin's price takes another leg higher and retail Bitcoiners try to get in on the mining action again. There is an argument to be made for selling shovels in a gold rush. I'm just not sure I'd chase BTDR shares as an investment given the volatility potential from this low float name.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614501-bitdeer-top-3-bitcoin-miner-should-it-be?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14332535.jpeg

Despite the recent selling pressure across the sector, the support around this level held, providing bulls a chance to fight back. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $30,458 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. The previous week, the number one crypto by market cap recorded similar price action while other cryptocurrencies experienced losses. Bitcoin About To Explode? Data from crypto options platform Deribit, shared by analyst Tom Dunleavy, shows that over $7 billion in these contracts will expire today, Friday 29th. In other words, today, option holders can exercise their right or obligation to buy/sell BTC and other assets at a specific price, depending on their contract. Over $5 billion of the options contracts are based on Bitcoin, while the rest are based on Ethereum, as seen in the chart below. However, option holders could choose to “roll over” their contracts to a later date. As a result, according to Dunleavy, spot prices could see a spike in buying pressure as major option players hedge their positions. This increased buying pressure could see BTC soaring above the $31,000 mark. Via Twitter, the analyst stated: Big options expiration date for both ETH and BTC tomorrow ETH: ~$2B notional BTC: ~$5B notional If these are rolled into more calls we should see spot buying from dealers to hedge their books; puts opposite story. Either way expect some vol (volatility). As Dunleavy claims, the crypto market is poised for volatility, whichever direction. The chart above shows the Max Pain price for BTC options, which is $26,500. Max Pain is the price Bitcoin must trade to deny most options traders from booking profits. In that sense, the BTC price will likely turn to the downside with a spike in volatility. Beyond $31,000, What’s Next For BTC? Analysis and crypto education firm Blofin recently posted a report on BTC’s short- and long-term risks and scenarios. The firm claims the recent rally was driven by a “hunger for positive news” and a “rebalancing” of internal liquidity. In other words, crypto investors got bullish and took money from altcoins into BTC. However, there is still a liquidity issue within the sector that could limit any rally, but there is a silver lining in this scenario. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? Blofin stated: The decline in the price of BTC will be more limited, with a relatively small probability of falling below $28k, while the upward space is relatively large, and there is even hope for a rebound to $35k and above.

Negative correlation between bitcoin and U.S. equities suggest investors bought the token for diversification.  ""We may be at a generational moment"" in crypto adoption, Hashdex CIO said.  U.S. investors have been piling into bitcoin (BTC) as institutional activity accelerated, driving the recent rally of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  BTC’s price gains and trading volume have concentrated during U.S. market hours recently, and have been the main force behind BTC’s strength, crypto analytics firm K33 Research noted in a report.  Bitcoin has surged 85% so far this year, per CoinDesk data, outperforming most of the crypto market. The price action has come as a slew of financial heavyweights, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Citadel Securities, have become more involved with BTC, spurring investor optimism.  Smaller cryptocurrencies have struggled amid increasing regulatory scrutiny whether they are unregistered securities.

Bitcoin’s latest surge has also coincided with decoupling from the performance of U.S. equities such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, its 30-day correlation turning negative last week for the first time since January 2021, K33 noted.

42410267,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwkqQ,1688071460,Bitcoin Hovers Over $30.3K Despite Renewed Inflation Worries,"Jobless claims dipped, while productivity rose – both unexpectedly.  Digital assets responded with a nothing-to-see-here shrug, mostly rising a little from where they stood 24 hours ago.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at $30,374, a 1% gain from Wednesday, same time. BTC has been on a roller coaster ride the past couple of days, albeit the kiddie version, rising above $31,000 briefly on Tuesday after a news story that Fidelity Investments would join BlackRock in the queue of financial services giants applying for spot bitcoin ETFs, but sinking below $30,000 on Wednesday as investors paused to consider the timing of an SEC approval and inflationary pressures.  On Thursday, Fidelity refiled paperwork for its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, a spot bitcoin ETF.  Read More: Fidelity Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF  “Yes, interest rates in the United States might get hiked again, a recession could be nigh both in America and across Europe,” Nick Rose Ntertsas, CEO and co-founder of NFT platform Ethernity, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “But we’re also seeing central bank interventions across a number of major economies that, in effect, have served as a driver of liquidity. Risk assets in particular respond well to these liquidity plays, and Bitcoin and digital assets are no different.”  Ntertsas added: “Looking ahead, I suspect we have another half year or so of volatility before we see a major upwards surge like that experienced in late 2020 and early 2021. Then the Bitcoin halving will kick in, meaning we’re off to the races.”  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,848, also up 1% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were trading in lightly green-tinted territory, although SOL, the token of the Solano smart contracts blockchain, recently spiked more than 10%.  As CoinDesk reported Thursday, crypto traders on the Solana blockchain have been following the example of Ethereum’s “Liquid staking token” (LST) craze by leveraging their SOL token derivatives in pursuit of lofty yields through an obtuse, re-leveraging process. The trend's emergence follows Drift Protocol’s Tuesday release of a new service, known as “Super staking,” which packages the entire cycle into a one-click operation.  Read More: Liquid Staking Frenzy Spreads to Solana as Drift's 'Super Stake' Offers One-Click Leverage  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of cryptos’ performance, was trading up 1.7%.  Equity markets were mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 rising 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively, on the upbeat U.S. economic data. First-quarter, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter was revised upward to 2%, surpassing expectations for 1.4% growth. And the Labor Department announced that jobless claims for the week ending June 24 fell by 26,000 to 239,000, the largest decline since October 2021 and below expectations of 265,000.  Both figures countered hopes that the economy was cooling and that inflation would continue to wane, enabling central banks to suspend interest rate hikes, which have weighed heavily on asset markets.  At the Banco de Espana Fourth Conference on Financial Stability, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, noted central bank uncertainty about the appropriate inflationary medicine in the months ahead, although he has suggested in recent weeks that the Fed would raise rates in upcoming months.  “Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go,” Powell said, adding: “We see the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.”  Read More: Bitcoin, Ether Hold Steady as Investors Shrug Off Upbeat Economic Data, Rekindled Inflationary Concerns  In an email to CoinDesk earlier this week, Stephane Ouellette, CEO of Toronto-based crypto platform, wrote that the BlackRock and other ETF applications had buoyed markets. “In our view, the largest incremental benefit for the industry from a US-based spot ETF is the continued entry of some of the world's most respected tradfi firms into the space, in spite of the bear market and horrendous 18 months of headlines.” Ouellette wrote.  Ouelette added: “Retail has even more methods of getting passive exposure to BTC. While some US-domiciled retail investors may now be able to buy the US ETF through their basic brokerage accounts, we view the ongoing acceptance of this asset class by firms like Blackrock and Fidelity as the real story.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/29/bitcoin-hovers-over-303k-despite-renewed-inflation-worries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31c50dbca58d2dbd10c61809729b6a1d4d33b921-1702x1070.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14328004,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540391,1688069133,Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30?,"Cardano (ADA) has shown signs of recovery in recent trading sessions, although its price continues to linger near a significant resistance level. In the past 24 hours, ADA witnessed a modest 2% increase, but weekly gains have been erased, resulting in a 7% depreciation on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Slovakian Lawmakers Pass Amendment Lowering Cryptocurrency Taxation The technical outlook has yet to present bullish signals, with both demand and accumulation remaining relatively low. Bitcoin dominance increased while trading within the $30,000 price range. Major altcoins also experienced minor gains in the past few days. Although Bitcoin displayed a bullish trend, its price fluctuated, and other altcoins followed similar patterns. For the Cardano price to experience upward movement, Bitcoin must exhibit another surge from its current price level. If ADA manages to sustain above the current support line with the support of BTC, the altcoin may soon attempt to break through immediate price resistance. The decrease in ADA’s market capitalization indicates the continued influence of bearish sentiment in the market. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was observed to be trading at $0.27, a significant resistance point for the altcoin. Previous price action has indicated that the bulls have faced rejection at this level in the past. Additionally, consolidation has been observed around this price mark. If ADA continues its upward movement, it may attempt to trade near or even surpass the $0.30 level. However, in the case of extended consolidation, ADA could experience a dip towards its support line at $0.26. Notably, the $0.26 level has acted as a bullish order block for the coin, indicating a price reversal and subsequent upward movement after reaching this level. This observation suggests the possibility of incoming bullishness for ADA. Technical Analysis Despite an increase in buying strength, the overall demand for ADA has remained low. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) failing to move above the half-line, indicating that sellers have maintained a strong presence in the market. However, there is an expectation for a potential resurgence in demand if the price manages to surpass the $0.27 zone. Similarly, the price falling below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line indicates that sellers have been driving the price momentum in the market. ADA has exhibited buy signals that suggest a potential price reversal in the near future. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed green histograms, which are tied to buy signals for the coin. This indicates positive momentum for ADA and suggests a potential upward movement in price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Downward Pressure – Will DOGE Bulls Avert A Further Slide? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which provide insights into price volatility and fluctuation, have constricted. This tightening of the bands indicates that the trading range has become tight.

42410282,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwlai,1688067201,"Bitcoin, Ether Hold Steady as Investors Shrug Off Upbeat Economic Data, Rekindled Inflationary Concerns","Initial jobless claims drop sharply, spurring inflationary concerns.  Bitcoin, Ether, and other risk markets were relatively unfazed by the continued strength of the jobs market..  Crypto markets were unfazed by economic data showing stubbornly tight labor markets and unexpectedly strong, quarterly economic growth.  Bitcoin was trading at about $30,500, up more than 1% over the past 24 hours. Ether and most other major cryptos were slightly in positive territory. Inflationary concerns have weighed heavily on investors who fret that central banks will have to raise interest rates again, casting the economy into recession.  Today’s data serves as the front-end rationale to what the FOMC has already stated, but simply delivered after the fact.  Economic growth  The U.S. economy expanded 2% in the first quarter, surpassing expectations of 1.4% growth. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims for the week ending June 24 fell by 26,000 to 239,000, the largest decline since October 2021 and below expectations of 265,000.  The data seemed to offer the latest evidence for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to renew its monetary hawkishness next month after halting rate hikes in early June.  The FOMC increased its peak 2023 interest rate projection to 5.6% from 5.1%, suggesting the group will boost rates two more times this year. And in recent remarks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the FOMC may hike interest rates further.  Also, while initial jobless claims were lower than expected, the four-week average of 257,500 was above consensus forecasts of 251,270. Moving averages often serve to smooth out fluctuations that may occur with individual observations.  Initial jobless claims have generally been pushing higher, which suggests the type of loosening in labor markets for which the FOMC has been yearning.  Asset markets unfazed  Risk markets across the board appear to be confirming what they’ve already baked into their projections. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were all trading slightly higher on Thursday, shrugging off the news as well.  Bitcoin has settled into a sideways trading pattern for the past week, teetering above $30,000 support.  BTC’s Visible Range Volume Profile with an April 2023 start shows the formation of a “high volume node” near $30,000. High volume nodes indicate areas of significant price agreement, often coinciding with strong support and/or resistance levels.  Ether has settled into a similar flat trading pattern, but with less momentum than BTC. Where BTC is riding support, ETH appears to be meeting resistance near $1,900.

ApeCoin is an Ethereum-based native currency of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem launched in March 2022. According to the ApeCoin website, the Ape Foundation was put in place to ensure smooth governance over the ApeCoin DAO and its treasury. The Ape Foundation is overseen by a Special Council, whose purpose is to ""administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community,"" though what that specifically entails is not laid out.  Beginning last Thursday, the DAO opened up a vote to add two members to its Special Council, replacing Siu and Ohanian who had served since the DAO's inception. The new term will begin on July 1 and last for one year.  Voting concluded on Wednesday evening, welcoming pseudonymous ApeCoin DAO community manager Waabam and Bored Ape holder CaptainTrippy to the Special Council. Of the five candidates brought forward, Wabaam earned 31.2% of the vote with 7.7 million APE, while CaptainTrippy took in 29.4% of the vote with 7.3 million APE.  The new recruits will join existing Special Council members Bored Ape G, Gerry and Vera Li. The ApeCoin DAO also filled two Governance Steward seats, bringing in All City BAYC and tiger is fine.  CaptainTrippy previously said in his nomination statement that he hopes to help the ApeCoin DAO community ""align and drive culture forward into the metaverse.”  Both and Ohanian expressed support for the new Special Council members.

42410281,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwlXP,1688064403,Prime Trust Is Having a Bad Month,"Prime Trust may be taken over by the state of Nevada, and the situation seems alarming.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Rough month  The narrative  Prime Trust owes customers more than $80 million in cash that it doesn’t have, court filings this week showed.  Why it matters  Prime Trust, a storied crypto custodian, is only the latest digital asset firm to acknowledge financial issues and face a takeover. But as a custody provider, it occupies a unique space among the various bankruptcies we’ve seen so far.  Breaking it down  On June 8, 2023, my colleague Ian Allison reported that BitGo, a crypto custodian that’s vacuumed up other companies in the past, had begun the process of acquiring Prime Trust, a fellow custody provider.  On June 22, i.e. two weeks later, BitGo walked away from this deal.  That same day, rumors emerged that the state of Nevada had filed a cease-and-desist against Prime Trust, which the state later confirmed by publishing an order which alleged it had a massive deficiency of customer funds and indeed may be insolvent.  Four days after that, the state of Nevada took things a step further, filing for receivership (basically asking for court approval to take over the company) and alleging that Prime Trust a) owed clients about $82 million in fiat that it didn’t have access to and b) lost access to certain crypto wallets in 2021 and so was using customer fiat funds to buy crypto to meet withdrawal requests.  This filing, which was made public on Tuesday, is pretty alarming. It’s got sign-off from Prime Trust’s interim CEO and board, indicating the company is cooperating with the state Financial Institutions Division.  It’s also worth noting that Prime Trust has changed leadership a few times since its founding. The allegations indicate that the custodian used wallets it lost access to in 2021, prior to the current interim CEO’s appointment.  Still, this appears to be the first time these revelations are being publicly disclosed, and the implications are serious.  One of these implications ties to the possible impact to TrueUSD, a stablecoin whose issuer said on June 22 it had “no exposure” to Prime Trust before later acknowledging it had a relatively small amount ($26,000) on the custodian.  Rumors that TrueUSD use Prime Trust to mint and redeem tokens have persisted though, and the token even depegged on Binance.US on Wednesday.  Lawmakers are already paying attention to stablecoin issues, and a bill addressing this sector of the crypto industry is still the most likely to pass through the House before other legislation, so I imagine Congress will take notice if one of the world’s largest stablecoins continues to have issues.  And regulators will of course be paying attention to issues by a regulated custodian.

42410270,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwl0L,1688063546,Liquid Staking Frenzy Spreads to Solana as Drift's 'Super Stake' Offers One-Click Leverage,"Risk-tolerant crypto traders on the Solana blockchain are taking a page from Ethereum’s “Liquid staking token” (LST) craze by leveraging their SOL token derivatives in pursuit of lofty yields.  Their rather obtuse process involves staking SOL tokens for a proxy receipt token called mSOL and then using those mSOL as collateral to borrow SOL – and then swapping that SOL for mSOL again – is reminiscent of the sort of leverage-on-steroids approach long witnessed in other corners of the digital-asset markets.  Drift Protocol, an on-chain crypto trading project for Solana, released a new service Tuesday known as “Super staking,” which packages this entire re-leveraging cycle into a one-click service – in the hopes of catering to a broader appeal.  Digital asset traders have quickly taken up the new offering, according to the team. Drift said its daily active user base hit all-time highs immediately after the launch, highlighting the market’s hunger for annualized yields that can climb as high as 10%.  The trade became so crowded that Drift nearly ran out of SOL tokens to lend out, co-founder Cindy Leow told CoinDesk.  “Definitely a huge success overnight,” Leow said in a Telegram message. “It shows that people are extremely keen on passive/leveraged yields.”  Separately, SOL’s token price jumped in crypto markets over the past 24 hours, up 8.8%, making it one of the day’s top performers among digital assets tracked by Messari with a market cap of at least $500 million.  LSTs and mSol: How it works  The yields generated by Drift’s Super Stake come from mSOL, a LST issued to SOL stakers that use Marinade Finance. mSOL tokens appreciate over time as their underlying SOL tokens accrue interest from Solana’s proof-of-stake processes. The longer a depositor holds mSOL, the more SOL they can expect to get when they redeem their mSOL.  Super Stake levers up this market math by letting holders borrow new SOL against their mSOL – and then staking that SOL for more mSOL. More mSOL means more yield-bearing upside. There’s more risk too: A rapid price move could lead to fast losses and possibly liquidation.  Drift’s Super Stake packages up a yield loop that savvy mSOL holders previously did manually: borrowing SOL against their mSOL collateral and swapping that borrowed SOL for more mSOL – on repeat. Each levered loop-de-loop increases depositors' exposure to the yield accrued by their mSOL tokens; Super Stake maxes out at three times around.  This convoluted procedure is representative of the LST economies popping up on many proof-of-stake blockchains. Market-leader Ethereum has the most mature landscape with Lido’s staked ETH tokens locking up $14 billion in ETH value, per DeFiLlama. Marinade’s mSOL is comparatively tiny at $114 million worth of SOL, but it’s still the biggest LST on Solana.  “People have been doing this manually ever since mSOL came out,” said Marinade’s Head of Communications, Brandon Tucker. “Drift just finally built a nice UI for it.”  Risks of DeFi looping  If mSOL loses value relative to the price of SOL, those SOL borrowers who post mSOL as collateral could get liquidated. Each turn around Super Stake’s loop-de-loop lowers the threshold at which this might happen – increasing risk for the user and the protocol too.  Those risks were on full display during FTX’s collapse last November when Solana’s top on-chain lending venue Solend – the most popular venue for borrowing against mSOL – nearly imploded from an mSOL depegging.  The pseudonymous Soju, who formerly worked at Solend, had to coordinate between lenders and market makers to defend the peg and save the protocol, Discord records show.  “We came very very close to dying that day,” Soju said of Solend this week. The protocol had fatefully planned to launch its own yield loop feature the same time that FTX collapsed. Solend “killed the project” instead.  He said he emerged with a distaste and distrust of leveraged yield loops.  “They underestimate the risk and they’re doing it for little to no gain,” he said of Drift, which isn’t taking a profit from Super Stake – but directs 10% of borrow fees into an “insurance fund” that would backstop the protocol if things go south.  Loew, who calls the addition “a highly requested public good,” said Drift is better-suited to handle market madness than Solend was during FTX’s collapse. A depeg in mSOL would have to be more severe – and also sustained – to shake the protocol or its users.  “If shortfalls do happen, the protocol automatically handles shortfalls with either insurance or social loss without external intervention, in a way Solend's didn't,” she said.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/29/liquid-staking-frenzy-spreads-to-solana-as-drifts-super-stake-offers-one-click-leverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00389ee29018d918edc645c16ea2a5ee840dd1e2-4666x2624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410265,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwkjo,1688061684,6 Factors Advisors Should Consider Before Using an SMA for Digital Assets,"Interest in crypto continues to remain strong among financial advisors, with 73% currently investing in digital assets, according to a recent Fidelity Digital Assets survey of institutional investors. But when offering digital assets such as crypto and NFTs to their clients, advisors are faced with an important question: how will I manage those assets?  Generally, there are two approaches: do it yourself (DIY), or using a Separately Managed Account (SMA), where a third-party manager takes charge of those assets. There’s lots to consider when choosing between the two. Here’s a rundown of the risks and benefits that go along with using an SMA:  1. Expertise and Professional Management  One potential advantage of using an SMA is gaining access to the knowledge base and execution capabilities of a specialized asset manager. From market trends and technological advancements to identifying investment opportunities, these professionals understand the intricacies of digital assets. They also possess the means to act swiftly upon the market intelligence. SMAs also provide advisors with valuable time savings, letting them put a greater focus on client relationships and personalized advice.  Advisors conducting their own research, trading and administrative tasks for digital assets may find it challenging to balance those workstreams with their core duties.  2. Diversification and Risk Management  Market volatility is common for emerging assets like crypto. To offset the associated price swings and unpredictability, asset managers adopt diversified strategies by spreading assets across various currencies and sectors, deploying various investment approaches. This diversification may help curb risk and minimize the impact of market fluctuations, subsequently bolstering portfolio stability.  Advisors who manage their clients’ digital assets independently must consider developing their own risk management models and diversified portfolio strategies, tasks that can be difficult and time-consuming.  3. Access to Advanced Tools and Technology  Asset managers operating SMAs typically use cutting-edge tools, analytics platforms, and trading technologies to perform their daily job functions more efficiently and accurately. These resources, in turn, provide advisors with comprehensive market data, advanced risk management tools, and efficient execution capabilities. Leveraging such tools leads to better decision-making, improved portfolio performance, and enhanced risk management. Although effective, they can be expensive and require a significant allocation of resources for advisors to onboard and manage these systems by themselves.  4. Cost  One potential downside to utilizing an SMA is the added cost. With margins shrinking in an increasingly competitive environment, any additional fees can significantly impact an advisor’s bottom line and book. The value asset managers provide in terms of expertise, risk management and time savings needs to justify the fee. Working with a seasoned asset manager that can drive improved portfolio performance to offset these fees is highly valuable.  5. Control  Another factor to be mindful of when working with an asset manager is the type of control they will require over investment decisions and strategies. Advisors must carefully select asset managers aligned with client goals and investment philosophies. And clients should understand that the performance of their portfolio isn’t dependent on others’ strategies. Establishing strong partnerships and communication channels with asset managers is necessary to help address any concerns.  6. Regulatory and Compliance  The digital asset space is subject to evolving regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements. Using an SMA adds another layer of complexity to navigating these regulations, as advisors must ensure the asset manager operates within legal boundaries and meets all regulatory and compliance obligations. Staying informed and conducting thorough due diligence on the asset manager’s compliance procedures are essential to mitigating these challenges.  In Sum  Leveraging an SMA for managing clients’ assets in the digital asset space presents both advantages and disadvantages for financial advisors. Potential benefits include expertise, efficiency, diversification, and access to advanced tools. However, advisors must also consider the associated costs, investment control and regulatory challenges when evaluating the suitability of an SMA for their clients vs. a DIY approach. Ultimately, a well-informed decision based on the unique circumstances and requirements of each advisor and their clients is key to launching a successful digital asset offering.

Base, which is built on the OP stack in collaboration with Optimism, was announced in February. To battle test the blockchain itself and the OP stack's security, Coinbase commissioned a six-month internal audit from its protocol security team, according to a press release.  The team audited all of Optimism's pre-deployments and smart contracts on both layer 1 and layer 2 to identify potential vulnerabilities of security risks, Coinbase said.  It also used a technique called fuzzing, which consists of finding implementation bugs using malformed code that is injected into existing code through automation. This particular technique was used on crucial components like the layer 2 blockchain bridge to layer 1 and the sequencer.  Cross-chain bridges are used to transfers assets from one blockchain to another and are a commonly used attack vector for hackers and exploiters. Security firm Chainalysis estimated that $2 billion was stolen from crypto bridges in 2022.  Base also engaged more than 100 external security researchers in its efforts to find and fix potential vulnerabilities, the press release added.

Rocket boost for the economy The upper house of the British government, the House of Lords, has voted to pass into law the Financial Services and Markets Bill that will see the UK embark on a path of acceptance of cryptocurrencies as “regulated activity”. Such a bold move from the UK really puts it on the map as regards its announcement last year which stated that it wished to be a global hub for crypto, and flies completely contrary to the anti-crypto environment that permeates the Biden administration in the US. Hailed as a “Rocket Boost for [the] UK economy” on the UK Gov website, the bill aims to make a “technologically advanced financial services sector” that is “open”, and which will “grow the economy”. As well as moving away from the US rejection of the crypto industry, the UK will repeal all the old laws that were passed in Brussels when it was a member of the EU. The UK Gov statement on its website affirmed: “By repealing old EU laws set in Brussels it will unlock billions in investment – cash that can unlock innovation and grow the economy.” The statement also read that today’s act will regulate crypto assets so that they can be safely adopted in the UK. Just as first suggested by Hester Peirce, US SEC commissioner and staunch defender of the innovations brought by the crypto sector, the UK will “establish Sandboxes” where crypto financial technologies can be tested before being released to the market. Crypto gold rush begins as US looks on As the UK government and regulators start to rewrite the financial rule book in order to grease the rails of innovation with full transparency and oversight of its regulators, this move has the potential to set a crypto gold rush in motion. The European Union has its MiCA regulations coming into force in 2024, Hong Kong, with Chinese backing, is opening itself up as a potential go-to crypto hub in Asia, and other jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai are also competing for a share of the crypto industry. Back over the pond in the US things are starting to look more and more gloomy as the SEC with full backing from the government drives the most innovative industry since the Internet away from its shores and into the welcome embrace of the aforementioned countries. The crypto industry will go where it is most welcome - and this certainly is not in the United States of today. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In addition to the aforementioned tax-cutting law, members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the country’s parliament, have further endorsed additional measures that impact cryptocurrency holders. The National Council of the Slovak Republic passed the amendment that will result in a reduction of personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of cryptocurrencies. This tax reduction specifically applies to individuals who have held the cryptocurrencies for a minimum period of one year. The recent vote marked the third reading of the bill in the National Council. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance in Slovakia has projected that the amendment, once implemented, will have a financial impact of approximately 30 million euros per year. Related Reading: Solana Faces Resistance Yet Traders May Find Buying Opportunities Here In a significant development, the Slovakian parliament recently passed another amendment to the constitution. This amendment specifically codifies the right of citizens to utilize cash as a recognized payment method. This action comes in response to discussions surrounding the potential introduction of a digital euro. The government aims to ensure that citizens retain the freedom to choose their preferred form of payment. Citizens will be able to choose cash payment after it has been implemented within the constitution. Drastic Reduction In Crypto Tax Rates Under the new legislation, the tax rate on profits gained from the sale of cryptocurrencies will be reduced to 7%. This marks a significant decrease compared to the current sliding scale tax rates of 19% or 25%. Moreover, the bill includes a provision that exempts payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros ($2,600) from taxation. Furthermore, the bill also addresses the issue of health insurance contributions. It specifically excludes income derived from cryptocurrencies from being subject to a health insurance contribution of 14%. As a member state of the European Union, Slovakia, like other EU countries, has the freedom to establish its own tax regulations and policies concerning cryptocurrencies.

14322080,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540370,1688054437,Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger?,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent performance has been a source of concern for its investors, as the world’s largest cryptocurrency struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. While the currency recently recorded a 12-month high slightly above $31,000, it is now facing potential profit-taking as miners signal a massive $128 Million move. Bitcoin Bulls Brace For Impact According to Yan Allemann, co-founder of Glassnode, the miner’s transfer could lead to significant sell-off pressure in the market. This could cause friction in the current bull run, which has already seen Bitcoin struggle to hold steady at the crucial $30,000 support line. Adding to the uncertainty is that Bollinger Bands, a technical analysis tool used to measure volatility, remains tight despite the low volatility. This has been shown to lead to abrupt market moves in the past, which could cause further complications for Bitcoin bulls. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? The support at $30,000 is crucial for the revival of the uptrend, and investors are now anxiously watching to see how the market reacts to the miner’s move. While Bitcoin has faced similar challenges in the past and managed to overcome them, the current situation is causing some concern among market observers. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s current price stagnation is reflected in its Average Directional Index (ADX) on the daily chart, which is set to spike downward. This ADX movement suggests that Bitcoin’s trend for the next 10 days could be to the downside. This development raises the possibility that Bitcoin might either consolidate for the next week-and-a-half, revisit the $29,600 support line, or even drop further to the $28,300 level if the downside movement persists. Either way, it has been a common price action for Bitcoin for the majority of the year to experience periods of correction or consolidation before taking another uptrend. The current ADX movement and potential downside trend are no exception to this pattern, as seen in the chart above. As Bitcoin corrects or consolidates, the liquidity of late-long positions taken from these levels is likely to be absorbed. This is a natural part of market cycles, and it is not unusual for Bitcoin to experience this type of price action. Once the correction or consolidation phase passes and the late longs liquidity is taken from these levels, Bitcoin may be poised to begin another uptrend. This could potentially result in a 6,000-point uptrend, which has been seen in previous cycles. BTC Faces Further Decline Yan Allemann also pointed out other technical indicators that suggest a short-term reversal in Bitcoin’s price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) peaked at 72.92 over the weekend, which is within the limit of overbought territory. The RSI has since remained in the upper and lower levels, which indicates a possible decrease in buying pressure. Furthermore, the double-top pattern and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also suggest that a short-term reversal in Bitcoin’s price may be imminent. The MACD being overbought, along with the RSI at the top level, adds to this likelihood. Related Reading: Compound (COMP) Surges Nearly 10% In The Past Day, Here’s Why However, there are also positive indicators for Bitcoin’s price. The funding rates remain positive, reflecting bullish sentiment among investors. Additionally, Bitcoin mining stocks have been moving higher, suggesting the potential catalyst for the next major move in Bitcoin’s price. As of now, BTC trades at $30,500, slightly up by 0.5% in the last 24 hours but failing to conquer the $31,000 mark.

According to Rpay, OFAC granted “a license that does not absolve Rpay of its compliance duties, but does eliminate the growing compliance risk,” so the company will have to reject employees of the Venezuelan government.  Gabriel Jiménez, CEO of Rpay, told CoinDesk that the license Rpay obtained from OFAC is similar to the one Visa and Mastercard have to operate in a country like Venezuela. “What is a highlight is that it is a crypto company, the one getting authorization from the Department of Treasury to operate under such difficult conditions,” he stated.  Venezuela's regulatory complexity has already triggered a number of crypto company exits. In 2020, peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange Paxful decided to leave Venezuela citing regulations and its own “risk tolerance,” while in 2022 Uphold, a platform offering cryptocurrency trading and digital asset debit cards, closed its Venezuela operations due to “the increasing complexity of complying with U.S. sanctions.”  Rpay was developed by the team behind the stablecoin protocol Reserve and currently has 600,000 registered in Latin America and 300,000 on a waiting list, Jiménez said. The platform has posted $5.7 billion in cumulative volume since going live in 2020, and it recently adopted the decentralized Electronic Dollar (eUSD) stablecoin, which tracks the US dollar.

The plan also provide for restaking tokens, allowing investors to simultaneously stake the same tokens on multiple projects. And Polygon plans to give developers the ability to ""add new decentralized chains on demand,"" according to a statement – joining competitors including Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync's Matter Labs that have made their networks easier to copy, in the pursuit of fostering broader ecosystems of specialized but compatible blockchains.  Under the new tech stack, Polygon says it will link the various Polygon chains through a shared crypto bridge powered by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, one of this year’s hottest blockchain technologies. CoinDesk reported exclusively earlier this year that Polygon would emphasize ZK technology in its future project roadmap.  ""Unified liquidity is the key to everything in Polygon 2.0,” said Brendan Farmer, the co-founder of Polygon in a press release. “We need to support unlimited scalability, but the entire Polygon 2.0 ecosystem must still feel like using a single chain. The validity of cross-chain transactions is guaranteed by ZK proofs posted to Ethereum, but we want bridging to feel seamless. We can’t make users wait for a chain to generate a proof or settle on Ethereum.”  With the new architecture, a coordination layer would come to exist to confirm cross-chain transactions, while the shared bridge will be powered by ZK proofs.  “With zero knowledge proofs, we can basically bridge or initiate cross-chain transactions in a way that's safe, and in a way that is instant,” Farmer told CoinDesk in an interview.  “And so what we want is this coordination layer for the shared bridge that allows for like an unlimited number of chains, but for those chains to sort of behave in a unified way,” Farmer said. ”For a user, it feels like you're using a single chain.”  Polygon provided this technical description of how it works: ""Native Ethereum tokens will be deposited into a single contract on Ethereum, so when a user transacts across Polygon chains, the corresponding assets will be mapped to the tokens deposited on Ethereum. No need for wrapped tokens and the corresponding UX difficulties."" UX stands for user experience.  The proposal also calls for an emphasis on restaking, which allows users to repurpose their staked crypto to ensure the security of other applications on a blockchain. Many protocols, like Eigenlayer, have recently embraced restaking.  Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder behind the Ethereum blockchain, has expressed reservations about restaking, fearing that it could create systemic risks for blockchains.  “I think restaking is a really nice answer to that question where there will be validators that stake the token in order to validate chains on Polygon,” Farmer said. “They'll be able to not only validate one chain, but they'll be able to restake their tokens to actually serve as decentralized validators.”  The announcement about Polygon’s new architecture and tech stack comes just a few days after it shared a proposal to upgrade its Polygon PoS chain to a zkEVM validium. Polygon has shared that it will also be releasing announcements over the next few weeks on its token, $MATIC, and its governance process.  “I think one of the guiding principles behind Polygon 2.0 is we want to build this sort of foundational piece of the internet, the value layer for the internet,” Farmer said.  Despite Polygon’s series of announcements, its MATIC token is down 30% over the past 30 days, the second worst performance among digital tokens tracked by the analysis firm Messari with a reported market cap of at least $500 million. A major overhang is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s labeling the MATIC token earlier this month as security – a designation that could bring added regulatory scrutiny. Tokens from other layer 2 projects are also down over the past 30 days, but not as much: Optimism has lost 13%, and Arbitrum is down 6%.

42410268,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwktj,1688052147,Apparently It's Very Difficult to Custody Crypto,"With the infamous Mt. Gox, less-infamous Quadriga and a handful of other times crypto companies have entered mainstream awareness for losing millions of dollars of customer funds, we have years of evidence that custodying crypto is apparently quite difficult. And yesterday, we got even more.  On the morning June 22 crypto custody giant BitGo terminated its acquisition of rival Prime Trust, by that afternoon Nevada's Financial Institutions Division (FID) ordered Prime Trust to cease all activities alleging the company’s “overall financial condition had considerably deteriorated.” Yesterday, Nevada’s FID filed to place Prime Trust into receivership.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This escalated quickly for what seems to be a good reason: Prime Trust allegedly owes its clients $85 million in fiat, and has about $3 million in fiat currency on hand. The company also owes a further $69.5 million in crypto, and has $68.6 million in crypto on hand.  It’s not just the number mismatch that has caught eyes, but also the way Prime Trust came to experience this shortfall.  According to the FID filing, Prime Trust is unable to access ""legacy wallets."" Before 2020, Prime Trust managed its customer’s crypto in its own wallets. In 2020, Prime Trust migrated customer assets to Fireblocks’ non-custodial custody platform.  Then, in 2021, after Prime Trust had turnover in its management team, it set up something called ""legacy wallet forwarding"" for clients and had funds sent back to Prime Trust’s old pre-2020 wallets, after issues on the Fireblocks platform. This, it turned out, was a huge mistake.  In December 2021, Prime Trust discovered that it was unable to access those ""legacy"" wallets. Here’s the bombshell from the filing: ""It is understood that from December 2021 to March 2022, to satisfy the withdrawals from the inaccessible Legacy Wallets, Prime Trust purchased additional digital currency using customer money from “omnibus customer accounts.”  There are two major takeaways here.  First, a custodian like Prime Trust not having access to wallets is incomprehensible; the whole point of a custody service is to pay someone to be better at custody than you. This incident completely undermines the marketing pitch and business case used by third-party custodians – the claim that people aren’t smart or brave enough to hold their own crypto, so they should trust a custodian. They’re the experts after all. Apparently, that wasn’t the case with Prime Trust.  And to get in front of the claim, don’t let anyone tell you for a second that Prime Trust is some second-rate firm. Prime Trust was known to be a legitimate, young company with promise. It raised over $100 million in a funding round last year that included FIS, Fin Capital, Mercato Partners and Kraken Ventures, and counted several crypto firms including Swan Bitcoin and Coinbits as clients.  Second, and here’s the main issue: Seriously, how difficult is it to custody crypto for others?  It should be straightforward. You give me crypto, I hold crypto for you, I give it back to you when you want it, and you pay me for those services. This is something individuals are wholly capable of achieving on their own in the world of self-custody. This should be a cakewalk for sophisticated companies that garner nine figures worth of venture funding.  The Prime Trust story is developing, so I’ll refrain from casting final judgment until we know the full story, but there are a few things that need to be fleshed out. How exactly did this happen and what exactly was the “additional digital currency” Prime Trust purchased allegedly using customer money? Was Prime Trust trading crypto in hopes it would make up the difference and pay back customers without a hitch?  If this is the case, then we enter an entirely new world for this story. The counterparty risk associated with custodians is that they might lose your crypto, there shouldn’t be an additional risk associated with the custodian trying to make it back in one trade after they lost your crypto.  Big picture, this is bad news, and not just for Prime Trust customers. If we’re being honest, the situation sends the message that this kind of basic failure is the norm in crypto, not the exception.  See also: Binance Crypto Custody License Application Denied by German Regulator BaFin  As bad as the financial losses are, the larger problem is the apparent coverup by Prime Trust seemingly exposed during its failed acquisition negotiations. (By the way, who on the other side of that table did they think they were going to fool? And how?)  Crypto has a shady mainstream reputation and here’s yet another example of shady behavior. Given Prime Trust’s pedigree, it immediately makes you wonder what other companies – maybe even with a trusted name – are playing fast and loose with user deposits.  Maybe they are. Hopefully they aren’t. But during crypto bull markets where no-name tokens can increase by a factor of 100 or 1,000, maybe they have and gotten away with it.  The issue for the industry is that stories like Mt. Gox, Quadriga and FTX dominate its reputation, casting doubt even on the good firms. And telling people to watch their backs just won't work.

According to a press release, the two firms will work together under the Candy Digital name to create digital experiences for sports franchises like Major League Baseball (MLB), NASCAR and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), as well as entertainment giants such as Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery.  Candy Digital is backed by Michael Novogratz’ digital asset firm Galaxy Digital and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, while Palm NFT Studio has received funding from Microsoft's venture fund M12 and Warner Bros. The former raised a $100 million Series A round in October 2021 at a $1.5 billion valuation, while the latter participated in a $27 million funding round in December 2021.  While Candy Digital’s CEO Scott Lawin will oversee both companies post-merger, Palm NFT co-founder and CEO Daniel Heyman will be appointed as president of Candy Digital.  “We’re thrilled to bring together two teams that have been market leaders in innovation and fan engagement,” Lawin told CoinDesk. “Palm NFT Studio shares Candy’s excitement about the role that digital assets will play as the connective tissue between fans, brands and content in Web3, and we’re looking forward to bringing world-class brands like Warner Bros. Discovery and DC to the Candy platform and community.”  Heyman said in a press release that the combined infrastructure of Candy Digital and Palm NFT Studio will help carry forward its mission of building digital brand experiences.  “Candy Digital and Palm NFT Studio’s unified technology platform scales our ability to create transformative experiences for fans,” said Heyman. “We look forward to working with Candy Digital to build the next generation of digital media and engagement.”  The two companies have previously worked together to roll out NFTs and digital collectibles leveraging each other’s infrastructure. In January 2022, Candy Digital teamed up with MLB to release an NFT collection minted on the Palm blockchain, Palm NFT Studio’s native network.

14320572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540342,1688050832,"Analyst’s Forecast: Bitcoin (BTC) To Hit $310,000 If This Happens","The crypto community is currently in a state of constant speculation as renowned analyst Willy Woo sets forth a prediction suggesting Bitcoin could potentially scale up to a price of $310,000 under a specific set of circumstances. Woo’s hypothesis, which has sparked a flurry of discussions in the crypto community, is hinged on an assumption that notable institutional players might decide to designate a fraction of their assets under management (AUM) to the largest digital currency, Bitcoin. The Theoretical Path To $310,000 Bitcoin Woo breaks down his perspective, detailing that a significant augmentation in Bitcoin’s market cap, coupled with a corresponding increase in its realized cap, could set the stage for this quantum leap in price. However, he underscores that the timing of these potential institutional inflows would significantly determine the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts: Bitcoin (BTC) To Reach $69,000 And Above In 2023 Woo noted: It [BTC potential to $310,000] would really depend on whether they [institutional players] deploy in a bearish or bullish phase of the market but the range would be between $128,000 – $398,000. Right now it’s $310,000. According to Woo, if such investment decisions take place during a bearish market phase, Bitcoin may dip to around $128,000. On the flip side, a bullish market condition could propel BTC to $400,000. Woo’s projections, albeit well-reasoned, were met with a fair share of skepticism, particularly concerning the assumption of institutional asset reallocation towards Bitcoin. Reacting to the doubts, Woo emphasized the hypothetical nature of his argument, stressing that the ultimate control of asset allocation rests with the investors and not the institutions. Investor Decisions VS Wealth Manager Discretion Splitting wealth management into two distinct categories – investor-driven decisions and wealth manager discretion – Woo explained that any large-scale movement toward Bitcoin would likely necessitate the approval of the individual investors represented by these institutions. Tweeting about his analysis, Woo stated that If these institutions “allocated 5% of AUM into BTC,” his calculations project above $300,000 per coin and could vary significantly to below it. However, currently, the estimate stands at $310,000, based on a methodology measuring market cap increase versus realized cap increase. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, Bitcoin currently trades above $30,000 after trading below that price range earlier this month due to its bloodbath from the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit on the two largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. However, following financial giants such as BlackRock expressed acceptance of the crypto market, Bitcoin has seen significant growth up by more than 20% in the past two weeks. Notably, over the past 14 days, more than $100 billion has been added to the crypto market cap.

14320440,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/bybit-vs-etoro-exchange-with-the-best-copy-trading-product,1688049900,Bybit vs. eToro: Exchange With The Best Copy Trading Product,"Several crypto traders crave attention, openly sharing their trades and promoting themselves for others to see and replicate. However, it's critical to be cautious of these traders who only showcase their winning trades. When you examine their profiles, you'll notice a complete absence of losing trades. Instead of blindly following these ""flawless"" traders, platforms like Bybit and eToro offer copy trading functionality. This feature lets you discover traders whose strategies and performance you admire and subscribe to their updates. Once you subscribe to your preferred traders, you can allocate some of your trading funds to them. By activating the autopilot feature on the platform, you can mirror their trades in real-time. It's as simple as finding a trader you resonate with, clicking the ""COPY"" button, and letting the platform take care of the rest. In this article, we review the pros and cons of Bybit and eToro to determine which copy trading product is superior for crypto enthusiasts. But first, what does copy trading mean? What is Copy Trading? Copy trading is a form of investing or trading where individuals replicate the trades or investment strategies of other experienced traders. It allows inexperienced or busy traders to automatically copy the trades executed by professionals in real time, typically through a dedicated platform provided by a brokerage or social trading network. Copy trading usually involves selecting a trader or multiple traders whose performance and strategies align with one's investment goals. Once a trader is chosen, their trades are automatically copied into the investor's trading account. The copied trades are executed proportionally to the investor's available capital, mirroring the actions of the selected trader. This way, investors can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of successful traders without having to actively trade or conduct in-depth market analysis themselves. Copy trading has gained significant popularity in the retail market due to several reasons: Accessibility Copy trading allows retail investors to access the expertise and strategies of professional traders who might otherwise be out of reach. It allows individuals with limited knowledge or time to engage in the crypto market and potentially generate returns. Learning Copy trading can serve as a learning tool for inexperienced traders. By observing and replicating the trades of successful traders, individuals can gain insights into various trading strategies, risk management techniques, and market dynamics. Time-saving Many retail investors have limited time to dedicate to active trading or market research. Copy trading enables them to participate passively in the market while benefiting from the trades of experienced professionals. This eliminates the need for extensive research, analysis, and trade execution. Diversification Copy trading allows investors to diversify their portfolios by following multiple traders with different trading styles and asset preferences. This diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance returns. Due to its rising popularity and the demand from retail investors, copy trading has become a staple offering for Bybit, eToro, and many online trading platforms and exchanges. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to facilitate copy trading, allowing investors to browse and select from a wide range of traders to copy. Some platforms also provide additional features such as performance statistics, risk metrics, and social interaction capabilities to facilitate the decision-making process for investors. Which is Better? Bybit Or eToro To determine which platform has the better copy trading platform, let’s explore the pros and cons of copy trading on both platforms. Pros of Bybit Copy TradingImproved Integration with Derivatives Trading Terminal Bybit has enhanced its platform with direct trading in a Master Trader Subaccount! Copy Trades are integrated with the main Derivatives Trading terminal, allowing investors to effortlessly copy trades from preferred traders on a single tan instead of a separate Copy Trading tab. Full Suite of Derivatives Trading Functions With the integration above, Master Traders can now take advantage of a comprehensive range of trading functions. Previously unavailable in the Copy Trading tab, features like Conditional Orders and Trailing Stops are now accessible to enhance trading capabilities. This integration empowers Master Traders with more tools and flexibility to execute their strategies effectively. Copy Trading via API Master Traders can now execute automated strategies with the support of V3/V5 USDT Perpetual OpenAPI. This integration enables the seamless execution of trading strategies, allowing Master Traders to automate their trading activities and optimize their trading performance. Trading on Autopilot with Third-Party Trading Tools Bybit now allows Master Traders to seamlessly connect their Subaccounts to third-party trading tools, including 3Commas and Insilico Terminal, through API integration. This enables Master Traders to leverage advanced trading features and execute automated strategies for enhanced portfolio management and increased profitability while effectively managing risks. Once the integration is set up, all trades conducted through these third-party tools will automatically synchronize with Bybit, Seamless Account Management Conveniently handle multiple Master Trader Subaccounts with ease. Bybit allows you to efficiently monitor and control all your Subaccounts in one place. Effortless Management of Trades Bybit has introduced an enhanced feature within the Asset Overview section specifically for Master Traders. Selected Derivatives accounts will now be clearly labeled as a ""Copy Trading"" account, providing investors with a clear distinction and easy identification. With this update, investors can access important information such as Unrealized Profit and Loss (PnL), the total profit share you earned, and conveniently export Order and Trade history. This functionality provides a comprehensive view of trading performance, similar to how you would view your regular Bybit account Order and Trade history. Automated Strategies Badge In recognition of the increasing popularity of automated trading strategies among Master Traders, Bybit has introduced a new feature highlighting their usage. Now, when Master Traders employ automated trading strategies, a special badge will be displayed prominently on their profile page. Cons of Bybit Copy TradingUnavailability in the USA Bybit Copy Trading is not currently available for users residing in the United States. This limitation restricts access to the Copy Trading feature for traders based in the USA, limiting their ability to take advantage of Bybit's functionalities. Geographical Restrictions In addition to the unavailability in the USA, Bybit Copy Trading may have other geographical restrictions that limit access to the feature in certain regions. These restrictions can vary depending on local regulations and compliance requirements, which may prevent traders from specific countries or jurisdictions from participating in Copy Trading on the Bybit platform. Pros of eToro Copy TradingChat With A Wide Selection of Traders eToro Copy Trading provides users with a diverse range of traders. Users can explore and select traders based on their performance, trading style, and risk profile. Furthermore, the platform enables users to communicate with the chosen traders, allowing for potential knowledge-sharing and insights. Range of Tradable Assets Depending on the user's location, eToro offers a variety of tradable assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities. This gives users diverse options for diversifying their investment portfolios and taking advantage of different market opportunities. Social Trading Community eToro functions as a social trading platform, allowing users to interact with other members of the eToro community. This social aspect enhances the trading experience by enabling users to share ideas, strategies, and insights with fellow traders. The community aspect fosters collaboration and learning among traders. Cons of eToro Copy TradingExecution Delay One potential drawback of eToro Copy Trading is the possibility of execution delays. Since Copy Trading involves replicating the trades of other traders, there might be a slight delay between the original trade execution and its replication in your account. This delay can result in slight differences in trade prices and potentially impact the overall performance of your copied trades. Inactivity Fees eToro imposes inactivity fees on dormant accounts that have been inactive for a certain period of time. If you're not actively participating in Copy Trading or any other trading activities on the platform, and your account remains inactive for an extended period, eToro may charge inactivity fees. These fees can reduce the profitability of your overall investment and should be considered when using the eToro Copy Trading feature. Verdict Thanks to its recently improved and updated features, Bybit edges out eToro as the exchange with the best copy trading product. Furthermore, eToro offers multiple investment options but provides access to only 80 cryptocurrencies. Bybit, on the other hand, offers over 350 cryptocurrencies, spot trading, futures, margin trading, perpetual swaps, options, and leveraged tokens. It also offers financial services like lending and borrowing. Regarding fees, eToro charges a 1% fee for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, while Bybit offers more competitive fees starting at 0.1%. However, it's important to note that copy trading also carries risks. Past performance does not indicate future results, and blindly copying trades without understanding the underlying strategies and risks can lead to losses. It's crucial for individuals engaging in copy trading to conduct thorough research, diversify their copied trades, and manage their risk effectively.

Royal assent, a purely procedural step following agreement from lawmakers, makes the Financial Services and Markets Bill an Act, and includes measures to bring crypto and stablecoins into the scope of regulation. The bill was last week approved by the upper chamber of Parliament.  The Act ""gives us control of our financial services rulebook,"" following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, enabling regulation of crypto assets to support their safe adoption in the U.K., said Financial Services Minister Andrew Griffith in a statement.  The bill, which was introduced in July 2022, gives regulators more power over the financial system, including crypto. While the bill was debated in Parliament, amendments were added to treat all crypto as a regulated activity and to supervise crypto promotions. The bill will also bring stablecoins into the scope of payments rules.  The U.K.’s Treasury, Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England, and the Payments Systems Regulator will soon be able to introduce and enforce rules to regulate the sector.  The Treasury has been consulting on its proposed rules for the sector since February, in line with the Conservative Government’s objective to turn the country into a crypto hub.

Altcoin Whales Have Displayed One Of The Most Active Days Of 2023 According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, several altcoins have seen transfers worth more than $10 million in value in a single day. Generally, besides centralized platforms like exchanges, only whale investors are capable of moving such a large amount of tokens with individual transactions. Whales are an important part of any cryptocurrency’s ecosystem, as the sheer number of coins that they hold means that they can sometimes have the power to influence the market. Related Reading: Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin Naturally, only a couple of whales making a few sizeable, but still relatively small transfers likely won’t actually produce visible fluctuations on the market, but a few massive transfers may do so. Thus, whenever the whales are highly active (that is, a number of them are making multiple large transactions), the price of the asset that they are trading can become more likely to display volatility. Now, here is a chart from Santiment that shows how the scale of whale activity has recently looked like for the various altcoins in the sector: Many different assets seem to have observed high levels of whale activity recently | Source: Santiment on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the whales of several altcoins moved around a large volume of tokens yesterday. Many of these alts saw major transactions crossing the $10 million mark, making the day the third most active of the year. These large transactions have come while these alts have registered some amount of fluctuations during the past week. It would appear that this market activity has raised the interest of the whales in trading these assets. As mentioned before, whales making such large multiple transactions can result in higher volatility for the prices of these cryptocurrencies. So far, however, since these large transfers have taken place, some of these coins have noticed some volatile price action, while the others have continued to move sideways. From the chart, it’s visible that Polygon (MATIC) in particular saw extreme amounts moved by the whales, but the asset has still only moved 1% in the past day. Nonetheless, it’s possible that volatility could still be coming soon for the asset, so it may be worth keeping an eye on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls As Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Intensify Interestingly, the Tether (USDT) whales have also been quite active recently, suggesting that some large shifts have been taking place. It’s unknown whether these moves are for buying or selling, but if they are a sign of whales exchanging the stablecoin for buying into the other cryptocurrencies, then their prices may feel a bullish effect. MATIC Price At the time of writing, Polygon is trading around $0.63, up 6% in the last week.

Other recommendations include setting up regulations for crypto custody platforms, measures to allow blockchain firms to access banking services and ensuring fair taxation of crypto mining activities.

One such way has been observed in the recent trading activity of Compound (COMP), the governance token tied to the Compound protocol. The asset experienced a significant surge, registering a nearly 10% growth within the past day. Over the last 7 days, COMP has been in an uptrend, and the 10% single-day rise forms part of a larger appreciation pattern. This escalation is noteworthy as the token’s price soared over 50% within just a week. Whale Activity Fuels Price Momentum Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain earlier today shed some light on the reason behind the recent COMP price surge. The firm disclosed on Twitter that a possible whale or institutional investor appears to have made substantial COMP transactions. Related Reading: Over 167 Million BAT Utilized In DeFi Mainly In Compound, Aave And Uniswap According to Lookonchain, “Wallet ‘0x0D5’ transferred 3 million USDT to Binance on June 26 and extracted 50,000 COMP, equating to around $2.26 million, 16 hours ago.” The same entity reportedly withdrew an additional 120,000 COMP, valued at approximately $5.53 million from Binance shortly after. The whale/institution withdrew another 120K $COMP ($5.53M) from #Binance just now. So the rise in the price of $COMP may have something to do with this whale/institution.https://t.co/6LfmjMxaRZ pic.twitter.com/Deh4v260qt — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023 Such considerable transfers often signify bullish behavior and could contribute to the increase in COMP’s price, given their potential influence on the token’s supply and demand dynamics. Compound (COMP) Latest Price Action COMP token price has increased in the past few days, with the governance token breaking multiple resistance levels. COMP is currently trading above $46, up 51.7% over the past week. The token currently has a market capitalization of $321 million, making it rank 109th among the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, the asset has seen an upward trend of nearly 10% in price. COMP has also added more than $100 million to its market cap in the past weeks. The asset market capitalization has surged from a low of below $200 million in the past few days to as high as $321 million as of today. COMP’s daily trading volume has also recorded a significant surge from the $10 million volume seen earlier this month to stand above $90 million in the past 24 hours. COMP currently has a 24-hour low of $38.82 and a 24-hour high of $47.39. Related Reading: Compound Prepares For A Major Rally To $80, Here Is Why Notably, the token’s performance is not limited to the past day or week.

The network joins Transak, which allows people to buy the blockchain's SUI token with fiat money, and Halliday HQ on Sui, a layer 1 blockchain founded by ex-Meta Platforms (META) employees and valued at $2 billion in a September funding round. Sui launched its mainnet in May and hit a peak of 1,007 transactions per second (tps) over the past 30 days, according to SuiExplorer data.  Cross-border payments using cryptocurrency has been a hot topic of late, and the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have both tested cross-border transactions of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the past year. Digital payments firm Strike, meanwhile, recently expanded its Lightning Network payments service to Mexico.  ""Our vision of unlocking the power of on-chain digital assets for the next billion users is being made possible on Sui,"" said Jim Nguyen, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Six Clovers. ""The way to do this is to close the gap between established e-commerce and Web3 commerce, by abstracting the blockchain and making the infrastructure invisible to customers.""

The crypto exchange market is unpredictable and fragmented, making it difficult to value and assess the impact of competition and the institutionalization of crypto as an asset class. A neutral view on Coinbase supports a strategy of writing upside calls and downside cash secured puts to capture price volatility, with the mean reverting level seen within the $55-65 range. Investment thesis Coinbase (COIN) is littered with headwinds, but I believe that each negative is offset by a potential tailwind that essentially places the stock rangebound rather than having a strong bullish or bearish view. There are several unknowns such as the US regulatory landscape concerning the SEC fine, the broader implications for trading in the US and the competitive space for the industry after the launch of the Fidelity/Charles Schwab (SCHW)/Citadel (EDX) exchange launch . Having said that, there is a significant amount of price volatility that could be captured through cash secured puts and call overwriting which can enhance returns within this price range. Factors limiting the upside (headwinds) Declining services and subscriptions revenue Coinbase and the stablecoin issuer Circle (USDC) have a profit-sharing agreement whereby interest payments are made on US dollar deposits which is representative of 32.7% of Coinbase's total revenue in Q1 2023 (see table below). The total market cap for USDC has declined from $44.5bn to now $28.4bn, resulting in a 36% fall year-to-date. This was due to Circle having reserves in the now liquidated Silicon Valley Bank (SIVBQ). The lack of transparency at the time has raised questions about what else lurks behind the scenes and has also resulted in a de-pegging to the US dollar on several occasions which has impacted the usage of the stablecoin. Despite Coinbase opening up USDC rewards to institutional clients and optimising retail rewards, the market cap of USDC has continued to decline. If this trend continues, the amount of interest income will continue to be lower compared to previous quarters which has made up a large part of the shortfall in transaction-based revenues recently. Staking revenue (blockchain rewards) is also vulnerable after the SEC shut down Kraken and may follow through with Coinbase. Although this is a small revenue source, representing 10% of revenue, a potential staking ban will dampen their total services and subscriptions revenues further. To sum up, interest income and blockchain rewards were seen as a reliable and predictable source of revenue which was mitigating the volatility in transaction-based revenue, but as this starts to become more uncertain, a lower valuation is appropriate. Coinbase Impact of a potential SEC fine/ban On the 6th of June, Coinbase were charged by the SEC for operating as an unregistered securities exchange. Whilst I am no lawyer, I do believe that this could take years to play out especially as Coinbase are prepared to fight their corner. The worst-case scenario is that Coinbase are issued a multi-billion dollar fine and a potential banning of alternative crypto asset trading in the US which could fundamentally change the business. 64% of total transaction revenue comes from ex-bitcoin trading. Over the past four quarters, their total transaction-based revenues were $1717.5bn with total revenues being $2720.3bn. So ex-bitcoin trading represents approximately 40.4% ((0.64*1717.5)/2720.3) of total revenues. Approximately 84% of their revenues come from the US and therefore, I estimate that roughly 34% of their US based revenues are coming through alternative crypto trading which would be impacted by a potential ban. However, I do believe that the most likely scenario would be a moderate sized fine with no banning of alternative crypto trading since the adoption is already quite large in the US and is growing internationally. A potential end to this case could also be a positive catalyst in the long run since we would finally have some regulatory closure on the issue. Nevertheless, in the meantime, this litigatory overhang will continue to hurt the upside potential on the stock. Rough Q2 in the making So far, Q2 Bitcoin trading has been rather subdued with price staying in the range of $24.8k to $31k. Trading volumes are also low along with volatility which implies that transaction-based revenues are likely to show a modest decline from Q1 numbers. Most of crypto is still in a winter and projects will need to be delayed given the macroeconomic picture. Stock based compensation is also quite high as a proportion to total operating expenses (currently at 22%) which I believe needs to come down further to under 15%. Coinbase will likely need to cut more R&D spend, which is nearing 40%, and focus more on efficiency and prioritising customer retention. So in anticipation of more cutting in R&D and potentially personnel, I believe that this can hinder growth in the short to medium term. Coinbase, Author Factors creating a floor (tailwinds) Healthy balance sheet Coinbase has piled a large US dollar liquidity balance of $5.3bn which has been their historical approach in crypto winters. I believe they have earnt the reputation of prudently managing their books in times of distress, and although their debt as a percentage of cash has been rising, it's still admirably below a 100% (see below chart), suggesting that they can cover their entire debt with their cash balance. Interest payments are also low, currently at 2.4% of total outstanding debt, suggesting no near-term liquidity issues. It's worth mentioning that 41.7% of their debt expires in 2026 with 29.2% expiring in 2028 and 29.1% expiring in 2031 respectively. So with no near term principal repayments and the big refinancing wall not appearing until 2026, liquidity constraints remain quite low. Coinbase also recently bought back roughly 5% of their 2026 convertible bonds at a 29% discount to par . Although this is small, it's encouraging to see them actively managing their treasury books in opportunistic conditions. In summary, I believe that they have ample access to capital which is rare for the crypto industry, and although stock based compensation remains high, they have levers to pull to streamline the business further if they need to. Coinbase, Bloomberg, Author Q1 earnings had some bright spots Q1 2023 results generated positive EBITDA which was driven mostly by an increase in services and subscriptions-based revenue ($362m vs expected $300-325 in their outlook) and lower R&D and G&A expenses ($607m vs $625-$675m forecast). On their 2023 Q1 report they revealed their active decision to eliminate the discounts made for trading and increasing prices for transactions with the focus being on increasing average revenue per user. Furthermore, it was also interesting to see that they saw an increase in customer deposits of 6.5% for the quarter, which could be due to a flight to quality with the notable failures of Signature and Silvergate Bank. Tying it together, the flight to quality plus the increase in prices worked well for Coinbase and I'm sure this is the message they will try to send as they expand abroad. International opportunities Brian Armstrong ((CEO)) expressed a desire for international expansion with each incremental dollar of capital to be invested abroad. This was also evident by approval for a Bermuda license and Brian taking multiple trips in the EMEA region this year to explore opportunities . They are also looking to expand their derivatives offerings to essentially compete more with Binance internationally. Whilst it's a dirtier game competing with Binance, I would expect for Coinbase to gradually take some market share internationally by their approach of being compliant and transparent via their SEC filings and potentially adhering to regulatory frameworks such as MICA in Europe . If Coinbase can get a MICA passport, not only will they be able to do business fluently within Europe, but it can also provide some level of authenticity internationally, as it shows that Coinbase is following a set of legislation which is comforting for prospective customers. Factors that are tough to call (reasons for volatility) Fragmented industry The crypto exchange market is unpredictable and fragmented with low barriers to entry and exit. Binance controls most of the market worldwide with a 20% share but the others are further down the list at between 2-5%, according to Statista. However, in the US, Coinbase is estimated to have over 75% of the market since Binance and others are unregulated. The launch of the EDX exchange is a potential game changer for Coinbase and the industry. I believe this can be viewed in two ways: Short term: the EDX launch shows that the industry is maturing and the interest from big players is starting to grow. Two weeks ago we saw a filing by BlackRock ( BLK ) for a spot Bitcoin ETF and last week a filing by WisdomTree. This essentially means that the transaction fee pie could grow larger with higher transaction volumes which benefits all including Coinbase in the short term. Long term: EDX launching also means that the space is becoming more and more competitive, especially on the retail side that EDX would cater to in theory. This will add pricing pressure to Coinbase in a market that is already seeing fee compression which will eventually lead to a race to the bottom in trying to retain customers. They will need to add more trading incentives and count on the loyalty of customers which I believe is currently fragile. Customer switching costs are essentially zero since you can open a competitor fast and transfer crypto assets immediately if one platform is more advantageous than the other. Because of the two reasons mentioned above, it makes it difficult to assess the impact of further competition and the institutionalisation of crypto as an asset class for Coinbase in the long term. Challenged valuation Valuing Coinbase is challenging as we don't know whether the company will end up primarily as a broker that deals with just transactions. In this case, Coinbase should have a multiple closer to that of Robinhood (HOOD) or a traditional broking firm that is levered to spikes in crypto prices. On the flip side, it's difficult to determine whether they are on a sustainable path to grow their services and subscriptions-based revenue to greater than 50% which the CEO is aiming for. If this turns out to be the case, a multiple closer to a growing technology firm or a SaaS based company could be more appropriate. In my opinion, each scenario is possible as a base case and therefore, it is tough to build a reliable model for the long term. Of course, if we get clarity on the regulatory side, I believe a positive re-rating of multiples is suitable, but until then it's a waiting game. Technical factors TradingView, Author Because my view is neutral, I believe the condition is great for a strategy that writes upside calls and downside cash secured puts to capture the spikes in implied volatility especially with the news flow that occurs on almost a daily basis, along with the movements in crypto prices. One could be cautious and write puts/calls on days with big swings in volatility within the areas highlighted in the above chart. it's possible to profit from the movements since the mean reverting level seems to be within the $55-65 range. Risk factors and mitigation The main risks would be a breakout of this range either above $85 or below $40 and therefore, some level of hedging against this risk may be appropriate, for example, a long strangle strategy with calls above $85 and puts below $40. From a fundamental perspective, the risk of this strategy comes from a material change in any of the factors discussed in the above text or any clarity regarding the SEC situation, in which case I would be looking to exit this strategy. Conclusion To conclude, there are a number of things turning sour at Coinbase but I do see a light at the end of the tunnel which comes in the form of a potential regulatory closure, international expansion and their ability to navigate the crypto winter efficiently. The unfortunate thing is that it could be a long waiting game and there is a possibility of being rug pulled by the SEC in the form of banning crypto trading or imposing a hefty fine on Coinbase. There are also lots of unknowns such as the competitive landscape within the US and internationally which poses questions as to how we can appropriately value the business, especially if parts of their revenue sources are at risk. However, I am bullish on bitcoin as I believe the regional banking crisis put a floor onto bitcoin prices at roughly the $20k mark and any further positive surprises in crypto prices would certainly benefit Coinbase.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614338-coinbase-an-opportunity-to-take-advantage-of-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14317386.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  In its first legal response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) claimed that digital assets listed on its platform fall outside the regulator’s (SEC) purview. The SEC sued Coinbase at the beginning of June, alleging that a dozen of the cryptocurrencies offered through its wallet or trading platforms were unregistered securities. In its answer, filed early Thursday, Coinbase claimed that these cryptos are not investment contracts and therefore not securities. It's an argument Coinbase has advanced before in public statements, but Thursday's filing goes into further detail explaining the company's position: cryptos on the exchange's secondary market platform are not part of any arrangements where a promoter is selling an asset tied to a contract, said the company, referring to language in the Supreme Court’s precedent-setting Howey case.  Germany's financial watchdog has decided not to grant crypto exchange Binance a custody license, news publication Finance Forward reported on Thursday. The report added that it's unclear if the denial was a formal decision from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) or an intention expressed in ongoing discussions. ""While we are unable to share details of conversations with regulators, we continue to work to comply with BaFin‘s requirements,” a Binance spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. “As expected, this is a detailed and ongoing process,” the spokesperson continued. “We are confident that we have the right team and measures in place to continue our discussions with regulators in Germany.”  The native token of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound (COMP) has surged by more than 50% over the past four days alongside a spike in volume and outflows on Binance. COMP was trading at $45.98 at press time, higher by 51.4% since Sunday and doubling in value from its June 10 low of $22.89, according to TradingView. Lookonchain noted that one particular wallet deposited $3.5 million worth of tether (USDT) to Binance on June 26 before withdrawing 50,000 COMP tokens ($2.26 million) on Wednesday and an additional 120,000 tokens ($5.5 million) on Thursday. COMP is one of a number of altcoins that have been rallying along with bitcoin's charge back above the $30,000 level. The likes of Blur and Arbitrum posted double-digital gains earlier this week, indicating a positive shift in sentiment after three-months of low volatility trading at range lows.

14316454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540295,1688040021,"Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin","Data shows the stablecoin market cap has returned toward equilibrium and may be gearing up for a reversal. Here’s how Bitcoin could benefit from this. Aggregate Stablecoin Market Cap Change Has Returned To Equilibrium According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the aggregate stablecoin market cap had previously been in a decline for around 14 months. The “aggregate stablecoin market cap” here refers to the combined market cap (that is, the total valuation in USD) of the top five stables in the sector. More specifically, the relevant stablecoins in the current discussion are Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), and TrueUSD (TUSD). The complete supply of these stables is considered here, regardless of how it is distributed among the different blockchains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Stalls As Short-Term Holder Exchange Inflows Intensify Historically, the combined market cap of these assets has held important information for the sector, as it can provide hints about whether capital is flowing into or out of the market right now. To track the flow of capital, Glassnode has looked at the 30-day percentage change in the aggregate market cap of these fiat-tied tokens. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator over the past few years: The value of the metric seems to have approached the zero mark in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Naturally, when the value of this metric is positive, it means that the top 5 stablecoins have registered net inflows during the last thirty days. On the other hand, negative values imply outflows have taken place in the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the 30-day percentage change in the aggregate stablecoin market cap was quite positive during the 2021 bull run. This would imply that these assets were constantly seeing an expansion in their supplies in this period. Usually, investors make use of stables whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. Such holders keep their capital in the form of these assets until they want to buy back into a volatile coin like Bitcoin or withdraw into fiat. Obviously, in the former scenario, the purchasing can have a positive effect on the price of the asset they are shifting into. During bull markets, a ton of capital flows into the sector, which is what helps sustain such rallies. Thus, it’s not a surprise that the stablecoin supply observed expansion during the 2021 bull run. As the bear market began in 2022, however, the indicator’s value decreased toward the zero level, implying that the outflows started to equal the inflows. A confirmed transition toward net outflows then occurred, as the bearish period kicked into full gear. There was a small period during the relief rally in the middle of the year where the 30-day percentage change again approached the zero market. A transition toward inflows, however, failed, and the indicator became negative once more. The negative values have continued until now, meaning that these top stablecoins have been observing net redemptions for 14 straight months. Recently, though, the metric has again neared equilibrium, meaning that there is potential for breaking into the inflows regime. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Gold, Silver Drops To Cyclical Lows: Glassnode It’s unclear whether this reversal will be complete, or if a rejection will happen like during the aforementioned relief rally. If the stablecoin market cap does begin to see an expansion, then it would be a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it would mean that there is now more capital present in the market in the form of the stables, which may be used to purchase the asset.

14316441,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/coinbase-moves-to-dismiss-sec-lawsuit,1688040000,Coinbase Moves To Dismiss SEC Lawsuit,"The crypto firm has filed a motion to dismiss the legal case brought against it by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing a lack of jurisdiction and violation of due process. Coinbase’s Rebuttal To SEC The industry is closely following the legal battle between US-based crypto exchange Coinbase and the SEC. In the latest development in the matter, the crypto firm has claimed that the regulatory body has no jurisdiction over Coinbase’s offerings. The company has even filed a motion with the US court to dismiss the SEC’s complaints on the grounds that the digital assets listed in the Coinbase platform are not considered securities and therefore are not under the SEC’s purview. This motion is in direct opposition to the SEC’s claim that several cryptocurrencies offered on the exchange’s wallets or trading platforms are unregistered securities. “Cryptos Are Not Investment Contracts” The SEC had taken its allegations against Coinbase to legal court in early June by filing a lawsuit against the crypto exchange. On June 29, the latter countered back via a 277-page response that declared that these cryptocurrencies do not qualify as investment contracts. This means that these cryptos are not an asset tied to a contract that a promoter could sell for a profit, and the token issuers are not obligated to the investors. Since the profit or loss generated from these crypto transactions depended entirely on the assets themselves and not the company that issued them, Coinbase claimed that they cannot be considered securities. The company mentioned the Supreme Court ruling of the Howey case to support its position. The Coinbase filing states, “None of the assets the SEC has now identified are, in fact, securities, and for that and other reasons, secondary transactions in those assets are also not securities. None of these satisfy Howey’s definition of an “investment contract.” In arguing otherwise, the SEC has advanced a novel construction of the operative term that is divorced from […] statutory context the Supreme Court and the Commission itself long ago agreed must inform the term’s meaning.” Coinbase Claims Abuse Of Process Notably, the company’s rebuttal has also pointed fingers at SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his fluctuating stance on the regulating body’s jurisdiction. Coinbase also pointed out its repeated requests for clarity on regulation and its voluntary compliance with the rules of various overlapping regulators, including the SEC, its senior staff members, and the courts regarding the application of securities laws to the crypto industry. Finally, the motion claims that the case must be dismissed solely on the grounds of violation of Coinbase’s rights to due process and alleged abuse of process.

Tokenization is the process by which real-world assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens.  “The tokenization of traditional assets and issuance of assets in tokenized form have the potential to increase efficiencies and reduce costs across an asset's life cycle, improve the efficient allocation of capital, optimize global supply chains, catalyze a new generation of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies and ultimately drive mainstream adoption,” the analysts wrote.  Bank of America notes that disruptive technology like radio, television and email took thirty years to reach mainstream adoption. It expects a much shorter lag for digital assets.  The bank said the implementation of blockchain technology will accelerate among financial institutions and corporates as the “opportunity cost of uncaptured efficiencies increases.”  “Distributed ledger technology and tokenized traditional assets aren’t ‘crypto,’” the report said, adding that “blockchains record ownership of the 26k+ tokens that exist within the digital asset ecosystem, but we expect 99% of those in existence today to essentially disappear over the next ten years.”  Memecoins like shiba inu (SHIB) and pepecoin (PEPE) receive a huge amount of attention “despite having no utility or intrinsic value, but other tokens are different”, the note said.  Public permissionless blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum and some third-generation blockchains are decentralized and require tokens to reward participants for processing transactions on the network, the report noted.

14315067,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540287,1688036403,"Ethereum (ETH) Price Drops Due Whale Selling, Key Levels To Watch","Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, experienced a price drop of over 3% within the last 24 hours. The reason is presumably a significant sell-off carried out by a prominent whale. The whale deposited 25,000 ETH (worth around $47.24 million) on Binance, only to withdraw a significant amount of USDT shortly afterwards. As the on-chain data provider Lookonchain reports, the whale has probably already sold a part of his ETH. According to the on-chain data, the whale withdrew 16 million in USDT. “The drop in ETH price [a few hours] ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale,” the analysts note, further explaining that the whale still owns around 8,000 ETH ($14.7 million) unsold. Nevertheless, ETH bulls continue to show strength. A look at the 1-hour chart of Ethereum reveals that the price has formed a bull flag. In technical analysis, a flag is a short-term consolidation pattern that occurs after a strong price move and indicates a temporary break in the trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Grinds Lower As The Bulls Take Back Seat A bullish flag forms during an uptrend with the flagpole pointing upwards, followed by a consolidation phase before a possible continuation of the upward movement. For now, the pattern has held, ETH has bounced up from the 4H 200 EMA at $1,825. In this respect, the bulls remain in control (despite the whale) for the time being. Basically, two scenarios are conceivable. If the aforementioned support levels are broken to the downside, especially the underside of the flag, Ethereum could face a further price decline towards $1,750. Conversely, a breakout from the flag pattern to the upside (around $1,900) could trigger a price rise towards $2,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation However, according to analyst Ali Martinez, that’s where the price will hit Ethereum’s key supply wall, which is in the $2,000 to $2,060 range, where 832,640 addresses have bought over 26 million ETH. “If ETH can break through this resistance barrier, we can expect an upswing to $2,330 or even $2,750,” Martinez believes. Ethereum Options Expiry On Friday Confirms Outlook The most important event this week for Bitcoin, Ethereum and the entire crypto market will be the expiration of over $7 billion in options tomorrow, Friday, June 30. The current options volume on the largest exchange Deribit is 14,107 calls, 9,445 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.67 for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, there are currently 76,776 calls, 39,779 puts and a put-call ratio of 0.52. Options Volume [Deribit]$BTC: 📈Calls=14,107.70, 📉Puts=9,445.50, ⚖️Put-call ratio=0.67 $ETH: 📈Calls=76,776.00, 📉Puts=39,779.00, ⚖️Put-call ratio=0.52 — coinoptionstrack bot (@optionstrackbot) June 29, 2023 A put-call ratio below 1 typically means that the number of call options is higher than the number of put options, which indicates a more bullish market sentiment. In this case, the put-call ratio for ETH is 0.52, which means that there are more call options compared to put options. Thus, the ratio indicates that market participants are more prone to bullish bets on the ETH price.

42393237,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjV2Z,1688036400,New deBridge Feature Lets Solana Users Easily Access Any Ethereum-Based Blockchain,"A new feature by cross-chain bridge deBridge will let Solana users access applications on other blockchains – and vice-versa – easily at low fees, Alex Smirnov, CEO and co-founder of deBridge, shared with CoinDesk.  Smirnov said the feature was the first time a Solana user could access Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, such as Arbitrum, without relying on derivative tokens or wrapped tokens, which present a security risk.  “Wormhole used to be the only interoperability solution available for the Solana ecosystem, but the problem here is that interoperability was not seamless,” Smirnov explained.  “Users and projects that needed to transfer liquidity to Solana have always faced limitations due to the lack of liquidity in Wormhole pools and high slippage during the exchange of the wrapped assets, which often made developers have to deal with non-liquid Wormhole assets,” Smirnov added.  deBridge said its new feature works by enabling any EVM smart contract to prepare on-chain instructions that are directly executed on Solana, while Solana programs can also prepare messages to be sent to any smart contracts on EVM chains.  This is possible thanks to a link-up with the DLN Trade, a cross-chain exchange product by deBridge that uses a decentralized order book to allow any asset on one chain to be traded directly to any asset on another without the bottlenecks and risks of liquidity pools.  Liquidity pools refer to a basket of tokens locked on decentralized exchanges that are used to facilitate trading for those tokens in the open market. DLN uses peer-to-peer liquidity to conduct trades, instead of relying on a liquidity pool.

14314678,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540296,1688035503,Dogecoin Faces Downward Pressure – Will DOGE Bulls Avert A Further Slide?,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently facing a critical juncture in its price movement. The DOGE price is teetering above the last horizontal support level before a potential substantial decline. In order to avoid a steep fall, it is imperative for Dogecoin to muster a decisive bounce at its current level. However, this task may prove to be challenging as a persistent downtrend, marked by a descending trendline, has been undermining the efforts of buyers to establish a sustained bullish recovery for nearly two months. Will Dogecoin be able to break free from this downward pressure and embark on a new upward trajectory? A Crucial Juncture For DOGE Price Analyzing the technical aspects of Dogecoin’s price movement on the weekly time frame reveals a significant decrease at the beginning of June, ultimately reaching the $0.06 horizontal support area. This particular zone holds immense importance as it has remained intact for an impressive 378-day period. Source: TradingView Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Rumbles With 18% Gain – Is A Trend Reversal On The Horizon? Whether the price manages to bounce back above this critical level or succumbs to a breakdown could potentially dictate the future trend for DOGE. At present, according to CoinGecko, the value of Dogecoin stands at $0.063. However, recent market conditions have not been favorable, leading to a slump in DOGE’s price. DOGE price at $0.063. Source: Coingecko Over the course of the past 24 hours alone, Dogecoin witnessed a notable 2.0% decrease. This downward trend has persisted over the past week, with DOGE experiencing an overall decline of 7.2%. Considering these developments, the current state of Dogecoin’s price raises important questions about its trajectory moving forward. Potential For Bullish Breakout Should the overall market sentiment shift back towards recovery, there is a possibility of Dogecoin’s price experiencing a bullish breakout from the overhead resistance it currently faces. Such a breakout has the potential to alter traders’ mindset, transitioning from actively selling during price rallies to adopting a strategy of buying on price dips. This shift in sentiment could have a significant impact on the market dynamics surrounding Dogecoin. DOGE market cap currently at $8.83 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A key factor in this potential shift lies in the concept of flipped support. If the $0.06 horizontal support area manages to hold strong and repel further downward pressure, it could potentially transform into a flipped support level. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Outshines Altcoins With 17% Rally – Here’s Why Flipped support refers to a situation where a previous resistance level, once broken, now acts as a supportive floor for price movements. In this scenario, the flipped support at $0.06 could serve as a bolstering force, encouraging buyers to step in and drive further recovery for Dogecoin. Should this bullish scenario unfold, the price of Dogecoin may find itself eyeing the next resistance level at $0.75. Breaking through this resistance could signify a significant achievement for DOGE and attract even more buyers and investors. A successful breach of the $0.75 resistance could mark a notable milestone, potentially setting the stage for further upward momentum and renewed market enthusiasm surrounding Dogecoin.

42393243,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjVN5,1688034116,Ex-Genesis CEO Michael Moro to Head Crypto Derivatives Exchange Startup,"Michael Moro, the former CEO of Genesis Trading, is taking the helm of a new cryptocurrency derivatives exchange called Ankex, which was incubated within crypto custody tech firm Qredo.  Ankex, which enters alpha testing this week, will begin with perpetual futures contracts in markets outside the U.S. The platform will allow users to keep custody of their assets in a decentralized manner while providing elements familiar to professional traders such as a central limit order book.  Following the collapse of FTX and other centralized crypto-trading platforms, a knee-jerk reaction was to espouse the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). But the trading experience in DeFi is not ideal for many institutions, who are used to a low latency, high speed matching environment, Moro said.  “The old model of custody, trading and settlement all in a box is done, but people are used to the central limit order book, fast matching and all of that stuff that offers a better trading experience,” Moro said in an interview with CoinDesk. “So we started building a really fast matching engine that’s off chain, in order to marry that with Qredo’s on-chain custody in terms of MPC [multi-party computation] technology, and get the best of both worlds.”  Moro pointed out that Ankex is a separate company from Qredo and after three months of alpha testing, the exchange will add Metamask and Fireblocks so any non-custodial wallet will be able to plug in and trade.  Ankex, which has some 17,000 users waiting to test it, is in the process becoming registered and licensed in the British Virgin Islands, Moro said. It also plans to become regulated in the U.A.E. and Dubai, he said.  In the alpha stage, Ankex will handle plain vanilla perpetual futures to begin with, and only three different contracts: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Binance coin (BNB). USDC will be the only acceptable collateral during testing, Moro said.  “In terms of leverage, we don’t want this to turn into a full blown leverage casino. So for Bitcoin, the max leverage we are offering is 20x, and then for ETH and BNB, just 10x,” said Moro. “But of course, if we only traded bitcoin, ETH and BNB, then, frankly, that is a boring exchange. We will also have to offer derivatives on tokens that are less common and lower in the market cap table.”",POSITIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/29/ex-genesis-ceo-michael-moro-to-head-crypto-derivatives-exchange-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53b53077b063e13cf73c29906674c6b77cb4930d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14313668,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540284,1688032835,"North Carolina House Approves Bitcoin Study, What Will It Reveal?","In consideration of recent developments, a bill has been introduced to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a state-administered depository for cryptocurrencies, positioning North Carolina as the custodian of its Bitcoin and virtual asset holdings. However, the proposed study will thoroughly assess the costs and benefits associated with alternatives such as a privately managed depository or utilizing the depository of another state. A Comprehensive Study For North Carolina’s Financial Holdings On June 28, the House approved a bill that authorizes a comprehensive study with a budget of $50,000. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating gold bullion and virtual currencies like BTC into North Carolina’s financial holdings. The study aims to examine various aspects, including the secure acquisition, storage, insurance, and liquidation of these assets. One of the main areas of investigation is the potential impact that gold and cryptocurrency holdings could have on North Carolina’s funds. Specifically, the study intends to assess whether such holdings could serve as a hedge against inflation and mitigate systemic credit risks. Furthermore, it seeks to determine if integrating gold and crypto assets into the portfolio could effectively reduce volatility and enhance overall returns. Related Reading: Report Reveals Surge In Institutional Bitcoin Adoption, How Far Will It Go? By undertaking this study, the House plans to gather crucial insights and evidence that will inform the decision-making process regarding North Carolina’s investment strategy. The bill emphasizes a neutral and data-driven approach to understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with diversifying the state’s financial holdings with gold and virtual currencies. The bill was successfully passed in the House with a majority vote of 73 in favor, 40 against, and seven members absent. For it to become law or be subject to a potential veto by Governor Roy Cooper, it must now proceed to the Senate for further consideration. Bitcoin Study: Analysis Of North Carolina’s Virtual Asset Holdings In a separate legislative initiative, on May 3, North Carolina’s House unanimously approved a bill that would prohibit payments to the state using a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Additionally, the bill specified that North Carolina would not permit the Federal Reserve to conduct any future pilot CBDC testing within its jurisdiction.

14313556,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/ftx-looks-to-revive-crypto-exchange,1688032649,FTX Looks To Revive Crypto Exchange,"FTX is reportedly looking to revive its crypto exchange, according to Wall Street Journal report. The once-leading crypto exchange FTX which suffered a spectacular collapse and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022, is reportedly exploring the possibility of reviving the FTX.com exchange. The Wall Street Journal reports that FTX’s newly appointed CEO, John Ray, said the company has begun “the process of soliciting interested parties to the reboot of the FTX.com exchange.” FTX experienced a severe liquidity crisis in November, prompting customers to withdraw an estimated $6 billion over fear that their assets were unsafe on the exchange. The Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) led crypto empire collapsed after news broke that FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research had been sharing assets to boost the company’s balance sheet. FTX’s improper trading of customer funds via Alameda saw SBF step down as CEO of the exchange. The disgraced CEO was charged with various federal crimes, including money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. SBF’s Request To Dismiss Charges Is Rejected On Tuesday, New York federal Judge Lewis Kaplan denied the FTX founder’s request to dismiss most of the criminal charges against him over the collapse of the exchange. The disgraced founder has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is now accused of misleading investors and lenders. Bankman-Fried will stand trial in October. FTX Halts Sale of Its Stake in Anthropic Bloomberg reported earlier in the week that FTX was set to sell its shares in the AI platform Anthropic but has decided to put the brakes on the sale. FTX currently holds over $500 million worth of shares in Anthropic, and the exchange has provided no specific reason for the halt of the sale. FTX Management Recover $7B in Liquid Assets FTX’s newly appointed management team announced this week that it made “substantial progress” in asset recovery. It revealed that it has thus far recovered $7 billion of liquid assets. The company’s new management published an investigative report with John Ray explaining the reality of what is going on at the exchange.

The central bank is looking at how it can innovate in settling transactions between financial institutions for securities or foreign exchange, while also developing plans for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital euro, that could be used by EU citizens.  “The ECB clarified that the envisioned start of exploratory work is in 2024,” testing the use of central bank money in both real and mock wholesale transactions, the document said.  The explorations will be “limited in capacity and time,” and take place on the basis of existing rules – including a new pilot regulation passed by the EU last year, which temporarily relaxes financial-market infrastructure requirements for securities trading using DLT, the document added.  The announcement came at the inaugural meeting of a new industry grouping set up by the ECB last week, as conventional financial players continue to explore crypto and the blockchain technology that underpins it. The ECB’s consultative board is dominated by traditional finance players such as Euroclear and Deutsche Bank, but also includes some DLT-focused initiatives such as HQLAX and Fnality.  The European Commission on Wednesday proposed new laws that could underpin a retail CBDC, including consumer privacy and holding limits to avoid deposits fleeing the banking system.  A recent survey by industry group the Global Financial Markets Association suggested that using crypto-style DLT in financial markets could save $100 billion per year by freeing up collateral and automating processes such as mergers.

42393241,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjV7h,1688025600,Sam Altman's Worldcoin Integrates With Identity Management Software Okta as It Pushes Into Germany,"Worldcoin, the blockchain identity project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has integrated with Okta and is launching its identity protocol, World ID, in Germany, the firm said in a Thursday press release shared with CoinDesk.  World ID verification is coming to Germany, such that users will be able to get fully verified using custom-designed hardware that employs biometric data. The Orbs, as the hardware is called, will be available around the country, starting in Berlin.  Okta is an identity and access management software provider with ""hundreds of millions of users"" and is aiming for billions, according to a blog post on its website written by Chief Technology Officer Hector Aguilar and Chief Architect Jon Todd.  A ""Sign in with Worldcoin"" option is now available on Okta's Auth0 marketplace for authentication solutions so that developers can adopt it as a sign-in option on their apps alongside Google or Facebook. World ID is Worldcoin's identity protocol, which uses zero-knowledge proofs and biometrics to verify an individual is human and unique.  In order to be fully verified by the Worldcoin protocol, users have to have their irises scanned at one of the Orbs, available in select locations throughout the world. Orbs scan users' irises and deploy artificial intelligence to create unique codes, or cryptographic IDs. The processing of the biometric data into an ID happens in near real-time, and the resulting digital key is stored on users' devices. By default, the Orb doesn't store data captured during the process.  Users can opt to have their data retained, but ""if they do that, then their data is encrypted, and then it can be used for things like improving the accuracy and inclusivity of the models,"" and the user can always revoke permission, said Tiago Sada, head of product, engineering, and design at Tools for Humanity, the company building Worldcoin.  World ID says it is more private than other sign-in options like Google, ""because you still preserve the privacy guarantees of the protocol behind the scenes, even though the developer doesn't have to deal with that,"" Sada said. By integrating with Okta, Worldcoin can be made available into thousands of applications with developers essentially just flipping a switch and making minor code changes, said Sada.  What's more, World ID helps developers and applications distinguish between humans and bots, given that it uses biometric data, such that it can better combat fraud attempts.  Worldcoin has 1.9 million users in 30 countries, according to the World App.  CORRECTION (June 29, 15:04 UTC): Corrects number of founders of OpenAI in first paragraph, an earlier version of this story had referred to a duo.

The initial public testnet will initially only work with Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, but future upgrades plan to introduce over 30+ markets. Public Testnet Set For Launch The launch of dYdX’s Cosmos-based blockchain is part of the decentralized exchange’s mission to democratize access to financial opportunities further. The dYdX chain, which has been created in the Cosmos ecosystem, recently completed its Milestone 4 and has over 40 validators who are running the platform’s software. The news was announced by the decentralized exchange on its official Twitter handle. “We are thrilled to announce that the dYdX Chain public testnet is set to launch on 7/05/2023 at 17:00 UTC!” The launch would also see testing commence for several functions. These would include viewing the order book, connecting wallets, and viewing account information. The decentralized exchange had stated in a blog post that it expected to launch its mainnet after completing Milestone 5 in September. Launch Ahead Of Schedule dYdX had transitioned from StarkEx, a layer-2 network built by StarkWare, to its own application-based blockchain created in the Cosmos ecosystem. dYdX’s five-step plan focuses on gradual testing of the blockchain before its eventual mainnet launch. dYdX’s endeavor to create its own application-based blockchain comes against the backdrop of several events in the global financial and crypto ecosystem that highlighted the urgent need for a more open, permissionless, and transparent financial systems and products. According to the dYdX announcement, the testnet launch is currently ahead of schedule, with the platform successfully completing its fourth milestone before the anticipated launch date. The third milestone (v3) saw the addition of several features to the stable internal testnet. These included dynamic funding rates, limit orders, and the use of ABCI 2.0, among several other features of the Cosmos SDK. V3 also saw documentation integration for validators and Market Makers, with the dYdX chain collaborating with a small group of internal validators to test out the network. The Fourth Milestone The fourth milestone will see the dYdX public testnet initially feature Bitcoin and Ethereum before integrating other cryptocurrencies through various upgrades. dYdX updated users about Milestone 4 through their official Twitter handle, stating, “Milestone 4 marks the completion of features necessary for our public testnet launch, which will include a larger number of validators running our software (40+). AND we are shipping this ahead of schedule! This public testnet will launch with Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, but we anticipate that the open-source software will include approximately 30+ markets as the network gets upgraded!” The launch will also enable testing several core inflows through integrations, including web sockets, API, and the web frontend. The decentralized exchange has also appealed to its community members to provide feedback and suggestions after using the testnet. The news has also resulted in a minor increase in the price of the DYDX token. However, this has not been enough to break the token’s overall bearish outlook. However, things are different in the Cosmos ecosystem, with the ATOM token registering a 15% increase in trading volume. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite initial expectations for a launch between the second and third quarter of 2023, the exact release date remains unknown. However, Shiba Inu chief developer Shytoshi Kusama released a new video today that may give the community renewed optimism. Alluding to the most frequently asked question of when Shibarium will finally be released, Kusama wrote via Twitter today: “Wen is so last year. The real question is… WHERE?” and shared numerous hashtags: #SHIBARMY #SHIBARIUM #SHIBOSHIS #SHIBAETERNITY #MVSHIB #SHIBACALS #WELLY #UNIFICATION #BADIDEAI #SEEYOUTHERE. The video features the Shiba Inu logo and a major (American) city. The message of the video is: “Something is coming. Actually we are going somewhere.” Apparently the developers of Shiba Inu are planning a big event, whether it is the launch party for Shibarium is the one million dollar question. At least that’s what Kusama’s words suggest, as it’s apparently no longer a question of when, but where. However, it could just be a Shiba Inu convention or an event to announce something else, so far it’s all speculation. #wen is so last year. The real question is… #WHERE? #SHIBARMY #SHIBARIUM #SHIBOSHIS #SHIBAETERNITY #MVSHIB #SHIBACALS #WELLY #UNIFICATION #BADIDEAI #SEEYOUTHERE pic.twitter.com/vLDAXVwWGn — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) June 29, 2023 But the chances are very high that it will be an event that puts Shibarium at the centre of attention. After all, Kusama uses the hashtag Shibarium second, right after #SHIBARMY. Obviously, the entire Shiba Inu community will meet, as Shiboshi NFTs, the collectible card game Shiba Eternity, SHIB The Metaverse, Shibacals, Bad Idea.AI and Shibarium developer Unification are also mentioned in the hashtags. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Surges Over 6,000% As SHIB Price Continues Uptrend Shiba Inu Price Remains Flat Despite Announcement The lack of clarity on Shibarium currently seems to be causing concern among Shiba Inu traders and is affecting the valuation of the SHIB token. Apparently, the delay in the release of Shibarium has had a negative impact on the price of SHIB in recent weeks. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up Lately, SHIB experienced a significant decline, falling from $0.000011 to $0.00000591, a level the price last saw on September 09, 2021. Even though SHIB managed a 40% rally, the price failed to break the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the descending trend channel that has been formed since early February. At press time, Kusama’s teaser video did not generate much hype among SHIB investors. The price remained stuck at $0.00000726, but in position to attack the top of the descending trend channel again. A breakout above the area between $0.000080 and $0.00000833 (23.6% Fibonacci retracement level) is the key resistance at the moment.

The KYC rules will kick in as early as next month, with customers required to complete several mandatory identification checks to use services offered by KuCoin. KuCoin Embraces Regulations According to a press release issued by the KuCoin exchange, the KYC rules will kick in from the 15th of July. This means users will be required to complete KuCoin’s KYC process to use the exchange and its services. “Consistent with KuCoin’s core values, we are dedicated to fulfilling ‘Know Your Customer’ obligation in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. We continually protect our customer’s assets and combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and related financial crimes around the world. Based on this, KuCoin will enhance the Customer Identification and Verification Program. The enhancement will officially take effect on the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC).” Customers that do not complete the KYC process will be unable to trade or make deposits on the exchange, the press release stated. As a result, the introduction of these rules means current users will be forced to comply with KYC regulations to be able to access KuCoin’s full suite of products and offerings. The press release noted, “Please take note of the following: Starting from the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC), newly registered users must complete their KYC in order to use KuCoin’s products and services. For users who registered before the 15th of July, 2023 (UTC), if their KYC is not completed, they will only be able to use services such as Spot trading sell orders, Futures trading deleveraging, Margin trading deleveraging, KuCoin Earn redemption, ETF redemption, and will not be able to use the deposit service (withdrawals are not impacted).” Better Compliance With Federal Regulations Cryptocurrency exchanges have come under considerable criticism thanks to a perception of being lax when it comes to Know Your Customer checks. Regulators have stated that such lax rules lead to fraud, terror financing, and money laundering. Jonny Lyu, the Chief Executive Officer at KuCoin, stated that introducing mandatory KYC checks would help the exchange better comply with federal regulations and enhance overall security. The CEO noted in the press release, “As a people’s exchange, KuCoin has always prioritized the security of users’ assets. As a globalized exchange, KuCoin closely monitors the crypto policies of various countries and respects compliance requirements, providing users with enhanced asset security. With the development of the cryptocurrency industry, crypto has gradually moved from a geek towards mass adoption. However, this process has also brought about certain security issues concerning on-chain assets. In light of this, KuCoin has strengthened our KYC system to comply with regulatory requirements worldwide and better protect the asset security of all cryptocurrency users through enhanced KYC rules.” Growing Numbers KuCoin had stated in its annual review that it had over 27 million active customers on its platform at the end of 2022., with 13 million users joining the platform in 2022 alone. This represents a 102% growth year-on-year in the exchange’s user base. The exchange revealed that its most significant jump in numbers came from the Asia-Pacific region, where it added over 7 million new users in 2022, representing an increase of 191% since 2021. Other areas that saw an increase in user base were Latin America (120%), Middle East & Africa (120% and 109%), and Europe (100%). Transaction volumes also saw a considerable increase between January and December 2022, with trading volumes across the spot and futures markets crossing $3.6 trillion, representing an increase of 52% year-on-year. At its peak, KuCoin’s daily trading volume in the futures markets reached a high of $23 billion, while the spot trading volume touched $12 billion.

42393229,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgjUNX,1688014248,"SEC Has No Jurisdiction Over Cryptos on Coinbase, Exchange Says in Lawsuit Response","U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase claimed that digital assets listed on its platform fall outside the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) purview in its first legal response to the regulator's lawsuit.  The SEC sued Coinbase at the beginning of June, alleging that a dozen of the cryptocurrencies offered through its wallet or trading platforms were unregistered securities. In its answer, filed early Thursday, Coinbase claimed that these cryptos are not investment contracts and therefore are not securities.  It's an argument Coinbase has advanced before in public statements like tweets and blog posts, but Thursday's filing goes into further detail explaining the company's position: cryptos on the exchange's secondary market platform are not part of any arrangements where a promoter is selling an asset tied to a contract, the company claimed, basically spelling out the Supreme Court's Howey case as an example.  The issuers of the tokens owe no obligations to investors, the filing said.  ""Because no such obligations are carried in the transactions over Coinbase’s secondary market exchange, and because the value that Coinbase purchasers receive through these transactions inheres in the things bought and traded rather than in the businesses that generated them, the transactions are not securities transactions,"" the filing said.  Some of the filing continues to reiterate Coinbase's already-live public statements, arguing that current SEC Chair Gary Gensler changed his position on the regulator's authority over crypto between taking office in April 2021 and mid-2022; saying the company has asked for regulation; and noting that Congress has started looking at the issue of crypto regulation.  ""Even were the SEC correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this action must be dismissed on the independent grounds that it violates Coinbase’s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process,"" the filing said. ""For years, Coinbase has voluntarily submitted to regulation by multiple overlapping regulatory bodies, has adhered to the public and limited formal guidance from the SEC, senior SEC Staff, and the courts about the application of securities law to its industry, and has begged the SEC for guidance about how it thinks the federal securities laws map onto the digital asset industry as the SEC’s actions reflected an escalating but undisclosed change in its own view of its authority.""  ""The SEC has chosen"" to pursue enforcement actions over rulemaking, the filing claimed.  The rest of the filing contains a point-by-point answer to the SEC's lawsuit.  In a separate document also filed to the judge overseeing the case, Coinbase alleged that its due process rights were violated when the SEC brought the lawsuit and that the SEC's lawsuit may violate the ""major questions"" doctrine. The company asked the judge to let it file for judgement and set a 7-week schedule for its motion, the SEC's opposition and its own response to the opposition.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/29/sec-has-no-jurisdiction-over-cryptos-on-coinbases-platform-exchange-claims-in-response-to-regulators-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eddc1bd2e964768a022e07220dde35349f209127-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This positive price action follows a report by the Wall Street Journal that the exchange’s new management has started receiving proposals from parties interested in restarting the exchange. The unconfirmed report cited the chief executive officer, John J. Ray III, who took over FTX when it officially filed for bankruptcy in mid-November 2022. Will FTX Be Restarted? Sources report that the management team of the cryptocurrency exchange has been in discussions with investors interested in seeing the platform back up and running. Different ownership and management structures are being considered as part of this effort. A joint venture is one option, which would involve compensating existing clients affected by the FTX bankruptcy through stakes in the new organization. Additionally, when the exchange is relaunched, it will operate under a new brand name to improve its reputation and regain trust. Related Reading: BNB Market Cap Down By 25% In June Amidst Binance Regulatory Pressure Rumors of this restart are six months after Ray III said he was setting up a task force to explore resuming operations. The CEO also added that despite the alleged illegal activities committed by executives, mainly Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research, the exchange’s business model was feasible. A restructuring and a restart of the exchange, observers note, will be a better outcome for its millions of clients who were adversely affected after the exchange unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy last year. Following the collapse of FTX, the cryptocurrency market tanked, with Bitcoin and Ethereum sinking to new 2022 lows. In a bear market of last year, the FTX collapse forced BTC prices below $16k. At the same time, FTT, the native currency of FTX, sank 92%. Despite the current expansion, the token is far from its October 2021 highs when each FTT was changing hands at over $69. When writing on June 28, FTT is trading at $1.73 with a market capitalization of $576,331,728. Charges Against Sam Bankman-Fried And Alameda Research Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, is charged with wire fraud, commodities fraud, money laundering, and bribery, among others, following an investigation by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The agency sought to discover whether FTX and Alameda Research knowingly engaged in market manipulation and if there was a conflict of interest. The CFTC also alleges that FTX and its trading wing, Alameda Research, failed to disclose their trading activities to clients while using their funds to support FTT prices.

14301261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540221,1688000405,"Bitcoin Takes The Crown: Market Cap Dominance Soars Above 58%, Highest Level Since 2021","Bitcoin (BTC) has again taken center stage in the cryptocurrency market as institutional interest surges. This interest has been spurred by major financial giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, who have applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). According to Coin Metrics, BTC’s market capitalization dominance has reached a new high for 2023, currently at 58%, the highest since April 2021. Bitcoin Rules The Crypto Kingdom BTC has been the leading digital asset and has maintained its position as the top cryptocurrency for a long time. Its market cap of $586 billion is significantly higher than the industry’s combined market cap, which stands at $425 billion (excluding stablecoins). According to Coin Metrics ‘ report, BTC’s dominance fell in the spring of 2021 as traders bid up smaller-cap altcoins, but it never dropped below 40% of the total market. However, with some newer tokens facing intensified regulatory scrutiny in the US, BTC has pulled ahead in 2023. BTC’s weighting in the CMBI 10, index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is also at a 2-year high of 65%. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin, Adds 12,333 BTC To MicroStrategy’s Holdings Looking at a broader basket of assets, BTC’s 85% return year-to-date outpaces most of the other major digital assets. Per the report, the only two assets with a greater return year-to-date compared to BTC are Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at 102% and Lido (LDO) at 104%. BTC Dominance Rallying Trend Ahead? On the other hand, crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe recently shared some insights regarding the Bitcoin dominance chart. According to Van de Poppe, “the chart looks like it wants to continue rallying,” but there are some key points to remember. One of the most important takeaways is that in September 2019, BTC tested the 200-week moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) and encountered resistance. This was 10 months before the Bitcoin halving event in May 2020. Van de Poppe notes that the current situation is similar to September 2019. BTC is once again testing the 200-week MA and EMA, and whether it can break through this resistance level remains to be seen. This could be a positive sign for Bitcoin investors, as the halving event was followed by a period of strong price growth for BTC. Related Reading: Radix (XRD) Down By 11% In A Single Day, As Altcoin Market Slows Down Overall, while there are some potential challenges for BTC to overcome in the short term, Van de Poppe’s analysis suggests that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains positive. As of now, Bitcoin trades at $30,100, and it continues to experience a decline in value, representing a 2% drop over the past 24 hours. Additionally, its market dominance, which considers all other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem, currently stands at 52%. There is a significant contrast between its current dominance and the 72% it achieved in 2021.

The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at about $30,100, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours. After rising to its highest level in a year last week – over $31,300 – following spot bitcoin ETF filings by BlackRock and two other large financial services firms, bitcoin has flattened as investors considered the potential timing of an SEC decision of the ETF applications and continued, inflationary pressure that has weighed on asset markets.  Still, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, wrote in a message to CoinDesk that bitcoin has risen 11% for the month, breaking from its more sluggish performance of the last two months amid the more upbeat news.  ""June has been the biggest month since November for digital assets as it relates to news flow,"" Connors wrote. ""Not unusual to see the market take a breather.""  Bitcoin Dominance  Connors also noted that bitcoin dominance has increased to a 26-month high. ""It has only grown during this recent market pullback as it outpaces ETH and other Alt coins,"" he wrote, attributing the drop to more technical factors than a specific cause.  Read More: Bitcoin Drops Below $30K as Altcoins Tumble; BTC Dominance Reaches 26-Month High  Bitcoin sentiment has turned bullish over the past week with the CoinDesk Bitcoin Indicator climbing into ""significant upturn"" territory after languishing in downturn areas for weeks. Earlier this week, European digital asset manager CoinShares reportedthe largest single weekly inflows in a year - mostly dominated by bitcoin-related products - after nine consecutive weeks of outflows  ""Look at Coinbase, up today and up 21% over the past 5 days,"" Connors wrote. ""If there were structural reasons for this move lower, COIN would have been hit as well.""  Coinbase closed up more than 1% on Wednesday.  Investors will be eyeing bitcoin’s price as the market approaches Friday’s expiry of bitcoin options contracts could fuel a price increase, or send it spiraling in the immediate aftermath.  Ether was changing hands at $1,830, off 2.4% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos were largely in the red with ADA and MATIC, the tokens of smart contracts platforms Cardano and Polygon each recently tumbling more than 6%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of cypto markets performance, was recently down 2.3%.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite continued its recent rally, inching up 0.2%, fueled partly by a record jump in tech device manufacturer Apple's share price to nearly $190 and more than 2% increase of Tesla a few days before the electric car maker announces Q2 vehicle deliveries. The S&P 500 was roughly flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) edged down. The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys and safe haven asset gold ticked down.  Binance, Coinbase Suits ""Not Forgotten""  In an email, Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, struck a wary note about cryptos' path forward.  ""The SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase have not been forgotten, but they've certainly drifted into the background and been overtaken by far more promising news flow,"" Erlam wrote. ""It would appear the cryptocurrency has good momentum once more and the community may well be wondering if this could be the kind of development that sees enthusiasm for cryptos surge again.""  He added: ""It's obviously been a fantastic year for bitcoin so far"" but a spring sell-off ""was another reminder that it doesn't come without major setbacks.""

Its grassroots’ embrace of crypto puts the country within the top 15% of the world in the crypto adoption index. But as the most populous hub in our final 15, it was hurt by a low opportunities score, which is a measurement of per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events. The sparse postings could be due to a cultural or language barrier, however, as we measured activity on Linkedin, Eventbrite and Meetup.com.  For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk’s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.  Earlier this year XRP was soaring, and at first it wasn’t entirely clear why. It later became evident that this was just another example of how Korean retail investors have the power to move global markets. At the time UpBit, Korea’s biggest exchange, led global XRP trading volumes with more than $790 million in tokens traded over 24 hours, overtaking volumes on Binance, the largest exchange in the world.  This is just one instance. Korean retail traders are known for pushing up other coins as well – and no, that’s not just smaller altcoins. The Korean won is consistently in the top three national currencies traded against Bitcoin, according to Coinhills. More generally, awareness of and interest in crypto is relatively high. Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) reported in September that there were nearly seven million registered crypto users in Korea. That’s roughly 14% of the total population.  It’s not surprising that such a powerful retail market would help vault Seoul onto a list of global crypto hubs. But Seoul is appealing in plenty of other ways: It’s a fast-paced and entrepreneurial city in an often fast-paced and entrepreneurial region. It’s no secret that Asia’s prominence in crypto is on the rise, especially after regulatory crackdowns in the United States.  Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  Members of South Korea’s crypto community explained Seoul’s appeal in a few ways. One was an openness to experimentation. Another was Korea’s prowess in gaming. A third was simply its community of “builders.”  - Emily Parker  Read the full story here:     Important events.
