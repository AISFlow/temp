42405444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYaJ,1606000224,"Pantera Raises Additional $5M for Its Bitcoin Fund, Bringing Total to $134M","Cryptocurrency firm Pantera Capital has raised another $5 million for its bitcoin fund, bringing the total to $134 million, according to a form D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      Formed in 2013, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund Ltd. was the first U.S.-based bitcoin fund. In an investor letter at the end of 2017, Pantera boasted a 25,004% return on the fund, mainly due to the bitcoin bull run of that year.      Recently, CoinDesk discovered that Pantera’s venture funds hadn’t fared well in comparison to the S&P 500. The venture funds Pantera Capital raised in August 2013 and August 2014 have returned 46.5% and 15.9% from their inception to September 2019, respectively.      Of course, that performance may have improved as of late due to bitcoin’s recent bull run. As of press time, the price of bitcoin has risen around 159% year to date.      CORRECTION (Nov. 22, 01:41 UTC): Pantera reported raising an additional $5 million in its most recent filing, not $134 million as this article originally stated.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/21/pantera-raises-additional-5m-for-its-bitcoin-fund-bringing-total-to-134m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd35f24448ebb4b01e19553b7e8ef520d39bc8c7-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tejpaul came to Coinbase after 25 years in sales and trading in the traditional financial markets with stints at Barclays and JPMorgan.      Tejpaul credited this growth in part to Coinbase’s acquisition of Tagomi in May.      “It radically transformed our ability to cater to institutional clients that want to use smart order routing and algorithmic execution,” he said. “Our trading volumes are 20 times what they were in the beginning of the year.”      The firm is now measuring new capital coming in for bitcoin in the billions, Tejpaul said.

XRP, the native asset of the XRP ledger, developed by payment-focused blockchain firm Ripple Labs, climbed to as high as $0.437564 before retreating to $0.413853 at press time, reaching the highest price point since July 2019, according to the CoinDesk 20.      The third-largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained over 33% in the past 24 hours, extending the year-to-date gain to 116%.      Other alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether, litecoin, cardano, bitcoin SV, EOS, tezos and tron are also flashing green. Most of these coins have picked up a bullish momentum in the past few days, seemingly tracking bitcoin's fast move toward the record high of $19,783 reached in December 2017.      ""Altcoins are high beta assets and usually move in the same direction as bitcoin, but more,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted on Friday.

42433186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3gLh,1605924033,US Regulator Seeks End to Bank Deplatforming of 'Disfavored' Industries (Like Crypto),"Call it the CPR after Operation Choke Point.      The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a national bank regulator led by former Coinbase counsel Brian Books, has proposed a rule that would forbid banks to blacklist legal industries – including, presumably, cryptocurrency firms.      Under the proposed rule, banks could deny financial services to customers only on the basis of “quantitative, risk-based standards established in advance,” not in response to political pressures.    The proposalhttps://occ.gov/news-issuances/federal-register/2020/nr-occ-2020-156a.pdf, published Friday in the Federal Register, does not mention cryptocurrency. But it will likely come as welcome news to businesses in the space, which have long struggled to obtain or keep bank accounts in the U.S. Crypto firms have long relied on a handful of banks – Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Metropolitan Commercial Bank among them – for basic banking needs.    On the other hand, if banks in the world’s largest economy were forbidden to discriminate against legitimate businesses, then all else equal, it could, in theory, undermine the appeal of permissionless, censorship-resistant payment systems such as Bitcoin.      The OCC proposal specifically mentions Operation Choke Point, an Obama-era Justice Department initiative that was ostensibly meant to shut down only fraudulent businesses and payday lenders by pressuring banks to close their accounts. In practice, there appears to have been widespread collateral damage.      “Government agencies (but not the OCC) were revealed to have pressured banks to cut off access to financial services to disfavored (but not unlawful) sectors of the economy,” according to the OCC’s proposal. These included the firearm and coal industries. Operation Choke Point ended officially in late 2017, but financial intermediaries still receive pressure from politicians and the public to unbank industries or individuals deemed unsavory or problematic.      In its proposal, the regulator gave examples of banks being pressured by political boycotts to stop providing financial services to family planning organizations or shotgun and rifle makers.      “Neither the OCC nor banks are well-equipped to balance risks unrelated to financial exposures and the operations required to deliver financial services,” the regulator wrote. “For example, climate change is a real risk, but so is the risk of foreign wars caused in part by U.S. energy dependence and the risk of blackouts caused by energy shortages … balancing these risks is the purview of Congress and Federal energy and environmental regulators” — in other words, not financial regulators or institutions.      The proposal is open for public comment through Jan. 4.      This week, President Donald J. Trump nominated acting Comptroller Brooks to be the permanent head of the OCC for a five-year stint. Congress has yet to vote on the nomination and the projected president-elect, Joe Biden, may end up filling the post if Brooks isn’t confirmed by Jan. 20.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/21/us-regulator-seeks-end-to-bank-deplatforming-of-disfavored-industries-like-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ff36c7a06bf36b70241796a38d5c9644b1f3fb2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
