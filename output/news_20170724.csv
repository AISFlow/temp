42400248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxX3,1500932117,'Unrealistic': BIP 91 Creator James Hilliard Has Choice Words for Segwit2x,"""Nutty.""  No, developer James Hilliard isn't describing his lunch.  Rather, that's his choice of description for Segwit2x, the controversial technical roadmap announced by bitcoin's startups and miners in May, and that has been the center of widespread debate ever since.  Like many developers, Hilliard is openly critical of the proposal and the timelines it is seeking to impose on development. Still, his skepticism is particularly notable as he's played perhaps the biggest role in helping boost perceptions the plan is moving forward.  If you went so far as to argue he's the reason the Segwit2x timeline is being met (and that bitcoin hasn't split into two competing assets), you wouldn't find many detractors.  That's because Hilliard has been the driving force behind a code proposal called BIP 91. Aimed at coordinating miners to push through the long-awaited code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit), it's been called the first of the two pieces to the Segwit2x roadmap, though that may obscure that it was actually an outsider's idea.  After BIP 91's approval by miners last week, and barring any bumps, SegWit could activate by the end of August. Not to be undersold, it's a major milestone for the network, one that moves a long-heralded technical development out of political gridlock and one step closer to activation.  And to many, Hilliard deserves the credit.  What he really thinks  Given the heavy politicization of the development of late, it shouldn't be a surprise that Hilliard's motivations for his role in the code upgrade have been questioned.  Does he support an eventual and controversial upgrade to a 2MB block size? Is he doing it largely to avoid a split? Which developer team does he prefer?  In a new interview, however, Hilliard made clear he's not a fan of the full Segwit2x agreement, particularly the move to 2MB that it seeks to enact later this year.  The next step for Segwit2x is to boost the block size via a hard fork, a process that's been heavily debated (not to mention denounced as dangerous if not properly implemented).  Already, Segwit2x developer Jeff Garzik is marshaling the charge toward this milestone. But, Hilliard is concerned about this approach. For example, he believes Segwit2x's three-month timeline is too short to say the least.  ""Three months for a hard fork is completely unrealistic,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Even coding it and getting some level of testing on it, let alone deploying it… I mean, that's pretty difficult.""  Many other developers  argue that there's little chance a 2MB hard fork can be safely executed in three months, since it's a change that could lead users to lose bitcoin if not implemented correctly.  'Unknown unknowns'  And Hilliard's opinion should matter on the issue.  When not working as a technician for mining firm BitmainWarranty, Hilliard has put time researching safe hard forks. As a result, he believes changes to bitcoin's ""consensus"" code (the rules that keep the network in one piece), are naturally difficult.  ""Nothing's simple when it comes to consensus code, especially not this one. It's something that looks simple on the surface, but when you actually start looking at it, it's really complicated,” he said, adding:  ""There are just so many things that could go wrong.""  He offered SegWit as an example, noting that it took months to fix all the ""known"" issues with the code. But developers, he noted, have to deal with ""unknown unknowns.""  ""As you're implementing it, you realize, 'Oh, here’s one issue that you need to deal with.' And another comes up, and another,"" he said.  That's why many Bitcoin Core contributors are wary of hard timelines, like those encouraged by the Segwit2x agreement. ""You really don't know how long until it's going to take until the change is done,"" he added.  And some would argue that the Segwit2x group isn't taking these software security concerns very seriously.  As evidence that others are beginning to think similarly, Hilliard went as far as to assert that bitcoin mining pools might not follow through with running code created by Segwit2x developers, even though they have pledged to.  In other words, they might just switch back to Bitcoin Core's software before the hard fork, since they don't necessarily have to commit to new software.  Indeed, mining pool F2pool, and possibly other mining pools, are running Bitcoin Core with BIP 91 instead of Segwit2x's software already, a move that does much to indicate which code is trusted.  Closed review  An issue that goes hand-in-hand with this is that some users have criticized the Segwit2x group for closing itself off from some of the industry's most knowledgeable developers.  Only select developers and companies were originally invited to the mailing list and the Slack group where testing is being done and talked about. (Although, the Slack opened to new members as of yesterday.)  And even though his idea was accepted by the group, Hilliard thinks it's true that Segwit2x's review process is closed.  Bitcoin Core contributors unanimously reject the proposal, for instance, yet their feedback has been ignored (or outright dismissed).  He told CoinDesk:  ""The reason that these sorts of projects don't have open development models is that when you're pushing arguably bad ideas – say, pushing a hard fork in three months – doing that in the public is kind of difficult because when bad ideas get exposed to public criticism, they get shredded.""  Though it might seem like a large reaction to a small thing, he's hardly alone in feeling that Segwit2x's goal is to put the needs of high-risk startups over users of a true, decentralized online currency.  Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has been another outspoken opponent of Segwit2x for a similar reason, told CoinDesk that he believes the closed development process is ""highly unethical"" and ""not remotely in the spirit of open internet protocol development.""  Such comments to point to the likelihood that technical debates will continue, even though bitcoin's capacity may soon increase.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organized the Segwit2x proposal.

42400227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIxR9,1500925202,Start Your Hedging: LedgerX to Begin Trading Cryptocurrency Derivatives,"For the first time ever, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has given permission to a private company to exchange and clear any number of cryptocurrency derivatives.  After three years of work, New York-based startup LedgerX was today granted a rare derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license allowing it to clear and custody financial instruments backed by bitcoin, ether and any number of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies.  The instruments, designed to mitigate investment risk, are the latest signal that the cryptocurrency markets are maturing, with the total value of the asset class crossing $115bn earlier this year.  But the guidance from the agency in charge of ensuring the integrity of all futures and swaps markets in the US could have bigger implications than just letting a single company finally open for business.  LedgerX co-founder and CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk:  ""It means a lot, not just for the industry, but globally, because the CFTC will set the example of what a well-licensed clearinghouse and exchange based around digital currencies will look like.""  As part of the DCO license, LedgerX will be required to surveil the institutional investors it works with and create increased transparency about those customers for the regulatory agency. Eligible participants include broker dealers, banks, futures commission merchants, qualified commodity pools and qualified high net worth investors.  With the granting of this license, these groups will now be able to enter into complex contracts with one another, with values derived from the underlying cryptographic asset.  As a result, Chou believes the creation of these assets will mark a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency markets, giving investors more sophisticated ways to hedge, and possibly, helping to stabilize long-volatile cryptocurrency prices.  ""We have a lot of in-progress talks with customers that are looking to work with retail customers that want to buy derivatives on bitcoin, binaries, all these exotic options,"" he said.  Beyond bitcoin  Though frequently described as a bitcoin exchange and clearinghouse, LedgerX's license did not require an overly broad definition of cryptocurrency. Rather, the permission is open to any of a series of instruments derived from the cryptographic primitives used to build a number of protocols.  Similar to how G5 currencies are typically viewed as safe investments due to their relative stability, Chou imagines three to five cryptocurrencies will be deemed ""viable"" candidates for the exchange and clearinghouse, based on market capitalization and functionality.  Initial coin offering (ICO) tokens sold to raise funds will not likely be considered for inclusion on LedgerX, given their gray area between CFTC-regulated commodities and SEC regulated securities.  Rather than having to reapply for each currency and each derivative contract, LedgerX will ""self-certify"" that the new opportunity is compliant.  ""Instead of evaluating different governments,"" as with the case of a G5 currency, said Chou, ""you’ll be evaluating different technologies or approaches underneath these digital currencies.""  Global implications  The CFTC decision comes at a time when many in the cryptocurrency industry have been anxiously awaiting clear guidance — including other regulators.  In March, another lengthy cryptocurrency regulatory application was refused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing among other things, a lack of ""surveillance-sharing agreements,"" and a requirement that ""markets must be regulated.""  Currently under review by the SEC, the application would let Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss list a bitcoin-tied exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the BATS BTX Excahnge.  Given LedgerX's lengthy requirements to report on its customers and the regulatory body's history of co-regulating certain instruments, Chou believes today's decision could provide just the answer the SEC and other agencies in Asia and Europe have been waiting for.  ""I think the CFTC will set an example both for other regulators here in the U.S., but also globally as well,"" he said.  Three-year battle  After years of working and waiting, progress had been moving swiftly leading up to today's news.  It was just earlier this month that the CFTC formally registered LedgerX as a swap execution facility (SEF) after operating with a temporary license for about two years, making the New York-based firm only the second cryptocurrency outfit to be regulated under the provision.  A close observer of the developing story might have even found a clue back in May, when LedgerX announced it had raised an $11.4 million Series B led by Miami International Holdings and Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments.  It turns out, the money for the startup that had already raised a $1.5 million seed round and an undisclosed Series A was intended to meet capital requirements implemented by the Dodd-Frank Act. In order to ensure agreements can be fulfilled in case of an emergency, the act requires that a DCO hold operating costs to run its business for a year.  Going as far back as September 2015, former CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen has been sitting on the board of LedgerX parent company Ledger Holdings, and since January 2016, Chou has served on the CFTC technology advisory committee.  In a statement, Wetjen said:  ""These are exciting times to have a new digital asset class emerge. I hope that the effort LedgerX put forward in the U.S. can set the stage for a global approach to this new digital asset class.""  Democratizing services  By moving the trading and settling of cryptocurrency assets into one heavily observed operation, Chou expects he'll be able to generate revenue from an entirely new source: data analytics to an unprecedented depth.  In addition to charging other exchanges for his service, Chou expects the CFTC's heavy surveillance requirements will result in cryptocurrency markets data that can be cross-referenced with points from previously existing data sets.  When the platform formally launches later this year, these services and more will only be available to eligible contract participants. But, Chou described his business model as ""multi-stage,"" eventually serving those who were previously unable to afford such services.  ""At first we're going to target a lot of institutional customers that want to invest in this asset class,"" said Chou, who added:  ""Then later, pretty much everybody.""

42400215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvMG,1500919572,Winklevoss Backed Gemini Exchange to Begin Daily Ether Auctions,"Digital currency exchange Gemini is set to begin hosting daily ether auctions on Friday.  Starting on July 28, the exchange – backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – will host an auction for ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) each business day at 4pm ET.  The launch comes less than a year after Gemini unveiled a daily bitcoin auction. Last September, the exchange positioned the auction kick-off as a way to mirror the kinds of sales held on traditional bourses like the New York Stock Exchange. In March, Gemini began offering a second daily auction for bitcoin, held during the East Asian Timezone.  ""This provides an opportunity for both buyers and sellers to trade in an instant of elevated liquidity and price discovery,"" the exchange said in an announcement blog post from last week.  According to Gemini, indicative auction prices will be broadcasted through its market data API and website 10 minutes before the auction time, during which it will be updated every minute until the final 60 seconds, with the price refreshing every 15 seconds after that point.

42400209,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvEO,1500918736,Think Bitcoin Is Small Business? Bitfury Is Making Almost $100 Million Annually,"The myth that blockchain industry startups don't make money has been largely shattered by investor documents that show Bitfury Group is generating revenue that would make it competitive against more mainstream companies.  Founded in 2011, the venture-backed startup that started as a bitcoin mining operation, and that has since expanded to offer other software services, generated $93.7 million revenue in fiscal year 2017 according to the documents obtained by CoinDesk. In total, this was a 70 percent increase year-over-year.  Of that revenue, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $24.7 million based on a 26 percent margin.  The firm – based in Amsterdam with offices in San Fransisco, Washington, DC, Riga, Latvia and Hong Kong – has already raised more than $100 million in venture capital, according to the documents, about $10 million more than the previously known number.  When those numbers are compared to revenue from venture-backed startups with similar numbers, Bitfury Group fits in with some recognizable names across more mainstream industries.  Last year, small business loan startup Kabbage generated a bit more than Bitfury Group with $97.4 million in revenue, but raised significantly higher equity funding with $239 million, according to the most recent Inc 500 list. Software company Yext, which went public earlier this year, actually generated less revenue than Bitfury Group, with $89 million after raising about $117 million.  In addition to Bitfury Group's revenue generated by bitcoin transaction fees, the company also lists a total of 500,000 bitcoins ""generated to date"" from the protocol's block rewards. At today’s prices of about $2,600, that would amount to $1.3 billion earned from mining, though there is evidence some of those bitcoins have been sold.  To give an idea of how Bitfury Group's mining operations compare to the overall bitcoin network, the company listed a 9 percent market share in March 2016 compared to an 11 percent share a year later. To put that in a bigger context, the documents reveal the only miners with a larger market share are Bitmain, with 19 percent and F2Pool with 12 percent.  Forecasting the future  The materials, which appear to be part of an effort to raise additional capital, also include numerous forecasts for the company’s own growth, as well as that of the entire industry.  Notably, by the year 2021, Bitfury Group predicts it will be generating $585 million in revenue.  Of that, $302 million (52 percent) is expected to come from transaction fees ($163 million) and mining rewards ($139 million); $217 million (37 percent) is expected to come from third-party infrastructure solutions including its Blockbox mining unit; and $66 million (11 percent) from b2b services, including its newly revealed Exonum enterprise grade blockchain.  But it's the total market for bitcoin transaction fees that appears to be BitFury Group's most enticing business vertical.  Described as a ""vast opportunity,"" it predicts $37 billion in transaction fees will be generated by the next reward ""halving.""  Don't say 'mining'  At least as far back as 2014, Bitfury Group co-founder Valery Vavilov has been working diligently to change the perception that his company was not a ""mining"" company.  In an early interview with CoinDesk, Vavilov went so far as to make this declaration, preferring instead to focus his efforts on ""fields of knowledge where humanity needs a lot of computing power.""  Nearly three years later, the investor deck appears to confirm that this transition has been successful.  Since that 2014 interview, Bitfury Group has grown to 250 employees, up from 70, according to Vavilov. He also cited the company's role in helping create The Global Blockchain Business Council, The Blockchain Trust Accelerator and the Blockchain Summit, currently underway, as evidence of its broader mission.  ""These are early days in blockchain, and we believe the future of bitcoin and the entire blockchain ecosystem shines bright,” Vavilov said.  As part of that broader scope, Bitfury Group has migrated much of the bitcoin mining wording to another website, giving the Bitfury Group domain a much more enterprise-driven appearance. The investor documents support that broader work by painting a picture of a much more ""holistic business strategy"" than one would expect from a pure mining operation.  While mining chips still make up a significant portion of the strategy (and indeed the revenue) going forward, the documents also describe a ""full envisioned product portfolio"" built around software licenses for the Exonum enterprise blockchain and other unannounced efforts.  The report concludes:  ""Bitfury is the only provider of enterprise private blockchain solutions supported by the inherent security and transparency of the public blockchain, when its competitors are developing transverse initiatives mostly focused on the financial services sector.""      Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that $13 billion dollars was created from Bitfury's block rewards.

42400213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvKI,1500914162,New Hampshire's Bitcoin MSB Exemption Law Takes Effect Next Week,"A regulatory exemption for digital currency traders in New Hampshire is set to take effect next week.  As reported last month by CoinDesk, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed HB 436 on June 2, which excludes ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from the state's money services rules. The measure was first introduced in January.  According to the text of the bill, which was finalized in late April, the new rules take place on August 1, or next Tuesday.  The measure won plaudits from the state's bitcoin community, though state officials, including those from its chief financial regulator, blasted the then-proposed law in hearings before the legislature. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, with Rep. Keith Ammon co-sponsoring the measure.  When it came time for votes, both the House of Representatives as well as the Senate displayed a somewhat divided view on the bill, clearing it by votes of 185-170 and 13-10, respectively.  Ultimately, the new rules highlight how New Hampshire has taken a largely different approach to its regulation of digital currencies. Other states, from New Hampshire to Washington, have opted for tighter controls on those who trade or handle digital currencies on behalf of customers.

Announced on 20th July, the grant for $794,000 to Salt Lake City-based Evernym was sourced from the Department of Homeland Security's Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR). That initiative has doled out funds to blockchain startups in the past, including Evernym, which has previously received a grant from DHS focused on the development of key management tools.  According to DHS, Evernym will design and build ""a decentralized key management system for blockchain technologies"". The research project is being managed by the department's Cyber Security Division.  William Bryan, acting DHS Undersecretary for Science and Technology, said in a statement:  ""A better, more secure method is needed to safeguard the identity and privacy of web-users. Research in blockchain holds significant potential to provide a solution that will make it considerably more difficult to hack an online user's identity.""  The SBIR program is a contract awards program that aims to get small businesses involved in federal research and development initiatives.

42400217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvJJ,1500897616,Crypto Assets Trade 24/7 – And That Changes More Than Uptime,"So, you're new to cryptocurrency ...  If you're anything like me, you’re probably awash in a sea of websites (many with the words ""crypto"" or ""coin"" in the title), and all of which look like something you might get if you locked a group of coders in a room and encouraged them to design a cypherpunk version of E-Trade.  As things stand now, as an investor or potential investor, you have probably seen big gains in cryptocurrency – but you’re still trying to get your bearings. (People around you are certainly making lots of money: Since I was hired at CoinDesk, bitcoin's price has gone up nearly $1,000, and that's just at the ""established"" end of the cryptocurrency spectrum.)  But while the big gains might be enticing, remember, you’re not just entering a new market – you’re also entering a market that may not have all of the features and conventions you’ve come to expect and rely upon as an investor.  Let's start with one of the most obvious aspects of cryptocurrency: Markets trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week – and that feature, as I'll explain, changes a lot more than market uptime.  24/7 trading  For one, the 24-hour market structure requires investors to think about the daily price changes in their positions through a different conceptual lens than their stock portfolios.  In the U.S., stocks listed on The New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market trade, during regular market hours, between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST.  Sure, there are after-market hours that span from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. But during these trading windows, liquidity is generally thinner and prices executions are less favorable. This means that investors, generally speaking, are forced to pay more to buy stock and sell at lower prices.  Finer points aside, the effect of this is that every day, every stock has an opening price and a closing price.  If you check the price of a stock you own on your phone, you can see the current price and price change, which is typically expressed in both absolute dollar terms and as a percentage change.  What’s that change benchmarked against?  It's not that day's opening price, as is sometimes assumed, but the closing price from the previous day's trading session. (This makes perfect sense: stocks typically open higher or lower than the previous day's closing price, due to trading in after-market or pre-market-trading.)  This means that if you want to calculate the price change in a given stock, you subtract the current price from yesterday's closing price and then divide by yesterday’s closing price, and then, finally, multiply by 100 to express that number as a percentage.    – (CurrentPrice - YesterdayClose) / YesterdayClose * 100      – Or, even more simply: ΔPrice / YesterdayClose * 100    The difference with crypto  Now, let’s take a look at the cryptocurrency markets.  Because the cryptocurrency markets never close, there are no opening or closing prices that we can identify.  The workaround that is currently in place is to calculate the 24-hour price change by comparing the current market price to the price a given cryptocurrency was trading the day before at exactly the same time.    – (CurrentPrice - 24HourAgoPrice) / 24HourAgoPrice * 100      – Or, more simply: ΔPrice / 24HourAgoPrice * 100    Take a look at the stock price change formula and compare it to the cryptocurrency price change formula.  Did you notice that in the stock price change formula the denominator, which represents yesterday's closing price, stays the same all day, while the cryptocurrency denominator keeps changing throughout the day?  What’s the practical effect of this rolling denominator?  In the simplest terms, it means that if you’re just looking at the percentage change over the last 24 hours, you can’t tell whether you're seeing real-time price movement in the cryptocurrency or just residual price volatility from the day before.  If you’re a long-term investor in cryptocurrency, you may not worry too much about 24-hour price gyrations – but it’s still important to understand what the data you’re looking at is measuring.

42400207,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvDP,1500890442,ICOs in the EU: How Will the 'Slow Giant' Regulate Tokens?,"Jacek Czarnecki is a lawyer specializing in blockchain technology.  In this opinion piece, Czarnecki shines a light on how ICOs might be regulated in the European Union, proposing next steps and potential challenges ahead.      A lot is happening in the initial coin offering (ICO) world.  Spurred by multimillion-dollar sales, the blockchain use case is drawing the interest of funds, investors, lawyers and regulators. But so far, the latter group has largely remained silent on the issue.  That's not to say there's not activity, though.  Much has been said already on how US law might apply to tokens, with the main subject of exploration being securities law.  Perhaps as a result, ICO organizers are now looking for jurisdictions that could provide legal certainty in this field. Some countries, aware of such efforts, are responding, engaging in jurisdictional competition.  Yet, for all the ink on the subject to date, surprisingly, not much has been said about how European Union law deals with tokens and ICOs. With that in mind, let's shed some light on this part of the world and how it might see regulatory approaches emerge.  The legal issues  On the most basic level, the legal problems with tokens and ICOs are the same in both the US and the EU.  Similar to the US, the key problem lies in whether a token is a security. If the answer is ""yes,"" the snowball effect begins, because such an approach triggers application of financial regulations.  Other important issues include anti-money laundering (AML) laws, payment services regulations and, of course, taxes. However, for some reasons these topics are much more complicated under the EU law than under the corresponding US regulations.  There are two main reasons for that.  First, the relevant EU regulatory frameworks are changing. Many laws are new, evolving or under ongoing reconstruction. To name just a few: MiFID II (the cornerstone piece of legislation for investment services), Prospectus Regulation (PR3) and the new Anti‑Money Laundering Directive. A lot is happening as part of the emerging EU’s Capital Markets Union.  Second, the situation in the EU is quite complex. We have the EU level and the member states level, and many laws developed on the former have yet to be implemented on the latter.  This sometimes leads to regulatory inconsistencies across member states, even though – in theory – the laws should be the same. Also, many issues are left to member states' discretion, which can cause differences in their regulatory approaches.  The proper approach  As mentioned, the fundamental question that every ICO organizer should ask is: ""Is my token a security?"" Unfortunately, under the EU law, the answer is not so straightforward.  MiFID, the EU's cornerstone piece of legislation related to investment services, provides such terms as ""transferable securities,"" which are a type of a broader category of financial instruments.  Transferable securities are those classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market, with the exception of instruments of payment, such as:  Shares in companies and other securities equivalent to shares in companies, partnerships or other entities, and depositary receipts in respect of shares  Bonds or other forms of securitized debt, including depositary receipts in respect of such securities  Any other securities giving the right to acquire or sell any such transferable securities or giving rise to a cash settlement determined by reference to transferable securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, commodities or other indices or measures.    It is a critical definition, as it is applicable to other regulations as well, such as laws related to prospectus requirements.  The definition is very broad, because basically it defines transferable securities as ""those classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market."" Theoretically, none of the securities types mentioned in this definition applies to most tokens.  However, points 1–3 are provided just as prominent examples, and the list is not exhaustive.  One reasonable approach assumes that, as long as a given token does not resemble any of the securities listed in the definition (such as shares, bonds etc.), it is not a security, even though the list is not exhaustive.  This would mean that many tokens should not be considered as securities, whereas some – for example, asset-backed or rights-related tokens (such as equity-like tokens) – are much closer to being qualified as such.  Unfortunately, there is no court judgment or official guidance on the EU level that would serve as an equivalent to the Howey Test in the US.  In practice, this means that all doubts are solved primarily on the member-state level. While it is usually not a problem with regard to standard and well-known types of securities, the case of tokens and ICOs is different.  Notably, many EU states have their own, historically well-developed legal doctrines on securities, which are not necessarily the same as those in other member countries. And as long as a clear framework on the EU level is missing, these local approaches will dominate.  This means that even though ICOs are by nature not only EU-wide, but global, in practice the legal analysis of a particular token crowdsale would be mainly based on the law of just one member state. The EU law would be applicable to the extent that it provides a general definition of ""transferable securities,"" but the lack of more specific interpretative guidance on tokens would have to be mitigated by a member state’s own law and its local interpretation.  In the future this might even lead to diverging approaches (and jurisdictional competition inside the EU).  A well-known example from the past was the case of applying value-added tax (VAT) to the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat money, finally solved only after a ruling from the Court of Justice.  One of the main goals of the EU is to take care of the single market, and to avoid such differences among member states. So, there is potentially room for action, taking into account token types, distribution methods, etc.  Regulatory guidance  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which is the EU’s securities agency, has not issued any public statement on ICOs yet.  Interestingly, in February 2017, ESMA published a report on distributed ledger technology (DLT). At that time, however, legal discussions with regard to applying securities regulations to token crowdsales were already well underway.  Ultimately, ESMA adopted a specific approach to the topic, which could be illustrated by one sentence from the report:  ""In line with current market initiatives in securities markets, the rest of the report deliberately focuses on permissioned DLT.""  It thus seems that the ESMA deliberately avoided covering in the report public blockchains, and also tokens and ICOs. As a result, there is no regulatory guidance yet available on the EU level.  Another approach was adopted by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which in its discussion paper from April 2017 specifically asked about ICOs.  Of course, it cannot be ruled out that ESMA will take a closer look on ICOs in the future. A positive result would mean dispelling some of the doubts and unknowns. On the other hand, one never exactly knows what approach to expect and how restrictive it might be.  Next steps  What follows from the above is that there is very little certainty on whether and how to apply the EU securities law to tokens and ICOs. In practice, the national laws of member states would play much greater role, which is not necessarily an optimal solution from the EU’s perspective.  This uncertainty has triggered some market-led efforts to provide clarity with regard to application of the EU law, including securities regulations, to tokens and ICOs. A prominent example is the European Regulatory Initiative led by blockchain investment platform Neufund, which launched a report called ""Tokens As Novel Asset Class,"" that was supported by many industry participants.  Contrary to smaller jurisdictions with less complex and more flexible decision-making, the EU is a slow giant. Sometimes it takes years before the EU undertakes action, in particular in the field of financial regulation.  In the case of ICOs and tokens, the right and balanced decision is needed sooner rather than later. The market does not need a comprehensive legal solution; just an interpretation defining basic issues would suffice.  I am sure the EU can make it.

42400236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvHL,1500886805,Kosovo's First Bitcoin ATM Sparks Central Bank Warning,"A private business in Kosovo is gearing up to install its first bitcoin ATM amid warnings from the country's central bank.  According to regional news source Balkan Insight, the ATM is expected to be placed in the center of Pristina, the country's capital city. Operated by IT systems firm Albvision Ltd, the machine will support transactions in bitcoin, and soon, 10 other cryptocurrencies.  The firm also has bitcoin ATMs planned for cities in two other Balkan countries: Tirana in Albania, and Skopje in the Republic of Macedonia.  Still, the decision to launch the unit has attracted attention from the country's financial regulators, who stressed that cryptocurrencies are lacking consumer protections due to a lack of local regulation.  ""We inform all potential virtual money users that in the Republic of Kosovo there is no institution guaranteeing the reimbursement of money that is lost,"" a statement from the Kosovo Central Bank noted.  Meanwhile, technology enthusiasts are coming to the defense.  In separate statements to the media, they're arguing a better way to mitigate threats is through educating the public and expediting the country's regulatory classification of the technology.  ""The risk is the same; a user can lose money if they do not know how to use it. But this ATM will create possibilities for bitcoin to have more users. The biggest risk is not knowing how to use it,"" said Valmir Hazeri, chief operations officer of a local bitcoin company Bitsapphire.  Hazeri went on to call for local regulators to take steps to open the conversation about possible legal accommodations for the industry.

42400208,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvGM,1500884105,Bold But Cautious: London Stock Exchange's Blockchain Work Is History Repeated,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.  In this opinion piece, Acheson discussion a recent DLT tech trial spearheaded by the London Stock Exchange, using history's lessons as a way to foretell the project's possible future.      Over 20 years ago, with little fanfare and much skepticism, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) took a bold step that ended up changing company finance.  Eager to open up the market and diversify its income, the LSE launched a new type of stock exchange aimed at smaller high-growth companies unable to meet the broader exchange’s requirements. The Alternative Investment Market, or Aim, was born.  Aside from the occasional hiccup, the venture can be called a success.  From a modest launch with 10 companies, the new exchange grew to almost 1,700 at its peak in 2017. And while many of the listed businesses are tiny, some have market capitalizations that rival those on bigger exchanges.  On a loop  Now, history could be about to repeat itself.  CoinDesk reported earlier this week that a subsidiary of the LSE Group is testing a blockchain platform to store private company records. Developed by Borsa Italia and IBM, the goal is to digitize shareholding structures, facilitate cap table management and bolster investor confidence.  Again, the group is choosing a cautious approach, but with grand goals.  While the initial project is focusing only on investment records, the group recognizes that this is a first step toward being able to digitize the actual shares, as well as future debt.  The idea of issuing shares on the blockchain is not new. The US state of Delaware is making significant progress on this, and exchanges around the world are progressing with trials.  The impact on company financing could be huge. Creating shares on a distributed ledger would lower both overheads and barriers, enabling small, private companies to enjoy a greater shareholding flexibility and liquidity. Investors would be more interested in investing in private businesses knowing they could exit relatively easily, which would further facilitate access to financing. And the exchanges themselves would enjoy lower administration costs and more transparent oversight, which would make compliance with ever-stricter rules less onerous.  Apart from the boost to investment and efficiency, a broader financing market would solve another issue. In spite of jittery institutions that were burned by previous growth market flameouts, the EU has indicated an interest in encouraging the creation of more junior exchanges such as Aim. Its goal is to not only support entrepreneurship, but also redress a systemic imbalance: the Euro area market capitalization as a percentage of GDP is approximately half that of the US.  The LSE Group’s initiative appears to be a positive step forward, for both market activity and blockchain development.  Eyes open  However, we do need to be aware of its possible impact on financial stability.  More liquidity also means more risk. In private equity, investors are generally there for the long term. Since exits are complicated, backers tend to use longer-term criteria when evaluating an opportunity, and often help out when things go wrong. Companies with tradeable securities don’t enjoy that benefit, and the result could be a slide in management quality.  Even if investors are focused on long-term fundamentals, easy exits can make the temptation to use them harder to resist. And as we have seen, in times of market turmoil common sense is usually in short supply. A stampede out the door, either because of negative rumors or a sharp change in general market sentiment, could wipe out both business and investors.  On the whole, the short-term effect of this and other initiatives is likely to be positive. Further trials leading to live projects could boost entrepreneurship and investment, which will in turn impact employment and economic growth. It is important, however, to remember that many of the barriers to investment are there for a reason.  The LSE’s strategy of approaching bold moves with caution – 22 years ago and today – will enable innovation to gradually find its place in a fast-changing field, and from there build a new type of system… step by careful step.

42400220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIvPD,1500867002,Details Emerge on Singapore Central Bank's Blockchain R&D,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore has revealed a three-step plan to connect the world’s central banks via distributed ledger technology.  The two-phase effort called ""Project Ubin"" would see global central banks settling cross-border transactions in real time via a blockchain.  Unlike the current system, where only high-value or institutionally crucial transactions are settled in real time, Project Ubin is being designed to let make every cross-border payment and security settlement almost instant.  By tokenizing global currencies and protecting the privacy of each transaction using zero-knowledge proofs, Intel’s software guard extensions, or other means currently being explored, the new system of self-executing smart contracts could increase both the speed and privacy of international transactions.  But Project Ubin – built in partnership with banking consortium R3 and banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group – is about more than just remittances.  History of the project  The first phase of the six-week project concluded December 23, 2016, and was formally announced on March 9, 2017, with the publication of a white paper detailing the results of the partnership.  Co-authored by Deloitte, the 44-page white paper, recounted Project Ubin’s strides towards tokenizing the Singaporean dollar (SGD) using distributed ledger technology. Specifically, the paper explained how lessons learned by R3 during a similar effort with Canada, called Project Jasper, were employed to build an ethereum-based prototype.  The paper shows how the system for the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s high-value and urgent transfers, called MEPS+, can be linked to the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) to increase money transfer efficiency between different participant’s online wallets.  Phase two of the project is now underway.  Designed to further research the prototype, the specific aim is now to improve how transactions are settled compared to the current system, where they are queued and periodically netted using ""classical algorithms,"" according to a representative of the Monetary Authority.  The process, called ""gridlock resolution,"" requires that a single central party have an overarching view of all the transactions to find the net sum. But if phase two of Project Ubin is ultimately successful, that could all change.  This second phase is divided into three steps. Now underway, step one involves a closer look at the mechanics of smart contracts, according to the representative.  To bridge the gap between the promise of distributed ledger technology to privately settle transactions in gross – or real time, as opposed to netting periodically – a team of eight part-time staffers and two full-time interns is exploring the use of zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation like MIT's Enigma Project, Intel's software guard extension (SGX) technology and Microsoft's cryptlets.  The second step of Project Ubin's current work is to identify how the platform can be integrated with various central securities depositories, including Singapore's own SGX, which is overseen by the Monetary Authority.  If that is successful, step three would eventually extend the digital bank issued cryptocurrencies even further to other central banks.  Central bank blockchains  The Monetary Authority’s plan to improve on the scalability and privacy of distributed ledger technology follows a shift in recent months away from last year's enthusiasm about the potential of blockchain to decentralize some central bank tasks.  Last August, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and UBS revealed plans for their own ""settlement coin,"" a similar, controversial, effort aimed to help central banks transact using tokenized assets on a distributed ledger.  In recent months, though, both the Bank of Canadahttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bank-of-canada-says-wont-use-blockchain-for-interbank-payment-system/article35112169/ and the Bank of England have made public statements about what they believe are the current limitations of blockchain technology and other distributed ledgers to provide the volume and privacy they need.  Going forward, the Monetary Authority's research team plans to validate policy questions around the possible conversion of the Singapore dollar into a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) and the potential impact of such a change on monetary policy.  A consultation paper on the matter is also forthcoming, designed to make clear the trajectory of the project.
