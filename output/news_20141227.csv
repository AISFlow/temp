42377912,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCRR,1419691344,Safello Co-Founder Moves to Tokyo to Start New Bitcoin Security Firm,"The co-founder of Swedish exchange Safello has left the company to join a team of bitcoin security experts in establishing a new Tokyo-based consulting firm.  The move should also see him assisting the investigation into Mt Gox's missing bitcoins.  Emil Oldenburg, who was also Safello's chief technology officer, left Sweden just last month and is now an official co-founder at WizSec, a new startup that has been performing unofficial analysis of Gox's transaction records.  Oldenburg told CoinDesk he was looking for something different after launching Safello in August 2013. A love of Japanese pop culture and a desire to return to his infosec roots drove him to make a quick decision on a chance offer.  He said:  ""I saw an opportunity in Japan and decided I needed to act now, as it wouldn't be there forever.""  Oldenburg met Wizsec's chief hacking officer J. Maurice at the Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup while on vacation in spring. The two got talking about security issues, and Oldenburg received an offer almost immediately.  Maurice said the engineer, who had racked up more than two years as a systems security specialist at Nasdaq OMX in Europe, was a catch for his fledgling company.  ""Our goal is to recruit the most elite hackers from all over the world, so we're honored to have Emil come join us to co-found our bitcoin security firm.""  Safello in Europe  Safello  operates a Europe-wide exchange serving all countries of the European Union plus Norway and Switzerland, leveraging Swedish banks' comparatively liberal attitude towards cryptocurrency businesses, and Europe's SOFORT instant payments system to serve its clients.  The company received its initial $600,000 backing from bitcoin veterans Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver and Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary. A further $250,000 investment came in July via Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp.  Seeing Japan up close  Despite the long-distance relocation, Oldenburg remains a shareholder in Safello and still has a keen interest in the exchange business.  A manga and Japanophile since his teenage years, Oldenburg had helped organize Japan-themed conventions in his native land, festivals that attracted thousands of cosplaying Swedes to peruse Japanese merchandise, games, and other cultural exports.  ""I'd studied the language in school and wanted to learn the language for real,"" Oldenburg added.  WizSec and the Gox connection  In November, San Francisco-based Kraken launched its local Japanese exchange, announcing immediately after that it had been selected by bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi to assist him and the Tokyo Metropolitan police in their investigation into what became of Mt Gox's 650,000 still unaccounted-for bitcoins.  WizSec has since signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Kraken, which prevents the company from discussing its current work, though it can be assumed it will involve Mt Gox somehow.  The founding team, which then consisted of Maurice, colleague Kim Nilsson and Gox creditor advocate Daniel Kelman, earlier this year took the personal challenge of analyzing the ""ticker-tape"" of Gox transaction information that had become publicly available through hacks, leaks and IRC chats.  This was despite the fact that the Japanese police were keeping all official Mt Gox transaction and customer data behind closed doors, unavailable for public examination.  Rising demand for bitcoin security  WizSec, which Maurice started after leaving IT firm Wiz Technologies in order to focus exclusively on bitcoin business, used its reconstructed Gox data to form new theories on what may have happened to the funds.  While the Mt Gox investigation looks likely to be WizSec's primary task, the company is also busy signing up other clients for security-related jobs involving audits and pen-testing.  Maurice, who also played a part in battling Roger Ver's would-be hacker/blackmailer in May, said these incidents had all led to a big increase in demand for security consulting in the cryptocurrency field.  ""As Mt Gox taught us, the most important thing in bitcoin is to not get hacked, or to build systems that don't require such trust in the first place, and that's what our firm will help new bitcoin startups with.""  ""We're building secure infrastructure from the beginning, so we can prevent another epic failure like Gox from ever happening again,"" he said.

42377911,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCSh,1419673527,Bitcoin Price 2014: A Year in Review,"If the story of bitcoin in 2013 was its meteoric rise in price, which saw it hit a peak of over $1,100 in November, then the tale of bitcoin's price this year is one of plummeting from those heights.  The price of bitcoin opened the year at $770, according to the CoinDesk Price Index. By mid-December, it was trading in the mid-$300 range. This represents a drop of more than 50% from the start of the year.  However, it's worth noting that bitcoin is still trading comfortably above its price for much of last year. Indeed, it is changing hands for more than three times the amount it was trading at during the highs of April 2013, before its historic bull run.  Over the past 12 months, the price has been buffeted by a diverse array of factors, ranging from adoption by payments giant PayPal and technology goliath Microsoft to the massive sell-order from the 'BearWhale' and rumoured clampdowns by the Chinese authorities.  The interactive price chart below, based on the CoinDesk BPI, retraces the highs and lows of bitcoin's price as it struggles to find its feet after an incredible year.

42377923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCfH,1419655685,Bitcoin Continues March to Mainstream at St Petersburg Bowl Game,"If BitPay's decision to promote bitcoin through a college football playoff seemed bizarre or peculiar at times, the event ultimately succeeded as spectacle, promoting the emerging technology's benefits to many hearing about it for the first time.  The Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl packed in references to bitcoin amid the typical college football trappings, the cheerleaders, marching bands and garishly painted fans that assembled in Florida throughout the week. Bitcoin was visible at a Christmas Day 'Battle of the Bands' competition, a commemorative physical bitcoin was used during the official coin toss and BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi explained bitcoin on local sports radio.  Though advertising blanketed the host stadium at Tropicana Field both on field and on ESPN, evidence suggests the event may have had the greatest impact not on a more general audience, but on BitPay's target demographic – small merchants.  In contrast to the skeptical college football fans in attendance and a sometimes critical social media viewership, the more than 20 local merchants surveyed by CoinDesk throughout the day were receptive to bitcoin as a payment method.  Still, the event featured a dedicated bitcoin 'Fan Zone' aimed at consumers. Located just blocks from the stadium on bustling Central Avenue, it was here where bitcoin arguably had the most impact on this demographic as attendees were able to ask questions and engage the industry.  AirBitz  CEO Paul Puey, who showcased his company's bitcoin wallet at the booth, perhaps best summed up the industry's optimism that the game and similar events will have a more lasting impact on consumers and the general public.  Puey said:  ""This event is not going to be remembered for the people who played in it, this event is going to be remembered going down as the biggest event to expose bitcoin in 2014. I can tell my kids about the Bitcoin Bowl, that I was there, that I educated a handful of people.""  Perhaps most notable, however, was the lack of bitcoin payments at the event itself, as bitcoin was not accepted at the venue's retail stores or concession stands as it is at other US sports venues in San Jose and Sacramento.  ""We could not come to an agreement on bitcoin being in the stadium with the Tampa Bay Rays,"" BitPay spokesperson Ashley Wheeler said, referring to the baseball franchise that calls the venue home.  As for the game, the North Carolina State (NC State) Wolfpack defeated the University of Central Florida (UCF) Knights after an exciting late comeback by their opponent. The final score was 34 to 27.  Up close with bitcoin  Though packed with entertainment, education was also a key focus for BitPay.  At its collaborative Fan Zone, bitcoin companies like Airbitz and Trucoin and digital payment companies like NCR Silver interacted with interested consumers alongside the official event sponsor.  NCR Silver product manager Reggie Kimble, who cited the Bitcoin Bowl as one of the reasons the payments giant integrated bitcoin into its point-of-sale system, believes events like the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl are effective and needed.  ""A lot of people are interested in bitcoin and really, the name Bitcoin Bowl has inspired a lot of curiosity from the general public which is sadly disillusioned and asking a lot of questions, so it's an opportunity to educate,"" Kimble told CoinDesk.  However, Kimble noted that, for now, such education is still in the early stages. ""I can tell you the most frequently asked question is 'Tell me all about this bitcoin',"" he added. ""Consumers want to know about it.""  Chris Brunner, president of bitcoin brokerage Trucoin, reported more success, speaking to ""a few hundred"" people at the booth over the course of the day where he showcased his company's new bitcoin ATM solution.  ""It's been exciting for us to speak to people who are from a slightly different demographic,"" Brunner said. ""As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, it's exciting for us to touch base with the world outside with the tech-sphere.""  Elsewhere, mobile payments startup TabbedOut was in attendance.  Consumer awareness low  Outside the booth, however, attendees seemed less concerned with bitcoin.  A random sampling of both NC State and UCF fans by CoinDesk suggested that bitcoin awareness among the crowd was limited, even despite the presence of the BitPay and bitcoin logos throughout the stadium and surrounding shops.  Regardless of demographic, many fans of both NC State and UCF were unaware of bitcoin, had only heard about it in passing or believe bitcoin is a company. Most seemed generally receptive to the idea of digital money, while others suggested they would learn more about bitcoin after hearing its benefits.  Steve Patterson, author of the e-book What's the Big Deal about Bitcoin? was also in the crowd interacting with fans, and reported similar findings.  ""I've spoken with a few people here and no one understands anything about [bitcoin],"" he said, adding that he's had the opposite experience with local business owners.  Twitter tipping blitz  The educational efforts surrounding the game weren't limited to St Petersburg.  On Twitter, bitcoin enthusiasts such as author Andreas Antonopoulos; bitcoin investor Erik Voorhees and core developer Jeff Garzik engaged social media users with bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip, donating bitcoin to those interested in learning more about the technology.    Tipping virtual beers during #BitcoinBowl #bitcoin      — Jeff Garzik (@jgarzik) December 27, 2014    There, the industry helped dispel common misconceptions about the technology, while engaging users who demonstrated a real interest in the digital currency and poking fun at bitcoin's more visible critics.    Could someone explain #bitcoinbowl to me? The bitcoin I understand. It’s the football that has me stumped. Why are they slamming each other? — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) December 27, 2014            BitPay refines its pitch  The game also showcased new advertisements for BitPay, both of which took opposite approaches to appealing to merchants while stressing bitcoin's benefits as an online payment option.  The ads are the first by a bitcoin company to appear on ESPN, a major US sports network that reaches 100 million households in total.  One video took a decidedly humorous approach to highlighting the difference between bitcoin and credit cards, painting traditional online payment companies as a greedy mafia.  Watch the first commercial here:  Another was more serious with its tone, emphasizing the benefits for merchants. The approach suggests BitPay is still trying to refine its pitch to a wider audience, but that small merchants remain its core focus.  BitPay boasts a notable stable of billion-dollar clients including online retailers TigerDirect and Newegg, and most recently, Internet pioneer Microsoft, though neither ad catered to enterprise companies.  Watch the second video below:  BitPay did not respond to an inquiry about whether the commercials would be aired again on ESPN or other networks.
