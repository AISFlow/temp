That implies an up to 25% upswing from current levels. Ilinsky’s bullish call comes even as the token struggled since April 10 to surpass $30K, as market participants priced in higher interest rates with global inflation still stubbornly high, in addition to improved confidence in traditional banks that’s consequently curbing demand for cryptos. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) retreated for the third straight day on Friday, hovering around the key technical level of $28K, which marked the summer 2021 low. The top coin managed to reach as high as $31K last week for the first time in 10 months, but for only a brief time, before dropping to $27.88K as of Friday afternoon. The $30K mark is where BTC’s price stood since last June before another crypto swoon took hold and accelerated into an even deeper selloff, underscoring the importance of this zone. “Nonetheless, following last week’s rally, now Bitcoin is generally in a good position,” Ilinsky told Seeking Alpha in an emailed statement. “Besides the fact that regulators largely agree on the decentralized nature of the asset, institutional sentiment surrounding the Premier crypto is high at the moment.” The span of bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) weakness has been less than a week. It’s still up 67% since the start of 2023, in a rally driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon capitulate, and the recent stresses in the global banking system that sparked investor interest in alternative assets. It's down 31.3% from a year ago, though, amid the fallout from a host of high-profile failures as well as increased regulatory scrutiny. As such, day-to-day and even weekly price action of BTC is highly speculative, and “it's important to recognize that regulatory developments and monetary policy remain key drivers of price fluctuations,” Ilinsky said. As seen in the chart below, BTC was the worst performer in the past month among a handful of asset classes (stock market ( SP500 ), gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), crude oil ( CL1:COM ), Treasury bonds ( TLT )), but it also fared best — by a mile — YTD. For a contrarian view, Seeking Alpha analyst Kevin George rates bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) a Strong Sell, arguing that increased crypto regulation could stifle the industry’s growth .

42420732,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqisP,1682181757,Judge Rules Bored Ape Yacht Club Ripoff NFTs Violated Yuga Trademarks,"A federal court in California has handed Yuga Labs, the company behind the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, a legal victory in the form of a partial summary judgment in its case against Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen.  Ripps and Cahen are the duo behind the RR/BAYC non-fungible token (NFT) collection, which featured primates in similar poses to Bored Apes, and also used marketing material similar to BAYC. The two created RR/BAYC as a satirical and critical response to Yuga Labs, and have said that the BAYC NFT contains racist dog whistles, 4chan memes, as well as hidden Nazi imagery. While this narrative has resonated in certain circles of the internet, BAYC’s founders deny this entirely.  Yuga filed suit in June 2022, alleging Ripps and his associates were deliberately creating consumer confusion under the pretense of satire, generating millions in unjust profits while taking pride in the damage they caused to the BAYC with their allegations.  The U.S District Court for the Northern District of California found that Yuga Labs owns the BAYC trademarks, which are valid and enforceable, and that the defendants used the BAYC marks – referring to the images – to sell RR/BAYC NFTs without Yuga Labs' consent and in a “manner likely to cause confusion,” with the similar product look confusing consumers intending to purchase an actual BAYC NFT or track their value with token tracking tools.  In addition, the court ruled the defendants' use of the BAYC marks was not a case of fair use, nor an artistic expression under something called the Rogers Test, because Yuga's BAYC marks were strong in the marketplace and the RR/BAYC project was intended to mislead.  The court also determined that the domain names registered and utilized by the defendants – rrbayc.com and apemarket.com – have the potential to create confusion, with the judge concluding the defendant's actions are driven by a malicious intent to profit and that the two are engaging in cybersquatting.  Yuga Labs argued it should receive $200,000 in statutory damages for the cybersquatting. However, the court dismissed this claim and declared that the determination of damages would be made during a pending trial.  Ripps and Cahen also attempted to argue that because NFTs are intangible, they aren’t protected under the Lanham Act, which governs trademarks, service marks and unfair competition, providing protection against infringement and false advertising.  The judge disagreed, arguing that NFTs, as virtual goods, still qualify as goods under the Lanham Act due to their unique, traceable, and brand-associated characteristics.  In a separate case, Yuga Labs reached a settlement in February with the developer of the RR/BAYC websites and smart contracts, Thomas Lehman.  “It was never my intention to harm Yuga Labs’ brand, and I reject all disparaging statements made about Yuga Labs and its founders and appreciate their many positive contributions to the NFT space,” Lehman said at the time.

42420734,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqitR,1682175109,Here Are Six New Projects Looking to Mitigate Bitcoin Mining’s Energy Footprint,"The environmental impact of bitcoin (BTC) mining has been trending again in the last few weeks due to a Texas bill to limit miners' grid participation and a New York Times article that condemned the industry.  Bitcoin mining consumes about 145 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year, says data from Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance, which is about the power consumed by Sweden, according to the International Energy Agency.  To critics, bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm is wasteful by design as its electricity demand continuously grows. To industry advocates it's a feature, not a bug because it secures the network while ensuring decentralization.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  There is a third camp that sees bitcoin’s energy consumption as an opportunity. A slew of new products and companies are trying to mitigate the environmental impact with several innovative systems that build on top of what is already in place to help miners become more sustainable.  Some of these projects are creating or taking advantage of market instruments that incentivize making bitcoin more “green,” while others are technical, centered around improving efficiencies and synergies around reusing the heat generated by the data centers.  Renewable energy credits  One such product, offered by institutional liquidity provider BlockFills and fund Isla Verde Capital, aims to help not only miners but also investors to find a “green” solution for their energy usage.  The offering essentially is tradable environmental assets in the forms of carbon emissions offsets and Renewable Energy Credits (REC). Carbon credits, assets that represent sequestered greenhouse gasses through projects such as reforestation, are as well known as they are criticized.  Read more: Regen Network Calculates the Real Price of Our Actions  Renewable energy credits represent ownership of the sustainability of electricity produced. These certificates represent 1 megawatt hour (MWh) of power produced from renewable sources such as wind, hydro and solar. They are usually separate to any power purchase agreements and are usually traded over the counter (OTC).  BlockFills and Isla Verde Capital tailor the purchase of RECs and carbon credits to miners’ needs and later retire them, such that miners can make claims about renewable energy sources.  The RECs are also geared towards bitcoin investors. “Massive asset managers” are now “looking at bitcoin, but they have these sustainability mandates that they must follow,” said John Divine, leader in digital asset OTC trading at BlockFills. The RECs can help them invest comfortably.  This might actually raise the price of RECs, “which directly incentivizes investment in renewable energy technology,” Divine said.  Incentivizing sustainability  Switzerland-based Block Green is another project that is trying to incentivize sustainable mining through a decentralized lending protocol. On its platform, liquidity providers looking for bitcoin-native investments can buy future hashrate, or computing power, over a specified period of time.  The platform includes “know-your-miner” information about a company’s financials, operational data, its energy sourcing and strategy. Block Green believes market mechanisms on the platform will incentivize sustainable mining because liquidity providers will pick miners with sustainable operations, lowering their cost of capital.  “We are currently working with some of the largest miners in the U.S. and Canada and we have begun integrations with institutions such as custodians, exchanges and asset managers looking to give users access to transparent and scalable” returns on their bitcoin, said a spokesperson for the firm.  Tokenizing clean bitcoin  Another system that is using financial incentives is offered by Clean Incentive and Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP). These companies are trying to promote investments in “clean” bitcoin by creating new, blockchain-based assets that miners can trade to capitalize on their use of renewables. Investors looking to verifiably own environmentally conscious bitcoin are the right fit for these assets.  With SBP, miners can verify their use of clean energy with third-party auditors and be added to a registry. After that, for every block reward they get they receive a Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Certificate, a blockchain-based asset they can sell to institutional investors. SBP completed its first transaction of a sustainable bitcoin certificate in February.  Similarly, Clean Incentive looks to “collect, validate and tokenize ESG [environmental, social, and governance] attributes” from a network of miners, said founder and CEO Casey Martinez, a data scientist with experience in renewable energy.  The startup is still in stealth mode but has already onboarded several miners, Martinez said. Clean Incentive partnered with a small-scale miner from Canada, Ocean Falls Blockchain, in November.  Efficient cooling  Some of the more technical systems that firms are providing include both hardware and software-related products.  Immersion cooling firm, LiquidStack, offers a hardware-based cooling system that can cut the energy used by the computers in bitcoin mines by 40% and reduce their land use by one-third, the company said in March.  For every megawatt (MW) of energy used for the actual computing in a data center, LiquidStack's system uses 0.02 MW for cooling, whereas other options use 0.1 MW to 0.7 MW, LiquidStack said.  The firm, one of the earliest in the space, in March received funding from Trane Technologies (TT), a 150-year-old firm in the heating and cooling space that brought in $16 billion in revenue in 2022.  “What made LiquidStack attractive was its potential to improve sustainability for data centers, including bitcoin mining, and its innovation,” said Amber Mulligan, vice president of strategic sales and marketing, commercial HVAC Americas at Trane.  LiquidStack’s technology also makes heat reuse easier and more efficient, opening the door to a host of synergies for miners, said Mulligan. She said that because the heat is actually managed with liquids instead of traditional air cooling, capturing it and directing it to other uses is easier.  On the software side, Vancouver-based mining services firm, Lincoin, has created a program that miners can use to more efficiently and profitably manage their operations, including their participation in demand response programs and heat reuse activities.  Demand response is when a miner, or other energy consumer, shuts down its operations at times of peak demand, such that the grid can meet the consumption needs. Often miners get paid for this. Heat reuse refers to the practice of using excess heat from a mining operation for another activity, such as greenhouse farming.  The software, called Rails, integrates real-time data from over 20,000 grid nodes in nine deregulated electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada, according to its press release.  “Large-scale miners use Lincoin to monitor real-time profitability, manage and optimize their operations, streamline tasks and participate in grid ancillary services while smaller miners use Lincoin to innovate by managing heat in greenhouses, monetize their surplus solar energy generation, or simply mine intelligently,” said CEO Medi Naseri in an email interview with CoinDesk.

As of this writing, the price of Bone Shibaswap has ballooned to an impressive 8.3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. However, a broader look at BONE’s market performance indicates an underwhelming run in the past month. The meme token has experienced a 16.8% price drop in the last 30 days. Related Reading: OKB Token Shines With 23% Gains On Weekly Chart, What’s Pushing It? OKX Becomes 12th Biggest BONE Holder Without a doubt, the price rise of Bone Shibaswap is reflective of recent market activity. On-chain data from Etherscan.io reveals that OKX, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, has acquired a staggering 1,900,736.16586897 BONE tokens (equivalent to $1,788,547.11 ) in the past 24 hours. This acquisition, executed via multiple transactions, pushed OKX to 12th place on the list of largest BONE holders. OKX is not the only exchange on this list, as Singapore-based firms Crypto.com and MEXC Global are also members of the exclusive club. The buying spree kicked off after OKX launched a voting event on Friday, April 21st, inviting users to vote for the meme project they would like to see listed on the exchange. The voting event features five of the most popular meme tokens, including AIDOGE, BONE, BONK, OPTI, and PEPE. OKX also declared its intention to list the three tokens with the highest number of votes. The voting event will end at exactly 06:00 am UTC on April 24th, 2023. Results are to be announced on the same day at 10:00 am UTC. If OKX does list BONE on its exchange, it will be the coin’s biggest exchange listing ever. Of course, as has been exhibited in the past 24 hours, this would have an impact on the value of Bone Shibaswap. Other prominent exchanges to have listed the token include Crypto.com, Gate.io, Bitget, Bing, and BTCEX. Time To Buy The Dip? Going by the coin’s movement in the past, BONE surged to new heights when listed by a crypto exchange. However, it is worth noting that these price increases were short-lived, as is often the case in the market these days. For example, after the cryptocurrency was listed on Crypto.com in early March, it rallied a 14.8% increase in a few days. By the end of March, the token price had plummeted by a disappointing 30.9%. According to CoinCodex price prediction, the current sentiment for Bone Shibaswap is bearish, with the token expected to lose 6.99% of its current value in five days. Meanwhile, the coin is projected to lose an additional 40% over the next month. That said, this information should not be relied upon as investment advice. BONE is currently priced at $0.945, with a daily trading volume of $4,888,630.

12005175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528072,1682155449,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is A Retracement To $25,000 Likely?","Despite the relative performance of altcoins in 2023, Bitcoin has seen a significant 75% bullish rally since the beginning of the year. However, Bitcoin’s price has been unable to surpass the resistance level of $30,000 for a week, and this has stirred a technical belief that there is a possibility of a retracement streak toward the medium-term support level of $25,000. Is Bitcoin’s Rally Losing Steam At $30,000? The annual upward movement in the price of Bitcoin, fueled by the banking crisis in March, may be hitting a roadblock at the $30,000 resistance level. To assess the underlying dynamics of BTC, we need to look at an extended chart, which provides a longer-term perspective spanning several weeks. Historically, the bullish reversals in this time frame have shown a well-defined chart structure, with phases of bullish impulses followed by periods of sideways transitions. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Drops 11%, Sheds All Gains From Shanghai Rally The recent bullish reversal in the last quarter of 2022, followed by the rebound from $20,000 that kickstarted the current rally, was preceded by a notable bullish momentum divergence (as indicated by the RSI technical indicator) from the oversold zone. Bitcoin Could Hit The $25,000 Support Level In Coming Days The RSI indicator has entered the technical overbought zone as BTC approached the $30,000 resistance level. The overall chart pattern resembles that of August 2020, which saw a retracement from $12,000 to $9,500 before the subsequent bull run starting in October 2020. Considering chartist probabilities, the scenario of a retracement towards the major support at $25,000 has gained in probability. Therefore, preserving the $25,000 support level would be a key factor in invalidating the bullish trend in 2023. This retracement scenario could be triggered by a break of the short-term support at $28,800; the upper part of the bearish gap opened on Monday, June 13, 2022. Related Reading: China Is Fast Losing Money: Their Bitcoin Stash Just Fell By $388 Million The market is on a precarious edge following a significant session of long position liquidations. To avoid a potential return to $25,000, the market would need to bounce convincingly off the $28,800 level and break above the intermediate resistance at $29,500 to signal renewed bullish momentum. The situation remains fluid, and further price action will provide more insights into the direction of BTC’s price movement. The Impact Of Interest Rates And US Dollar On Bitcoin’s Technical Analysis Bitcoin is currently at a crucial chart juncture, and the market is expected to decide in the coming hours. This decision is likely to be influenced by two key factors from the inter-asset class dynamics: the trend of market interest rates and the behavior of the US dollar on the Forex, which has returned to its annual low and is acting as a support level. If there is a continuation of the rebound in rates and a breakout of support on the US dollar, it may negatively impact Bitcoin’s price and increase the likelihood of a decline toward $25,000. On the other hand, if there is a cessation of the rebound in rates and the US dollar support level holds, it may counter the scenario of a decline toward $25,000. The market will ultimately determine which direction Bitcoin takes. (This is not financial advice and is the observation of the author.

While many had high hopes for this upgrade, which promised to improve the network’s speed and scalability, the market seems to have reacted negatively to the news. This sudden drop in price has left investors wondering what the future holds for Ethereum, and whether or not it can recover from this setback. Crypto Market Downturn Drags Ethereum Lower At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum stands at $1,860.72 according to CoinMarketCap, but the past 24 hours have not been kind to the cryptocurrency, as it has seen a slump of 4.05%. The past week has been even more unforgiving, with Ethereum experiencing a significant drop of 11.02%. The once high-flying cryptocurrency is now left to wonder what caused this downturn and whether it can regain its vigor in the days and weeks ahead. In recent days, the cryptocurrency markets have been displaying signs of fragility, largely due to anxieties about persistently high inflation, fluctuations in the stock market, and the looming threat of an economic recession, which have all contributed to dragging prices downward. Against this backdrop, Ethereum has been experiencing a steady decline since Tuesday, a trend that has been mirrored in the wider cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, for instance, has suffered a drop of over 3% in the past 24 hours alone and has fallen by more than 10% from its recent peak above $30,000, currently trading at just around $27,346. ETH False Breakout Of Local Support Level: Potential Bounce-Back? Despite a recent fall, the price of ETH experienced a false breakout of the local support level at $1,896. However, a daily closure far from the $1,900 mark may trigger a bounce back toward the $1,920-$1,930 zone tomorrow. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Gets Stuck In Price Range – Will SHIB Break Free? Ethereum (ETH) market cap at $223 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: OKB Unfazed By Crypto Market Bloodshed, Rallies 22% Today On a larger time frame, the situation for Ethereum remains bearish, with the bar on the verge of closing below yesterday’s low at $1,913.60. If this happens, there is a high likelihood of further decline towards the next significant support level at $1,846, a scenario that may play out until the end of the week. Looking ahead from a midterm perspective, Ethereum’s price has retreated to the middle of a wide channel, with sellers taking control as the price remains below the crucial $2,000 mark. This indicates that the cryptocurrency may face continued pressure and struggle to regain its bullish momentum. -Featured image from Zohr",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-eth-drops-11/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12002787.jpeg
