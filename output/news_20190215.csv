42430190,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2bh,1550260806,Decentralized Finance Emerges as Banner Topic at Ethereum Denver Conference,"""We always needs to ask, 'Who are we building for?'""  Kicking off the annual ethereum hackathon ETHDenver, Aave CEO Stani Kulechov shared an opening address on “leaping decentralized finance [into the] mainstream.”  Aave is a Swiss-based blockchain technology company that officially launched in September of last year. Acting as the parent company to ETHLend – a decentralized financial marketplace for asset-backed loans – Kulechov explained that cross-application coordination and cooperation is key to seeing mainstream adoption.  ""We need to approach adoption from an ecosystem perspective,"" said Kulechov. ""You might be building a project that relates to decentralized finance. Each has a use case but if you can connect all these DeFi [decentralized finance] applications … we form an ecosystem where we are bringing together more users.""  However, highlighting that mainstream adoption isn't the be all and end all of application development, Kulechov added that ""decentralization is a choice"" and that to some developers ""it might be a good idea to focus on the segment of decentralized users that are privacy-concerned.""  As highlighted by Josh Stark – head of operations at blockchain consulting firm Ledger Labs – in a blog post, a new wave of decentralized applications (dapps) are growing in both number and popularity on the ethereum blockchain.  Called “decentralized finance” or “DeFi” applications, these dapps on ethereum give users new tools to manage and use ethereum-based money or assets, Stark explains in his post.  As such, today’s talk by Kulechov is actually one of several centered around the topic of finance.  DeFi-related talks expected to be held later today at ETHDenver include an address by CTO Alex Bazhanau from cryptocurrency lending platform Bloqboard, as well as an address by Tom Bean, a co-founder of decentralized lending protocol bZx.  Tomorrow, the DeFi narrative continues with a panel discussion on the roadmap for many of these finance-focused application on ethereum with a panel discussion between several DeFi startups including bZx, Set Protocol, Zerion and Wyre.

42430197,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2ph,1550247305,Apple Hints at Behind-the-Scenes Blockchain Work in New SEC Filing,"Apple has submitted what might seem like an arcane filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – but the document contains tantalizing details about the computing giant's interest in blockchain tech.  The document – entitled ""Summary of Apple’s Commitment to Responsible Sourcing"" – details the company's commitment ""to upholding human rights across its global network of suppliers that support the manufacturing of its mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and related accessories."" Making note of both its internal work on this front as well as its relations with supply chain providers, the document is largely a description of Apple's efforts to ethically source materials for its popular products like the iPhone.  Notably, however, the Feb. 15 filing makes mention of Apple's involvement in the drafting of ""Blockchain Guidelines"" for the Responsible Business Alliance's Responsible Minerals Initiative. According to an RBA press release, those ""voluntary guidelines"" were published in mid-December of last year and ""represent a first industry effort to define a common set of principles, attributes and definitions for the application of blockchain technology to support mineral supply chain due diligence."" The press release makes no mention of Apple's involvement, but the tech firm is listed as a ""Company Member"" on the effort's official web page.  The SEC filing also notes that in 2018, Apple chaired the board of the RBA and participated in a number of its internal committees and working groups, including ""the blockchain team.""  When iChain?  These details aside, the filing doesn't touch on what Apple-watchers might most want to know: whether the Cupertino colossus is on the cusp of joining the growing ranks of tech giants that are offering some form of blockchain-related service. Specifically, if Apple is working on some kind of supply chain-focused solution, it hasn't (yet) shown its cards.  A request for further information about Apple's work with the RBA was not returned by press time.  As Fortune's Jeff John Roberts wrote in December, the question of whether Apple will take the proverbial plunge is an active one, with many in the industry contending that ""it’s going to take a tech giant like Apple to make blockchain payments work at scale.""  There is demonstrable interest internally, to say the least. The crypto space has seen Apple veterans join industry startups, and in December 2017, as CoinDesk reported at the time, a published patent filing from Apple detailed a proposed program to certify timestamps by combining aspects of blockchain technology with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

42430185,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2Rh,1550243751,"tZERO Is Live, But Volume Is Light and Its Token's Price Is Down Sharply","tZERO is off to a slow start.  In the three weeks since the long-awaited launch of Overstock.com’s alternative trading system (ATS) for security tokens, activity has been light. According to traders in a dedicated Telegram chat, daily volume has fluctuated between 7,000 and 23,000 units of the platform’s own tZERO Preferred (TZROP) token – the sole listed asset for now. The company itself gave a slightly higher range: 9,000 and 35,000.  Either way, that’s a tiny fraction of the 26 million TZROP issued after the $134 million security token offering (STO) last August. Of the 1,000 accredited investors who bought into the sale, only a few hundred were on-boarded on the trading platform at the time of launch, according to the company. Approximately 15 percent of the tZERO users now are newly registered traders who didn't participate in the STO but came to the platform after the launch, the company's CEO Saum Noursalehi told CoinDesk (and this number is growing).  Among this group, the sellers are prevailing, with the token’s price, quoted at $8 when trading opened on Jan. 28, falling as low as $3, traders said. (TZROP was sold for $10 during the STO, although some investors bought in for $8 or less during the pre-sale).  At one point, some traders were bidding at $1, although as of Wednesday the bid-ask spread had tightened to $3-$3.35. Some took an opportunity for arbitrage, selling some of their tokens and then buying them back at a lower price. (There is no public order book, so only participants can directly see trading activity.)  One trader, Mark Nelson, told CoinDesk he believes the selling pressure came from investors who had bought into TZROP during the initial coin offering (ICO) frenzy, hoping to make handsome profits soon and not understanding the real nature of the token.  “From discussions with other TZROP holders, many of them don’t really understand what tZERO is and what type of investment they were making, they clearly did not read the offering details and just jumped in on hype from the general ICO craze expecting to double their investment in short order — unrealistic expectations,” Nelson said, adding:  “Those investors and others who likely lost their shirts in the last 6 months on crypto and maybe even traditional market investments and the ones selling now.”  There have also been technical hiccups. Some users have been complaining that it took them a week or more to get their accounts verified by broker-dealer Dinosaur Financial and that wire transfers of fiat and token transfers to brokerage accounts also took some days.  Another trader, Andrew Marks, told CoinDesk that cash for the tokens he sold didn’t arrive as soon as it would on a traditional brokerage platform.  “I haven’t withdrawn cash yet, but I did sell some shares. It took one day for the sale proceeds to appear in my Dino account,” he explained. “I sold shares on Wednesday and the cash appeared Thursday. I was expecting cash to appear instantly — let’s just say I would expect to see my available cash in my Dino account immediately after the sale.”  Dinosaur didn't answer CoinDesk's request for a comment, redirecting the question to tZERO. Earlier, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi told CoinDesk that Dinosaur had been struggling to process all the clients' requests in time as the KYC checks were conducted manually, but tZERO had been working with the broker to automate and speed up the process.  ‘Patience will be key’  While the experience so far may be underwhelming, none of this is to say traders have given up on the grand vision for tZERO first laid out four years ago by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne.  Quite on the contrary, they expect activity to pick up, and the token’s price to rise, when trading is opened to retail investors, once the company becomes or acquires its own broker-dealer, which tZERO's CEO Saum Noursalehi previously told CoinDesk will happen in late summer.  “I do expect the value to only be depressed for a short period of time and recover fully and even be above $10 prior to August opening of trading for all investors,” Nelson said.  Moreover, Bruce Fenton, a board member at tZERO, says the company is working on getting more institutional players to partner with the platform.  “The bigger question is if tZERO can interface with other brokers and exchanges and the answer is yes, that’s the plan,” Fenton assured the traders in the Telegram chat. “tZERO has many hooks into Wall St. which could possibly help with distribution. ... The whole space is very early so patience will be key.”  Aside from more traders, tZERO also hopes to get new assets on the platform soon. Byrne has said it plans to list at least one more token this year, to be issued by Elio Motors, a company producing light three-wheeled cars. However, the timeline for these plans is not public yet.  And it’s worth remembering that Overstock is working to sell its flagship e-commerce business to raise cash it can invest in its portfolio of blockchain startups, of which tZERO is the most prominent. More directly, Hong Kong-based GSR has a deal to invest $404 million in tZERO. Both transactions are supposed to close in the coming months.  All told, it’s still early innings for this platform. As Marks concluded:  “tZERO really isn’t launched. This platform is just for tZERO holders and other accredited investors to trade TZROP only. My understanding is the actual platform will be totally different. I imagine the experience to be better as well.”  UPDATE (15, February 19:30 UTC): This article has been updated to add volume figures provided after publication by tZERO.

42387635,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlwKr,1550239505,NYSE Arca Filing Kicks Off Countdown for New Bitcoin ETF,"The clock just started on the latest effort to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it was beginning its review of a bitcoin ETF rule change proposal filed by NYSE Arca and Bitwise Asset Management on Feb. 11, and the proposal itself was published in the Federal Register on Feb. 15, meaning the regulator has 45 days to make its initial decision on whether to approve, reject or extend the proposal.  The SEC has at most 240 days to make a final decision on whether to approve or reject the ETF.  Members of the general public looking to file responses to the rule change proposal have three weeks to submit any comments.  Many proponents of bitcoin ETFs believe the funds will bring new investors and increased liquidity to the market.  NYSE Arca and Bitwise announced their attention to launch a bitcoin ETF earlier this year, filing the rule change proposal the same day. However, due to the government shutdown, the SEC did not publish the filing in the Federal Register, meaning the agency was not examining the proposal.  That changed today, with Friday's edition of the Register starting the latest countdown.  The SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF, rejecting several and asking others to withdraw their submissions.  However, SEC commissioner Robert Jackson recently said he believes one will be approved ""eventually,"" anticipating that sooner or later a proposal will match all of the regulator's guidelines.  That being said, not everyone thinks an ETF will actually bring in fresh liquidity, such as bitcoin analyst Nik Bhatia, who previously told CoinDesk that existing fund products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, may already serve the same purpose.  Most recently, VanEck and SolidX withdrew a joint proposal filed with Cboe BZX Exchange due to the recent U.S. government shutdown. The proposal, first filed in 2018, had faced a final decision date of Feb. 27, and was widely considered to be a strong candidate for approval.  However, conversations between its proponents and regulators lapsed as a result of the shutdown, and VanEck CEO Jan van Eck explained that the firms thought it would be better to pull the proposal and re-file at a later date than to hope it be approved on a technicality. The companies re-filed the proposal the following week.  While the SEC has published the VanEck/SolidX proposal on its website, this one has yet to appear in the Federal Register, meaning the clock has not yet started for this ETF.

42430191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2fh,1550239234,What QuadrigaCX Says About Institutional Crypto Investment,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.  _______  Open pretty much any mainstream financial media source and it’s hard to feel cheerful. Economic growth is slowing. The yield curve is flattening. Trade tensions are tensing. There’s plenty for an institutional investor to fret about.  Yet none of those worries are top-of-mind for institutional investors these days when it comes to their crypto investments. Along with most of the blockchain sector, they’re more engrossed in the drama unfolding around the death of the CEO of a Canadian crypto exchange.  In case you missed the story on CoinDesk, the CEO of beleaguered Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, which was already in trouble because of frozen accounts, passed away unexpectedly in India in December. Leaving aside the suspense over the encrypted laptop, the debated existence of cold wallets and the exact role of the chihuahuas in all this, the attention-grabbing detail is that he apparently was the sole keeper of the password that could access client funds. When he died, he took the password with him.  On the surface, it doesn’t look like this has much to do with institutional investment. The exchange was not exactly geared up for rigorous checks and oversight. But its fate, and that of its clients, points to a fundamental truth about crypto investing for institutions, one that both colors allocation decisions and shapes emerging infrastructure.  It’s this: The crypto market is the only market out there at the moment where operational risk is greater than market risk. And this highlights both crypto investing’s weakness and its opportunity.  Building blocks  Readers of this newsletter know that every week there’s positive news about infrastructure development for institutional transactions. Sometimes it’s a listing or a launch, occasionally a partnership or merger, and the array of items usually comes together to create an impression of constructive evolution.  Often the news is security related. Licenses are sought after and awarded, which implies greater oversight; compliance processes are boosted, which reassures regulators; and new products and services stress tighter security, which addresses market concerns. The general tone is one of raising overall standards to meet institutional expectations.  Obviously, these moves (and plenty more like them) are necessary. The nascent crypto market is still largely unregulated, as official institutions around the world wrestle with the choice between fitting the new asset class into existing obligations, or creating new ones.  Meanwhile, institutional investors do not like ambiguity when it comes to processes. Few can afford the risk of fines or public embarrassment as a result of not having retroactively complied with rules when they eventually emerge.  What’s more, businesses built on new technologies are generally feeling their way along the development curve. As anyone involved in cybersecurity knows, it’s almost impossible to foresee and protect against all possible attacks. With traditional securities, there is generally some recourse or walk-back. But most cryptoassets are still bearer securities, which implies a whole different level of custody risk.  Silver lining  This unique condition of the crypto market is not a disadvantage. On the contrary.  First, the “progress principle” and its impact on motivation is well documented. The tangible and identifiable steps forward in sector development engender a constructive atmosphere, which brings in even more brain power and keeps the momentum going, regardless of price movements.  Second, the focus on security highlights the market’s youth as well as its potential. While improving the security of crypto holdings may seem like a basic beginner step, the chance to participate in the creation of a new asset class is rare.  What’s more, the risk-return profile of cryptoassets as a whole becomes even more asymmetric as the operational base of transactions – the technology, regulation and quality of market participants – continues to evolve. And the bear market is giving a much-needed breathing space for the construction to advance, the security to improve and investors to become even more familiar with the fundamentals.  This entry-level progress sets the stage for more sophisticated risks as the market matures.  To many this may rhyme with the well-known song of parenting: We focus on making our young feel secure, so that as they grow they have a solid emotional base from which to deal with what life later throws at them.  Growing up  While extremely painful to many, the lessons learned from QuadrigaCX’s lax security and almost non-existent governance are an important part of this evolution. Beyond the unwelcome education, serious mistakes serve to highlight vulnerabilities, focus attention and hone priorities. This makes the sector stronger.  Meanwhile, crypto infrastructure continues to evolve, and any interest that has been scared away will return as the sector’s increasing professionalization calms concerns over operational vulnerabilities.  Eventually, institutional investors in crypto assets will be able to get back to doing what they do best: fret about market risk, and take positions accordingly.

42430198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2th,1550235637,8 Illicit Crypto-Mining Windows Apps Removed From Microsoft Store,"A number of apps in Microsoft's app store have been found to be able to illicitly mine cryptocurrency.  The eight apps, discovered by Symantec on Jan. 17, hosted a version of Coinhive, a script for mining the monero cryptocurrency that has proved popular with cyber criminals.      In a blog post on the discovery, Symantec said it had reported the apps to Microsoft, which subsequently took them down. The apps all ran on Windows 10, including Windows 10 S Mode, which restricts app downloads to the Microsoft Store.  Three developers, DigiDream, 1clean and Findoo, reportedly produced all the apps, which covered the areas of computer and battery optimization tutorials, web search, web browsing, and video viewing and download.  Symantec wrote in the post:    ""In total, we discovered eight apps from these developers that shared the same risky behavior. After further investigation, we believe that all these apps were likely developed by the same person or group.""        After being downloaded and opened, the apps work by fetching the monero mining JavaScript library by triggering Google Tag Manager in their domain servers. The mining script is then activated and harnesses the bulk of the victim computer’s CPU cycles to mine the cryptocurrency. The JavaScript has also been removed from Google Tag Manager after Google was informed, the post said.  ""Although these apps appear to provide privacy policies, there is no mention of coin mining on their descriptions on the app store,"" Symantec said.  The apps were published from April to December of last year, although most were published toward the end of the year. Despite being on the Microsoft Store for a relatively short period, ""a significant number"" of users may have downloaded them onto their PCs, said the firm.  Monero (XMR) is by far the most popular cryptocurrency among bad actors deploying mining malware, according to a study published last month. So much so that the author's of the research estimated that hackers have mined at least 4.32 percent of the total monero in circulation.  “Overall, we estimate there are at least 2,218 active campaigns that have accumulated about 720,000 XMR ($57 million),"" they wrote.

Luxembourg, an EU member nation, passed a bill making it possible to legally issue ""dematerialized securities"" in April 2013 via an amendment of a securities law passed in 2001.  Taking into account technological developments in recent years, the chamber said the new bill further amends the 2001 law to also include the registration and distribution of securities using secure electronic registration, ""such as distributed ledger technology and in particular blockchain technology.""  Specifically, the amendment adds Article 18a to the law, which states:  ""Account-keeper may hold securities accounts and make registrations of securities in securities accounts within or through secure electronic registration devices, including distributed electronic registers or databases. Successive transfers recorded in such a secure electronic registration device are considered like transfers between securities accounts. Holding of securities accounts within such a device secure electronic registration or registration of securities in securities accounts through such a secure electronic recording device do not affect the fungible nature of the securities concerned.""  A document proposing the bill prior to its passing indicates that blockchain securities have the same status as traditional securities under the bill. It say that, for securities issued over blockchain, ""the easiest way today is to use the token concept... This is from the technological point of view a new type of dematerialized security, but to which are attached from a legal point of view the same rights as classic dematerialized securities.""

42430200,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2xh,1550228411,Bitcoin's Sideways Drift Has Shifted Price Recovery Target to $3.7K,"View  Bitcoin's six-day-long consolidation near $3,600 has neutralized the bullish view put forward by a falling wedge breakout confirmed on Feb. 8. The follow-through to that bullish breakout has been extremely weak with prices unable to challenge the highs above $3,700 hit last Friday.  A move above $3,711 (Feb. 8 high) would validate the bullish outside reversal candle seen in the 3-day chart and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $4,000. That looks likely as BTC has witnessed another falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart.  Bitcoin risks falling to $3,400 if the latest wedge breakout fails and prices find acceptance below $3,531 (wedge low).  Bitcoin's (BTC) six days in the doldrums has weakened the bull case in the short term, leaving a target of $3,700 for a resumed rally.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization was expected to make a quick move to the psychological resistance of $4,000, having witnessed a falling wedge breakout last Friday on the back of strong volumes.  BTC, however, has remained directionless near $3,600 in the last six days and is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,570 on Bitstamp.  So weak has been the follow through to the wedge breakout that prices have failed to challenge even the highs above $3,700 seen last Friday. The immediate outlook, therefore, is neutral and $3,711 (Feb. 8 high) is the new level to beat for the bulls.  A convincing move above that resistance would put the focus back on the high volume falling wedge breakout and open the doors for a stronger corrective rally.  The bears may feel tempted to hit the market with fresh offers if the sideways action continues over the weekend, which could push price toward $3,400.  3-day chart  BTC created a bullish outside reversal candle on Feb. 8, meaning the price action seen during that three-day period engulfed the highs and lows of the preceding three days.  As the name implies, that candlestick is widely considered an early sign of bullish reversal. The trend change, however, is only confirmed after prices find acceptance above the high of that candlestick pattern.  A move above $3,711 (Feb. 8 high) would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors to levels above $4,000.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is currently trading above the upper edge of the falling wedge – a breakout indicating a resumption of the rally from lows below $3,400 seen on Feb. 8. The positive move means BTC could confirm the bullish outside reversal with a move above $3,711 over the weekend.  The bears will likely capitalize and drive prices back toward $3,400 if the breakout fails and prices move below $3,531 (wedge low).

In its latest financial report, published Thursday, the firm said for Q4, ending Jan. 27, it made revenue of $2.21 billion, down 24 percent from $2.91 billion in the same quarter last year, and down 31 percent from $3.18 billion in the previous quarter.  The firm said it is still feeling the effects of a drop-off in the crypto mining market, with an excess of inventory it had struggled to sell.  Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang commented:  “This was a turbulent close to what had been a great year. The combination of post-crypto excess channel inventory and recent deteriorating end-market conditions drove a disappointing quarter.""  In an earnings call on Feb. 10, Colette Kress, the firm's executive vice president and CFO, added that the issue had caused the firm to reduce shipments in order to allow excess inventory to be sold. She added that inventory is expected to normalize in Q1 in line with its forecast.  The report also provides revenue numbers for the last full year.  Inventory issues aside, Nvidia said it made record revenue for the year of $11.72 billion, up 21 percent from the year prior. It also saw record yearly revenue from its gaming, datacenter, professional visualization and automotive segments.  “Despite this setback, NVIDIA’s fundamental position and the markets we serve are strong,"" Huang said. ""The accelerated computing platform we pioneered is central to some of world’s most important and fastest growing industries – from artificial intelligence to autonomous vehicles to robotics. We fully expect to return to sustained growth.""

Announcing the news on Thursday, the firm said the purchase comes it acquired stellar wallet BlockEQ last December. That product will be rebranded to become the ""anchor wallet"" for the StellarX platform going forward. Coinsquare did not disclose the cost of the acquisition.  StellarX is a ""full featured"" decentralized exchange app native to the stellar protocol and offering trading in a range of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies – the latter being unusual for a DEX, allowing users to fund with fiat if they own a U.S. bank account. As a DEX, users retain sole custody of their funds, and trade in a peer-to-peer fashion. StellarX has no access to users' funds or keys, and charges no fees.  As part of the acquisition deal, BlockEQ cofounder Megha Bambra will now lead StellarX as it moves to continue developing in accordance with its product roadmap announced by Stellar in the autumn of 2018. While now owned by Coinsquare, StellarX will continue to operate under its own brand, according to the announcement.  StellarX will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Coinsquare, based in Bermuda. The firm said it will now seek to license the DEX under the country's crypto-friendly regulatory regime.  “We are deeply committed to ensuring that the cryptocurrency market thrives, and adoption is key,” said Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond. “Stellar is the fastest payment network in the world and we see enormous potential to create industry leading services on StellarX to further broader adoption.”  The news comes exactly a year after after Coinsquare raised $30 million in equity financing led by financial services firm Canaccord Genuity. The investment, the company said at the time, “will be used to fuel a global growth plan and diversification strategy focused on making the platform even more responsive to mainstream customers’ needs.”  However, the firm has felt the effects of the crypto bear market in recent months and laid off 40 employees in early February.

42430196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMp2rh,1550218520,How SABRE Tech Can Stop Hackers From Splitting Bitcoin Into Two,"If hackers felt like it, they could split bitcoin in two.  It wouldn't even be that hard, according to research from 2017. Thanks to insecure technology underpinning the internet, someone with the right credentials could exploit the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) by faking their identity and confusing the network into sending floods of data somewhere it shouldn't. ""The internet's biggest security hole,"" as it's been called, has been used for everything from snooping on government emails to stealing cryptocurrency.  As far as splitting bitcoin, the attack is as bad as it sounds. If executed successfully, one chunk of the network would be completely sliced off from the other. No one could communicate and send transactions to people who are a part of the ""other"" network.  That's where researchers from the prestigious Swiss university ETH Zurich hope to help. As described in a new white paper, they've invented a relay network called SABRE that they hope will one day be built on top of bitcoin.  With the same name as the curved blade common in the Napoleonic era, SABRE sounds like it would be used to slice bitcoin in half. Instead, it hopes to do the opposite. Rather, the planned network would (metaphorically) wield a saber against impending attackers, stopping them in their tracks.  Eth Zurich computer network researcher Maria Apostolaki told CoinDesk:  ""SABRE is a small relay network whose nodes are strategically located such that they remain connected to each other and connected to as many regular nodes as possible, even in the presence of a AS-level adversary that hijacks traffic.""  This network would ""render the partition ineffective,"" she said.  When SABRE is used, the risk of a split goes down, the researchers claim. Without SABRE, it's possible for an ISP to attack and partition bitcoin with only a ""small"" routing attack. But, according to the researchers' simulations on a group of five nodes, there's only a 3.1 percent chance probability of the attacker could hijack the network and partition it. The probability also decreases as the number of nodes increases.  To be presented at The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium this month, the proposed layer is the result of years of research. Apostolaki has been researching this specific issue since 2016 since ""blockchain applications are very common nowadays making research on their routing characteristics very impactful.""  The attack  The attack strikes at the root of the internet.  Every time you click a webpage, you're unknowingly using BGP, an internet protocol that helps get data from Point A to Point B. Say you want to get to CoinDesk.com. Your computer doesn't necessarily have a direct link to the server storing that website, stored in, say, New York City.  Rather, millions of nodes make up the internet, which are divided into groups called ""autonomous systems"" (ASes), each managed by a single entity known as an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISPs then connect companies to the internet, such as Comcast or the like. BGP helps your request for CoinDesk.com determine which ASes to jump through to get to get the webpage and pull it up on to your screen the fastest. (It sounds like a lot, but all of this happens in the blink of an eye.)  The problem is, hackers can trick other nodes using the protocol that they own certain resources they don't really own in order to divert internet traffic essentially anywhere they want.  That's why it can be used to access data the attacker isn't supposed to be able to see – or to steal cryptocurrency, as hackers have done several times in the past, by using BGP to redirect traffic from bitcoin miners to themselves.  [video width=""2572"" height=""1432"" mp4=""https://www.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/part.mp4""][/video]  ETH Zurich's researchers say it could be particularly harmful for bitcoin.  Apostolaki told CoinDesk:  ""An [AS] level attacker can partition the bitcoin into two disjointed components by first hijacking and then dropping traffic exchanged between them.""  The paper explains that ""any"" AS-level attacker could isolate half the bitcoin mining power by hijacking just 100 prefixes.  SABRE to the rescue  But ETH Zurich researchers think they can prevent the attack with a so-called ""relay network."" SABRE is a proposed network that would be managed by one entity, providing bitcoin nodes with an ""extra secure channel"" for moving blocks across the network.  This network would consist of a variety of nodes with IP addresses (an ID number that lets other nodes find and connect to them) that are publicly known. That way, any bitcoin node can connect to them. And a bitcoin node needs to just connect to one of them to take advantage of its capability for keeping it connected to other nodes.  So, why can't the attack just switch targets and fool the SABRE nodes instead? The researchers propose a little hack: They only place the SABRE nodes in ""cherry-picked"" ASes with certain characteristics that make them harder to hijack.  ""So, the [central] idea on their work is that if you run a relay network with nodes on diversely placed /24 announcements, it's much harder for a route hijacker to disrupt it,"" explained long-time Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell, discussing the idea in the IRC chat channel ""bitcoin wizards.""  The research is convincing. Or, at least, reactions from at least one skeptical bitcoin developer have been rosy.  ""At least it's doing something different that makes sense,"" continued Maxwell, who's often critical of proposed changes that might have negative consequences for the blockchain.  In an email to CoinDesk, Braiins and bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool CEO Jan Čapek argued that ""[SABRE] is an interesting insight into BGP hijacking issues. It solves the bitcoin network partitioning problem and can be applied to other [peer-to-peer] networks, too.""  However, he's not convinced a ""large-scale"" attack is very likely, partly because ""there are many redundant ways"" bitcoin nodes are connected already. ""Many nodes form global clusters interconnected via VPN channels. We now have Blockstream satellite that provides an alternative way of broadcasting blocks via a satellite link,"" he explained.  He hopes the underlying problem – BGP – will also one day be addressed.  That said, Čapek said Slush Pool would be happy to connect to the SABRE network, should it get ""industry-wide consensus.""  Since it would be immediately helpful for mining pools to adopt, it would prevent their miners from losing mining rewards, Apostolaki told CoinDesk, she expects to see some adoption soon:  ""Given the practicality of routing attacks I do believe that SABRE will be at least partially deployed.""

Fold product lead Will Reeves put it this way:  “We’re trying to make bitcoin fun again and illustrate that lightning is at a point where it is mainstream-ready.”  The Fold web app plans to integrate lightning for all its shopping options over the next six months, including Starbucks, Whole Foods, Dunkin Donuts, Target and Uber. Since these aren’t official partnerships, the crypto startup places orders on users’ behalf and converts payments to fiat to offer a seamless experience. It remains to be seen how this will factor into the company's revenue model once the lightning options are out of beta. (A request for comment from Domino's was not returned as of press time.)  “The average purchase was $25,” Reeves said of the Domino’s experiment. “Since the average lightning payment is usually less than $5 so this was able to stretch the Lightning Network to higher value payments for the first time at volume.”  According to 1ML, the overall network set new record highs this week with more than 26,588 payment channels able to facilitate $2.4 million, a 39 percent increase compared to last month. Reeves said orders came in from every state across the U.S.  “It was pretty evenly spread across the country, which was great to see,” he said.  After the Fold lightning integration, Reeves said the startup plans to launch mobile versions of the Fold app for both Android and iOS. This seven-person startup, which is incubated by venture studio Thesis, is currently fundraising and looking to diversify its retail brand offerings.  Reeves said Fold currently serves 1,500 monthly users, facilitating roughly 35,000 total bitcoin transactions since launching the first version of the app in 2014. Until now, the largely bootstrapped project was funded by a small seed round from Boost VC. Looking forward, Reeves said the plan is to partner with crypto wallet startups for direct integrations.  “The largest barrier to conversion was setting up a new lightning wallet,” Reeves said, adding there were roughly 1,500 orders but only a 10 percent conversion rate because people struggled to use lightning-enabled bitcoin wallets.  “We’ve learned a lesson that in order to grow the lightning ecosystem we not only need the best products, but the best education as well,” Reeves said. “We will incorporate that into our plan going forward.”  Beyond wallet integrations, Reeves said Fold is also partnering with the custody solutions startup Casa, for a direct integration with the Casa browser extension so that hardware node owners can also use it to buy pizza.  The Fold team is hardly the only one pushing lightning toward mainstream adoption.  February 2019 also witnessed the launch of Koala Studio with its lightning-powered chess game, allowing users to wager with tiny amounts of bitcoin. Plus, lightning users have already completed 3,536 jobs through the bitcoin-centric freelance job site LND Work.  Meanwhile, Square CEO Jack Dorsey said during a recent podcast that his company’s Cash App will integrate lightning capabilities sometime in the future. The diversity of projects related to this protocol makes Reeves even more bullish for the possibilities in 2019.  Speaking to the partnership with Casa, Reeves said:  “We’re looking forward to working that team to spread lightning to the rest of the world.”  Domino's Pizza image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/02/15/make-bitcoin-fun-again-new-lightning-app-lets-you-buy-pizza-with-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d24d5f67ecb3a5f839e41b971a545b9404d1520c-1500x1011.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
