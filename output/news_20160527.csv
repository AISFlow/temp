42378708,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZy5,1464385675,Was Ether's Loss Bitcoin's Gain? Traders Wonder After Wild Week,"The price of bitcoin appreciated nearly 4% for the week ending 27th May, but the figure is perhaps not indicative of the wild trading action the market saw during the period.  Such movements came as market observers are becoming more interested in the relationship between bitcoin, the token supporting the world's longest-running blockchain, and ether, the token for the Ethereum platform.  Bitcoin's gains, for example, came as ether prices plunged sharply, but it made this climb amid modest trading volumes. By contrast, ether enjoyed robust transaction activity, a sign that points to a potential migration of traders away from bitcoin.  Many market observers are beginning to suggest that these two digital currencies display a negative correlation. Since they both have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and each is publicly traded, experts have begun weighing in on the value of each as an investment.  This perceived competition may not be over any time soon, and one market watcher emphasized that both currencies have quite a bit of potential.  ""It is still early to call the winner at this stage,"" Toya Zhang, senior PR Manager for OKCoin, told CoinDesk.  While developers have created many cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was the first one to reach scale – but some are beginning to think that this state of affairs might change.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, said:  ""[There are now] serious concerns about whether [bitcoin] can do thousands of transactions a second and whether it’s robust enough for widespread use.""  Ether, which operates at a far smaller scale than bitcoin, does not currently face such challenges. Further, supporters have asserted that ether has far more flexibility and potential than bitcoin, as Ethereum is proving capable of supporting a broader range of applications than bitcoin’s code.  However, ether has done far less to prove itself than bitcoin, as the latter currency has long dominated the space. If a digital asset wants to achieve widespread adoption, this ""requires continuous progress,"" Zhang continued.  While any forward-looking predictions are purely speculative in nature, hard data – involving both price movements and volumes – can provide a better understanding of market activity.  Bitcoin’s modest climb  Over the week, bitcoin prices rose 3.9% from $436.73 at 12:00 UTC on 20th May to $453.82 on 27th May, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.  However, the digital currency’s price fluctuated between $440 and $450 for most of the week until Friday. These fluctuations coincided with lackluster volume of 7.6m BTC during the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 27th May.  ""Bitcoin trading volume is flat,"" Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk at the time.  He added:  ""There's no clear trend as market players exhibit uncertainty on future price direction, torn between the relatively bullish news of the upcoming supply production halving in July, and the relatively bearish news of Ethereum emerging as a competing and superior currency.""  However, this soon changed, as observers reported a sharp decline in short positions that caused the subsequent price breakout that reached highs not seen since last fall. At press time, bitcoin is trading at $473.20.  Ether’s plunge  Ether prices, by contrast, declined 14% during the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 27th May.  While the digital currency began the period at $14.31, it ended a week of trading by falling well below $12 per ether at press time. These price movements took place as ether’s day-end, 24-hour trading volume fluctuated significantly.  The week started out strong, with volume of $53.8m at 23:59 on 19th May, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. However, this measure fell to as little as $17.9m at 23:59 on 22nd May and finished the week at $20.7m.  The currency’s recent drop – and bitcoin’s rally – can be attributed to market participants front-running The DAO’s raising of money, claimed George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant.  Samman argued that market participants sold their ether holdings after the recent rally, purchasing bitcoin soon after.  Such speculations, while unconfirmed, nonetheless remain indicative that market participants are beginning to more closely scrutinize the nature between the two markets.  Was ether's loss bitcoin's gain? That answer remains elusive, though the search for connections between the two markets has certainly begun in earnest.  Charles L.

42378707,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZwp,1464382514,Kraken to Add DAO Trading as Critics Call for ‘Moratorium’,"Just over two weeks after Ethereum-powered The DAO sparked global headlines, San Francisco-based digital currency exchange operator Kraken has announced it will offer trading pairs for tokens representing voting rights in the decentralized autonomous organization.  The move comes amid continued discussion in the blockchain community about the viability of the project – the most prominent to date built on the Ethereum network – and its capacity to follow through on the aspirations of its supporters.  For example, at least one prominent developer in the Ethereum ecosystem, lead proof-of-stake researcher Vlad Zamfir, joined academic Emin Gün Sirer and Smartwallet CEO Dino Mark in issuing a call today for a temporary “moratorium” on The DAO, a release that named seven causes for concern about its structure.  Yet, against this backdrop, trading will officially launch at 12:00 UTC on Saturday, at which time Kraken will be the most prominent digital currency exchange to list trading for DAO tokens. DAO tokens, once the decentralized group officially launches this weekend, can be used by stakeholders to vote to fund projects that seek support.  The decision to offer trading services for DAO tokens is notable given that Kraken was one of the first major exchanges to begin offering support for ether, the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network, last August.  Other major exchanges, including Bitfinex, Coinbase and Gemini have all since followed suit and offered ether trading.  Kraken, which is in the middle of raising a Series B round of fundraising, said in statements that it decided to move forward in adding trading pairs following news it would enable its stakeholders to begin withdrawing tokens from the platform.  In total, seven trading pairs will be introduced, providing users with the ability to exchange DAO tokens for bitcoins, ethers, euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen.  Dark pool and margin trading services will not be offered as part of the new offering, the exchange said.

42378704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZqX,1464370896,Bitcoin Mining Firm KnCMiner Declares Bankruptcy,"Sweden-based bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner, a startup that has raised $32m in venture funding from investors including Accel and Creandum, has declared bankruptcy.  Once one of the industry's fastest-growing mining firms, the bankruptcy filing and entrance into receivership marks a new and perhaps penultimate phase for KnC, which was founded in 2013 and has drawn fire in the past from bitcoin and digital currency ecosystem over its consumer-oriented mining products.  Earlier this month, a Swedish court ruled in favor of KnCMiner by effectively scuttling a lawsuit over the Titan, a hardware product designed to mine alternative cryptocurrencies.  However, in remarks, CEO Sam Cole denied any relationship between the bankruptcy filing and recent litigation involving the company’s mining hardware customers.  Cole claimed that the primary factor was the upcoming drop in the bitcoin transaction block reward subsidy, set to take place sometime in the middle of July.  Currently, when a miner successfully processes a block, they receive a reward of 25 freshly minted bitcoins. Once the halving takes place, the subsidy will drop to 12.5 BTC – an event that effectively cuts a miner’s bitcoin income by half.  Cole told CoinDesk:  ""Effectively our cost of coin – how much we produce the coins for – will be over the market price. The price is now [roughly] $480. With all of our overhead, after July, the cost will be over $480. All of the liabilities we’ll have after that time will be too high.""  He said the move to bankruptcy was a pre-emptive one taken by KnC’s board of directors, explaining that the firm wanted to avoid running out of funds prior to the drop in revenue.  Following the decision, KnC said it will now seek to sell off profitable aspects of the company, but did not specify which parts of its business would be auctioned. Cole said KnC had tried to reduce its overhead in the past few months, including layoffs at its mining facilities as reported by local media at the time.  The group of companies under the KnCGroup umbrella, which includes KnCMiner as well as other subsidiaries focused on software development and digital currency trading, among others, has been placed under the control of receiver Nils Åberg.  This does not include XBT Provider, a firm partially owned by KnC that offers an exchange traded note, a type of financial instrument, based on bitcoin.  ""Our first priority is to ensure we can continue business [to] at least 10th July acquire the operations as a going concern, including the company’s very knowledgeable and diligent staff,"" Åberg said in a statement.

42399054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8UW,1464366991,Bitcoin Price Hits Six-Month High Amid 5% Surge,"Bitcoin prices surged more than 5% in the early hours of 27th May, a more than six-month high that saw the digital currency breaking out of the relative calm it had experienced in the last several sessions.  Bitcoin prices  reached a high of $479.39 between 07:00 and 07:04 UTC, which was its highest level since 4th November, 2015 and 5.6% higher than the currency’s opening price of $453.82. The digital currency retreated somewhat after reaching this high, dropping to a low of $470.12 between 08:45 and 08:59 UTC, before once again experiencing an upward climb that yielded a high of $477.87 between 12:45 and 12:59 UTC.  As for the exact reason behind the move, the verdict is still forming.  Some market participants speculated bitcoin’s rally was the result of manipulation on Chinese exchanges. It was pointed out on forums that bitcoin prices surged to nearly $500 on OKCoin and Huobi, while they failed to make such a rally on Bitfinex and Bitstamp.  One expert, however, provided a more data-driven approach. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk that a short squeeze helped fuel bitcoin's price rally. In addition, there were not enough sell orders to match the buy orders, which contributed to the currency’s sharp climb, he said.  Looking forward, the market data indicates there has been a major change in sentiment.  ""Shorts have now been obliterated,"" said Zivkovski, adding:  ""Almost 80% of traders are now in a long position, signaling that market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish and that players expect more upside in the aggregate.""  In comparison, the digital currency on the Ethereum network, ether, fell more than 10% during this period, according to Poloniex data.  The move is notable as the digital asset has been surging in volume in recent weeks on positioning from public figures and media that it is a competitor to bitcoin.  Charles L.

42399042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbi8Ii,1464358797,US Congress Reps Receive Blockchain Briefing at Capitol Hill Event,"More than 15 members of Congress met with representatives of the blockchain technology industry this week as part of a roundtable organized by advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  Held in Washington, DC, the event drew a number of industry stakeholders, including startups such as ConsenSys, Bittrex and Bloq, as well as IT firms and consultancies like Deloitte and Microsoft.
