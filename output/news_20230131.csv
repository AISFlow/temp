8580250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518236,1675206045,Why It Could Be Disastrous For Crypto If The Fed Raises Interest Rates By 50 BPS,"The crypto and legacy markets could see a spike in volatility in a few hours. Jeremy Siegel, the Wharton School of Business Professor, told CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ that “it will be a disaster” if the United States Federal Reserve (FED) increases rates by 50 basis points on February 1, 2023. FED Have To Increase Interest Rates By 0.25% The Professor insisted that if the FED mentions any figure “that’s not 25 basis points” during today’s meeting, the effects would be far-reaching. Besides changes in interest rates, Jeremy wants to see the FED change its statement’s wording and expressly mention that their monetary policy decisions over the past months have been working. He adds that it would be refreshing for the FED to assure the market that they are near the end of their tightening cycle. Crypto and legacy market participants expect the United States central bank to slow down on rate hikes in the coming months. However, traders’ and investors’ hope could be dashed if policymakers assess market conditions differently and see the need to keep rates high. Economists expect the FED to increase interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75%, up from 4.50%, on February 1, 2023. The bank began raising interest rates in January 2022. Over the months, the prevailing interest rate in the United States has risen from 0.25% in January 2022 to 4.50% by the close of 2022. Falling Inflation, Rising Crypto, And Bitcoin Prices Inflation is among the many factors, including labor conditions, which the FED considers when determining interest rates. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for the government to intervene and cushion its citizens saw governments slash rates to record levels. According to Jeremy, inflation was inevitable with “money being poured on and on, “and it did sharply in 2021 and 2022. Recent readings show that the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a metric tracking price pressures on consumer goods and a proxy to gauge inflation, has been slowing down after rising to multi-year highs. Related Reading: US Federal Regulators Warn About Crypto Activities In December, inflation dropped to 6.5%, making it the sixth consecutive month of falling consumer prices. It peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 before falling to 6.5% in December, 1% less than in January 2022, when inflation stood at 7.5%. Bitcoin prices briefly recovered in December 2022, bottoming up after losing over 60% in 13 months from November 2021, in reaction to changing macroeconomic conditions, mainly inflation. Over the past weeks, Bitcoin prices have been tracking higher as the crypto market expects inflation to cool down and the FED to slow down on tightening in 2023.

""Customer research conducted by the ImmutableX team found that ease of onboarding, security, compliance and plug and play features were the top priorities for development studios integrating Web3 components into their game,"" the company said in a press release.  The new tool is a non-custodial wallet, gamer profile and authentication solution, similar to an Xbox Gamertag or an Apple ID, that does not require a password at sign-on. This means that Immutable does not hold on to a user’s private keys nor is it involved in signing transactions.  Players are able to access a suite of tools integrated into the Immutable Passport, including a secure digital wallet, fraud protection and seamless authentication across Web3 games and marketplaces.  Immutable says that the new tool will help Web3 gaming studios ""drive adoption across mainstream audiences, maintain enterprise-grade security and access meaningful player analytics."" In addition, any studio that integrates Passport will have access to active players in the ImmutableX ecosystem.  “For Web3 gaming to reach a billion players, onboarding must be invisible, secure and work across any game – mobile, console or desktop,"" said Immutable president and co-founder Robbie Ferguson. ""Passport is a self-custodial wallet, where users can sign in with just an email and one-time password – it will be a game changer for players and radically reduce user acquisition costs.""  Blockchain-based gaming has made strides in recent months, with major companies like Ubisoft and Square Enix embracing crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to create new revenue streams for creators.

42435115,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdojAc,1675205087,"Crypto Market January Roundup: Aptos, Metaverse-Affiliated Tokens Lead Broad-Based Rally","After spending 2022 in the doldrums, the cryptocurrency market has soared in January, with the biggest winners tokens that fell by the most last year.  Layer 1 blockchain Aptos’ APT token was the biggest winner among 160 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of overall market performance, surging 387% this month. Gaming- and metaverse-affiliated tokens including Gala Games’ GALA token and Decentraland’s MANA token gained 233% and 149%, respectively.  “It’s not unusual to see the hardest-hit coins rallying the most when the market turns bullish,” Martin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes, said. “Those smaller altcoins have a higher beta to bitcoin on the way up and on the way down.”  The increases come during a broad-based swoop upward in digital assets that has seen bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, rise about 40% and more than 30%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index has climbed 38%.  Aptos’ rise  Founded by ex-Meta Platforms employees and launched in October, Aptos had a rocky start amid widespread questions about the network's transaction speeds and tokenomics. The November market tsunami triggered by crypto exchange FTX’s collapse sent APT’s price to an all-time low at $3 on Dec. 29, down more than 76% from its initial $13 listing, according to CoinDesk data. FTX’s investment arm and venture capital titan A16z were among Aptos’ investors.  Traders heavily shorted APT at the start of the year, showing a willingness “to pay triple digits in annualized interest to do so,” Leinweber told Coindesk, referring to the sharp drop in APT’s annualized funding rate on Jan. 25.  Leinweber said while there’s no pressure on the price from selling because Aptos investor unlocks are not set to begin until this coming October, the extreme negative positioning in Aptos led to a massive short-squeeze, which eventually and quickly pushed the price higher in a month.  Coinglass data shows $115 million in liquidated short positions compared to approximately $70 million long liquidations since Jan. 8. The trend may underscore concerns that many traders have about Aptos.  “For the token to justify its market value, it will need to grow its user base and liquidity significantly before the VC unlocks kick in,” Leinweber added.  Metaverse tokens surge  Increases in media, culture and entertainment tokens outpaced all other sectors as the CoinDesk Culture & Entertainment Index skyrocketed 81%. Among the biggest gainers were metaverse-related tokens MANA (Decentraland) and SAND (The Sandbox), which recently rose 152% and 91%, respectively. Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s AXS token has jumped around 75%.  A Monday report by crypto data firm Kaiko noted a surge in metaverse token trading volumes on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, compared to Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume.  “The trend suggests that the Korean region has a particular affinity for the metaverse,” according to the report, noting that daily volumes had crossed $600 million for the four tokens Jan. 22-23, nearly double the volumes on Binance for the two days.  Crypto markets, which have largely correlated with equities' performance over the past month, particularly the technology sector, have significantly outperformed major indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen 9% and 5%, respectively, regaining ground from their own 2022 spiral down.  Other crypto winners have included the LCX cryptocurrency exchange’s LCX token and Fetch.ai's native FET token, which recently rose 292% and 201%, respectively. Solana’s SOL token surged 146% in January to recently trade around $24, rebounding from its December record low of $8.19. A favorable, late December tweet by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who expressed “hope” that the Solana community “gets its fair chance to thrive,” has helped spark SOL’s rally.  January’s Losers  Chain’s XCN token in the CMI's Currency sector was one of two monthly laggards, falling 10%. MXC, the native token of the MXC Supernode network in the Computing sector, declined by roughly 5%.",POSITIVE,AXS | APT,AXS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | APT,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/31/crypto-market-january-roundup-aptos-metaverse-affiliated-tokens-lead-broad-based-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37775596a1aaefe587b561f092c0abbb2ce188cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hotly anticipated consultation, to be published by His Majesty’s Treasury on Wednesday, asks for feedback from industry members and experts on rules that focus on protecting consumers that also align with the country’s ambition to become a hub for crypto.  Some proposals will place more responsibility on trading venues, such as crypto exchanges, to define and detail requirements for admission and disclosure documents, the Treasury said in a statement to the press.  The proposed rules also target financial intermediaries such as custodians and seek to set up a regime around the lending of crypto assets. The Treasury is inviting feedback on a planned market abuse regime aimed at improving market integrity, consumer protection and operational resilience of firms. The consultation also proposes prudential and data reporting requirements for crypto companies.  Regulators around the world are calling for more rules for the crypto industry in the aftermath of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and stablecoin issuer Terra that sent ripples through the industry.  “We remain steadfast in our commitment to grow the economy and enable technological change and innovation – and this includes crypto asset technology,” Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a press release. “But we must also protect consumers who are embracing this new technology - ensuring robust, transparent, and fair standards.”  Meanwhile, the U.K. is trying to catch up with the European Union, which is in the last stages of approving its landmark Markets in Crypto Asset regulation that focuses heavily on stablecoins and will set up a licensing regime for service providers.  The U.K.'s wide-ranging Financial Services and Markets Bill, which could give crypto regulators more powers of oversight, is being debated in Parliament and is expected to be finalized by April.  The local crypto industry has been hoping for some clarity on how to operate in the interim. The industry raised concerns about how it should be handling crypto promotions and advertising – something the upcoming rules indicated was not allowed without approval.  In Tuesday’s announcement, the Treasury said that it is introducing a “time limited exemption” that will enable crypto asset businesses that are registered with the U.K.'s financial regulator under its anti-money laundering regime to issue their own promotions while the industry awaits more rules.  The consultation will be open till April 30 after which the government will consider the feedback and work on its response.

Want to receive our daily markets updates in your email inbox everyday? Subscribe to our First Mover newsletter here.  Top Story  The year 2023 has begun on a positive note, with bitcoin up 40%. The rally could be interrupted by a temporary price pullback as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to stick to his hawkish script during Wednesday's post-meeting press conference, analysts told CoinDesk.  The Fed began its two-day meeting today and will announce its rate decision at 19:00 UTC on Wednesday. Powell's press conference will follow the rate decision at 19:30 UTC (2:30 p.m. ET).  Having raised rates by 425 basis points (bps) last year that included outsized moves of 75 bps and 50 bps, expectations are firmly centered on the Fed to slow the pace of tightening to 25 bps on Wednesday. In other words, a 25 basis point rate hike is priced in. The focus will be on whether Powell acknowledges the recent softening in inflation and economic activity, bolstering markets' hopes for an early pivot toward easing.  The odds, however, are stacked against such an outcome because the recent rally in stocks and bonds and the decline in the U.S. dollar have eased financial conditions in the economy for the first time since April. That has dented the Fed's effort to counter rampant price pressures in the economy with tighter credit standards.  ""There is a strong possibility that in the press conference Powell will be more hawkish and re-tighten financial conditions. For that reason, we could see a healthy short-term correction in crypto and all risk assets,"" Nauman Sheikh, head of treasury at crypto asset management firm Wave Financial, said.  Sheikh added that the market has run ahead of itself in pricing the so-called Fed pivot despite repeated warnings by the Fed that rates will remain ""higher for longer.""  Token Roundup  Ether (ETH): ETH was trading up 0.9% at about $1,570.  Decentraland (MANA): The native token of the metaverse project has gained about 152% in January. Decentraland’s price uptick has largely followed its announcement of a number of new features mid-month, although the platform’s user figures haven’t increased significantly. MANA’s price was recently trading up 3% to 74 cents Tuesday.

Below is a listing of the five worst trading days of 2022 for both BTC and ETH. The assets have been highly correlated and so the lists overlap. Both lists also correspond to days of massive uncertainty around the solvency and operations of several crypto institutions.  BTC's worst 2022 trading day was a 16% decline on June 13, coinciding with Celsius Network's announcement that it was pausing investor withdrawals. ETH's worst trading day was a 17.5% decline on Nov. 9, when Binance retreated from a deal to acquire troubled crypto exchange FTX.  BTC and ETH have surpassed the closing prices on those beleaguered days with investors seemingly having already pivoted from negative contagion of those events to focus on more currently relevant factors, such as inflation numbers and the next Fed interest rate announcement.

Testnets run on top of and duplicate the main blockchain. They allow developers and users to test upgrades and applications in a low-stakes environment before going live.  This new testnet, which will go live at 10 a.m. ET (15:00 UTC), will provide the ability to test staked ETH withdrawals (EIP-4895). Users won’t immediately have the ability to participate in the simulated withdrawals until the testnet goes through an upgrade on Feb. 7. For now, users will be able to deposit ETH to validators on the testnet, and then withdraw them the following week.  The launch of the Zhejiang testnet comes after Ethereum developers deprecated the Shandong testnet. They agreed to shut down Shandong because it included a few EIPs surrounding EVM Object Format (EOF), which is no longer included in the Shanghai upgrade. Developers agreed earlier this month that the upgrade for EOF will instead be a part of a separate Ethereum hard fork expected in the third quarter.

The cryptocurrency has been upward since late 2022 and could be on track for further gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gearing To Bounce Back Against Bitcoin – Does Doge Have The Energy? As of this writing, Algorand (ALGO) trades at $0.24 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. Over the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency saw a 3% decline while recording a 40% profit in the last month. Algorand Founder Makes The List Of Most Important Crypto Projects According to a recent report, Algorand founder Silvio Micali s one of the top “2023’s crypto characters to watch.” The computer scientist is one of the investors of the zero-knowledge proofs (zk Proof) technology which is widely accepted in the blockchain space and one of the pillars of its privacy settings. Micali has been part of the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department since 1983. In addition to Zk Proof, Micali has investigated Verifiable Random Functions and is the co-inventor of probabilistic encryption. According to the report, Micali has received the Turing Award called the “Nobel Prize of computing,” the Gödel Prize, and other distinctions. In that sense, the report claims that Micali and the Algorand network have the background and capabilities to push the crypto space into a new adoption era. Over the coming decade, Micali believes only those blockchains capable of processing fast transactions will remain and see high levels of adoption. This theory is part of the long-term value proposition for Algorand, its founder said: The moment the blockchain starts to be used for transactions, the few blockchains that are really capable of transacting at a very low cost, they’re going to emerge, in my opinion. When traditional finance starts getting on the blockchain, you’re going to see the blockchains that are really used in a massive and transactional way are going to accelerate. ALGO Founder On The Radar Along With? In addition to Micali, the report ranked Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, and Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. As the report claims, the past years in crypto were led by “moguls” by loud personalities with little technical background, such as the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, Samb Bankman-Fried. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches Critical Inflection Point Against Bitcoin: What Happens Next? Thus, the industry might look up to Buterin, Back, and Micali as the new faces of the crypto industry.

Markets widely expect a 25 basis point (bps) increase on Wednesday.  The current lull has done little to offset crypto markets' 2023 feel-good story where bitcoin has registered its largest January gain since 2013 while ether rose to two-month highs. BTH was recently trading around $23,100, up nearly 1.5% over the past 24 hours and nearly 40% for the month. Ether was recently changing hands just below $1,600, also up about 1.5% and more than 30% for January.  Both of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are trading much higher than they were during crypto’s darkest days last year. Below is a listing of the five-worst trading days of 2022 for both BTC and ETH. The assets have been highly correlated and so the lists overlap. Both lists also correspond to days of massive uncertainty around the solvency and operations of several crypto institutions.  BTC’s worst 2022 trading day was a 16% decline on June 13, coinciding with Celsius Network’s announcement that it was pausing investor withdrawals. ETH’s worst trading day was a 17.5% decline on Nov. 9, when Binance retreated from a deal to acquire troubled crypto exchange FTX, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection.  BTC and ETH have surpassed the closing prices on those beleaguered days, with investors seemingly having already pivoted from negative contagion of those events to focus on more currently relevant factors, such as inflation numbers and the next Fed interest rate announcement.  Tuesday’s BTC and ETH small price increases imply cautious optimism ahead of the Fed decision. The CME FedWatch tool currently places the probability of a 25 bps increase at 98.2%, a dovish tilt suggesting the Fed believes it's taming inflation with its actions.  On a technical basis, momentum has declined because both cryptos reached overbought levels, when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as the means of measurement.  The RSI indicator measures the speed and magnitude of price changes and ranges between 0-100. Readings above 70 imply that an asset is overbought, and readings below 30 indicate that an asset is oversold. Bitcoin and ether recently rose as high as 87 and 86, respectively, and have since declined to 70 and 59.  Bitcoin actually remains in overbought territory and has outperformed ether on the year, despite a contraction in ETH’s supply.  Both assets have appeared to settle into new areas of support near $23,000 for BTC and $1,600 for ETH.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/31/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-ether-price-surge-a-reversal-from-darkest-days-of-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62d969d5045943e08353ac5e0ae03ac09a230c85-2761x1840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410871,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCqj,1675199282,Blur Reportedly Finds Loophole in OpenSea's Blocklist as Marketplace War Escalates,"The battle for market share over non-fungible token (NFT) creators and collectors has escalated to new levels.  According to speculation on Twitter, zero-fee platform Blur has found a loophole to bypass collections blocklisted by leading platform OpenSea – intensifying the competition between the two marketplaces.  On Monday, Twitter user “Panda Jackson” posted a Twitter thread sharing details of the supposed loophole, explaining that Blur created a new marketplace on Seaport, a protocol that OpenSea released in May 2022. OpenSea and a handful of other marketplaces including fractional NFT platform Tessera and the ApeCoin marketplace are built on the Seaport protocol.  Panda Jackson specified that because Blur’s new marketplace feature based on Seaport isn’t included in the original blocklist, it can list collections with enforced royalties on the marketplace.  In the wake of the royalty debate in November, OpenSea clarified its stance with creators and built a royalty enforcement tool to prevent creators from having their collections listed on marketplaces that don’t honor creator royalties – including Blur, whose trading volume has been nearing that of OpenSea.  With the current loophole, Blur would be able to bypass OpenSea’s blocklist rule. This means that collections that previously weren't allowed to be listed on Blur’s royalty-optional marketplaces can now list these NFTs, which could threaten OpenSea’s share of the overall trading volume.  Evidence of the loophole is visible on the Blur marketplace. For example, earlier in January, NFT goliath Yuga Labs opened the long-anticipated Sewer Pass mint and included the code in the collection’s smart contracts that prevent the tokens from being listed on marketplaces that do not honor creator royalties.  According to data from Blur, buyers can now purchase the Sewer Pass on the marketplace. It is important to note the Sewer Pass NFTs are marked by a “permissioned” tab, which means full royalties are being enforced by Blur on the collection.  Although Blur has always had a royalty-optional model, its new feature challenges the very structure that drew many users to the platform. Panda Jackson told CoinDesk he is hopeful the loophole will, in fact, be a win-win situation for creators and collectors alike.  “Since creators are able to have enforced royalties on the two largest marketplaces at the same time, creators' income may be increased and result in more creators joining the space,” said Panda Jackson. “All players will benefit from this.”  NFT royalty or revenue?  Blur, which debuted in October 2022, landed itself on the map for being a no-fee marketplace geared toward professional NFT traders. In one of its first days it raked in about 1,160 ETH in trading volume, or over $1.8 million. It soared past competitor marketplaces such as Sudoswap and LooksRare, challenging OpenSea’s top spot.  However, the timing of Blur’s launch raised questions among creators in the space as the royalty conversation was in full swing. In August, marketplace X2Y2 moved to a royalty-optional model, followed by leading Solana-based marketplace Magic Eden in October. This sparked an outcry from artists in the space, who claimed marketplaces were attempting to drain their profits and over-commodify creativity.  By the beginning of December, X2Y2 and Magic Eden reverted to their original model of enforced royalties. However, Blur kept pushing along and has held the second-largest trading volume below OpenSea for at least the past month, according to data platform Dune Analytics.  Crypto community bracing for BLUR token release  While the timing of Blur’s scheme might appear timely in the wake of the Sewer Pass hype, there’s also hype around the anticipated launch of its governance protocol and native token, BLUR. Blur has been airdropping the token over the past several months to traders who have purchased Ethereum-based NFTs on the marketplace, to help make the marketplace community-owned.  Blur was set to launch its token earlier this month. However, it recently set a new date of Feb. 14 to gear up for the launch.  “We’re trying new things and the extra two weeks will allow us to deliver a launch that hasn’t been done before,” said Blur in a tweet.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BLUR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | BLUR,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/31/blur-reportedly-finds-loophole-in-openseas-blocklist-as-marketplace-war-escalates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/111f803662fe550fb7b4c662e0436f2d74c6116c-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coin can also try to revisit the $7 mark if it breaks past the $6.70 level. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was green, indicating an increase in buyers on the one-day chart. Technical Analysis The altcoin has fallen from the overbought region, contributing to the recent price correction. The Relative Strength Index was below the 60 mark, but it displayed an increase in buying strength. Buyers still had power over the sellers in the market. A fall in demand will bring DOT below its immediate support line. The price of the altcoin was slightly above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which implied that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. About DOT losing momentum over the subsequent trading sessions, it formed a death cross in the chart. A death cross occurs when the longer moving average crosses above the shorter moving average, in this case, the 50-SMA (yellow) line going above the 20-SMA (red) line. A death spiral is usually followed by a fall in the asset’s value. Other technical indicators showed that the bullish signal was weakening. Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates a change in price momentum and a trend reversal. The indicator underwent a bearish crossover and formed red signal bars related to a sell signal. A sell signal often means that the price is headed for a dip. On the same note, capital inflows noted a decline, although they were still in the positive zone.

The world's largest digital token ( BTC-USD ) perked up 1.9% to $23.12K at 3:17 p.m. ET and is set to finish the month with an over 40% surge. Similarly, ethereum ( ETH-USD ) gained 2.6% to $1.59K, poised to end the month with a nearly 35% climb. That helped push up the global crypto market cap by 1.8% to $1.05T, according to CoinMarketCap data . The Federal Reserve is widely expected to shift down its rate increases to the standard 25-basis-point increment as the U.S. central bank's tightening that's been in place since March 2022 starts to work through the economy and rein in inflation that was initially deemed as ""transitory."" That would lift the federal funds target range to 4.50%-4.75%. Inflation pressures, though, are still too elevated for the Fed's liking, on top of a still-tight labor market and easing financial conditions. That implies Fed policymakers could push back against market expectations for rate cuts later in 2023. And if the Fed were to defy the consensus and implement a larger-than-expected rate hike, it would potentially bode poorly for crypto prices and other riskier asset classes. Seeking Alpha contributor Colorado Wealth Management Fund suggested that ""continuing to push rates higher would create a high probability of overreacting,"" given the lag that the impact of monetary policy has on the real economy. Unsurprisingly, crypto-related stocks also changed hands in a sea of green. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) +8.4% , Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) +8.2% , HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( HIVE ) +6.5% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +5.5% and Silvergate Capital ( SI ) +5% were among the biggest winners. The upswings across crypto were accompanied by a risk-on day for the broader stock market, with all three major indices posting gains.

The coin was hovering around the $50 mark at the beginning of January and breached $90 very recently. It secured close to 70% appreciation. At the moment, AAVE is trading laterally on its chart. In the last 24 hours, the coin fell by 0.9%, thereby confirming consolidation. The coin started to lose steam as the altcoin failed to cross the $91 price mark. The technical outlook depicted that the coin was still on the bullish side. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Move Large Amounts, Bearish For DOGE? After a fall in accumulation over the last few days, the chart noted an uptick in demand at press time. This indicated that AAVE might be eyeing a break in its price consolidation. Over the last two weeks, the coin’s price has fluctuated between $70 and $90, with the altcoin primarily trading above the $84 mark. The altcoin depicted that the buyers were starting to rise again, which might push demand up and help AAVE break its immediate resistance. At the moment, AAVE is trading 88% below its all-time high secured in 2021. AAVE Price Analysis: One-Day Chart Aave was trading at $82 at the time of writing. The journey from $52 to $85 was smooth, after which it took AAVE some time to cross the $90 price level. Over the past few weeks, AAVE has broken past essential resistance levels. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $85; a move above that level may help the altcoin reach $90. On the flip side, support for the coin stood at $80 and $76, respectively. As demand rises, a slight push from buyers will make Aave price challenge $85 and break its consolidation. The amount of Aave traded in the last session was green, indicating an increase in buying pressure. Technical Analysis The altcoin visited the overbought zone over the past few weeks; the coin noted a pullback after that, which is not unusual. At the moment, AAVE has started to note an increase in demand. The Relative Strength Index was moving close to the 60 mark, which meant more buyers than sellers. Accordingly to the increase in demand, the altcoin price moved slightly above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which suggested that buyers were in charge of the price momentum. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines, which indicated increased bullishness on the chart. Other technical indicators indicated mixed signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence reads price momentum and change. The indicator formed red signal bars tied to sell signals on the one-day chart. This could imply that the price will dip in the coming trading sessions before finally breaking through immediate resistance.

42435102,te14p4VjvrIefREtKdoj1O,1675191933,Wormhole Wins Vote to Be Uniswap’s Designated Bridge to BNB Chain,"Wormhole, the crypto bridge platform, won a community vote on Tuesday to become the official governance bridge for Uniswap – the largest decentralized exchange platform by trading volume – when its version 3 platform arrives on Binance’s BNB Chain.  The win grants Wormhole valuable new turf in an ongoing battle between bridge platforms – vital pieces of crypto infrastructure that allow users to pass assets and other data between blockchains. The Wormhole bridge will eventually be used to give Uniswap v3 users on BNB Chain the ability to participate in the Uniswap DAO’s Ethereum-based governance process.  The Uniswap DAO, which allows holders of Uniswap’s UNI token to vote on major strategy decisions, voted 62% in favor of Wormhole. LayerZero, a leading Wormhole competitor, came in second with 37%.  The vote was technically a “signaling” proposal, meaning its passage does not automatically install Wormhole as Uniswap’s official BNB bridge. Instead, the outcome means Wormhole will be written into an upcoming, official proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB chain.  Uniswap is aiming to deploy on BNB Chain before its business source license expires on Apr. 1. Once the license expires, copycats will be able to clone Uniswap’s code to launch competing projects.  In an earlier “temperature check” proposal, 80% of UNI voters signaled that they were in favor of bringing Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain. That proposal, however, named Celer – a bridge platform that lost this week's vote – as Uniswap's bridge partner. With Wormhole’s victory in this week’s vote, the Uniswap DAO rejected a proposal from the Celer CEO to deploy Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain using multiple different bridge providers.  Cross-chain bridge attacks  The main point of community discussion in the lead-up to this week’s vote, which took place between Jan. 27 and Jan. 31, revolved around security. Historically, crypto bridges have proven a primary target for hackers. Wormhole was famously the target of a $325 million attack in February 2022. That attack is still the fifth-largest in crypto history, according to Rekt, but the stolen funds were ultimately reimbursed to users by Jump Crypto, a major Wormhole backer.  A Wormhole victory signals that the service has largely bounced back from that reputational hit – at least in the eyes of UNI’s governance community.  More than 8,000 crypto wallets participated in this week’s proposal, representing a combined 45 million UNI governance tokens. The tokens used in this week’s vote were worth a combined $300 million at UNI’s current price of $6.60.  The vote came a day after LayerZero, Wormhole’s main competitor in the race, faced allegations that it worked to conceal a critical “backdoor” vulnerability in its code. LayerZero denied the allegations and said the allegations were intended to harm its reputation in the lead-up to the Uniswap vote.",POSITIVE,UNI | BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/wormhole-wins-vote-to-be-uniswaps-designated-bridge-to-bnb-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16526ed683f419091197aba93d0c82811ae7bea8-2122x1413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bluntz tweeted to his followers that the DOGE/BTC trading pair is “gearing for a revenge pump for probably 100% or more.” Based on his chart analysis, Bluntz identified that Doge had formed a bullish pattern that may surprise the crypto community. Bluntz seems convinced that Doge will continue to surge its price, thus cautioning that investors would be careless for missing out on this potential opportunity. Bluntz’s sentiment appears to be backed by other crypto market analysts who are also confident that Doge is destined for massive growth. Bluntz also disclosed that the Dogecoin/USD trading pair has finally broken out of a consolidation channel, indicating that Doge is “loading and set to lead the altcoin season.” He said it is just a matter before the meme crypto witnesses a huge price uptick. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 6% After Elon Musk Unveils Crypto Payment Master Plan Does Dogecoin Have More Potential Than Bitcoin? For investors seeking to invest in cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is one of the major altcoins that can prove to be a better investment choice. Dogecoin is currently the ninth-largest cryptocurrency. However, Dogecoin seems a good option for investors willing to take on a little risk. Doge’s price appears relatively much less volatile than BTC’s price. As a result, its price’s relative stability makes many investors consider it a more suitable currency for daily transactions than BTC. Despite some of the selling points that Dogecoin has over Bitcoin, BTC still has significant advantages over the Shiba Inu-themed crypto. BTC’s value is significantly higher than Doge’s. Bitcoin’s all-time high is over $69,000, while Dogecoin is around $0.70. The price difference shows why millions of people invest in Bitcoin because they deem it a reliable long-term value store. In the public eye, high-net-worth investors are less confident in investing huge amounts of funds in Dogecoin. Instead, institutional investors prefer Bitcoin as their investment choice. In that sense, Doge is likely to lag behind Bitcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Move Large Amounts, Bearish For DOGE? Doge Price Analysis At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading its price at $0.09, up 7.39%, with a trading volume of $1.3 million in the last 24 hours, as per Coinmarketcap. So far, the Dogecoin trading chart shows ranging vector candles to the upside, indicating that the crypto asset is currently bullish. Furthermore, the movement seems to be targeting a closer higher high, which could result in a further price surge. The buyers appear to be taking control and pushing the price above. If Doge maintains its bullish trend, then in the next few days, it will likely soar toward the resistance level of $0.1507. But if the coin sees a price correction, it will retreat to $0.07.

Johnson, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.  “It’s important for us to have a relationship with the owner of any entity that is registered to operate in our markets,” Johnson said. “A culture of compliance often begins at the top.”  Johnson, who previously called on Congress to expand the regulatory agency’s authority to review crypto company acquisitions, said the failure of the FTX exchange highlights the need for more transparency from parent companies of U.S. subsidiaries registered with the agency.  “That culture is not solely part of what’s happening in the subsidiary but it's often influenced by what’s happening in the parents,” Johnson said. She pointed out the CFTC lacked the oversight power to investigate FTX, which was based in the Bahamas at the time it sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November.  She pointed to LedgerX – a U.S. regulated subsidiary – as one of the few units that survived the parent's collapse. In 2017 the New-York based firm applied to become a registered derivatives clearinghouse, meaning it was under the agency’s oversight and would need to comply with examinations and balance sheet verifications.  Despite continued debate about the agency’s authority in regulating crypto spot markets, Johnson said the issue at hand “isn’t a turf war,” but more about a business choosing to be a part of a “particular financial market ecosystem.”  “It’s important for us to know certain facts, information [and] data about the company acquiring a registered market participant,” Johnson said, adding that the relationship between the two is “a sacred tie.”  “The CFTC needs to engage in a dialogue with market participants to understand effectively how to modernize our regulation,” she said.

Decentraland’s MANA, which is the native token of the metaverse project, has gained about 145% in January. Decentraland’s price uptick has largely followed its announcement of a number of new features mid-month, although the platform’s user figures haven’t increased significantly.  January’s market surge has seen a number of smaller tokens outshine the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin has risen 40% for the month, ether by 32% and BNB by 32%. Decentraland’s market cap sits at $1.3 billion while bitcoin’s is $446 billion.  Yield Guild Games’s YGG has gained 92% in price. YGG is a gaming guild that invests in the play-to-earn world and provides on-ramps for users. It has a $57 million market cap.  Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at blockchain consultancy STORM Partners, said the metaverse-related token upswing is partly because “the business potential of such tokens is now much clearer than it was a year ago, which in contrast to certain altcoins is not the case.”  The Sandbox’s SAND token has rallied by 91% ahead of its token unlock in mid-February. Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s token AXS also gained around 75% on the month and has a token unlock in April.  “It’s clear that Investors have a growing interest in Web3 virtual worlds, Ahmed said. ""A new report from McKinsey & Co. says spending in the metaverse could reach a total of $5 trillion by 2030, showing everyone wants a slice.""  The metaverse-related token total market cap is currently around $8.5 billion, less than 1% of the total crypto market capitalization, which is now almost $1.1 trillion, Ahmed said, adding: “Therefore, there is plenty of room for growth.”",POSITIVE,AXS | MANA,AXS | BTC | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/31/metaverse-tokens-outperforming-bitcoin-in-january,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91bc7c3b23da883ad9bfb1793037df375a0dc297-2058x1030.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Former high-level executives of FTX, including onetime billionaire and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, have been accused of defrauding investors and customers through the improper transfer of billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to crypto hedge fund Alameda Research (FTX's affiliated trading desk). A portion of those funds were reportedly transferred via accounts Alameda had at Silvergate ( SI ). In the letter, senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Roger Marshall (R-KS) and John Kennedy (R-LA) asked Silvergate ( SI ) about its ties to the failed trading platform, saying “both Congress and the public need and deserve the information necessary to understand Silvergate’s role in FTX’s fraudulent collapse, particularly given the fact that Silvergate turned to the Federal Home Loan Bank as its lender of last resort in 2022.” In the beginning of January, Silvergate disclosed holding $4.3B of short-term FHLB advances as of Dec. 31, 2022. That funding, in addition to the ~$4.6B it had in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2022, helped the bank to avert a run on deposits after FTX's downfall in November 2022. The lawmakers said the bank in December had refused to fully answer requested information, citing “confidential supervisory information.” ""This is simply not an acceptable rationale,"" the senators wrote . ""It is crucial that you provide Congress with the information needed to assess the extent to which Silvergate is responsible for the improper transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda, and to determine the nature of the compliance failures by your bank and your auditors that could have allowed for such abuses.""

8563218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518154,1675181233,Ethereum Reaches Critical Inflection Point Against Bitcoin: What Happens Next?,"Ethereum and Bitcoin represent the number two and one cryptocurrencies by market cap, respectively. The two top coins tend to move in tandem, with Ether gaining the slight edge performance-wise when the crypto market turns bullish. That hasn’t recently been the case, causing the ETHBTC trading pair to reach a precarious inflection point that could cause further discrepancy between the two crypto giants. Here is a closer look at what could happen next. The History Of Ethereum Outperforming Bitcoin Could Be At Stake Ethereum price has been relatively muted compared to its typical outperformance over Bitcoin when the crypto market turns bullish. Since the beginning of 2020, the crypto market has been mostly leaning in Ether’s favor. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Won’t Go Down Quietly: Key Supports To Watch The overperformance of the Etheruem side of the ETHBTC trading pair can be seen in the chart below. The same chart also depicts two converging, long-term trend lines taking the two cryptocurrencies to an unusual inflection point. Is a breakdown against Bitcoin imminent? | ETHBTC on TradingView.com The longer of the two trend lines dates back to the launch of Ethereum. From the lowest touch of the trend line to where the upper trend line formed, ETH grew 9000% against BTC. From the top trend line to the bottom, ETH fell 89% against BTC in a shocking twist of fate. From the second lower trend line touch to the second upper trend line touch, ETH rose another 290% against BTC. Since then, the pair have been in consolidation as the two trend lines narrow further, converging into an apex. When highly volatile assets tighten up this much, the eventual move tends to be explosive. #Ethereum appears to be at am important inflection point against #Bitcoin. While I expect $ETH to probably outperforms longer term, I tend to think $BTC wins this initial battle. pic.twitter.com/rfYLEGeUkL — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) January 30, 2023 What Happens Next In ETHBTC? The monthly LMACD (pictured above) shows that momentum is in favor of more downside for ETH against BTC, hinting at the trend line breaking down. Although Bitcoin appears poised to rally once again against USD and Ether tends to outperform during such phases, cyclically, continued weakness in Ethereum against BTC would make sense. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Reaches Line Between Bear & Bull Market Despite limited data to go on, a cyclical rhythm of troughs against Bitcoin could be developing on the trading pair. Cyclical troughs are usually established following a “valid trend line” breaking down, according to Hurst Cycle Theory. When divided into separate corrections, each ETHBTC cycle appears to have its own, individual valid trend line. Each ETHBTC cycle has formed what resembles a head and shoulders top reversal pattern, with the second cycle lacking the breakdown from the neckline. Cycle theory doesn't bode well for Ether | ETHBTC on TradingView.com The first cycle ended when the weekly LMACD fell below the zero line at the trend line – a situation possibly brewing on the ETHBTC trading pair currently. The breakdown the last time caused Ethereum to sink almost 68% relative to Bitcoin. The breakdown in ETHBTC the last time represented a worsening of the crypto bear market. Although the market bottomed in late 2018, Bitcoin continued to outperform ETH on the ratio until September 2019. BTC was bullish for the a significant portion of time before Ether was able to refuel and return to outperformance. Considering the time involved in the converging trend lines, the breakout or breakdown will be powerful, with the potential to kick off a new trend for the next several months.

42388146,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR7Nvh,1675181027,Mango Markets Exploiter Thought a DAO Protected Him. Then US Courts Showed Up,"Mango Labs’ $47 million civil suit against crypto trader Avraham Eisenberg isn’t just the latest legal drama to emerge from the destructive exploit of Mango Markets. It’s also a case study in how the ideals of crypto governance take a back seat to real-world contracts law.  Eisenberg, who faces criminal charges over the $114 million escapade, had in October negotiated a settlement with Mango Markets’ decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that he thought exempted him from civil liability. To him, his trades were legal and used “the protocol as designed.” But, just in case his victims felt otherwise, he negotiated with them to make sure they would not sue.  Representatives for Mango Markets now say the DAO’s own deal should be thrown out for effectively violating contracts law; they’re demanding Eisenberg pay back the DAO. In doing so, Mango Markets may unwittingly highlight how powerless crypto governance is when grappling with the conventional legal system.  Mango Markets was a popular venue for trading crypto tokens and derivatives on the Solana blockchain that is managed by a DAO. Holders of the MNGO governance token vote on everything from token listings to debt repayments. It's widely recognized as one of the most active DAOs in the Solana ecosystem (although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has called Mango DAO governance a sham).  See more: Mango Markets to Resume Crypto Trading, SEC Be Damned  Members of Mango DAO had voted not to hold Eisenberg accountable in exchange for him returning $67 million in crypto. Daffy Durairaj, a co-founder of Mango Markets, even said he’d see to it that Eisenberg was “cleared of any wrongdoing.” Based on his own public gloating over his “highly profitable trading strategy,” Eisenberg thought he was in the clear.  Durairaj and Mango Labs are now leading a lawsuit against Eisenberg to get back the $47 million he kept. It’s seemingly a violation of the agreement – a vote on a smart contract by a DAO – struck between victim and perpetrator.  Eisenberg believed the negotiated settlement put the issue to bed. “I believe all our actions were legal,” he said in a Twitter thread where he self-doxxed as the trader whose massive trades in MNGO and perpetual-futures contracts crippled Mango Markets with bad debt.  But that negotiated proposal holds no legal water, according to lawyers at Canadian law firm McMillan LLP interviewed by CoinDesk.  “The Mango Markets settlement appeared unenforceable from the get-go,” said Benjamin Bathgate, a commercial litigator with the firm.  He and colleague Reuben Rothstein said they were surprised Mango’s core contributors ever proposed invalidating their claims – and surprised, too, that the vote passed.  “However, we were not surprised to see signs that one or more affected users assisted in the criminal investigation. And we were not at all surprised to see, a few days ago, Mango Markets bring a civil lawsuit seeking to render the settlement void and bring a claim against Eisenberg to make its users whole. Not in the least,” Bathgate and Rothstein said in an email.  Indeed, Mango Labs’ suit against Eisenberg casts aside its “negotiated settlement” with Eisenberg as “unenforceable” and requests the court toss it aside.  Eisenberg “forced Mango DAO to enter into an unenforceable settlement agreement – under duress – purporting to release depositors’ claims against him and precluding them from pursuing a criminal investigation,” Mango Labs’ lawyers argue.  In contract law, if a party is forced against its will (i.e., under duress) to enter into an agreement, then that contract is null and void, according to the Corporate Finance Institute.  What’s notable here is that the deal was on a smart contract created with the principals of on-chain governance in mind.  Ascribing uniform principals to anything in crypto is a fool’s errand. But for a movement predicated on the notion that networks of individuals can operate a monetary system better than governments can, it's notable that the boosters of decentralized governance here have ceded their authority to the U.S. courts.  The McMillan lawyers see things a bit more straightforwardly.  “We think (and hope) the fascinating Mango Markets case – of an ill-advised settlement gone awry and effectively being ignored – will put a shock of reality into DAO ecosystems and give their users a reality check,” Bathgate and Rothstein said.  “In their isolated system the votes undoubtedly seem powerful, and they are in a business sense as they operate as a cooperative of sorts aggregating purchasing power,” they said. “But that doesn’t mean that a DAO proposal and vote can cure all ills: like it or not, that’s what the courts are for.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/31/mango-markets-exploiter-thought-a-dao-protected-him-then-us-courts-showed-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ff10df0cb792583ca86bc6f597df3db1efe5cf9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new capital will help Squid add more supported chains and expand the team.  Other participants in the funding round included Distributed Global, Fabric Ventures, Galileo, Chapter One and Noble Capital, among others. Axelar participated as a strategic investor.  Introduced in 2021, the Axelar network is a blockchain of connected blockchains that allows for cross-chain communications. Squid provides cross-chain liquidity that connects decentralized exchanges (DEX) with more users in a more user-friendly way that doesn’t involve the security risks of cross-chain bridges.  Cross-chain liquidity in theory can provide more liquidity for borrowing and lending activity and put DEXs on a more even playing field with centralized exchanges, which took a hit after the recent collapse of multibillion-dollar exchange FTX.  “Failure of centralized trading platforms has highlighted the need for secure decentralized alternatives. Squid powers this future by enabling decentralized, secure, and simple to use cross-chain swaps,” said Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov in the press release.  How it works  The Squid protocol plugs into existing liquidity on DEXs on supported chains to easily enable cross-chain swaps, a type of smart contract technology that allows for the exchange of tokens between two different blockchains. Squid offers an application programming interface (API) and software development kit (SDK) for developers and a customizable widget.  Squid’s mainnet launch supports 25 chains, including Ethereum, Moonbeam, Binance Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon and a number of Cosmos-based chains.

By understanding these costs, entrepreneurs, researchers and regulators have the opportunity to help DAOs deliver on their promise to create a fairer internet.  On the coordination side, DAOs add friction to using resources by requiring members to pass proposals. By default, most DAOs today are at risk of being what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin would call a vetocracy, where the default outcome is ""no"" unless a proposal sponsor rounds up sufficient support for their project. In some cases, the fact that democratic process adds friction is a feature, not a bug.  See also: DAOs Are the Real Meritocracies | Opinion  For financial protocols that steward millions in user deposits, it should be difficult to change settings that could impact upon tens of thousands of users. In the earlier stages of value creation, however, a core team should have authority to take dozens of small actions toward a goal without the friction of writing proposals.  Many projects were eager to cede that authority and adopt the ""DAO'' moniker early in their lifecycle in an attempt to garner community enthusiasm, saddling themselves with the burden of coordinating hundreds of people just to take baby steps. Plus, most DAO infrastructure and tooling is built on the assumption that DAOs will be primarily interacting with smart contracts, meaning that there is a dearth of thought put into enabling members to take action in the real world.  On the regulatory side, starting a DAO is easy – you can create a multisig (a multisignature wallet, which requires multiple people to sign transactions together) in minutes. The cost of starting a compliant DAO, however, is immense.  Everything from incorporating an entity to paying contributors in jurisdictions around the world can take weeks of legal work and rack up hefty bills, making the idea of starting a DAO seem like a fool's errand. If a DAO needs a lawyer and an accountant just to operate, that's an immense barrier to entry.  When it comes to raising money, vague securities laws can make crowdfunding a risky endeavor. When it comes to spending money on anything off-chain, a DAO will need to open an institutional trading account or ""off-ramp,"" which can be a multi-month affair.  And if the DAO owns real world assets like land and trademarks, the cherished property of forking, which allows a group that disagrees with the main group to branch off, becomes even harder or impossible.  Making DAOs work  Many of these coordination and regulatory costs can be solved with innovation. Entrepreneurs are building tools to ease burdens of DAO payroll, compliance and governance. Some of these barriers must be addressed at the policy level, for example by clarifying DAO statutes and securities laws. More research is also needed on governance mechanisms in order to move DAOs away from vetocracies and towards meritocracies.  Sometimes, though, the high coordination and regulatory costs are simply worth paying. For example, important pieces of internet infrastructure that touch the lives of many ought to be decentralized. MakerDAO, which acts as a sort of Federal Reserve guardian of the stablecoin DAI, is a great example of something that should be very decentralized because trust in the protocol is established by the fact it's (theoretically) stewarded by a large group and immune from the whims of a single person. The success of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the internet itself is largely due to decentralization, which has brought them robustness and passionate communities.  See also: The Psychological Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum's Governance | Opinion  Making DAOs work is an important project for humanity because they promise us a more democratic future where we own and govern the town squares of tomorrow. One thing is certainly clear – demand for democratic systems is increasing, and people are skeptical of a few platforms ruling the internet.  By lowering the coordination and regulatory costs, we can make DAOs more viable and help them fulfill their original vision to create a more level playing field and a more democratic internet.",NEUTRAL,DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | DAI,Scott Fitsimones,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/31/whats-holding-daos-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0be0ac5ae43d0831120d688133d0c1e11e1257b3-1100x460.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What does this mean for the meme coin’s price? Dogecoin Whales Have Made Multiple Large Transactions Today A few transactions involving a huge amount of DOGE have been spotted on the blockchain in the past day. As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, the first of these transfers involved the movement of 450,000,000 DOGE, worth more than $40 million at the time of the transaction. As the scale of this transfer is quite large, the sender is likely to be a whale. Transactions from these humongous holders are generally the ones to watch for, since they can sometimes cause noticeable ripples on the market. Naturally, these transfers can both be bullish or bearish, depending on what the whale intended to do with the move. Here are some additional details regarding this Dogecoin whale transfer, which may have hints about the purpose behind it: Looks like this massive transfer only costed the sender a fee of $0.09 | Source: Whale Alert As can be seen above, both the sending and receiving addresses for this Dogecoin whale transaction were unknown addresses. “Unknown” here means that these addresses aren’t connected to any known centralized platform. So, usually, such addresses belong to personal investor wallets. Since there isn’t any platform involved here, it’s hard to say exactly why the whale made this transfer. The holder may have been selling through an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, in which case the move could have bearish effects on the price of the meme coin. Related Reading: This Level Could Be Crucial For Bitcoin, PoW Pricing Model Suggests However, it’s also possible that both the addresses here were owned by the same whale, and that they were simply restructuring their holdings across these addresses. If this scenario would be true, then Dogecoin shouldn’t feel any impact from this transaction. According to another tracker, Dogecoin Whale Alert, there have also been two other whale transfers today. And unlike the above transaction, these moves did involve centralized platforms. 🐕🪙🐋🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 352,422,225 $DOGE ($32,672,007 USD) was transferred from a #Top20 wallet to a #Binance wallet.

Blockchain info for these two moves confirms that the same sending and receiving addresses were part of both transactions, meaning that a single whale was likely behind both of them. The sender was a top 20 wallet here, implying that this Dogecoin whale was among the 20 largest on the network. On the receiving end of these two transfers was Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? Open Interest Registers Sharp Jump As one of the main reasons why investors use exchanges is for selling purposes, transfers heading to these platforms can have bearish implications for the price of DOGE. These deposits to Binance have come after Dogecoin has rallied around 8% in the past day, following news that Elon Musk is planning to roll out cryptocurrency payments on Twitter. If the whale truly intended to sell here, then it’s likely that it was done to take advantage of the current profit-taking opportunity.

As bitcoin mining declines in a region, the correlation between bitcoin and local stock markets subsides as well. The United States and China are where most bitcoin mining has been conducted over the last five years. Crypto is an uncorrelated asset class, according to its proponents, and as such ought to contribute to portfolio diversification. However, research has shown that this claim hasn't held up particularly well. We examined the relationship between where bitcoin mining was conducted and how the performance of the local equity markets correlated with bitcoin prices and found that in the United States especially, the performance of the S&P 500 and bitcoin prices have exhibited a positive correlation over the last five years. Because the United States and China are where most bitcoin mining has been conducted over the last five years, we used the S&P 500, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite indices as our regional proxies. We calculated the rolling nine-month correlation between bitcoin returns and each of the three indices using weekly data. We then compared that with the bitcoin hash rate by country from September 2019-which is as far back as reliable records go to January 2022. The bitcoin hash rate measures the computational power of the bitcoin blockchain and is a proxy for how much bitcoin mining is being done. Prior to November 2020, China accounted for more than 60% of bitcoin mining. But fast-forward to November 2021 and China's share had plunged to about 15% in response to government steps to reduce bitcoin mining. Over the same time period, the United States climbed from representing about 10% of global bitcoin mining to more than 35%. Bitcoin Hash Rate Distribution by Country, Sept. 2019 to Jan. 2022 University of Cambridge Bitcoin Mining Map, Statista data Bitcoin Mining Distribution by Country, 2019 to 2022 University of Cambridge Bitcoin Mining Map, Statista data These trends make November 2020 to November 2021 time frame an excellent window into how bitcoin-prices-to-index correlations adjust as bitcoin mining ebbs and flows. We found that as US crypto mining spiked between November 2020 and November 2021, bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 rose to 0.39 from 0.28. But as crypto mining plummeted in China during the same period, bitcoin's correlation with the two Chinese indices fell also. The Hang Seng's and Shanghai Composite's bitcoin correlation declined to -0.14 from 0.21 and to -0.44 from 0.09, respectively. Bitcoin Correlations with Equity Indices November 2020 November 2021 S&P 500 0.283 0.386 Hang Seng 0.213 -0.138 Shanghai Composite 0.085 -0.437 The results suggest the more bitcoin is mined in a particular country, the greater the correlation between the cryptocurrency and local equity markets. As bitcoin mining declines in a region, the correlation between bitcoin and local stock markets subsides as well. Regarding annual correlations between bitcoin prices and the indices in question, our hypothesis holds up there too. The more bitcoin mining in a locale, the greater the correlation between the price of bitcoin and local stock markets. This relationship was strongest with the S&P 500 and Shanghai Composite and less so with Hang Seng over the full-time period. Annual Correlations: Bitcoin and Equity Indices 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 S&P 500 -0.174 -0.119 -0.045 0.064 0.155 0.186 0.747 Hang Seng -0.289 -0.378 0.010 0.011 0.148 -0.190 0.400 Shanghai Composite 0.014 0.253 0.096 0.122 0.169 -0.390 -0.040 In total, our results indicate that where bitcoin is mined may affect how it moves and which stock indices it moves with. And this affects what sort of diversification benefits bitcoin may or may not bring to a portfolio.

The remittance service, Send Globally, will be available in the Philippines starting Tuesday, according to a press release. It runs on the Lightning Network, a “layer 2” scaling solution that enables cheaper and faster Bitcoin transactions. Funds sent via the service from abroad can be received as local currency in the recipient’s bank or mobile money account, according to the release.  Strike has made waves through its work with El Salvador to support bitcoin as legal tender in that Central American country. Now, its goal is to upend the traditional multi-billion-dollar remittance industry, which it says is plagued by high fees and slow processing times, by leveraging Lightning’s low-cost and near-instant payments.  “When you think cross-border, you don't think very fast, very cheap and very good experience,” Strike founder and CEO Jack Mallers said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We're using Bitcoin's Lightning Network under the hood to achieve some stuff that has never been possible before.”  Lightning Network growth  Lightning analytics site, 1ML shows an increasingly vibrant network with over 16,000 nodes, more than 76,000 channels (connections between Lightning nodes) and a network capacity close to 5,300 BTC (roughly $122 million at the time of publication).  “Even a couple years ago, Lightning wasn't as developed,” Mallers explained. “A network is only as strong as its participants. The growth of the network has economies of scale and network effects that we've never seen before.”  According to the release, the Strike app converts dollars into bitcoin and sends a Lightning payment to a third-party partner in the recipient’s country. (Strike has partnered with Bitcoin payments firm Pouch.ph in the Philippines). The partner converts that bitcoin into local fiat currency and forwards the money to the recipient’s bank or mobile money account.  Mallers says all of this takes place outside of the view of users, shielding them from the complexity of bitcoin payments and removing any potential tax implications that could result from the sale and disposition of bitcoin.  “There's all sorts of tax consequences involved – if I wanted to remit money from here to the Philippines, I have to tell the IRS about it. That's ridiculous,” Maller said. “We use the properties of Lightning under the hood. So our users don't even know we're using it. They're just sending dollars and receiving pesos.”  Last month, Send Globally also launched in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana.  “We have partners all over the world,” Mallers said, “because Lightning is this open payment network.”  UPDATE: Tuesday, January 31, 2022 15:34 UTC: Adds Lightning Network growth chart.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/strike-expands-lightning-powered-remittances-to-philippines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a27660eab9537042e0d2d30ddd22c1db639282d-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A subnet is a sovereign network that defines its own rules for membership and tokenomics. They are composed of a group of validators – in this case, Avalanche validators – that work together to reach consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.  Read more: Amazon Web Services Taps Avalanche to Help Bring Blockchain Technology to Enterprises, Governments  Tokenization is a growing trend among financial institutions as it allows traditional finance players to attract more investors by using blockchain technology. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Asia’s private market exchange ADDX, the asset tokenization industry will expand to a $16.1 trillion business opportunity by 2030.  Intain’s digital marketplace is intended to automate and integrate functions such as verification agent, underwriting, rating agency, servicer, trustee and the investor, according to the company. “Rather than replacing trust intermediaries, [IntainMARKETS] integrates them onto a singular platform and process to enable digital issuance and investment on-chain,” the company added.  Ava Labs, the company behind the layer 1 protocol Avalanche, said this is the first structured finance marketplace that combines tokenized issuance and investment with end-to-end administration on-chain.  Avalanche was the company’s choice of protocol because of its subnet architecture, which allows Intain to create a permissioned network for select financial institutions while complying with particular regulatory frameworks, Intain said in its statement.  “Attempts by the blockchain industry thus far have focused on tokenization, but for a financial instrument based on a complex structure, tokenization itself neither addresses the need of transparency nor efficiency,” said Siddhartha S, founder and CEO of Intain.

42421392,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnzfp,1675176936,Initial Coin Offerings Deserve a Rethink,"In the fallout over FTX, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) recently announced he is considering legislation aimed at protecting retail investors from cryptocurrency fraud. Legislators and regulators should proceed with caution. Casual observers may be skeptical of the innovation of cryptocurrencies, but the clearest innovation has been initial coin offerings (ICO).  ICOs have allowed entrepreneurs to raise money, circumventing the thicket of decades-old Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. Members of Congress serious about economic growth should be encouraging initial coin offerings and rein in the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s regulatory overreach.  Don Phan manages the cryptocurrency business at Amazon Web Services and was previously a congressional staffer.  Initial coin offerings are a technological innovation that disrupts the current fundraising apparatus calcified after passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Sarbanes-Oxley should serve as a cautionary tale. Passed in the aftermath of the Enron-Arthur Anderson accounting scandal, Sarbanes-Oxley was meant to boost investor confidence and protect retail investors.  Instead, Sarbanes-Oxley has made it more difficult for entrepreneurs to access public capital markets. Startups are now staying private longer precisely because accessing money from the public markets has become so burdensome.  See also: What Is an ICO? / Learn  The U.S. Congress took a step in the right direction with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act of 2013), which promoted equity crowdfunding, the kind most associated with platforms such as Kickstarter and AngelList. The intent of Congress was to allow more investors to take part in the growth of early-stage startups and for startup founders to be able to raise money from a much wider range of people.  Congress pushed in the right direction by promoting equity crowdfunding, but Congress could not foresee how much bigger the ICO market would be. According to data compiled from CB Insights, $19 billion has been raised since 2013 through initial coin offerings, while only $969 million has been raised through equity crowdfunding. Clearly, ICOs have won out.  While AngelsList and Kickstarter were innovative for their time and paved the way for our understanding of equity crowdfunding, they are centralized platforms that were ultimately limited in their scale. The intent of Congress was to make fundraising easier for founders to raise from small investors, exactly what ICOs do so well.  See also: Investing in Crypto: Alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether / Learn  The Securities and Exchange Commission bears the most responsibility for giving ICOs a bad name and has vastly overstepped its authority as an executive regulatory agency. The SEC does not have final say over cryptocurrency regulation – Congress does. While the JOBS Act intended to make fundraising easier, the SEC is pushing for an overregulated regime that replicates the worst features of Sarbanes-Oxley.  If the SEC gets its way, fewer retail investors will be able to take part in the growth of early-stage startups and startup founders will only be able to raise from a limited range of sources. The chilling effects of possible SEC enforcement can be seen in how cryptocurrency entrepreneurs must contort themselves to avoid the “ICO” term for fear of an SEC crackdown.  Founders now use incomprehensible terms such as “initial decentralized offering” (IDO) and “token generation event” (TGE) to disguise what would otherwise be a simple fundraising exercise. Congress should use the provisions of the JOBS Act to provide ICO entrepreneurs with a “safe haven” of legal protection from SEC enforcement.  Furthermore, SEC regulation of ICOs should be viewed as protectionism over initial public offerings, or IPOs, in which an agency led by a former Goldman Sachs partner protects the IPO ecosystem of investment bankers, auditors, corporate lawyers and regulators who bear the most risk of ICO disruption.  Fraud or failure?  A regularly quoted statistic is that most ICO-backed ventures shut down within four months. Legislators and regulators need to convincingly distinguish between fraud and failure. Business failure is not a crime and should be encouraged by lawmakers attempting to encourage economic growth.  Regulation is often a zero-sum game because rules aimed at protecting retail investors – the proverbial grandmother who has lost her life savings in the latest crypto fad – come at a real cost to entrepreneurs, who must contend with more rules while being starved of the capital needed to grow their businesses.  See also: The Bizarre (Sort of) Bipartisanship of the Crypto Congress  Chairmen Brown and Gensler may be sincere in their desires to support growth and tech entrepreneurship, but they risk strangling the clearest source of funding for future innovation.  Most potential retail investors have heard that cryptocurrencies are largely scams they should avoid, so the benefit of regulation will likely be minimal. On the downside, another layer of regulation will make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to raise the money needed to grow their businesses.  If more regulations pass, it is foreseeable the innovative startups of the future will be built in foreign countries, far away from Silicon Valley, far from American shores.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Don Phan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/31/us-senate-cryptocurrency-fraud-ico,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4228d77bea3133aee61d72404bb2f703d50c5675-5010x3340.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388147,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR7O9j,1675173600,Nic Carter from Castle Island Ventures Backs New Crypto VC Firm,"Breed VC, a new crypto-focused firm, has closed fundraising for its first fund and brought in a “considerable portion” of its $20 million target, founder and general partner Jed Breed told CoinDesk during an interview. The fund was backed by prominent crypto investor Nic Carter, Tribe Capital and Shima Capital, among others.  The venture capital firm closed the fund at the beginning of the year, meaning the fundraise happened during the severe turbulence following the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX.  “I’ve known Jed since 2018 when we met in the Boston crypto scene. I’m backing him because he has a great track record as an investor, is very crypto-native and has an excellent network in the space,” said Carter – a general partner at Castle Island Ventures – in an emailed statement. “I launched my first fund in a bear market and know how hard it is to raise during times like this. However, these tend to be the best times to deploy. I have complete confidence in him and am proud to make him my first LP [limited partner] check.”  Breed VC will focus on pre-seed and seed funding rounds. Verticals of interest include decentralized finance (DeFi), consumer-focused decentralized applications (dapps), non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructure and blockchain scaling solutions.  ""Our midterm thesis is following closely for the next breakout application in crypto. Long term, as scaling and UX improve we feel every interaction on the internet will be built on crypto rails. Crypto is here to stay and we plan to take an active part in helping builders create the future,” said Breed.  Jed Breed started his crypto career as a bitcoin miner before moving on to Circle, where he headed digital assets and helped launch the USDC stablecoin. He then moved on to run the DeFi efforts at institutional hedge fund Arena Capital, cutting his investment teeth as an angel investor.  Breed VC has already made its first deal with a portfolio company, a zero-knowledge borrow/lend platform that has yet to officially announce its details. In addition to financial backing, Breed VC will offer operational support to companies. The smaller size of the fund lends well to one-on-one support, noted Breed, who can also tap his broad crypto network for help on anything from tokenomics design to relationship building,  Read more: VC Firm Pantera's 2023 Crypto Forecast Says the Future Is DeFi  UPDATE (15""44 UTC): Headline and body to clarified that Nic Carter invested as an individual.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/31/nic-carters-castle-island-ventures-backs-new-crypto-vc-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77aa5c935cb826ab8e013d6e20d3f03910568b46-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The technology will be available on-chain on Ethereum, Celo, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Avalanche. California-based Tokensoft is betting its open-source smart contracts will help it take a chunk of business from other popular on-chain fundraising mechanisms, such as exchange initial DEX offerings (IDO) and token launchpads.  The expansion means deeper integrations with the Web3 world, where startups raise millions of dollars by selling investors tokens instead of equity. Tokensoft is one of a handful of companies built to help those issuers navigate the sometimes thorny regulatory and compliance landscape around such distributions.  By moving its own product on-chain, Borda said Tokensoft’s clients can add new levels of abstraction to their token distributions. One new feature allows for tethering a token unlock to the price of bitcoin (BTC), instead of to periods of time.  “The kind of people who go with bitcoin price unlocks are bullish on bitcoin and just bullish on crypto as a whole,” he said of the veteran crowd this product line targets. “This isn't for folks who ask, ‘What if bitcoin never hits $50,000 again?’”  Smart contracts will also allow more creativity in setting airdrops, he said. One might set the code to only distribute to wallets that have executed specific smart-contract interactions, for example.  “It’s become a lot broader in terms of how you can distribute tokens to a user base,” he said.  Making one’s software tech open source has potential downsides for a business, though – not least being the possibility of prospective customers simply copying the code and replicating it without ever paying a penny. Borda acknowledged the risk, but said it's one Tokensoft is willing to take. Users would still need to pay Tokensoft for regulatory guidance, he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | ARB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/31/crypto-issuance-startup-tokensoft-brings-its-token-launchpad-on-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b101352b5cda40fd833b919909b2f628f68fa80-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Evidently, experts say that 2023 is the “build phase” for GameFi and it is set to explode in the next couple of months. Related Reading: Dogecoin: Can Elon Musk’s McDonald’s Offer Give DOGE A ‘Happy’ Price? Considerably, blockchain games are seen to have doubled since last year. In fact, in 2021, blockchain games were able to amass as much as $476 million in revenues. The year 2022 was also a phenomenal year for the play-to-earn (P2E) industry. Here Are The Top 5 GameFi Cryptos To Watch This Year Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is known for its scalability and security. It’s also a winner in terms of customer experience compared to other blockchain platforms. It is an open-source platform that allows users to build and release their very own decentralized applications (dApps). It clearly tops the list when it comes to the platform of choice due to its smooth, speedy, and secure transactions which also increases the demand for AVAX tokens. At the time of writing, AVAX is trading at $19.55, up 8.3% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Metacade (MCADE) Metacade has an obvious edge being the first-of-its-kind metaverse arcade ever built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It has a massive P2E potential. Its goal is to ultimately morph into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which will start in the Q2 of this year and end in Q4 of 2024. With the strong roadmap and long-term potential of Metacade, analysts anticipate that the price, which is currently at $0.01, will hit $1 this year. The Sandbox (SAND) SAND is certainly one of the best GameFi cryptos to buy and invest in for 2023. Apart from its popularity especially with Roblox and Minecraft fans, this platform is steadily growing in adoption with its dynamic and interactive 3D virtual landscapes. The platform is pretty neat with its no-code plug-and-play feature. Sandbox empowers user-generated content while allowing users to monetize their virtual real estate. SAND is currently trading at $0.7260, down 8.7% in the last week. Axie Infinity (AXS) Axie Infinity is very popular, especially with Pokemon Go fans. With this P2E metaverse, users can buy, collect, train, and upgrade their Axies, all while trading NFTs. Gamers will also earn rewards when they win battles with others. With the increasing demand and irresistible features of Axie Infinity, it sits as one of the top GameFi cryptos to invest in this year.

Riley Financial (RILY) have agreed to restructure an $11 million promissory note the miner owes to the investment bank.  Greenidge was one of several miners that struggled last year to meet operating costs and debt obligations as crypto prices slumped and energy costs rose. It was hit particularly hard because of its reliance on natural gas. Its mining margin declined to 20% in the third quarter of last year from 42% in the second quarter, according to CoinDesk's calculation based on public filings.  As detailed in a press release on Tuesday, under the new restructuring deal, Greenidge will raise $1 million in a stock sale underwritten by B. Riley. The miner will make a $1.9 million principal payment on the note, bringing the balance down to about $9 million, with no more payments due until June.  In addition, Greenidge is seeking to sell excess real estate from its South Carolina mining facility, with proceeds going toward the note. If the miner is able to pay down $6 million or more before June, its monthly payments would be trimmed to $400,000 from the currently scheduled $1.5 million.  Greenidge previously reduced $76 million of debt to NYDIG to $17 million by transferring mining rigs that had 2.8 exahash/second of computing power to the lender along with accrued coupons and credits. Greenidge can further cut its debt to NYDIG by $10 million if it facilitates ""for NYDIG the rights to a mining site within three months."" Greenidge has signed five-year hosting agreements with NYDIG, which ""includes a profit-sharing component,"" according to the press release.  Greenidge warned of its deteriorating liquidity position as early as September. Its situation was similar to those of now-bankrupt Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK), which received a $100 million lifeline from crypto financial-services firm Galaxy Digital.

Here’s what Santiment says is the possible reason behind this decline. Bitcoin Observes Largest Profit To Loss Transaction Ratio In 2 Years As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, yesterday was the largest profit-taking day for BTC since February 2021. The relevant indicator here is the “ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss,” which, as its name already implies, measures the ratio between the daily volume being involved in profit-taking transactions and that involved in loss-taking ones. The indicator works by looking through the on-chain history of each coin in the circulating supply to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the current value of Bitcoin, then that coin is said to be holding a profit. Now, if the coin is sold while in this state, its sale transaction would contribute towards the profit volume. On the other hand, the metric would count the volume under the loss-taking type if the coin is sold while the BTC price is less than its last transfer value. When the ratio between these two volumes is greater than 1, it means there are more profit-taking transactions taking place on the network right now. On the other hand, values lower than the threshold imply that loss-taking is dominant currently. Related Reading: This Level Could Be Crucial For Bitcoin, PoW Pricing Model Suggests Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin ratio over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the ratio between profit and loss transactions for Bitcoin was at a very high level during the past day. In this spike, there were more than 2.4 times as many profit-realizing transfers happening on the blockchain as compared to the loss-taking ones. This level of profit-taking is the highest observed since February 2021, around two years ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? Open Interest Registers Sharp Jump Interestingly, the latest surge in the metric coincided with BTC hitting a high of $23,900 yesterday. Since then, however, BTC has sharply declined and is now below the $23,000 level. This would suggest that it might have been these profit-taking transactions that have led to the latest pullback in the price of the cryptocurrency. Today, after the BTC value has declined, the indicator’s value has also dropped off and is now below 1, implying that profit-taking has stopped and loss-realizing transfers are taking over now. This could be bullish for the coin, however, as Santiment explains, “If loss transactions pile up now, prices are more likely to bounce right back.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $22,800, down 1% in the last week.

In October, the firm announced plans to tokenize three of its funds under a partnership with digital-assets securities company Securitize.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Pennsylvania-based Hamilton Lane said that its flagship Equity Opportunities Fund V recently closed with $2.1 billion in investor commitments and that the firm is making a portion of that accessible to individual investors through a tokenized feeder fund on Securitize that’s backed by the Polygon blockchain. The fund offers “diversified exposure to unique and differentiated deals through an efficient fee structure,” Hamilton Lane said in the statement. A feeder fund collects money from a pool an investors.  With the tokenized version of the feeder fund, the minimum investment amount drops to $20,000 from at least $5 million for the traditional version.  “The new Hamilton Lane tokenized fund is a major step in the continued democratization of the private markets by significantly expanding access to the historically high-performing private-equity asset class, particularly through reduced investment minimums,” Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement.  “Private equity has outperformed the S&P 500 by 70% over the past 20 years, but that performance has mostly been enjoyed by major institutions, sovereign wealth funds and university endowments. Individual investors can begin accessing these opportunities, too,"" he added.  Hamilton Lane plans to launch the previously announced two additional feeder funds, which offer exposure to private credit and secondary transactions, in the coming months.

The focus will be on whether Powell acknowledges the recent softening in inflation and economic activity, bolstering markets' hopes for an early pivot toward easing.  The odds, however, are stacked against such an outcome, as the recent rally in stocks and bonds and the decline in the U.S. dollar have eased financial conditions in the economy for the first time since April. That has dented the Fed's effort to counter rampant price pressures in the economy with tighter credit standards.  ""There is a strong possibility that in the press conference Powell will be more hawkish and retighten financial conditions. For that reason, we could see a healthy short-term correction in crypto and all risk assets,"" Nauman Sheikh, head of treasury at crypto asset management firm Wave Financial, said.  Sheikh added that the market has run ahead of itself in pricing the so-called Fed pivot despite repeated warnings by the Fed that rates will remain ""higher for longer.""  Markets have been fighting the Fed since mid-2022, only to be met with a stern message by Fed officials. The recent decline in inflation expectations has only strengthened investor conviction that the central bank will soon end tightening and begin cutting rates later this year.  Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said financial conditions have loosened to a point where Powell may detail the extent of easing is ""unwarranted."" That would push risk assets, including tech stocks and crypto, lower.  ""At this juncture, it seems unlikely the Fed would want to appear dovish, so with the risk are for a hawkish Fed – albeit this is expected – and in a market where leverage funds are short USD (in the spot market), the risks are small skewed to USD upside, which by extension this means a lower Nasdaq and gold price,"" Weston noted in a weekly market update.  Caution has seeped into the market ahead of the Fed, boosting demand for short-duration put options or bearish bets.  ""Weekly puts are popular for block traders, but there is no record of far-month put options trading,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  Quick bull revival likely  The expected Powell-induced pullback could be short-lived, as the market has recently become resilient to hawkish Fed talk.  ""I expect the Fed to raise funds rate by 25bp (already priced in) and send out Powell to talk all hawkish, but a barking dog never bites,"" macro investor James Choi tweeted. ""Market is forward-looking, and it will start pricing in a ""PAUSE"" in March, in which by the time the S&P 500 will be at 4500.""  ""We wouldn't be at 4,000 and financial conditions this loose if the market believed Powell in the first place,"" Choi added.  Several Fed officials warned of higher rates early this month. Still, bitcoin managed to gain 40% this month, with more risky cryptocurrencies like gaming tokens staging bigger rallies.  The longer duration call-put skews, which measure the cost of bullish calls relative to puts, remain biased in favor of calls. ""The reason for this sentiment in the market is that a 25 bps rate hike is basically priced in, and investors are more inclined to believe that Powell's hawkish speech is a bluff,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/31/fed-preview-powell-to-trigger-healthy-pullback-in-bitcoin-experts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac59ed983fd540f0d5a969b8896cbe796ff7df59-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The London-based Archax and its new custody business are among the few offerings to have cleared the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) high bar for firms dealing in digital assets. All assets held in custody will be entirely segregated and “solvency-remote” from the exchange, said Archax, meaning that if the trading business did go bust, custodied assets would not be included in any bankruptcy proceedings.  “Events like FTX have highlighted the need for a more traditional approach to things,” said Archax Chief Marketing Officer Simon Barnby in an interview. “As an FCA-regulated custodian, we are permitted to hold cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets like funds or real estate, as well as traditional instruments and cash for our clients.”  The Archax custody service will further appeal to banks and big institutional customers by virtue of being partnered with Swiss multi-party computation (MPC) tech provider Metaco. The service will be rolled out using IBM Cloud, a battle-tested key security environment familiar to many of the world’s big banks.  “We wanted to find partners with the right expertise, particularly around the security of cryptographic keys, where we could use their technology but not outsource stuff, because the FCA requires us to be in control,” said Barnby.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/31/uk-crypto-exchange-archax-launches-fca-regulated-custody-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c25917810e232f247c09c1e431f02d99aae3f0b-1200x593.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

8551307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518087,1675160128,"Solana (SOL) Is The Biggest Opportunity This Cycle, Venture Capitalist Claims","Chris Burniske, a co-founder of Placeholder VC, a venture capital firm that invests in decentralized networks and Web3 services, laid out his bull case for Solana in a new episode of the Bankless Podcast. The analyst was one of the few Solana’s proponents who believed in the network’s potential, even after the FTX collapse and the SOL price crash to $8.05 on Dec. 29, 2022. In the podcast, Burniske reiterated his bullish stance for Solana as a network, as well as the SOL token and its price. Why Solana Is Having The Biggest Bull Case According to Burniske, Solana is at an early stage at this point, like Ethereum was in 2018. Even though Ethereum is currently “a much harder asset,” Solana is “on the path to harden its asset and will continue to do so.” When asked if the SOL token will follow a similar path as Ether, which has become a form of money with its decreasing supply, the analyst said: Yes. I expect an evolution. When I look at SOL’s inflation, and Placeholder has an internal tracker, it is 6% annually which is quite low from a yielding perspective for the people who are putting up capital. The reason for this is the current inflation of Solana to its peers. While ETH clearly tops the list with 0-1%, Solana ranks second with 6%, while other networks like Near with 20% and Avalanche with 22% have significantly higher inflation. Related Reading: What’s Next For Solana As Bulls Face Rejection At $25? “The reason why this is super relevant is that valuation of proof of stake assets finds their footing around those yield rates, and I am not denying that ETH has the best setup and it’s the most mature,” Burniske elaborated. He further explained, “But the lower the yield is that basically implies to me the lower risk the validators views the asset is having and so they will tolerate lower rates of inflation.” This is an indicator of the strength of the network. While other networks require inflation rates twice or three times as high to retain their validators, Solana requires much less monetary incentive. In terms of fees, only Ethereum can stand up to Solana as well. As Burniske elaborates, on a 24-hour basis, these are $15,000 for Solana, which is double that of Avalanche, triple that of Filecoin, and 6-7 times that of Cosmos Hub, with Ethereum, again boasting “100x” in fees, as the analyst acknowledged. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Rally Could Gather Pace above $30 One metric that Burniske didn’t mention, but is still very noteworthy, is daily active addresses. As the chart below shows, Solana ranks first with 451,200 daily active addresses, followed by Ethereum (373,200), Polygon (346,100), NEAR (64,700), Avalanche (39,900), and Aptos (15,000). Solana daily active users 450k Ethereum daily active users 373k pic.twitter.com/OP978Ig8Xg — Alex❓ (@ShiLLin_ViLLian) January 30, 2023 Is SOL Price Undervalued? Based on fundamental strength, Burniske believes Solana is the most undervalued ecosystem. The Placeholder VC co-founder explained that in every bear market, his company picks one or two assets and builds an “aircraft carrier strategy” around that ecosystem, and in the last bear market, it was ETH and Bitcoin. “What I mean by aircraft carrier is if you take Ethereum, we buy a bunch of the core ETH assets and then venture fund around it, to really get to know that ecosystem. And then you can pick the best teams,” Burniske explained and revealed that Cosmos and Solana are those two assets currently. Burniske also had a tip for the podcast’s listeners. While explaining that Solana’s venture stage valuations are right where Ethereum’s 2018/2019 valuations were, he revealed, “One that your user could check out is Tensor Trade, an NFT trading platform. Its closest analog would be Blur within Ethereum.” At press time, the SOL price stood $23.76, seeing a rejection at the crucial resistance level of $26.13.

42388140,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR7Nhf,1675160095,Hong Kong to Require Stablecoin Licensing as Early as This Year,"Hong Kong is set to demand mandatory licensing for stablecoin issuers and won't allow algorithmic stablecoins, its top financial regulator said on Tuesday. Entities conducting regulated activity in Hong Kong will have to obtain a license to operate stablecoin services.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) laid out its regulatory plans after receiving feedback on a discussion paper published last year. Based on the 58 responses it received, the regulator said it will set up a regime to supervise stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets.  To start with, the HKMA plans to supervise the governance, issuance and stabilization of fiat-backed stablecoins, for which issuers must maintain reserves matching the amount of the crypto in circulation. Stablecoin reserves have come under heavy regulatory scrutiny around the world since 2021, when the issuer of the top stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether, revealed much of its USDT reserves were made up of unsecured short-term debt. Major economies such as the U.S., the European Union and Japan also are working on controls for stablecoin issuers.  ""The value of the reserve assets of a stablecoin arrangement should meet the value of the outstanding stablecoins at all times,"" the report said. ""The reserve assets should be of high quality and high liquidity. Stablecoins that derive their value based on arbitrage or algorithm will not be accepted.""  TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin whose value was supposed to be maintained through another crypto asset, luna, collapsed last May.  ""In drawing up the specific regulatory arrangements, the HKMA will consider the feedback received, latest market development and international discussion. We will also engage with stakeholders and market participants. We expect to implement the regulatory arrangements in 2023/24,” HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said in a press statement.

In September, Shoba Pillay was asked by the court to offer an outside view of goings-on at the crypto lender, has now published an account of the firm’s operations in the runup to bankruptcy being declared in July.  “In every key respect – from how Celsius described its contract with its customers to the risks it took with their crypto assets – how Celsius ran its business differed significantly from what Celsius told its customers,” Pillay wrote, after interviewing staffers, including former Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky, as well as customers of and vendors to the company.  Promises of a community-led lending system offering lavish returns and financial freedom clashed with a reality where the company itself was largely creating the market in native token CEL, and wasn't open with customers about the risks they faced, Pillay said.  In April 2022, Celsius’ Coin Deployment Specialist Dean Tappen described Celsius’s practices as “very Ponzi like,” Pillay said, adding that staff were aware of the discrepancy between internal CEL mechanics and public pronouncements.  On June 12, Celsius paused customer withdrawals and had it not done so, “new customer deposits inevitably would have become the only liquid source of coins for Celsius to fund withdrawals,” Pillay said.  “In some instances, however, between June 9 and June 12, Celsius did directly use new customer deposits to fund customer withdrawal requests,” Pillay said – the usual definition of a Ponzi scheme, where promised returns can't be sustained from genuine market performance.  In other cases the arrangement was less direct, such as between May and June 2022 when the company had to unwind borrowing after crypto returns were insufficient to fund buybacks of its CEL.  “Celsius recognized that it should not use customer assets to purchase the coins necessary to cover liabilities to other customers,” Pillay said. “It justified its use of customer deposits to fill this hole in its balance sheet on the basis that it was not selling customer deposits but instead posting them as collateral to borrow the necessary coins.""  However, Pillay added, ""Celsius’ problems did not start in 2022. Rather, serious problems dated back to at least 2020, after Celsius started using customer assets to fund operational expenses and rewards.""  Another unnamed Celsius manager is quoted as saying “we spent all our cash paying execs and trying to prop up alexs [Mashinsky, sic] net worth in CEL token.”  Despite repeatedly saying he was not selling CEL, and despite employees internally saying the token’s true value was zero, Mashinsky sold 25 million tokens to the value of at least $68.7 million between 2018 and bankruptcy, Pillay said. Co-founders Nuke Goldstein and S. Daniel Leon are cited as making CEL sales valued at $2.8 million and $9.74 million respectively.  Pillay said Mashinsky’s claims to the media and on social media to “always have 200% collateral” were “far off the mark,"" with 14% of Celsius’ institutional loans wholly unsecured in December 2020. That figure rose to nearly 36% by mid-2021 – and even then some of the collateral was in unstable assets such as FTX’s FTT token, Pillay said.  “What Celsius and Mr. Mashinsky never did was correct the record after the fact for the thousands of live audience members who heard these misstatements or for those who watched the recorded videos on YouTube before they were edited,” Pillay said.  Pillay also uncovered “significant tax compliance deficiencies” in the company, saying that its mining arm may owe over $23.1 million in use taxes, and has reserved $3.7 million in liability in U.K. value-added tax.  The U.S. bankruptcy code allows the appointment of an independent examiner to examine allegations of fraud or mismanagement by a bankrupt company or its executives. Pillay is a former federal prosecutor and partner at law firm Jenner & Block.

Curve's 3pool is a liquidity base pool that provides crypto traders a capital-efficient means of swapping between the top three stablecoins – USDT, USDC and DAI.  3pool, also known as Tri-pool, started as a decentralized finance (DeFi) savings bank account during the 2021 bull run. Large traders parked their stablecoin holdings on the pool in return for an annualized percentage yield (APY). The APY comprises a share in trading fees and supplemental fee income via Curve's governance token CRV.  At press time, the seven-day moving average of 3pool's APY stood at 0.98%, or 250 basis points less than 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which stood at 3.54%, according to data sourced from DeFiLlama and crypto services provider Matrixport.  ""A year ago, the spread between treasury yields and stablecoins was negligible. Investors were indifferent in 'parking' their assets in either 'low' yield product. There was no opportunity cost,"" said Matrixport's head of strategy and research, Markus Thielen.  The 10-year yield has nearly doubled year on year, thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive liquidity tightening cycle. The central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate by 425 basis points to 4.25% in less than a year with interest rates expected to further rise to nearly 5% later this year.  Meanwhile, DeFI yield's have crashed from their lofty double-digits range in early 2021 as the liquidity-powered crypto bull market started running out of steam in mid-2022.  The dollar-pegged stablecoins and Treasury yields offered nearly similar yields at the beginning of 2022. At the time, analysts were optimistic that the Fed rate hikes would boost demand for all assets linked to the greenback, including stablecoins.  However, since August 2022, stablecoin yields have dropped relative to treasury yields, disapproving of the strategy of parking money into stablecoins.  The gap is unlikely to narrow in favor of stablecoins anytime soon, considering the Fed plans to lift the benchmark rate above 5% this year and keep it there for some time.  Prospects for the global economy are improving, according to the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The optimistic growth expectations are likely to keep longer-duration bond yields elevated.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/31/stablecoins-seem-unattractive-as-the-gap-between-3pools-apy-and-treasury-yields-widens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05f9c6ab1991d7e355028637a65a7226846b7cf2-1920x1920.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421966,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQz12,1675133732,Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals,"This month’s debut of the Ordinals protocol, which stores non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Bitcoin blockchain, is driving a wedge between Bitcoin purists who say the blockchain should be restricted to financial transactions, and those who see the network as large and versatile enough to host a range of use cases – even if that means meme-themed art.  Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor says the protocol uses “inscriptions,” or arbitrary content like text or images that can be added to sequentially numbered satoshis or “sats” – the smallest units in Bitcoin – to create unique “digital artifacts” that can be held and transferred across the Bitcoin network like any other sats.  Ordinals, in its current form, wouldn’t be possible without Bitcoin’s 2017 Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade and the more recent 2021 Taproot upgrade. SegWit helped scale Bitcoin by introducing a block field to hold “witness data” – signatures and public keys for Bitcoin transactions. Potential vulnerabilities forced developers to impose limits on the size of that data. When Taproot came along, it resolved those security concerns, allowing the old SegWit restrictions to be removed and paving the way for large chunks of NFT data to be stored on-chain. Turns out it’s the perfect foundation for Ordinals.  The new protocol has reignited an age-old debate on whether Bitcoin should be used for non-financial purposes. In 2010 the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, answered with a resounding “no.”  Long before Ordinals, a few old school Bitcoiners floated the idea of incorporating a domain name system (DNS) into Bitcoin. The project, dubbed BitDNS, was quickly shot down by Satoshi.  “Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale,” Satoshi wrote, sealing the fate of BitDNS, which eventually morphed into a separate chain called Namecoin.  With that as the backdrop, some members of the Bitcoin community are characterizing the NFT project as an “attack,” even as others move to embrace it.  “My response to that is, you know, Bitcoin isn't really for anything, it just exists.” Rodarmor explained. “It has really transcended the intentions of its creator.”  The protocol’s opponents argue that Ordinals will compete with traditional payment transactions by crowding blocks and driving up transaction fees. Rodarmor disagrees. “To that I say, well, there's this fee market pricing mechanism that bitcoin has, that lets people pay the amount of fees according to how valuable doing the transaction is to them,” Rodarmor told CoinDesk in an interview. “And that applies both to financial transactions and to inscriptions. And so, the fee market already handles what people pay for transactions, what they think they're worth and then miners just pick the transactions with the highest fees. So it all sort of fits into Bitcoin’s security and incentive model.”  Satoshi’s chiding didn’t settle the debate and two opposing schools of thought emerged – those who supported nonfinancial applications on Bitcoin and those who were against it.  Rodarmor has poured gasoline onto that fiery debate with the launch of Ordinals. “It’s also fair game for miners to censor the crap as a form of discouragement,” said Blockstream CEO and renowned Bitcoin cypherpunk, Adam Back, in a now deleted tweet.  He later posted: “We can recognize we can't really stop them and it's a free world with anonymous miners. But we can also educate and encourage developers who care about Bitcoin's use case to either not do that or do it in a prunable space-efficient e.g., time-stamp way.”  Others are in the hard-no camp. Longtime Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, told CoinDesk that Ordinals is an “attack” on Bitcoin.  On the other side of the debate, some thought leaders have embraced Ordinals, hailing it as a solution to the ever-decreasing Bitcoin block subsidy – the amount of bitcoin (BTC) a miner wins for solving a block.  “Ordinals = NFTs on Bitcoin. This is good for Bitcoin,” tweeted Bitcoin educator, Dan Held.  The Bitcoin subsidy – the amount of bitcoin awarded to a miner for successfully mining a new data block – gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The current subsidy is 6.25 BTC, which will be reduced to 3.125 BTC at block height 840,000 in 2024. As this amount gets increasingly smaller, miners will become more reliant on transaction fees.  If Ordinal inscriptions do indeed drive up competition for block space, the higher transaction fees may make it worthwhile for miners to continue securing the Bitcoin network, or so the theory goes.  Another Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd, says the hullabaloo might be all much ado about nothing.  “This freakout re: ordinals is stupid,” Todd tweeted. “You've always been able to embed as much data as you can pay for in BTC transactions. Taproot didn't change that.”  The surgeon and longtime Bitcoiner, Dennis Pourteaux, wrote a blog post laying out the connection between Taproot and Ordinals.  “Taproot made it basically so that the transaction size is unlimited,” Pourteaux told CoinDesk in an interview. “Save for that it must, of course, be smaller than a block itself.”  Pourteaux is a self-admitted NFT aficionado, but he isn’t taking sides in this debate. He believes the squabbling over Ordinals is a blessing in disguise for the Bitcoin community.  “That's how we keep Bitcoin safe,” Pourteaux said. “By having these technical debates and by putting the smartest minds together and figuring out next steps if any next steps are needed.”  As for Rodarmor, NFTs on Bitcoin are simply decentralized, permissionless fun.  “My vision is that Ordinals is a fun art project, and I hope that it encourages people to learn more about Bitcoin,” Rodarmor said. “To use Ordinals and to make inscriptions requires that you run your own full node. And so I hope that people get interested in running their own full nodes because I think that's good for Bitcoin. There's no sidechain, there's no token, there will never be a token. It just uses plain bitcoin.”  CORRECTION (03:54 UTC): Corrected Luke Dashjr’s last name in 13th paragraph.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/31/bitcoin-community-erupts-in-existential-debate-over-nft-project-ordinals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58bc13ba80ee915166ed3e054486ca10c291ba6c-5075x3505.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What's next?  Prices  By Sam Reynolds  Bitcoin-Tech Stock Correlation to Be Tested Again as Wall Street Kicks Off Earnings Season  Bitcoin and ether began the business day in Asia in the red, with the world’s largest digital asset by market value down just under 4% on the day to $22,795 and the latter down 4.8% to $1,568. Investors are eyeing a busy week in the U.S. with an underwhelming earnings week expected, as well as another interest rate hike.  “The Q4 earnings season for the S&P 500 continues to be subpar,"" wrote FactSet analyst John Butters in a note published earlier. ""While the number of S&P 500 companies reporting positive earnings surprises increased over the past week, the magnitude of these earnings surprises decreased during this time. Both metrics are still below their 5-year and 10-year averages.”  Refinitiv data shows that analysts expect S&P 500 earnings reported this week to decline 3%, with tech down 8.7%.  Investors are also looking to another – but smaller – interest rate hike this week, with the results of the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting coming out on Wednesday. Investors believe the Federal Reserve will hike rates by 25 basis points (bps) which would be the smallest rate increase in almost a year.  All of this continues to test the correlation bitcoin is reported to have with the stock market.  “There doesn’t seem to be any indication that crypto will stop moving in response to Fed policy decisions, though Ethereum’s upcoming Merge is one of the more important events in crypto’s recent history,” Riyad Carey, research analyst at Kaiko, told CoinDesk in a previously provided note.  Insights  Centralized Exchange Tokens Post Solid Gains in January Despite SEC Interest  By Sam Reynolds  The digital assets market is having a record January, and you’d be forgiven if you thought the bear market was over. Bitcoin is up nearly 40% since the beginning of the year, and ether has gained 30%, with altcoins also showing some strength.  Exchange tokens are also following this trend and have posted double-digit growth during the last month. Binance’s BNB, Crypto.com’s CRO and KuCoin’s KCS are all squarely in the green.  Normally this wouldn’t be much of a surprise because the rise of these tokens correlates with an increase in volume on exchanges. Right now, it’s a healthy, vibrant market and exchange token prices reflect this.  But this is forgetting what happened in the last days of December.  As part of a complaint filed against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) laid out the case as to why FTX’s former exchange token, FTT, is a security.  ""If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings,"" the SEC wrote in its complaint. ""The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.""  This could describe many – but not all – of the exchange tokens on the market. And because Ellison has signaled her intent to cooperate with law enforcement, the SEC’s claims were not contested. When this was unsealed in December, it should have been a day of reckoning for the exchange token sector.  OKX, for instance, specifically shies away from that description of its exchange token.  “The native token was never a big part of our business or treasury. Our native token was always designed to engage our most active customers and give them a way to seek discounts through activity on the platform,” is how an OKX executive described the token in an interview with CoinDesk.  The same can’t be said about Huobi, which CryptoQuant data shows is the exchange most reliant on its own token.  The market may have priced in the idea that the SEC might not be able to do a lot about how it thinks exchange tokens are securities.  Exchanges that offer these tokens don’t have much of a nexus to the U.S. They are located offshore, not run by Americans, and don’t allow U.S. residents on the platform.  But BitMex also thought it was safe from U.S. regulatory oversight by doing the same thing, and we all know how that turned out.

8530291,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518033,1675126819,"Bitcoin Spiked to $23,960, But Traders Are Not Very Greedy","Sentiment data reveals that the Bitcoin price upwards trend from November lows to as high as $23,960 on January 30 was marked by “sober” traders. Related Reading: Gala Games Plans for Mobile Gaming, GALA To Be The Primary Token Bitcoin Traders Are Not Greedy Per the Fear and Greed Index, the 40% surge of BTC prices to January highs is unlike other periods in the coin’s boom and bust cycle. When BTC rose to bottom-up from November lows following the FTX contagion, the Fear and Greed Index spiked to a maximum of “55”. Although this is still “Greed,” indicating a possible Fear of Missing out (FOMO) amongst traders, it is suppressed compared to the 2018 to 2019 cycle. By overlaying the sentiment index’s reading with BTC prices over months and years, it is clear that the spike to spot levels was approached with caution and even levels of risk management. Fear gripped the market in late 2018 when prices sank below $4,000. However, once prices began turning around ahead of the Bitcoin halving in 2019, traders doubled in droves, forcing the index reading to “69”, the Greed territory, from “21.” Even after a minor retracement, the index’s reading was persistently above the “60” mark throughout late Q4 2018 and H1 2019, pointing to general confidence by traders and investors. Sentiment and Bitcoin Correlation A big part of BTC’s price action is shaped by how market participants perceive prevailing market conditions. Hype can trigger demand, and prime volatility as billions of dollars pour into Bitcoin. The crypto space is new and still needs a regulatory framework. Crypto regulations are being developed and improved across the board. Complex products, including Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), may be approved months ahead. Whether they are given the go-ahead depends on the availability of monitoring tools aimed at preventing price manipulation. The former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Jay Clayton, cited the absence of sufficient monitoring tools as one of the reasons for rejecting the launch of an ETF tracking the spot price of Bitcoin. Traders are confident Bitcoin has turned the corner, shaking off the bears of November. However, considering the state of the general economy and inflation readings, BTC and crypto prices remain in a precarious position.

Buyers have stepped in the near year, with both spot Bitcoin and BITO rallying above key moving averages. I see more upside likely in crypto, and I highlight key levels for profit-taking. Toss all that out the window now. I see upside risks to crypto, and Bitcoin specifically. As it’s hard to gauge the true fundamental value of one token, I prefer to assess price action and the charts to see how investors should play Bitcoin. One way to play near-term moves in this crypto asset is to buy and sell the Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). According to ProShares , BITO offers a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin-linked returns with the liquidity and transparency of an ETF. I am not a big fan of the high 0.95% annual expense ratio, but the 30-day median bid/ask spread is just 8 basis points and tracking error is minimal. BITO is marketed as a diversifying asset for investors’ portfolios. As an alternative to conventional currencies, it still seems to be benefiting from a falling US dollar. Additionally, BITO can appreciate rapidly when the underlying assets rise. Finally, you do not have to move money to potentially risky exchanges or wallets since this ETF can be purchased through any major brokerage firm. Think of BITO as a commodity ETF that holds near-dated futures contracts. This vehicle is 35% invested in the March expiration CME Bitcoin futures contracts and 65% in the nearer-dated February expiration. BITO Holdings ProShares So, ProShares will have to roll out to later-dated contracts each month. That means when Bitcoin is in backwardation, it should benefit, while contango – when near-term contracts are priced relatively cheaply to later-dated contracts – works to the detriment of investors. Right now, the Bitcoin futures term structure is very flat, so I don’t see big risks there. CME Bitcoin Futures: Flat Term Structure CME Group The Technical Take Digging into the price action and momentum, I see bullish risks for a few reasons. First, notice in the long-term chart of Bitcoin itself below that the coin has risen above its falling 40-week moving average. Technicians like myself use the 40-week line as a proxy for the 200-day moving average. It helps gauge the trend’s direction and strength. Up 4 straight weeks to start the year, the low volatility action we saw to finish 2022 (after a steep fall in early November) appears to have been like a coil for this upward thrust. On the upside, $25k could be resistance but more likely $29k to $30k could be where sellers emerge. Bitcoin: Above Its 40-Week Moving Average (Finally) Stockcharts.com Homing in on BITO, there is more to like here. The chart below illustrates that bulls have grabbed the reins. Volume is high this year – mainly on up days – and the ETF is above its 200-day moving average for the first time in its history. Following a pair of bearish consolidations (a bear flag in early 2022 and a bearish rising wedge in Q3 last year), BITO found a floor under $10, and has now risen above the important $13 to $14 zone. I see resistance in the low $17s. With high RSI momentum holding, this rally has not been swift to be sold off – the last few days of tight ranges lead me to assert that another move-up is in the cards. BITO: Bullish Thrust On Volume, Next Resistance $17-$18 Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I like BITO for a bullish near-term play on Bitcoin. The fund shows solid volume trends and, along with the underlying asset, may be reversing the bearish trend.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573680-bito-playing-bitcoin-big-2023-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8529039.jpeg
42421961,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQyvU,1675124189,EthBoy NFT Painting Continues to Evolve With Fourth Edition,"EthBoy, the non-fungible token (NFT) painting of Vitalik Buterin in a harlequin suit, is minting another edition on Tuesday in celebration of the Ethereum co-founder’s birthday.  Trevor Jones, the artist behind the NFT collection, is releasing the fourth edition of the generative artwork done in the style of Pablo Picasso’s ""Paul as Harlequin."" The latest animated edition, titled TRANSCEND, was done in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning DJ Sasha and will be exhibited on Oxford Street in London.  The NFT is part of a larger collection titled ETHEREAL, in which Jones partnered with artists Alotta Money and DJ Don Diablo to release a new Ethboy iteration with NFT platform Async Art every six months over the next five years.  Async Art allows creators to make digital art that changes over time and responds to external data and stimuli. Each day, the painting changes due to factors such as the price of Ethereum, network gas fees and more. The latest edition, minted as a one-of-one, celebrates Buterin’s birthday on Jan. 31.  Jones said in a press release that the goal of the collection is to create a narrative tapestry of Buterin’s life.  “Many in the Web3 community think in terms of months rather than years and therefore this half-decade-long collaborative project will undoubtedly become a historic work of art and a grail for the 10 collectors and partners involved,” said Jones.  Jones told CoinDesk that since releasing the first chapter of the collection the NFT space has experienced a host of changes, including chilling market conditions and new digital art trends.  ""AI and generative art have been a hot topic in the last year, and open editions have made a huge comeback just recently, although there is still demand for 1/1 art and artists,"" said Jones. ""The collapse of FTX has had an impact of course, but the NFT art space itself is still vibrant and engaging.""  Jones partnered with artist Alotta Money to create the first edition of EthBoy in 2020, which sold for 260 ETH, worth $141,536 at the time.

SOL price moved smoothly from the $20 mark to $26, but the bulls got tired at $26, which caused the coin to dip 7.7% on the daily chart. Over the last week, SOL has noted no considerable price movement. The technical outlook for SOL indicated that the price was inclining toward bullish momentum. Demand for the altcoin was still upbeat despite a downward movement in the buying strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Touches New ATH Following 4.68% Adjustment Buyers still outnumber sellers on the chart. If demand remains consistently in the positive zone, the SOL might end up challenging the $26 mark. As Bitcoin travels into the $24,000 zone, altcoins can be expected to move upward. If buying pressure notes a downtick further, the coin can fall in value before it jumps back above the $26 mark. The market capitalization of SOL increased, which meant that demand was on the upside for Solana. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was trading at $23 at press time. The coin moved to the $26 mark, but the bulls gave up then. Since then, SOL has dropped below the $25 mark. Solana has to flip the resistance level into a support level; failing to do so, Solana might fall to the $20 level, as that was the altcoin’s nearest support line. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $26, allowing it to move close to $28. The amount of Solana traded in the last session was red, which indicated that the coin noted a fall in buying strength. Technical Analysis SOL has been in the overbought zone for some time now, and buyers continue to dominate the market despite a slight fall on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index was at 60, and despite the downtick, the indicator displayed that buyers exceeded sellers in the market. On that same note, the Solana price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. SOL was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line, indicating that the altcoin was still bullish. Demand and accumulation remained high on the chart, and the Chaikin Money Flow suggested the same. Chaikin Money Flow reads the capital inflows and outflows at a given time; the indicator was above the half-line, which meant that capital inflows were more than capital outflows.
