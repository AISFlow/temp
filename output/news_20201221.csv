42433418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfrh,1608586298,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dumps to $21.9K; ETH 2.0 Affected Ether Locked in DeFi,"After the past week’s record bitcoin volume for 2020, the price dipped on lower volume. Meanwhile, November’s dip in ether assets locked in DeFi can at least partially be attributed to the Ethereum network’s ambitious 2.0 upgrade.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $22,843 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 5.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $21,960-$24,081 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC near its 10-hour moving average and below the 50-hour on the hourly chart, a sideways-to-bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price rode a roller coaster up and down over the past 24 hours. After a steady run above $23,800 in early hours trading, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dumped as low as $21,960, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price recovered somewhat to $22,843 as of press time.      Lower-than-average volume led to a thinner-than-usual market Monday as many traders were likely staying on the sidelines with the holidays and new year quickly approaching.      “Trading activity is subdued. That doesn't motivate anyone to trade on Christmas week,” said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula.      After Dec. 17’s combined volume record $4.7 billion day across major exchanges Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit, Kraken and Poloniex, that figure was much lower, down to $2.5 billion as of press time Monday.      Despite this, big-time buyers in the over-the-counter market have helped keep bitcoin well above the $20,000 level, first breached back on December 16.      Read More: MicroStrategy Splurges On Another $650M in Latest Bitcoin Investment      “Real demand from largely price-insensitive institutional buying drove us into that level, and the resulting fireworks we saw on the break came from the leveraged side as roughly half the market's outstanding leveraged short positions were liquidated,” quant trading firm QCP wrote in an investor note Monday.      On derivatives venue BitMEX, over $44 million in sell liquidations, the crypto equivalent of a margin call, occurred, which put some pressure on the market for bitcoin to head lower. Sell liquidations are triggered when leveraged long positions start losing a significant portion of the money the buyer posted to place the trade.      “The $20,000 spot level ... is now our firm bull/bear line, with $16,000 as our strong support,” QCP Capital said in its investor note. “We are lightening up on selling puts up here, as this week brings our very well flagged Christmas expiry, which is now officially the largest OI on record.”      Open interest, or OI, is loaded up in the bitcoin options market for Dec. 25 expiration, according to data from aggregator Skew.      The overhang of options expiration and the declining activity in the spot market may be the largest dynamics to watch for the market in the next several weeks.

ETH Locked in DeFi rising from November trough    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) was down Monday, trading around $609 and slipping 7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Uniswap Is the Number One Gas Guzzler on Ethereum      The amount of ether “locked” in decentralized finance, or DeFi, for “yield” or a return in exchange for providing liquidity, hit a high of 9.4 million ETH on Oct. 20. In November, the amount of ether locked dipped as low as 6.7 million before rebounding in December, at over 7.2 million ETH as of press time.      Cooper Turley, editor of newsletter DeFi Rate, told CoinDesk that Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade dynamics, which also includes staking in the network, played a role in the amount of ether locked, dipping and then recovering somewhat. “People unlocked ETH to stake via [Eth 2.0] and trade it during the recent run-up,” Turley said. “Now that things have settled a bit, most that did not stake into [Eth 2.0] are depositing back into DeFi.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly red Monday.

42433416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQfjh,1608582658,Central Banks Had to Up Their Money Game This Year – And They Did,"This year, pandemic and all, central bank digital currencies (CBDC) got their 15 minutes of fame. In 2019, Facebook awakened central banks to the possibility of serious private competition. And although libra, now diem, remains a paper tiger, it’s not difficult to imagine other Big Tech firms joining the pack. Central banks had to up their monetary game – and so they did.      The end of this strange year is a good time to look at the state of play on CBDCs and revisit some fundamental questions, starting with the most basic: What is a CBDC? With so many definitions and models out there, it’s become harder (not easier) to understand what CBDC means. Here is a good starting point: a CBDC is a direct claim on the central bank. You own or hold something that was directly issued by the central bank, not by an intermediary.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views and opinions expressed here are his.    If your money doesn’t appear in the central bank’s balance sheet as a liability, it’s not a CBDC. As a result, when we hear about indirect or two-tiered or synthetic CBDCs, chances are that we’re not looking at the real thing. That doesn’t mean these models are irrelevant, it just means they are promoting something different from CBDCs.      In fact, most of these models were designed with one goal in mind: preventing CBDCs from being a radical departure from the current system. The major concern of central banks is that people would easily move from bank deposits to CBDCs during crises, increasing financial risk and disintermediating banks at the worst possible time.      See also: Coronavirus Driving Interest in CBDCs, Say Central Bank Chiefs      But as Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, recently said, the job of central banks “is not to protect banks’ business models; our job is to ensure that if banks’ business models change, we manage the financial and macroeconomic consequences of that.”      CBDCs are about more than making money digital. Nine out of 10 dollars used for savings and transfers are already digital, in the form of deposits held in checking and savings accounts. And this is a reality not only in the U.S. and European Union, but also in Brazil.      What’s new about CBDCs is creating the possibility for anyone to open a basic checking account at a central bank. Maybe we’ve been using the wrong name all along. Instead of “central bank digital currency” we should have been talking about “central bank accounts” – although CBACCT wouldn’t make for a great acronym.      Another relevant question when exploring the possibilities for CBDCs is, “Who needs them”? It’s not hard to find skeptics, even among central bankers, who believe the CBDC is a solution in search of a problem. Many will say, with good reason, that central banks aren’t made for providing retail services.    Central banks have been successfully operating and supervising complex technological infrastructures for decades.    Others will add that regular people won’t care if their money is deposited with the central bank or a commercial bank, as long as their account comes with deposit insurance. Most people may even fail to notice the difference between a CBDC and the money they already use for payments through their debit cards or PayPal and Venmo apps.      Brazil offers some good examples here. The combination of a thriving payments sector with the recent introduction of instant payments for retail customers is making it easier and cheaper to use payment services wherever and whenever needed. Things may improve further next year with the implementation of open banking, which should allow people to compare, choose and even mix financial services from different institutions.      How would a CBDC fit in this ecosystem, with several private options working just fine, from bank deposits to e-money? Central banks have at least one good reason to get ready for a CBDC. Picture a country where money and payments are controlled only by private institutions. Sure, private parties are good at innovating and moving fast. But once they dominate a market and crush the competition, they tend to raise the price of their products and services, leaving many customers behind.      However, in the increasingly digital world, not having access to digital money means not being a full citizen. The pandemic has made this even more evident. It’s true that a CBDC, by itself, won’t promote financial inclusion. Digital currencies will prove useless for those who don’t have regular access to smartphones, connectivity or even electricity.      See also: Marcelo Prates - 4 Myths About CBDCs Debunked      But if central banks don’t offer a secure, stable and inexpensive public option for digital money and payments, people and small businesses that cannot afford private digital currencies will end up deprived of an essential service in the modern economy.      More than that, we know all too well how this story of private parties providing essential monetary services ends. Last decade’s global financial crisis showed us how far governments needed to go to save private institutions offering services that are vital for everyone, like money and payments. These institutions will always be not only “too big” but “too important to fail,” in the words of Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England.      The third and final question relates to the technology of CBDCs. The general assumption is that central banks will use blockchain to launch a CBDC. This isn’t correct.      Central banks have been successfully operating and supervising complex technological infrastructures for decades, including the payments systems that facilitate the circulation of money in the economy. The case for central banks moving from their reliable centralized system to a blockchain isn’t clear-cut, especially because blockchain remains untested on a large scale for retail payments.      See also: Stanford Prof Darrell Duffie on Our Big Stablecoin Future      Much more important from a technological perspective is to find a way to have a CBDC that can be used and transferred offline without leading to double-spending or fraud. A reliable offline CBDC is the holy grail for central banks willing to go digital.      Again, a recent example from Brazil illustrates the practical relevance of this feature. Last month, a northern state in Brazil faced a power outage that lasted several days. Can you imagine living not only without electricity but without money because your digital currency only works online? Although still at an early stage, some promising hardware solutions for an offline CBDC have started to appear.      Here’s to a 2021 low on viruses and high on digital currencies.

Shenzhen, China-based mining firm Linzhi Inc. has begun rolling out a new Ethereum ASIC miner dubbed the Phoenix, reportedly three times more powerful than top options available today. As reported by CoinDesk, the journey to produce a more powerful and efficient Ethash ASIC miner was begun some two years ago by Chen Min, former CTO of mining giant Canaan.      Mining pool F2 Pool released a demo of the new machine on YouTube Saturday. The Phoenix outpaces the next best A10+ Pro at 2,600 megahashes per second MH/s to around 500 MH/s. Linzhi’s new machine is also more energy efficient clocking in at 3,000 watts per hour to the A10+ Pro’s 1,300 W, F2 Pool says.      “If you look back on CoinDesk reporting about Linzhi dating back to the first article in September, 2018, it's clear we had delays,” Linzhi Director of Operations Wolfgang Spraul told CoinDesk in an email. “Some due to underestimating the technology, then some due"" to the coronavirus pandemic.      Read more: Ethereum Fees Plummeted 65% in October Following DeFi Volumes Back to Earth      Spraul said the firm is rolling out pre-orders and limited quantities to “developers, community, pool operators, etc.” Innosilicon carries the A10+ Pro for about $4,440 per unit while Linzhi has yet to release a public price figure.    Scrapping Ethereum mining    The new product comes as the Ethereum network has begun a technical transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). That process began Dec. 1 with the launch of the Beacon Chain. That chain acts as a central conductor for the new blockchain network which uses coin deposits as a means of securing the network, called “staking,” over mining.      Read more: What Is Proof-of-Work?      Still, miners have at least a two-year runway with PoW on Ethereum. The current network, Eth 1.x, won’t be moved over to the new PoS blockchain until phase 1.5 of Eth 2.0.      The current Linzhi Phoenix demoed by F2 Pool will need at least one upgrade to stay useful before that transition, however.      The Ethereum network’s directed acyclic graph (DAG) – a component of Ethereum’s PoW algorithm called Ethash – stands at just under 4 gb, while each Linzhi Phoenix only has a 4.4 GB memory. The incumbent A10, on the other hand, can house between 6 and 8 gigabytes, F2 Pool says.      The Phoenix will need a bump in memory size or aftermarket components if it is not to become obsolete before phase 1.5. Spraul told CoinDesk in an email that the Phoenix miners currently rolling out are limited to quantities of pre-orders. The firm is “working on a successor with an increase in DAG memory – no specs yet,” he said.      Of course, other Ethash-based cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum Classic will still be using proof-of-work, meaning a market will still exist for the Phoenix even after Eth 2.0 phase 1.5.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/21/linzhi-begins-rollout-of-long-awaited-ethereum-miner-phoenix,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e4048f19550159f190e8fda24bb326b7e89e630-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433399,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQXJh,1608570900,Uniswap Is the Number One Gas Guzzler on Ethereum,"Decentralized exchange Uniswap is the number one gas burner on Ethereum. It has been responsible for close to 30% of all transactions initiated on the network in the last 8 hours.      Since as early as Nov. 13, Uniswap has consistently ranked as the top decentralized application (dapp) for the amount of fees used. The runner-up for this same time period, making up about 11% of total fees on Ethereum, is Tether, the company behind the eponymous dollar-pegged stablecoin that began to migrate its token supply onto Ethereum back in 2019.      Computational resources on Ethereum are measured in units of gas and paid for by users on the network in the native cryptocurrency ETH. Since the official debut of the second iteration of Uniswap in March, users have paid close to 240,000 ETH to use the dapp, which is equivalent to roughly $146 million at time of writing.      More specifically, users have been paying for the Uniswap router, which enables swaps between Ethereum-based tokens. There are two other known components to Uniswap and that is its token distributor and governance token, UNI. These components are less frequently interacted with by users and only make up about 1% and 3%, respectively, of the transaction activity generated by the Uniswap router.      See also: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home    Gas consumption highlights activity on Uniswap    As a decentralized exchange, Uniswap has created over 24,000 different markets for trading and attracts close to 100,000 weekly users. Given these figures, founder and CEO of Dune Analytics Fredrik Haga told CoinDesk he’s not surprised by the high gas consumption of the dapp in comparison to other DeFi applications on Ethereum.      “Trading is something many users do frequently and requires interactions all the time, while lending on the other hand (i.e. Maker/Compound) is more passive,” said Haga in an email.      While decentralized finance (DeFi) dapps like MakerDAO and Compound have higher amounts of total value locked (TVL) in their protocols, Uniswap takes the lead for the total amount of transactions initiated and gas consumed.      See also: Total Value Locked, A Proxy for Investor Interest      Additional metrics like gas consumed highlight how the activity of DeFi apps can be compared and ranked in different ways according to their use case.      Though TVL is the most popular metric for measuring the growth and activity of DeFi dapps, it often paints an incomplete picture of the myriad of ways DeFi is beginning to take off on Ethereum.      Ilya Abugov, lead analyst at DappRadar, said in an interview with CoinDesk in November:    “It’s very important to supplement TVL with as many additional metrics as possible. There’s been a tendency to see TVL as the metric [for DeFi], partially because it’s very elegant and simple. But that simplicity and elegance obscures some of the realities.”",NEUTRAL,ETH | UNI,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI | USDT,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/21/uniswap-is-the-number-one-gas-guzzler-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e01f1f53db4385ab7fbcf33085ab748775edd43-2093x1432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQX5h,1608569127,Bank of Russia Chair: Digital Ruble Is No Threat to Banks,"The Bank of Russia doesn't believe a digital ruble will hurt its banks.      Earlier this month, Russian banks warned the Bank of Russia that the digital ruble under discussion might weaken them if people pull their funds to rush into the new system. Introducing the digital ruble into Russia’s financial system might cost the country’s banks up to 25 billion rubles (~$34 million), according to Sber, Russia’s largest retail bank and the most vocal critic of the current approach to the central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The Bank of Russia’s chairwoman, Elvira Nabiullina, shrugged off these concerns during a press conference on Friday.      “We don’t see this [digital ruble launch] leading to any significant funds outflows or changes,” she said.      Last week, Sber calculated that banks might lose up to 4 trillion rubles (~$54 billion) in liquidity in the first three years once the project launched. As a result, the money-strapped banks would have to increase interest rates about half a percent and restrict loans for retail as well as small businesses.      Nabiullina was skeptical about this estimate, saying, “I’m not sure where these numbers are coming from,” and adding that interest rates would not be affected by the digital ruble but by inflation rates and general monetary policies.      “If for some reason, unrelated to the digital ruble, banks experience a liquidity shortage, we have tools to fix that,” Nabiullina said.    Protesting voices    Echoing Sber’s sentiment, the National Council of Financial Market (NCFM), the Russian banks’ trade group, said in its letter to the Bank of Russia this week that an outflow of money from banks to the digital ruble system would make banks less stable and more dependent on loans from the central bank. (CoinDesk read the letter.)      To prevent that, the NCFM recommends something similar to China’s digital yuan model, where the central bank would open digital ruble accounts for commercial banks, which will manage the digital rubles of retail users as part of their balance sheets.      A similar model has been proposed by Sber’s Popov during a recent Zoom conference with the Central Bank. However, the regulator did not seem open to this approach.      Russia’s financial regulator outlined the possible launch scenarios for the future central bank digital currency (CBDC) a few months ago in an analytical report. Most of these scenarios scare the country’s banks, the public discussion shows.      The Bank of Russia seemingly favors a centralized model in which the regulator will be the administrator of the system and the banks will help onboard users, which the banks don’t like.      In an open Zoom call with the regulator, several of Russia’s financial institutions voiced concerns that banks will be obliged to use their own budgets to integrate the digital ruble system and get no business upside. Further, the Bank of Russia could become a new government-backed mega-bank, while other banks will have to compete with it for Russian people’s money.    A ‘strong hand’ approach    The Bank of Russia’s report does not really explain why the country might need a CBDC at all, says Vladislav Martynov, adviser to the Russian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association (RAKIB). He is also a member of the Ethereum Foundation and one of the earliest blockchain advocates in the country.      “The Bank of Russia would prefer not to bother about the digital ruble too much, but there is a movement [of CBDCs] around the world, central banks are working on concepts and the Bank of Russia can’t just sit around doing nothing,” Martynov said.      In these circumstances, the regulator viewed the launch of a CBDC as a chance to consolidate yet more power in the Central Bank, Martynov believes.      “The spirit of the published report is very conservative: it’s about creating a new powerful monopoly, a new state bank that will be dominating the market while the role of commercial banks will be diminished” he said, referring to the Bank of Russia being a single administrator of digital rubles.      Another concern is that digital ruble adoption will be forced through in a top-down way, and government-controlled companies will be obliged to use it. Previously, this happened to the National Card Payment System (NSPK), Russia’s homegrown alternative to Visa and Mastercard.      NSPK was created in order to keep the Russian economy going in case a new round of sanctions cut the country off from global payment networks – a threat that felt real several years ago. State-owned companies were obliged to issue NSPK cards, called Mir, to their employees.      “We saw how the Mir cards were forcibly rolled out,” Martynov said. “So if they set a goal to [to roll out the digital ruble], they will see it achieved."" He added that the Bank of Russia, apparently, wants to get as many people using the digital ruble as possible.      A forced “mass adoption” of the digital ruble might become as disastrous for Russia as the enormous experiments of the USSR, like the nation-wide anti-alcohol campaign by Mikhail Gorbachev or the river reversal project, Martynov believes.      To be sure, the regulator hasn’t yet decided if the digital ruble will even happen at all. Since publishing the report, the Central Bank has been gathering public feedback, and will do so until Dec. 31. Nabiullina previously said that if the regulator does decide to continue with the CBDC, the first pilot might take place at the end of next year.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/21/bank-of-russia-chair-digital-ruble-is-no-threat-to-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94b7cff0e495c9198dfc1e0a557d8dfefb6143f9-1440x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It's estimated that 230,000 BitGrail users lost funds in the breaches, which targeted the platform's stores of the nano cryptocurrency, as reported by Reuters.  The police said the perpetrator, a 34-year-old man from Florence named only as ""F.F."", is either behind the breaches or took no action to prevent them after the first attack came to light.  “It is not yet clear whether he participated actively in the theft or if he simply decided not to increase security measures after discovering it,” Ivano Gabrielli, director of the national centre for cyber crimes, said in Reuters' report.  While in February 2018, F.F. contacted the Italian police to report the first hack, Italian authorities said it would have been simple to avoid later hacks, but instead, he ""knowingly failed to prevent them.”  The accused man faces charges of computer fraud, fraudulent bankruptcy and money-laundering.

Companies can keep getting bigger and more profitable so long as the cost and complexity of managing a process internally is lower than the cost of assembling the same pieces on the open market from multiple different suppliers.      The transaction costs that Coase talks about are not the simple matter of swiping a credit card. They involve the true cost of negotiating agreements and implementing them, tying together business rules, payments and covering the terms of an exchange between parties. Cutting a check or sending a wire transfer costs just pennies. Negotiating and implementing business agreements costs thousands of dollars. Blockchain champions who think the future is just about low-cost money transfers are missing a big part of the vision and transformative power of this technology.

Nearly every European country had its own national champion, not to mention Nortel in Canada and AT&T in the U.S. Today, that same market is dominated by just a handful of global firms including Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung. That pattern repeats itself across nearly all the world’s biggest industries.      In every case, IT has made it possible to organize companies on a larger scale and to replace individual variability in implementing processes with a systematic approach to shared information across geographic boundaries. It has also made it possible to gather and aggregate demand and flows of money into vast centralized funding pools that support enormous capital expenditures.      The installed base of the industrialized world’s electricity and transport infrastructure alone is worth trillions of dollars, and it was all funded by taking just a few cents from each consumer’s electricity bill or gas tank at a time.    Two public blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have each, in their own way, become the dominant architectures.    Information technology was essential in managing that river of pennies to fund industrial development because within an organization, under centralized control, the cost of transactions could be kept very low.      The New York Central Railroad, struggling under the weight of four million annual logistics invoices, became the second commercial customer for a Hollerith Punch Card Tabulating machine from the company that would, in time, become known as IBM. Customer Information and Control System (CICS) was the first large-scale mainframe transaction processing system, and it was developed by IBM to help electric utility companies manage their customer billing.      Blockchains will transform global commerce because they are going to change the cost of transactions between firms. When that happens, firms and finance will unbundle themselves. In 2020, all the paths towards this future suddenly accelerated. I count five particularly important milestones in acceptance and development this year:    Digital assets    The first has been a ramp-up in mainstream comfort with digital assets. From China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) program to capital allocation decisions by Square and MicroStrategy, governments, enterprises and capital markets all took big steps forward this year. It’s estimated that PayPal and Square alone, in choosing to offer bitcoin to their users, are buying up more bitcoin than the entire mining process is producing this year. Expect the range of those assets to rapidly expand in 2021, both in the number of companies and governments engaged as well as the type of assets.    Regulatory frameworks    Secondly, regulatory frameworks are maturing in a way that further supports rapid acceleration. The European Crypto Framework, released in September, is a strong positive step. The Bank of England’s decision to build a regulatory framework around digital tokens based on fiat currencies is likely to be especially impactful because these fiat-based/fiat-backed stable-coins are now the most popular digital assets in use by both individuals and enterprises.      Most importantly, the industry’s ecosystems and technology choices are starting to converge. In particular, it’s increasingly clear that two public blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have each, in their own way, become the dominant architectures. Bitcoin has a market cap that exceeds the next twenty combined. Ethereum has more developers and users than all the others combined.      This is a completely normal and expected development, at least if you are a student of the history of technology. The internet itself followed this path, with early users preferring the comfortable walled gardens of AOL and Compuserve or private enterprise networks.    Dominant architectures    As usage widened and security tools matured, the power and value of the public internet overwhelmed the world of walled gardens and private networks. Bitcoin and Ethereum both have tens of millions of users, thousands of nodes and millions of developers. The largest private blockchains have dozens of nodes, at best.      In the last few years alone, thousands of startups focused on those ecosystems have been funded. These are orders of magnitude more diverse and vibrant ecosystems than any private blockchain environment. With the arrival of enterprise-grade privacy tools like Baseline Protocol (which uses Nightfall privacy technology that EY developed and donated into the public domain) enterprises can now use the public Ethereum blockchain and do so for a fraction of the cost of building a private network.      I often compare this to the choice companies had between software-based Virtual Private Networks that ran over the internet or actually building a private leased-line network. The cost- and time-to value differentials are staggering.      Private blockchains and their related companies and services are not going to disappear overnight. Netscape arrived in 1994 and the future of the web was immediately visible, but not everyone got on board right away. The AOL user base didn’t peak until 2002. Technology decisions have powerful inertia and take years to adjust, particularly in the enterprise, even if the endgame looks very clear.    DeFi    The final big milestone of 2020 has been the acceleration and expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi). As novel as DeFi seems to be, it is, in fact, just the logical extension of how blockchains are supposed to work. Blockchains like Ethereum are designed for the creation of programmable digital assets. Until recently, the level of maturity in these smart contracts was very low. The smart, in smart contracts, often consisted of little more than managing the supply of tokens and list of owners.      With DeFi, suddenly there was real programmability. Smart Contracts could execute functions like loans and insurance, holding assets for others and actually doing things with them and being linked through oracles like Chainlink to the outside world. The total value of assets being used in the programmable frameworks has risen by factor of more than 20 this year, and while it is still a drop in the overall financial ocean, this is now a large enough amount of money to start attracting serious engineering talent into this space.    Rainstorms over rivers    Transaction costs between companies have always been much higher than those within companies. Common information systems, common leadership and a degree of internal trust make it possible for large enterprises to assemble solutions internally at scale. Externally, things get harder because not only is there a lack of trust but there is also no continuity of information systems, business process and rules across company boundaries. The result is a loosely coupled environment with lots of redundant (and expensive) verification.      Blockchains change this model because they hold out the potential for transactions between companies to converge closely in cost and speed with those internally. This kind of as-close-as-being-in-the-same-company integration already exists without blockchains but it is very costly and is only done on a bespoke basis between enterprises that already have long standing and deep ties, often in cases with a big power imbalance as well (big company tells weaker supplier to join its network). That’s a very small minority of business relationships.      Blockchains drive standardization and interoperability: Tokenization will turn just about every form of asset transfer and data transfer into an inter-operable standard. Smart contracts will do the same for business process and logic. Companies will have the ability to add or subtract suppliers easily and even small businesses will be able to move in sync with enormous global networks because they are all linked into a common set of tools and processes.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work      This year is seeing the very first small steps of this approach taking shape, with the arrival of DeFi and business applications on the public Ethereum blockchain. At first, you can expect much of this to be a re-creation of traditional enterprise processes, but now faster and cheaper on the blockchain. EY and Microsoft managed to cut cycle time for contract management using a blockchain by 99%, so there’s lots of fat to cut.      Inevitably, however, innovators will move on from recreating to re-arranging the Lego blocks of finance and operations and, in so doing, they will start to unpack the traditional model of the enterprise. If working with external partners is just as easy as internal ones, the minimum economic scale of many companies starts to drop a great deal. This is not a new pattern either: In my time at IBM, we found that digital manufacturing technologies like 3D printing were already starting to cut the minimum economic scale for manufacturing in some industries by as much as 90%.      If you can use a blockchain to get a 1,000 small suppliers to work as efficiently as a 100 big machines in a centralized factory, do you need to aggregate revenue from millions of customers into a massive, centralized store of capital to fund a huge factory? Probably not.      Won’t decentralized financing go nicely with decentralized infrastructure? A shower of pennies across a wide range of small companies that are linked on the blockchain may be just as useful as aggregating them into a river of capital. What does the model of the firm look like when the corner store can compete with the biggest hypermarket on price?    The past is not our future    As disruptive as this year has been, and as transformational as blockchain technology is set to be, the future is not the same as the past. The immense diversity of local and regional enterprises in the past existed in part because information systems did not support global operations, not simply because it was nice to have local companies serving local clients. In the future, much of that business ecosystem diversity will revive, but it will not simply be replication of what came before, because it will be possible to serve small market segments globally without needing an enormous production scale. Whatever the future model looks like, we will look back on 2020 and see it as the starting point.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/21/public-blockchains-are-set-to-reshape-global-commerce-2020-was-the-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bf221485c2b2028f2b52da22720203615116566-1200x871.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQWvh,1608563008,India's State-Led Payment Network Is Growing. Now Nation Wants to Export It,"A surge in e-commerce and declining cash usage during the COVID-19 pandemic have boosted India's state-led shared payments infrastructure.      According to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the nation will have processed over $425 billion in commerce by the end of this year. Emboldened by growth and eyeing expansion, the United Payments Interface’s (UPI) umbrella organization is thinking about exporting the model to other countries.    Developed under state guidance and regulated by the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, the payments interface began as part of the larger India Stackhttps://www.indiastack.org/about/ project, which pooled application programming interfaces (APIs) that could be used by public and private actors to build digital infrastructure.    While UPI is one of the prominent applications of the stack, other services include a unique biometric ID system, known as Aadhar, and electronic document storage.      UPI enables both digital payments and peer-to-peer transfers for 200 banks that are part of the network, and for payment processors such as GooglePay. Put simply, UPI resembles a personal digital wallet that can be used to access and move around money from bank accounts. E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have both integrated UPI, allowing residents to pay for goods directly using the platform.      This interoperability is a key part of the pitch being made by the National Payments Corporation of India, the umbrella rule-making body for UPI, in favor of exporting the payments model.      “We have started engaging with people overseas and the response has been very positive,” said Ritesh Shukla, CEO of NPCI’s international expansion subsidiary, speaking at a recent tech summit organized by Carnegie India and co-hosted by India's Ministry of External Affairs. He added that the organization hopes to create an international product similar to UPI over the next couple of years.    See also: India’s State-Regulated Digital Payments Network Is Dominated by Google and Walmart    While Shukla didn’t name any countries involved in the discussions, Bhutan launched a debit card tied to a similar network last month.      According to Shukla, NPCI’s approach to the export is likely to be two-pronged: It would help countries that do not have an existing payments system to build one, while for countries that already have some form of existing payments network NPCI would help them upgrade it until it more closely resembles the UPI with respect to inter-bank operability.      “You talked earlier about whether there will ever be another M-Pesa in Kenya, and this to me has the potential,” said Victor Malu, head of future financial systems at FSD Kenya, during the conference.      M-Pesa was rolled out in 2007 by Kenyan telecom provider Safaricom and offered people an alternate way to transfer money using text messages. Seen as one of the earlier steps towards financial inclusion through digitisation, M-Pesa is similar to Venmo but doesn’t require a bank account.      M-Pesa has about 24.5 million users in Kenya alone. But at the same time services like M-Pesa, and even bank accounts, are company-specific and can present hurdles when a user wants to move money from, for instance, a mobile account to bank account.      But before UPI can go abroad, some problems need to be sorted out. As the volume of digital payments jumped in India under COVID-19 restrictions, the network’s servers also began to feel the heat. According to NPCI data, the State Bank of India (SBI), which processes the largest chunk of UPI transactions, had a failure rate of 5.31% for the 510 million transactions it processed in September. These failures were due to technical issues.      Keeping UPI going when activity spikes also requires Indian banks to upgrade their back-end infrastructure. The UPI system gives banks little incentive to invest in improving the system because they don’t earn anything from the mostly small-ticket expenditures made using the service.      In the absence of architecture to reliably process transactions and the missing economic incentive for banks to build one, the payment network could run into adoption hurdles. If unresolved, these issues could also make it harder for the NPCI to export the network.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/21/indias-state-led-payment-network-is-growing-now-nation-wants-to-export-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16920467d131ef2f119fad73e2d00194bda552f4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQXNh,1608561972,"First Mover: As Markets Turn Ugly, Bitcoiners Thank Secular Trend","Bitcoin was lower for a second day, retreating following an eight-day streak of gains that was the longest since June 2019.      ""A period of consolidation could be beneficial,"" Simon Peters, an analyst for the trading platform eToro, wrote early Monday in an email, ""allowing things to stabilize and cool down.""      In traditional markets, European shares fell the most since June as an apparent mutant strain of the coronavirus in the U.K. led the Netherlands, Belgium and France to impose border closures. U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open, even after U.S. lawmakers agreed on a new $900B stimulus deal. Crude oil fell nearly 6%. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,870.67 an ounce.    Market moves    (Editor’s note: This is the sixth and final installment of First Mover’s recap of how the bitcoin market evolved over the course of 2020 and what it means for the future. Today we cover the period from October through December, when big investors and Wall Street firms suddenly started touting bitcoin as a hedge against central-bank money-printing, causing prices to double and reach a new all-time high.)      Bitcoin proponents have tried myriad strategies over the cryptocurrency's 11-year history to pitch it to prospective buyers.      Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency's inventor, designed Bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer electronic payments system outside the control of any person, company or government. For a while, some cryptocurrency analysts positioned bitcoin as a ""safe haven"" asset that would hold its value in times of deep economic dislocation and market turmoil. That proposition was dashed in March, when the initial global spread of the coronavirus sent global markets reeling, and bitcoin plunged 25% over the course of the month.      What ultimately proved to be bitcoin's breakthrough was big investors' adoption of the cryptocurrency's potential use as a hedge against central-bank money printing and the debasement of the dollar. The thesis derives from the hard-coded limits on bitcoin's supply, as programmed into the underlying blockchain network; unlike government currencies that can be issued subjectively and at will by central bankers, only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created.      As of early October, bitcoin prices were trading around $10,800, up 50% on the year. It was already an impressive gain, especially during a year when the global economy had suffered the worst contraction since the Great Depression. U.S. stocks were up 4%.      Despite the outperformance, bitcoin analysts were still bullish. The blockchain network was growing, brokers cited continuing interest from buyers, positive-looking patterns were forming in price charts, options markets were hinting at further gains, the dollar was weakening in foreign-exchange markets, and there were few signs that governments and central banks would curtail the seemingly endless flow of stimulus money anytime soon.      Yet, as of early October, few traders were betting that prices would more than double over the next three months, blowing past $20,000 to a new all-time high.                  And then, almost as if a gate were opened, big corporations and money managers started to pile into bitcoin, accompanied by a flurry of recommendations from once-skeptical Wall Street analysts.      MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor shifted at least $425 million of his company's corporate treasury into bitcoin. Square, the payments company, said it would put some $50 million, or 1% of its assets, into the cryptocurrency. PayPal, another payments company, announced it would allow 346 million customers to hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and to use the digital assets to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network.      “It’s the sheer scale of PayPal’s reach that is attracting the headlines,” Jason Deane, an analyst for the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote in a report in late October. “This could well go down in history as a watershed moment, the point at which bitcoin goes properly mainstream.”      Analysts with JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon had famously called bitcoin a ""fraud"" in 2017, wrote that the cryptocurrency had ""considerable"" price upside. “Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from here,” they wrote.      Additional endorsements would flow over the coming months from the hedge-fund legend Stanley Druckenmiller, money managers SkyBridge Capital and AllianceBernstein, brokerage firm BTIG and life-insurance company MassMutual. Wells Fargo, the big U.S. bank, published a 2021 investment outlook with a full page discussing bitcoin's big gains, even though executives said customers weren't allowed to buy it in their accounts due to regulatory uncertainty.      ""I think cryptocurrency's here to stay,"" Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for the big mutual-fund company BlackRock, told CNBC on Nov. 20.      Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election reinforced investors' belief that government stimulus money would continue for the foreseeable future, since the candidate had pledged to push for at least $5 trillion of new spending initiatives from education to housing, health care and infrastructure.      In December, the Federal Reserve adopted ""qualitative"" guidance for its $120-billion-a-month of asset purchases – a form of monetary stimulus that relies on money printing. The move gave policy makers additional flexibility to continue the program as long as they deemed fit.      Prices for bitcoin shot past $20,000 on Dec. 16, setting a new price record, and within days had surpassed $23,000. As of late Sunday, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $23,642.      ""Bitcoin has graduated from 'digital assets playground' to 'mainstream global investment,'"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for the cryptocurrency firm Arca Funds, wrote Saturday in a column for CoinDesk. ""Investors now have the knowledge and means to buy bitcoin themselves, and we are seeing it in real-time, which happened quicker than we anticipated.""      What comes next? Analysts are still bullish.      Dan Morehead, CEO for the cryptocurrency-focused money manager Pantera, recently cited a formula that projects a price of $115,000 by next August. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer for the Wall Street firm Guggenheim, predicted bitcoin could go to $400,000.      The cryptocurrency investment firm NYDIG published an analysis arguing that the Bitcoin network's growth could justify prices in the range of $51,611 to $118,544 in five years. Kraken Intelligence, a research unit of the digital-asset exchange Kraken, published results of a survey noting that clients expect an average bitcoin price of $36,602 in 2021.      Even the Kraken customers' comparatively modest prediction would represent a 55% gain from current price levels. That could mean bitcoin outperforms again in 2021, with Wall Street analysts on average predicting a 9% return for U.S. stocks next year.      A once-in-a-generation calamity like the coronavirus was bound to create extreme gyrations in global markets, with some assets proving big winners and some losing big. (Remember ""The Big Short""?)      The final few months of 2020 validated some investors' bets that the economy wouldn't return to its former strength anytime soon, and that trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus, from governments and central banks around the world, would be needed on an ongoing basis to nurse any recovery.      In hindsight, bitcoin was the biggest winner from that trade.      “The current macroeconomic environment is set up perfectly for an asset that blends the benefits of technology and gold,” the U.K. money manager Ruffer Investment said in a recent portfolio update, after confirming a bitcoin purchase worth more than $745 million. “Negative interest rates, extreme monetary policy, ballooning public debt, dissatisfaction with governments – all provide powerful tailwinds.""      Bitcoin marketers couldn't ask for a more compelling selling point. As if this year's 225% year-to-date price gains weren't compelling enough.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    (Editor's Note: CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, who writes Bitcoin Watch, is off this week.)

Tezos Israel said in a press release Monday that the hardware security modules, developed in partnership with Hub Security, will allow validators (also known as ""bakers"") to store their private keys in a secure cloud or in a separate physical unit, avoiding theft and network disruptions.  Network validators must stake large amounts of cryptocurrency – that is, lock in funds a period of time – to qualify to validate the network. This approach requires ""rigorous security,"" said Eyal Moshe, CEO of Hub Security.  A kind of server, the new device is powered by a mini hardware security module (HSM) that acts as the user's ""remote control"" and software that allows ""bank-level"" two-factor authentication, according to the release.  It is said to offer bakers a better alternative to cryptocurrency hardware wallets, which need to be physically connected to the computers running the network.

Flexa is on a mission to bring crypto straight to merchants with its SPEDN digital wallet. The app allows users to spend multiple cryptocurrencies for point-of-sale purchases at merchants such as Nordstrom, Barnes & Noble, Express or Lowe’s.      Flexa's private sale of its AMP token ended Nov. 20. Newly disclosed players include Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner’s Robot Ventures II, Starwood Capital founder Barry Sternlicht, AlpInvest founder Volkert Doeksen and Innopay founder Douwe Lycklama.      Flexa has taken a merchant-first approach to bringing crypto payments mainstream, Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk in a Zoom interview. The startup plans on gradually decentralizing its wallet service while providing more centralized software solutions for merchant partners, Spalding said.      Read more: 'Crypto Stripe' Flexa Raises $14 Million so You Can Buy Coffee With Bitcoin  “[Crypto] is outside the core payment flow, which is why you don’t see Target or Walmart or Home Depot or these other guys accepting this stuff, because it's not a part of what they really do. We’ve been building this with merchants from the very beginning,” Spalding said.    Flexa converts FXC to AMP    The now out-of-favor Flexacoin (FXC) – sold in 2018 and 2019 private funding rounds – is being swapped for AMP in light of an upgrade to the payment network’s backend, he said. Flexacoin holders can migrate to the new token on a one-to-one basis through the official portal. Spalding said FXC was often mistaken for a payment token itself; the ERC-20 style token is merely infrastructure for the Flexa Network.      The new model allows “conditional” staking of AMP tokens for collateral management without requiring they be transferred from the original address. The network includes a function, transferByApproval, that allows for more dynamic collateral governance of external accounts. Spalding claims the function is a novel Ethereum address feature necessitating the token swap. The project’s code was audited by Trail of Bits and ConsenSys Diligence.      “Partition strategies can be used to systematically grant controller-like permissions to various actors in the ecosystem. This enables the AMP contract to execute common implementation situations for collateral managers,” a new technical paper shown early to CoinDesk states.      The crypto payments provider is also releasing the Flexa software as an open-source SDK in January, Spalding said.

FHE is an emerging technology – often described as the ""holy grail"" of encryption – designed to allow data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in cloud or third-party environments.  IBM said last week its new service, developed in-house, will allow clients to start experimenting with technology to improve the privacy of their internal IT architectures.  “While current encryption techniques allow data to be protected during storage and in transit, data must be decrypted while it is being processed or analyzed – creating a window of opportunity where data is more vulnerable to theft or exposure,” said IBM.  Data leaks have become a major issue for enterprises. One making headlines this week saw personal details of clients of cryptocurrency hardware wallet maker Ledger exposed on an online forum.  Research and advisory company, Gartner predicts that by 2025 at least 20% of businesses will be budgeting for programs that require homomorphic encryption, up from less than 1% currently.

42433380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQWph,1608552010,Puerto Rico-Based FV Bank to Offer Regulated Crypto Custody in the US,"A Puerto Rico-based digital challenger bank is launching a custody service for digital assets, offering clients the chance to securely store and exchange major cryptocurrencies from early 2021.      FV Bank (which stands for fintech ventures) announced Monday it has received permission from the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions (OCIF) to provide custody services for bitcoin, ether, EOS, XRP, and ""many"" ERC-20 standard tokens. It will also allow ""seamless exchange to fiat [currency],"" according to a statement.      “We are targeting going live in Q1 2021,” an FV Bank representative told CoinDesk via email.      Almost as if the stars were aligned, banks like DBS, BBVA and Standard Chartered have recently been making announcements about providing digital-asset services, perfectly timed with the price of bitcoin reaching all-time highs.    See also: The Big Banks Positioned to Ride Bitcoin’s Bull Run    An announcement earlier this year by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) opened the door for U.S. banks to take custody of digital assets. This presented an opportunity for firms like FV Bank, a nimble innovator originally set up to provide U.S. banking services to fintech companies.      “When the OCC came out with their opinion back in July, we saw that as an opening and went to our regulator and sought clarification and permission as a bank to provide custodial services to our customers,” FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini said in an interview. “Our goal is to allow anyone, from an individual to an institution, to custody their digital assets and also have seamless banking services related to that custody.”    See also: Following OCC Letter, Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services    Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States with its own financial regulatory body, the OCIF. But all laws for banking and insurance in the jurisdiction are based on U.S. laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Because Puerto Rico is part of the U.S. banking system, this allows FV Bank to hold a master account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.      Paschini said FV Bank has chosen a custody tech infrastructure partner, but its name has not been made public yet. In terms of liquidity, he said the bank will be working with several large over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading desks.      FV Bank’s regulated custody offering, which uses a technique called multi-party-computation (MPC) to protect private cryptographic keys, also comes with $20 million worth of insurance cover, sourced from the Lloyd’s of London market.

Such a drop in flows into the largest bitcoin fund would increase the likelihood of a price correction similar to the one seen in the second half of 2019, according to a note from the bank's quantitative strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, as reported by Bloomberg Monday.  The digital asset manager's bitcoin inflows “are too big to allow any position unwinding by momentum traders to create sustained negative price dynamics,” the strategists said.  They stopped short of saying bitcoin is overbought after the cryptocurrency soared to consecutive record highs in recent weeks.  The most recent data tweeted by Grayscale Investments showed the firm reached $15.5 billion in cryptocurrency assets under management on Dec. 18 – up $2 billion in less than a month. Its Bitcoin Trust is now worth over $13 billion of that total.  Bitcoin hit a new record price of $24,273 on Sunday. At the time of publication, prices were lower at around $23,450.  New York-based Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.

42433392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQX3h,1608525131,Why Ledger Kept All That Customer Data in the First Place,"First, the good news, in a manner of speaking: Ledger customers can now see firsthand whether their personal information was exposed in the hack discovered in July.      Someone posted the complete lists of 1 million email addresses and 272,000 names, mailing addresses and phone numbers belonging to customers of the France-based maker of hardware cryptocurrency wallets. The latter list is a lot bigger than the number previously disclosed by Ledger (9,500).      Asked about the discrepancy, a Ledger spokesperson said: ""At the time of the incident, logs from a third-party application managing our database showed 9,500 individuals were impacted. Simultaneously, we were working with an external security organization to conduct a forensic review, which also confirmed 9,500 people."" In an email sent to customers later Monday, Ledger said the details in the list of 272,000 ""are not available in the logs that we were able to analyse."" Customers whose information was in that list will be notified by email within 24 hours, the company said.      “It is a massive understatement to say we sincerely regret this situation. We take privacy extremely seriously,” Ledger said in a tweet storm Sunday. “Avoiding situations like this are a top priority for our entire company, and we have learned valuable lessons from this situation.” Among other steps, Ledger has hired a new chief information security officer and taken down 170 phishing sites since the breach, it said.      There are at least three file-sharing sites, reminiscent of the golden age of MP3 blogs, where you can download the two lists. I will not post the links but it took just a few minutes searching Twitter to find them.      If you download the trove, please check for your own details, then delete it. If you keep the file, gawk at the names or gossip with friends about it, well, I’ll be very disappointed.      Several of the email addresses in the data leak match those that received phishing emails from scammers seeking to defraud CoinDesk readers.      As we reported in July, these scammers were copying legitimate CoinDesk newsletters, adding some fraudulent paragraphs and links about a crypto giveaway, and sending them to individuals who never signed up to receive CoinDesk emails to begin with.      Casa CTO Jameson Lopp suggested in November that Ledger customers may have been targeted; Sunday's data dump supports that theory.      Read more: ‘Convincing’ Phishing Attack Targets Ledger Hardware Wallet Users    Bigger picture    The bad news: O.K., it’s not news but Sunday’s data dump serves as a sobering reminder that even a maker of hardware crypto wallets can become a honeypot of sensitive data. (I'm using the term ""honeypot"" in the sense of ""a valuable target for hackers,"" not ""a decoy site to trap them."")      The reason is partly due to the marketing imperatives of a startup, and partly due to legal and regulatory requirements.      In an FAQ posted in July, the company said an attacker had accessed part of its marketing database through a third party’s API key that had been misconfigured on Ledger’s website.      As soon as the breach was discovered, the key was deactivated, Ledger said. But not in time to prevent the rascals from accessing the lists and, apparently, selling them to phishing artists.      Why would a third party have an API key? The FAQ goes on to explain:      Ledger e-commerce and marketing teams use a third-party solution (Iterable) to send and analyze transactional and marketing emails to customers who have bought products on ledger.com or have signed up to receive our newsletters. … In accordance with our Privacy Policy, as a data controller, we may transmit some of your data to third parties such as payment service providers (PSPs) infrastructure, logistics, and other services providers, within applicable contractual and legal frameworks.      That covers the emails. What about all those mailing addresses, names and phone numbers? Why not purge those after shipping the goods? Back to the FAQ:      For legal reasons, we are obliged to store some transactional information relating to our customers' contact details and their orders data.      In accordance with the storage limitation principle set forth under applicable laws, we endeavor to retain data for no longer than the time required to comply with such legitimate and legal purposes, including satisfying any legal, accounting, tax, or other compliance reporting requirements.      We may archive some of your personal data, with restricted access, for an additional period of time when it is strictly necessary for us to comply with our legal and/or regulatory archiving obligations and for the applicable statute of limitation periods.      At the end of this additional period, your remaining personal data will be permanently erased or anonymized from our systems. If you purchased a product or a service from us, we may retain some transactional data attached to your Contact Details to comply with our legal, tax or accounting obligations for a maximum 10 years period set forth by French applicable laws, as well as to allow us to manage our rights (for example to assert our claims in Courts) during applicable French statutes of limitations.      We also need to retain some of your personal data contained in this database, in order for us to answer your questions, to process potential claims, and to retain evidence for the criminal investigation.      In other words, sometimes companies’ hands are tied and they have to hold on to the toxic waste that is customer data even if they don’t want to.
