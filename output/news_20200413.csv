42431717,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5ilh,1586812860,Bitcoin Drops as Traders See Bearish Signals in Futures Markets,"Bitcoin slid Monday to its lowest point in the past seven days, with traders saying bearish signals are appearing after the cryptocurrency’s 30 percent rebound from a market bottom in mid-March.       After recovering from the depths of the coronavirus-induced sell-off, bitcoin repeatedly failed to break above a price of $7,400.      Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell Monday by 1.6 percent to 20:45 UTC (4:45 p.m. EDT) while ether fell 1.8 percent.      Most major digital assets were down on the day. Bitcoin cash (BCH) was down 4.8 percent, EOS (EOS) dipped 2.6 percent and bitcoin sv (BSV) lost 1.9 percent. All price changes are from 0:00 UTC.      Bitcoin futures contracts for June on exchanges such as Kraken are trading around $6,750, which suggests traders are pricing in further downside. Such “backwardation” — where futures trade at a discount to the spot price — represents a shift from last week, when futures were trading at a premium.      “Futures and our own activity indicate that speculators expect to see lower prices in the short term,” said Maxine Boonen, CEO of over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin liquidity provider B2C2. “One particular hedge fund sold us $20 million of bitcoin today and they have usually been right.”      Early losses on Monday triggered $29 million in position liquidations for futures traders on the BitMEX exchange, exacerbating the sell-off. Hourly liquidations on BitMEX had averaged just $200,000 over the past few days.       In traditional markets, the S&P 500 of large U.S. stocks fell 1 percent as the death toll from the coronavirus continued to cast a pall. New York state, now the epicenter of the pandemic, surpassed 10,000 deaths, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.      Constantine Kogan, a partner at crypto fund BitBull Capital, said the “macroeconomic trend isn't positive so it will continue to put pressure on crypto,” Kogan said.      Elsewhere, gold, a classic haven asset and hedge against inflation, is currently trading up at 1.2 percent.      Although some cryptocurrency analysts and investors think bitcoin could prove to be a hedge against inflation, the yellow metal is outperforming it.      “A break below $6,500 will likely lead to another round of liquidations and send the price towards the $6,100 to $6,200 area,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto investment brokerage Bequant, said of bitcoin.      “For the bulls, a break below will be particularly painful,” he said. “There really isn’t much support until the $5,000 zone. This cautious tone is supported by a shift in the futures curve.”",NEGATIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/13/bitcoin-drops-as-traders-see-bearish-signals-in-futures-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cbc50a43ee759a1ceba694e260fb5fc61590f5e8-1858x1079.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431707,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iPh,1586809298,Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy,"This weekend, Google and Apple announced a massive coronavirus partnership. In the coming months, they’ll be rolling out updates to their operating systems to enable “contact tracing” – the process of identifying carriers of coronavirus so they can be isolated from the healthy population. The system will track with whom you come into contact by recording when your Bluetooth connects with other devices near you.      Contact tracing precedes Google and Apple, of course. During the 2014-16 Ebola crisis in West Africa, the World Health Organization carried out extensive on-the-ground interviews with people regarding where they went and with whom they came into contact. These people were then told to watch for symptoms and to quarantine themselves as needed.      Every country affected by the coronavirus is now adopting their own version of contact tracing and almost all are going digital, leveraging the smartphones in people’s pockets through Bluetooth or geolocation data. How they go about it reflects local laws and norms around the use of personal data and people’s rights to privacy. For example, contact tracing in the European Union must be compliant with the EU’s privacy law, the GDPR, which gives Europeans more control over their data than Americans currently enjoy.      See also: Zoom Has Privacy Issues, Here Are Some Alternatives    The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT)https://www.pepp-pt.org/, a consortium of over 130 research organizations from eight countries, is putting together a variety of different proposals for contact tracing, including the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) initiative backed by 25 academic researchers. PEPP-PT could offer a model for protecting privacy while carrying out necessary disease surveillance, they argue.    “This system is very good because it doesn't leak,” says Claudia Diaz, Associate Professor and researcher at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Chief Scientist at Nym, an open-source, decentralized, permissionless protocol. “It’s very difficult to extract any meaningful information from what is visible, because there's just some random keys and nobody can make sense of those keys unless you interact with that person.”      Europe’s debate over how to carry out contact tracing delineates the questions that the US will need to answer with its own contact tracing system. They include how to keep users’ Bluetooth IDs truly anonymous, how to secure the upload of Bluetooth data to servers, and what a decentralized, open system approach might look like.    The DP-3T proposal    DP-3T is like Singapore's national TraceTogether app, which monitors the exchange of Bluetooth signals with other users of the app. If individuals are diagnosed with coronavirus, they can choose to allow the government to access their app, and see what other phones they were near, or had crossed paths with, and alert those individuals. The system creates a random ID for people’s phone numbers, which are exchanged between phones, rather someone’s actual phone number.      DP-3T processes the contact tracing data locally on the user’s device. Then, when a person is officially diagnosed with coronavirus, a health agency would authorize the upload of a record of Bluetooth contacts, each assigned a random ID that regularly changes. It then sends those Bluetooth IDs of an infected person to other devices, to see if there was a crossover within its own record of Bluetooth contacts, and then alert the device's user if there was contact.      Through this design, the random IDs don’t need to be centralized in any way, which limits the privacy risks, as well as the potential re-appropriation of data for other purposes, like state surveillance, the researchers say. The design would encourage trust in the apps built on the protocol, making them more likely to be downloaded and therefore more effective, they argue.    A centralized approach raises the risk of abuse by a nefarious actor.    “With the approach that our team is exploring, you would not upload all your observed codes in a central database, but the key to generate the codes would be put in a database that will be sent to all the phones,” said Bart Preneel, a cryptography professor at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, who is working on the DP-PPT project and is an advisor to Nym.      The random codes your phone collects don’t give location information, or any other information other than what other codes you were in close proximity to. “The keys of infected people would be sent to all phones, and with this key, every smartphone can have an algorithm to detect whether yes, a code they’ve come in contact with matches this key. And that, we believe, is maximally private,” Preneel says.      According to Diaz, centralized networks inherently include privacy vulnerabilities. For example, when someone uploads data, such as a Bluetooth ID, to a backend server, that could correspond to them alerting health authorities they got infected. Observing this metadata traffic on a network level means that a person could potentially be identified, though it wouldn’t be easy.      See also: Privacy Advocates Are Sounding Alarms Over Coronavirus Surveillance      “The backend that is receiving this information would be able to see the IP address,” says Diaz. “So, the IP address of my home is the IP address from which I send these messages and these messages correspond to somebody who has tested positive. So, they would be able to infer that I am positive or the people living in my house are positive.”      A centralized approach raises the risk of abuse by a nefarious actor or state level adversary. The privacy of such data is not trivial. There have been numerous racist attacks due to coronavirus and many people fear being evicted due to loss of income or even for being diagnosed with coronavirus.      Preneel says the DP-3T proposal, in part, figured out a work around on this. Even if you aren’t infected, your phone would send a dummy string and not the key to a server. That way, your phone is regularly sending messages to the server, which means someone wouldn’t be able to identify which communication might actually mean you’re infected. But that work is still in development.      Diaz said the dummy traffic obscures whether someone has tested positive, but the backend server can distinguish if the message being received is a positive report that should be published or just a dummy message to be discarded. So the backend server can associate the observed IP address with the positive report.      See also: In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-offs on Privacy      Harry Halpin, the CEO of Nym, a privacy startup, has an additional tool that can address this. He’s offering up Nym’s mixnet as one alternative to build contact tracing apps on.      A mix network (taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes”) obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network. It does this by taking messages, or packets of data, from one place, holding them, and then waiting for a few more to come in. Then it shuffles them or mixes them, like you would a deck of cards. It then hands those to the next proxy server, which then waits for some more packets, shuffles them, and so on. If there aren’t enough packets they make up fake packets, which is dummy traffic. While it does make the network slower, it’s much more anonymous, and resists the observation of metadata.      “With Nym, you can communicate freely without your internet traffic revealing your metadata. It’s even more important now given increased surveillance due to the coronavirus. Nym’s mixnet resists a global passive adversary like the NSA that can record all the traffic coming in and out of a network,” said Halpin.      Nym has asked to join the PEPP-PT and is currently building a coalition with related initiatives, like those pursued by Henry de Valence from the Zcash Foundation and Carmela Troncoso, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, who is the lead contact for Europe's private corona contact tracing.      After reviewing the U.S. proposal involving Google and Apple, Halpin says something like DP3T is not ideal, but could be the best of suboptimal options if speed is of the essence.      “But the long-term social and technical effects of this technology are still dangerous, and so DP3T and Bluetooth contact tracing in general is not a panacea,” said Halpin. “In the long-term, applications built on a mixnet offer one more potential solution for conducting contact tracing in a more private way.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/13/europe-debates-covid-19-contact-tracing-that-respects-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41b934224350f82a8d16cb047c76aecbd40f6040-1900x1267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new program, called “Star Atlas,” will automatically freeze accounts deemed to be engaging in “suspicious” transactions until a compliance officer follows up on the case, according to a Monday press release. It will help Huobi’s exchanges target “abnormal behaviors” and “problematic transactions” in real time.

This $350 billion lending program for small businesses provides loans that keep employees on payroll for at least two months, as part of the $2.3 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress. PayPal and Intuit (maker of QuickBooks) are the other fintech firms included in the program.      Jackie Reses, head of Square Capital, tweeted that Square will work with Salt Lake City-based Celtic Bank to roll out the lending program this week.      “We will notify sellers when their application is available via Square Dashboard, starting with employers whose application data we can verify automatically,” she tweeted.      Last Friday, Square founder and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that Cash App offers routing numbers so people who didn’t file tax returns can still accept stimulus checks. This long-standing feature has been used since 2018 to accept direct deposits from employers, even for those without a bank account.      Although the publicly traded Square has yet to release revenue statistics from Q1 2020, it would be surprising if Cash App didn’t profit from the surge in speculative bitcoin (BTC) trading in March. Bitcoin sales accounted for nearly half of the company's quarterly revenue in Q4 2019. Last year, Dorsey said he wanted to help bitcoin achieve “currency status.”      It’s clear different components of the Square empire will take complementary approaches to fintech. The Square Crypto team, a skunkworks unit not related to Cash App’s bitcoin efforts, released an open source Lightning development toolkit in January.

42431710,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iVh,1586799726,Exchange Banking on TON's Gram Tokens to Shut Down After Telegram Court Order,"Blackmoon Crypto, an exchange that aspired to be the first to sell Telegram’s blockchain tokens, is closing, its CEO told CoinDesk.      The news comes weeks after a court order put into doubt whether grams will be issued as planned at the end of April. Blackmoon touted its relationship with investors in Telegram’s upcoming blockchain last fall, shortly before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against the messaging platform in October and secured an injunction delaying gram issuance by months.      However, Blackmoon CEO Oleg Seydak told CoinDesk high regulatory compliance costs were the reason for the exchange's closure.      ""After in-depth analysis we concluded that running a crypto exchange in compliance with all modern [European Union] regulation including the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and licensing requirements (that are constantly changing unpredictably and unfavorably) is not competitive to unregulated alternatives that are available in the market at the moment,"" Seydak told CoinDesk in an email.      According to a user, the exchange sent an email last week announcing the closure. All withdrawal limits have been lifted and fees have been canceled. Holders of Blackmoon's own BMC tokens, sold during a $30 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, will be able to convert the coins into USDC stablecoins.      Read more: Making Sense of the SEC’s Case Against Telegram      “We will release the converter by the 24th of April and will inform you accordingly,"" said the email, which was shared with CoinDesk. According to Seydak, withdrawals will be processed automatically for the next three months, ""and after that period we'll be considering all requests on a case-by-case basis.""      The user, who asked for his name not to be published, said he invested 34 ETH in Blackmoon’s ICO in 2017, when ETH price was as high as $311 apiece.      “I saw an opportunity in future asset management project in the crypto sphere,” the investor told CoinDesk. “Later, I followed the cooperation with TON (gram) and was additionally positive about it.”      Now, the investor is worried whether Blackmoon would make the BMC to USDC conversion transparent and fair to investors.      ""The BMC/USDC conversion rate will be flexible and depend on the amount of requests and outstanding reserves,"" Seydak told CoinDesk.    Great expectations    Blackmoon Crypto is registered in the Cayman Islands and was initially a marketplace for ethereum tokens backed by shares in mainstream companies like Lyft. Last summer, it boasted a modest 3,800 users, but hoped to boost this number dramatically with a unique offer: as soon as Telegram’s TON blockchain launched, Blackmoon planned to become the first official marketplace for its tokens, called grams.      The exchange partnered with Gram Vault, a Swiss custodian founded especially for holding yet-to-be-issued grams, and that it had some big investors in Telegram’s TON $1.7 billion token sale as clients.      Read more: Telegram’s Fight Against SEC Will Help Push Cryptocurrency Legislation, Says Trade Group      Blackmoon Crypto was also working with TON Labs, Telegram’s unofficial technical partner, and was affiliated with the Cyprus-based lending marketplace Blackmoon Financial Group, founded in 2014 by Ilia Perekopsky, who later became the Telegram vice president.      Blackmoon had been hoping to boost its gram liquidity by pulling tokens directly from Gram Vault, under the belief it would hold a significant number of tokens once investors received their allocations.      However, the issuance of grams has been indefinitely postponed: on March 24, the New York court supported a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against Telegram and ruled that grams should not be issued.    'Purely venture stuff'    A Blackmoon ICO investor who spoke to CoinDesk under the nickname Eric Idosen said he used to hold Blackmoon's tokens but sold them in November.      “I guess the situation with TON morally hurt them as both the leadership and developers [of Blackmoon] have been seriously involved in it,” he added. “They probably decided to freeze all activities for now.”      Blackmoon has created “many good tools for traders,” but later Binance did the same and obviously prevailed, Idosen said. “They are good guys, not scammers at all. But you need to understand that it was a purely venture stuff,” he added. ""Their main problem was the lack of liquidity – a typical issue for new platforms.”      Another former investor said he also sold his tokens back to Blackmoon and his friend used the platform's investment products. Neither yielded much profit, but everything was organized properly, he said: “In general, it worked pretty normally.”",NEGATIVE,TON,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/13/exchange-banking-on-tons-gram-tokens-to-shut-down-after-telegram-court-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f86f6698edd72caad63e1908401d28d412664f82-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431719,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5inh,1586795127,Crypto Long & Short: DeFi and Traditional Finance Are Forming an Unlikely Friendship,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance are perhaps not as oil-and-water as most think.      There are few topics as controversial in the crypto sector as decentralized finance. Many believe it is the future of finance – removing middlemen will lower costs, unleash efficiencies and create a more transparent, resilient and better-distributed framework. Others (myself included) find the idea terrifying – a financial system without oversight or an off switch is even more vulnerable to manipulation and error than one that is legally accountable to the user and can be fixed when things go wrong. If a DeFi platform can be “fixed” when things go wrong, just how decentralized is it?      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week — with insights and analysis — from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      An example of this happened this week: decentralized exchange Bisq, which allows users to trade crypto assets anonymously, suffered a hack involving the theft of $250,000. To prevent a greater loss, the platform developers switched it off.      Obviously, from the users’ point of view it is a good thing Bisq did so. But Bisq also showed the world that it can, which calls into question the concept’s resilience – this time it was for the users’ benefit, but who’s to say that will always be the case? (No aspersions cast on the Bisq team, it’s the concept I’m talking about here.)      Read more: How DeFi Dinner Bonds Can Help Restaurants During Crisis      While I am personally skeptical of the concept, I am very intrigued by the potential impact DeFi could have on traditional finance. The two are not oil and water, and the automation and transparency of some innovative market functions emerging from the sector could broaden the scope and reach of the fintech applications of tomorrow.      So I perked up when I read about a group of Chicago-based institutional-grade crypto market participants banding together to form the Chicago DeFi Alliance, which aims to support crypto startups during the current coronavirus crisis. TD Ameritrade, Cumberland, CMT Digital, DV Trading and Jump Capital – many of them blue-chip names from traditional markets – have joined with venture capital firm Volt Capital and DeFi startup Compound, to provide advisory services to selected projects.  This group of organizations has plenty of experience in traditional business and finance. Its participants also understand the potential appeal of an alternative system of value based on a decentralized network.      By focusing their energies on enabling institutions to invest in and trade crypto assets, they have already started to build up the intersection between the centralized and decentralized worlds. This new alliance, if successful, can move that relationship beyond the purely transactional – rather than just investing in and (hopefully) profiting from decentralized assets, its participants will be able to start to sketch out what a deeper interaction could look like, with the experience and sector-wide view necessary to keep it practical.    Getting better    You may be wondering why I’m featuring a technical upgrade in a newsletter that focuses on investment principles. It’s because bitcoin (BTC) is not just an investment asset – it’s a new technology whose use case is still evolving, and changes to that technology could be material in determining the eventual outcome.      Many investors see bitcoin as an asset without tangible fundamentals, whose price will go up or down according to market sentiment. While this is true, those who insist bitcoin has no intrinsic value overlook that it is more than just consensus around a price.      The intrinsic value of technologies depends on their use case. The narrative around bitcoin’s use case is still evolving – so far, it has not fulfilled its initial promise as a payments mechanism, but that doesn’t mean it never will. Some dispute its role as digital gold given its high volatility. Adoption as an alternative financial rail in areas with rickety and/or intrusive legacy systems is so far muted, given barriers to access and exit.      One bitcoin improvement proposal seriously being considered by the community is known as Schnorr/Taproot. If approved, this could enhance bitcoin’s privacy and scalability features, and support better payments functionality and improved smart contracts. If you’re interested in the details, my colleague Alyssa Hertig explains the proposed changes and their potential ramifications in depth.      Read more: Post COVID-19, Companies Must Be Resilient, Not Just Efficient      But whether tech upgrades are your thing or not, even just talking about it highlights an often overlooked feature of crypto asset investing – it’s not just buying into a technology, it’s buying into an evolving technology. It’s like venture investing, getting in at the ground floor of a potentially important innovation – but in the form of a liquid asset. You enter without extensive contracts and exit whenever you want.      Even beyond the potential of the technology itself, whatever your views on that may be, that ease of access to the possible upside in itself is powerful. (In our just-released CoinDesk Quarterly Review Q4 2020, we summarize the most significant technical upgrades expected in the crypto asset market over the next few months.)    Deeper relationship?    In a confused market peppered with dividend cuts and the unwelcome realization that we are already in a recession, we can expect renewed interest in bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P500.      While last month saw a strong spike in correlations as everything crashed and then rebounded and crashed and rebounded again, it’s likely that we are starting to see an uncoupling. Bitcoin has so far performed better in April than any of the other major indices, in spite of the much-celebrated S&P 500 rally. It has even handily outperformed gold, although the shiny metal is still one of the top-performing assets for the year to date.      Going forward, times of heightened volatility in traditional markets are likely to aggravate bitcoin’s volatility even further; but as things settle into a “new normal,” bitcoin’s resilience and monetary policy, especially as the halving narrative gains in volume, are likely to support further outperformance.      Watch out also for fractures in the physical gold market, which could further destabilize markets overall, while highlighting bitcoin’s relative advantages.    Chain links    Digital assets are not a claim on assets or income streams, as are bonds and equities – they’re a claim on future services, and as such, don’t lose value in a recession. TAKEAWAY: This draws on something that we touched on in THE BRIEFING above: the “intrinsic value” of crypto assets. In the case of bitcoin, for example, the future services are the eventual use case of this new technology; in ERC-20 tokens, on the other hand, the future service is more clearly defined, but requires some platform building and/or user growth first. Either way, this highlights the unusual investment characteristics of crypto assets, and hints that just because they don’t have tangible assets or flows doesn’t mean that due diligence can be overlooked. Will this future service generate enough interest for the token in question to at least maintain its value?      The Bitcoin Fund, managed by Canadian investment firm 3iQ, has started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchanges under the symbol QBTC.U. TAKEAWAY: The market now has another way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without worrying about onramps and custody. So far, it’s still small – the market cap for the listed shares is approximately $14 million – but it’s the first such fund listed on a major stock exchange. It also highlights how hard it is to be a first mover in this space – the firm spent almost three years negotiating with the Ontario Securities Commission before approval was granted.      China-based bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Canaan Creative, which listed on Nasdaq (CAN) in November, disclosed a net loss of $148.6 million for 2019 on revenue of $204.3 million. Although computing power sold (measured in Thash/s) was up almost 50 percent, net revenues for the year were down almost 50 percent, according to the company largely as a result of the lower price of bitcoin. TAKEAWAY: Since the figures were released, the share price fell by over 10 percent (to $3.20 at time of writing); it is now down almost 50 percent year to date, and over 60 percent below its listing price. What’s more, the company has downgraded its expectations for 2020 as a result of the crisis, which is likely to hit the Q1 figures. In an earnings call , the CEO and founder acknowledged a significant drop in December’s revenue. It’s also worth remembering the company is being sued in a class-action lawsuit amid allegations it released false and misleading statements to make its financial health appear better than it was prior to its initial public offering.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Those of you who have been watching this sector for a while will remember the heady days of 2017, when bitcoin’s price climbed ludicrously fast, starting the year at under $1,000 and reaching an all-time high of just under $20,000. Then came 2018, when the price fell by 60 percent over the course of a month. Well, bitcoin is even more volatile now, if you look at the standard deviation of the natural log of daily returns over the past 30 days. TAKEAWAY: Unprecedented times bring the greatest risk and the greatest opportunity (profound, I know).      Bitcoin’s hashrate is on the rise again. TAKEAWAY: You may remember that after the price crash of mid-March, Bitcoin’s hashrate (which represents the resources invested by miners in maintaining the network) also fell. Then bitcoin’s self-correcting mechanism known as the difficulty adjustment kicked in a couple of weeks ago, with the second sharpest drop in the network’s history. That, plus the recovery in the bitcoin price, seems to have done the trick: the hashrate is picking up again.      (See our recently released Halving Report for more detail on hashrates and the upcoming halving.)      Related to THE BRIEFING above, DappReview has published its Q1 report on decentralized application (dapp) activity, which shows solid growth, unevenly distributed. The number of dapp transactions grew over 80% year-on-year, fueled by ethereum-based financial applications. TAKEAWAY: The growth may be strong, but the financial figures are still low at under $8 billion (not inconsiderable, but not yet a threat to traditional finance). However, they do hint at a strong coalescence around the ethereum network, in spite of the efforts of competing blockchains. And the focus on financial applications underlines users’ interest in an alternative market system, which traditional providers should take note of.      I don’t have nearly as much time to listen to podcasts as I would like, especially during lockdown. (I miss going for walks!) But the CoinDesk podcast stable under Adam Levine is putting out some powerful stuff I have to flag.    My colleague Christine Kim’s interview with Ethan Vera of Luxor Technologies and Wolfie Zhao from our China office gives a rare peek into miner economics.  Nathaniel Whittemore’s chat with Ben Hunt is a grounding look at the current rally.

42431711,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iZh,1586794552,Bitcoin Vaults: Developer Bryan Bishop Releases Prototype for Secure On-Chain Storage,"""People are not good at securing their keys,"" said Bryan Bishop, a longtime bitcoin developer. ""To the extent that we can write software better and secure [bitcoin] better, that's a win.      As CoinDesk previously reported, the idea of a bitcoin vault has been around since 2016. The original proposal required a hard fork that core developers never implemented.      But as of today, Bishop is rolling out a fork-free prototype on GitHub and sharing it out over the Bitcoin Core email list.      The basic idea involves storing bitcoin (BTC) on-chain in a particularly secure manner that allows for recovery from security mistakes. The on-chain approach is part of what makes Bishop's vault distinct from a cold wallet.      Cornell professor and Ava Labs founder Emin Gün Sirer was part of the team that proposed bitcoin vaults back in 2016. He told CoinDesk he's been watching Bishop's work closely.      ""It's fantastic to see vaults go from concept to reality,"" he told CoinDesk in an email. ""We would like to see vaults become a standard feature on all cryptocurrencies, as they have the potential to avoid what are called 'Sorry For Your Loss (SFYL)' events.""      How it works    The thing about a normal wallet is you only have your own security model to protect you. If someone gets your private key, you have no recourse.      Vaults, as proposed by Bishop and others, offer a Plan B. If your security falters somehow, you have a clawback mechanism.      Users of such vaults would effectively be deciding to limit the pace at which their bitcoin (BTC) could be released in the event of a breach. The stored bitcoin would be divided into a series of what Bishop is calling ""shards."" These shards could only release their bitcoin to a hot wallet one at a time at some pre-set interval.      The proposal also calls for something called a watchtower which would monitor vaults. Any time it saw BTC move from a shard, it would likely notify the owner. If the attempt to transfer the bitcoin had not been authorized, the user could activate a pre-signed transaction that would move all the BTC to an off-chain cold wallet, before the bitcoin could unlock for use by the attacker.      Under certain conditions, the watchtower might skip the notification step and simply initiate moving to the cold wallet anyway.      ""To operate this vault and everything that runs with it will require software at a minimum. This is not a manual procedure,"" Bishop said. It's not yet clear whether users would run their own watchtowers or if that will need to be something that's shared by users.      Here is one adversary vaults might help users defend against: themselves. This model of timed release could be useful, for example, for bitcoin holders to ""pay themselves"" at set intervals, while introducing self-imposed friction over their ability to spend profligately.      ""I want to make it clear that this is experimental, it's a prototype,"" Bishop said.      It's worth noting Bishop's implementation has been written assuming that Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 119 will one day be adopted. It will work as is now, but if BIP 119 is adopted, ""It makes some of the security a little bit tighter,"" Bishop said.      Bishop is known these days as part of the team launching Avanti Bank in Wyoming, but this project is independent work. There are no immediate plans for Avanti, founded by blockchain advocate Caitlin Long, to adopt it.      Related projects    Meanwhile, Bishop is not the only person to work on vaults for bitcoin's existing codebase.      Since proposing the design last year, Kevin Loaec of Chainsmiths took it and modified it into something ""targetted at people (actually: companies) who need to move the funds often and relatively fast ... It's a whole other level than the 'multisig' used today by most,"" Loaec wrote to CoinDesk in an email.      Chainsmiths calls the product Revault, and expects to raise money around it soon.      Bob McElrath, formerly of Fidelity, is working on a similar implementation with several collaborators now, which he says will be described soon in academic papers. His description broadly applies to Bishop's work as well.      ""This kind of wallet is terribly complex,"" McElrath wrote, ""having at least three distinct wallets: an 'active' wallet (used to send & receive), a 'vault' (timelocked storage), and a 'recovery' wallet (destination for funds in case of attack).""      Ittay Eyal, a developer who was also part of the team that made the original vault proposal with Sirer, told CoinDesk, ""We are actually in the process of developing a provably secure implementation of a vault for Ethereum in collaboration with Certora.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/13/bitcoin-vaults-developer-bryan-bishop-releases-prototype-for-secure-on-chain-storage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8767541ef40c831e3791be6a137793f2785e2fd-1300x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      Everyone has a bad take about what the world is going to look like after COVID-19. “Coronavirus is making the future happen faster,” or “It’s not changing the future, it’s accelerating it!” is one common refrain.      What the hell does that even mean? In most cases, it means the writer-flack usually points to some technology that already exists but nobody uses because current implementations mostly suck (videoconferencing, 3D printing, or VR) and are only regarded as mainstream in dissident tech applications, e.g. firearms manufacturing.      See also: Preston Byrne - How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      “Will the Coronavirus kill globalization?” is another seemingly insightful-yet-not-really observation. This literally asked by Foreign Policy magazine – not when Donald Trump was elected, or when Salvini or Orban or Boris Johnson were elected, or when the U.S. shut its borders to China, or even when the U.S. shut its doors to Europe, but rather this week, under circumstances where global trade has ground to a halt. Any country capable of doing so has sealed its borders, and both Democrats and Republicans are openly discuss re-on-shoring supply lines.      Journalism is a lagging indicator. With the exception perhaps of the feeds belonging to Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis), Ben Hunt (@epsilontheory), and Jon Stokes (@jonst0kes), Twitter is not much better. Internet macro takes on COVID that appear, at first brush, to be insightful and quantitative are usually also easily debunked. On Twitter, I have seen COVID described as an impossibly unlikely event, a seven-sigma or even 12-sigma occurrence.      Translating from math-ese into English, a 12-sigma event would be the sort of thing we might expect to see twice every 10,000 years. But pandemics like COVID-19 are far more common on far shorter timescales: major plagues have swept the world at least 20 times in the last 2,000 years, and at least three global influenzas, AIDS, polio, Ebola and now COVID-19 have each presented global threats in merely the last 102 years.    Resiliency over efficiency    So if we’re not going to wake up in six months and find ourselves in either ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior,"" revisiting the 1881-1914 New Imperialism of hyper-nationalistic great power conflict,or an episode of ""The Jetsons,"" what should we expect the world to look like in a few weeks when the first wave of COVID recedes?      Probably, we will return to a world much like we left, except businesses will no longer be run with the assumption that raw efficiency should always take precedence over resiliency.      This is not the way most people, and nearly all institutionalized corporate executives, are currently trained to think. I recall a friend who worked at a bank in Canary Wharf, in London, telling me several years ago his bank “did not plan for any contingency that the British Army and a couple of tanks showing up at the front door couldn’t fix.” By which he meant the bank’s official policy considered real-world business interruption events which the British Army could not handle – including, presumably, a global pandemic which shut down the entirety of the United Kingdom – to be so unlikely as to be not worth preparing for.    Everyone has a bad take about what the world is going to look like after COVID-19.    The most interesting business thinking today is likely not to be found in think-pieces or industry panels (if conferences ever return, that is), but rather behind closed doors among the members of boards of major corporations, law firms, importers, and others trying to dissect what has happened to their businesses in the last 30 days, and how to best position themselves to prevent this from happening again.      I’m not privy to those discussions – I am too young and too beautiful to sit on such committees. But having run three of my own businesses I can guess what their conclusions might be. I am guessing (a) strategic cash reserves and (b) wider geographic distribution of staff will be the more important issues.      See also: Preston Byrne - How to Escape Contracts That Are Killing Your Company During Coronavirus      First, firms will be looking to increase their cash reserves, substantially. This includes companies like law firms which historically distribute most of their profits and don’t sit on cash for very long.      For most small and medium-sized companies, the idea of building a nest egg is an unfamiliar one. For the better part of the last 10 years the strategy has been to pour profits into further growth; demand shocks were nowhere to be seen, and there would always be another customer, or failing that another venture raise, another something around the corner to tide you over, if only you pitched it hard enough, no matter how insane your business model might be. See: WeWork.      I prefer caution. When I ran a small law firm of my own, I kept my burn rate very low by, for example, setting up shop in Connecticut rather than New York. I always aimed to have sufficient opex in the bank, so I could survive in the (extremely unlikely) event the phone stopped ringing for a few months. Fortunately, that never happened, but I would have been ready for it if it had. After COVID-19, rational business leaders will understand that lengthy cashflow interruptions can sometimes occur.    American companies never expected they would require a federal-government-degree-of-planning to manage their own day-to-day affairs.    Second, although work from home will increase in frequency, it is horrible from both a team communication and business development standpoint. I hate it. I expect businesses to prioritize the establishment of self-sufficient satellite offices with very small teams in small, geographically distant exurban communities.      If we need a precedent for this, we should look to the government which has, for at least 70 years, had sweeping contingency plans, chiefly to survive a nuclear war. All federal agencies develop and maintain comprehensive continuity of operations, or COOP: plans to relocate their agencies outside of Washington, D.C. and continue working remotely in the event of a major disaster.      COVID-19 was one such disaster. In a little under a week starting on March 19 and ending on March 26, the lights winked out everywhere between Boston and Washington, D.C., a megalopolis 400 miles where much of America’s commerce is conducted. Millions of jobs were lost. Based on the level of corporate paralysis that has gripped much of the United States during COVID-19, we may safely infer that American companies never expected they would require a federal-government-degree-of-planning to manage their own day-to-day affairs.      See also: Nic Carter - Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In      What I’ve personally taken away from this disaster is that even geographic spread between cities is a unique form of exposure to cities. There are meaningful differences between the experience of my friends who are stuck in New York and those of us who are “stuck” in more rural areas. Rural zones continue to enjoy greater freedom of movement and action, and less oversight from, for example, overzealous urban police than the people living in built up metropolises. The lower density often, but not always, can result in lower amounts of disease transmission.      Between these two measures – maintaining larger liquid cash reserves and promoting the wide dispersal of small teams capable of fully independent operation – companies of all sizes, large and small, will seek to address pandemic risk. Clever emergency planners will recognize that the risk of a statewide shutdown is not the only risk they face. Pandemic prepping will also mean preparedness for currency devaluations, bank failures, government property seizures, financial censorship, and other threats that lurk in the background.      There will be myriad opportunities to develop business in this new world, including for Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency companies that can assist businesses in building robust, automated, cryptographically secure financial architectures. I expect that businesses selling credible software-based resilience will be profitable indeed.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

42431705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iNh,1586786703,COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ Unites 60 Firms on Self-Sovereign ID Project,"Technologists building blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) tools are collaborating on an “immunity passport” to help stop the spread of COVID-19 without compromising the privacy of users. Proving some level of immunity would help individuals return to everyday life.      The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) is working on a digital certificate, using the recently approved World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credentials standard. The certificate lets individuals prove (and request proof from others) they’ve recovered from the novel coronavirus, have tested positive for antibodies or have received a vaccination, once one is available.      Over 60 organizations in the SSI space are participating, such as Evernym, Streetcred, esatus, TNO, Georgetown University and others. The initiative also has a global spread including Consulcesi in Italy, DIDx in South Africa, TrustNet in Pakistan and Northern Block in Canada.      These digital certificates would be issued by health care institutions but controlled by the user and shared in a peer-to-peer manner. (A common misconception is that self-sovereign means self-attested, which removes the need for governments and other authorities; trust in the issuer of the credential is critical, said a spokesman for Evernym.)      The tech world agrees on the need for some kind of digital certificate. Self-sovereign identity mavens were buoyed by former Microsoft boss Bill Gates asking for digital test certificates during a Reddit AMA last month: “Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it,” said Gates.      ‘Human-centric’    There have been a slew of COVID-19 solutions purporting to use blockchain to protect users’ privacy. These have been spurred by surveillance measures enacted in places such as China, including things like thermal facial-recognition cameras, temperature checkpoints and location tracking. While these measures may be effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19 – which has so far claimed at least 115,000 lives worldwide – there are legitimate fears of surveillance overreach.      In the U.K., for example, the technology arm of the National Health Service, NHSX, is working with big data and AI companies like Palantir and Faculty. Though lawyers for those companies said patient data will be anonymized, a report by the Guardian on Sunday cited an unnamed government official voicing concerns the confidential health data was being processed with “insufficient regard for privacy, ethics or data protection.”      SSI may provide an alternate path with less-fraught trade-offs.      “The technology we have been building is human-centric,” said Jamie Smith, Evernym’s strategic engagement director. “It’s really the polar opposite of surveillance-focused solutions we have seen in places like China. Very government-centric solutions have serious implications for ongoing privacy.”      The appropriate approach, said Smith, must be an open ecosystem where there are multiple solutions that are interoperable, a common framework across many regions.      However, this may also lead to intellectual property (IP) disputes, a possibility CCI says it is working to address.      “The CCI is currently in conversations with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) about the potential to establish a DIF Working Group to provide any necessary intellectual property rights protections for schemas and specifications resulting from the community-driven CCI effort,” an Evernym spokesman said in a statement.    ‘Thin’ blockchain layer    SSI builder Evernym uses the Linux-related Hyperledger Indy blockchain protocol, but the CCI project itself is ""ledger-agnostic."" SSI and Verifiable Credentials create a triangle of trust between the issuer of a credential (think of a digital version of a tangible document like a driver’s license, passport, birth certificate, car title, plane ticket, etc.), the holder of that credential and a verifier.      It’s a system that puts the holder at the center of things, rather than (an often tedious) back-and-forth directly between the issuer and verifier. It also gives the holder power to choose what they want to share and with whom.      At the core, it’s a decentralized DLT architecture, but one that doesn’t involve running lots of data on blockchains.      “It’s a very thin-layer usage of blockchain just for cryptographic infrastructure. All the credentials are exchanged off-chain, peer-to-peer. The role of blockchain is super-important, but it’s thin,” said Drummond Reed, Evernym’s chief trust officer.      Another way to understand how this blockchain layer operates is by looking at the way the internet itself is designed, allowing users to do e-commerce transactions, for example, using public and private keys.      “The hard part of public key infrastructure (PKI) is how do you actually prove it’s someone’s public key,” said Reed. “The solution has always been centralized service providers called certificate authorities.”      In this case, the blockchain acts as a decentralized directory of public keys rather than relying on a centralized service, which helps return control back to the user.      Looking beyond the immediate need for COVID-19 test credentials, Evernym VP of Revenue Nick Ris said the concept of “trust at a distance” should highlight the need for other SSI applications.      “In higher education there are tens of thousands of students trying to work remotely and engage with universities and systems that are totally inadequate,” he said. “The tech we are building is scalable, interoperable and cheap relative to the costs they have got right now for infrastructure.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/13/covid-19-immunity-passport-unites-60-firms-on-self-sovereign-id-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fcf36346100ff5d5e482c1c4011c8a6a450fa9a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5ijh,1586779396,Bitcoin Ends Four-Week Winning Run With Drop Into Bear Territory,"View    Bitcoin's (BTC) short-term trend has turned bearish following a drop to $6,600. Further losses could be in the offing, say chart analysts.  The recent liquidity-driven bounce in equities could falter, too, adding to the bearish pressures for bitcoin.  A UTC close above the 50-day average is needed to neutralize the bearish case.    Bitcoin is reporting losses on Monday, having ended last week with its longest weekly winning streak in nearly a year.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell by $300 soon after midnight to hit a 12-day low of $6,600. Bitcoin was last seen trading near $6,693, representing a 2.5 percent decline over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index (BPI).      A near 2 percent price rally seen in the seven days to April 12 had marked bitcoin's fourth straight weekly gain. Prices rose 15.4, 1.0, and 8.8 percent in the previous three weeks, respectively. A four-week winning trend was last seen in May 2019, as seen below.    Market woes to return?    The latest four-week price rise from $5,300 to $6,900 pales in comparison to the uptick seen 11 months ago. Back then, bitcoin jumped from $5,150 to $8,730 in the four weeks to May 26, 2019.      Further, the follow-up to the latest four weeks of gains has been negative so far. The cryptocurrency is flashing red, as noted above, and may continue to lose altitude in the near term, with some observers suggesting the recent equity market rally is liquidity-driven and has potential to unravel.      As of Thursday, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, was up 27 percent from multi-year lows near 2,200 observed on March 23. The Federal Reserve has announced multiple easing programs worth trillions of dollars over the past few weeks to help contain the impact of the coronavirus and cushion the markets.      Also read: Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset Looms      However, the rally could soon begin to unwind, pushing bitcoin lower. That's because the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin this week and looks likely to bring a reality check to investors with disclosures over the extent of the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus restrictions.      ""It would be unprecedented"" if the S&P 500 failed to re-test or even fall below its low on March 23,"" analysts at Bank of America Global Research said last week, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Nomura's analysts called the recent equity market bounce as “an unenthusiastic, inorganic bear market rally"" in the same report.      Bitcoin has largely moved in tandem with the S&P 500 over the last six weeks or so. The cryptocurrency fell by 24 percent in March, as the S&P 500 declined by over 12 percent. Bitcoin is now reporting a month-to-date gain of 4 percent, while Wall Street's benchmark index has added nearly 8 percent to its value so far this month.      The trend looks to be continuing, as bitcoin's $300 slide seen during the Asian trading hours on Monday was accompanied by a 2 percent slide in futures tied to the S&P 500.    Bearish signals    Bitcoin fell by over 5 percent on Friday, confirming a rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart. The bearish reversal pattern often ends up reversing the previous move, meaning the doors have been opened for a re-test of the March low of $3,867.      Macro trader Henrik Zeberg is calling a move as low as $1,000. While that target looks far-fetched, a move to levels below $6,000 due to the wedge breakdown could be seen.      Another analyst, Josh Rager, suggests the pullback from last week's high above $7,300 to $6,600 could be the start of a bearish lower-highs and lower-lows set up.      The four-hour chart shows that bitcoin has already established a lower high at $7,200. It's also confirmed a head-and-shoulders breakdown with a drop below the neckline support of $6,790. That's created room for a slide to $6,100 (target as per the measured move method).      The bearish case would weaken if prices print a UTC close above the 50-day average at $7,145. That hurdle proved a tough nut to crack last week.      Also read: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      A bullish close above the 50-hour average, if confirmed, would likely pave the way for a test of the psychological resistance of $8,000. Some analysts expect the upcoming mining reward halving to keep the cryptocurrency better bid in the short term.      ""For the short term, we expect to see bitcoin retest the US$8,000 price level in the coming weeks, with the upcoming halving event in May serving as a catalyst for the digital asset’s continued appreciation,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack told CoinDesk.

42431723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iph,1586775642,First Mover: Bitcoin's Market Cap Eclipses Citigroup's as Yellen Calls for Big-Bank Dividend Cuts,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price drop since Friday has pushed the oldest and largest cryptocurrency back into the red for 2020.      But guess what bitcoin is still beating? Big U.S. bank stocks, which are suffering as coronavirus-related business disruptions, household lockdowns and rising unemployment eviscerate the economy, pushing up loan losses.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is down 26 percent this year, while Bank of America has fallen 29 percent, Wells Fargo has tumbled 38 percent and Citigroup has plunged 40 percent.      Bitcoin is down a comparatively paltry 6.4 percent on the year.      With governments and central banks around the world pledging trillions of dollars of emergency aid packages and money injections, bitcoin has garnered heightened investor attention lately as a potential hedge against inflation, a digital form of gold. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet last week surged past $6 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.      Yet, when bitcoin was envisioned in a 2008 white paper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the original intended purpose was as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that could bypass financial institutions.      And it's that original use case that prompted TradeBlock, a cryptocurrency research firm, to take a look last week at how the cryptocurrency is performing versus bank stocks. The topic could come under heightened focus this week as JPMorgan reports earnings for the first quarter.      ""Interestingly, while market prices of the large banks and even payment processors saw a lack of investor confidence during the past several weeks, investor confidence in bitcoin has fared surprisingly well,"" John Todaro, director of currency research at the crypto-focused firm TradeBlock, wrote in an email.      In fact, Citigroup's share price has been hit so hard its market capitalization has shrunk to about $100 billion, according to FactSet – well below the $122.8 billion outstanding market value of bitcoin. If the trend continues, bitcoin could next overtake Wells Fargo, whose market value currently sits at $135 billion.      Bitcoin's market value is still less than half of JPMorgan's, which is around $313 billion.      In a report last week, CoinDesk Research noted developers are actively working on technologies that would improve bitcoin's usefulness as a payment system. And that's to say little of the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which aims squarely at displacing big banks and so far has largely been built around Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain network after Bitcoin.      Just as they were in the 2008 crisis, banks are big beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's new emergency lending programs.      As of April 8, banks were borrowing some $43.5 billion from the central bank's so-called discount window, which is usually reserved for emergencies. (The Fed in late March encouraged banks to use it as a way of trying to assure coronavirus-roiled markets had plenty of liquidity.) Wall Street dealers had pulled down another $33 billion, money-market mutual funds were backstopped by $54 billion and collateralized loans known as ""repurchase agreements"" totaled some $227.6 billion.      Bitcoin, which saw a big sell-off in March along with just about everything else as investors sought safety in U.S. dollars, may have benefited from the stabilization in markets that followed the Fed's aggressive response.      But the banks' year-to-date stock returns reveal just how worried shareholders remain.      According to a Morgan Stanley report last week, cash-strapped companies have been drawing down credit lines at a record pace, with a total of $223 billion drawn so far in 2020. There's a big risk some of those loans could go bad if the economy sours further.      There are also concerns banks might face losses stemming from the past decade's explosion in corporate debt, especially ""leveraged loans"" made to companies with junk-grade credit ratings. Many of those loans were packaged into bonds known as collateralized loan obligations, sponsored by non-bank financial firms such as Blackstone. But Fitch, the credit-rating firm, has warned some of those losses could reverberate back onto banks.      ""Overall, credit risk is rising as the global economy slows, and leveraged lending is a key concern given the higher risk associated with the loans,"" wrote Brian Kleinhanzl, a bank analyst at the brokerage firm KBW.      So far the biggest U.S. banks have managed to keep paying dividends, but former Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week regulators should ask banks to consider suspending the shareholder payouts – to preserve capital that could be used to support additional lending. Such a move also would help to avoid a repeat of the 2008 crisis, when losses grew so steep the big banks had to get emergency capital injections (bailouts) from the U.S. Treasury Department. Citigroup and Bank of America each needed $45 billion.      Citigroup's stock-price plunge has been so swift the New York-based bank's dividend now equates to a yield above 4 percent, a level not seen since 2009.      JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who in 2017 called bitcoin a ""fraud"" before saying the following year he regretted the comment, wrote last week in his annual letter to shareholders that his board of directors ""would likely consider suspending the dividend"" if an ""extremely adverse"" economic scenario came to pass. That was defined as a situation where gross domestic product, or GDP, tumbled by 35 percent in the second quarter, with U.S. unemployment surging to 14 percent later in the year.      Dimon published his letter just days before JPMorgan's own economists predicted in a report that GDP would fall at a rate of 40 percent in the second quarter, and that the unemployment rate would jump to 20 percent:      If investors haven't already written off big-bank dividends, a wave of suspensions could push the stocks lower.      That could widen the performance gap with bitcoin, which doesn't have a dividend to cut.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin fell to 13-day low of $6,600 early on Monday, having fallen out of a rising wedge pattern three days ago, as noted by macro economist Henrik Zeberg.      The converging nature of the trendlines forming the wedge pattern indicates bull fatigue. Hence, a breakdown is considered confirmation of a bullish-to-bearish trend change.      An asset usually ends up erasing a major chunk of a recent rally following a wedge breakdown. Hence, Zeberg expects bitcoin to drop to levels below $5,000 and suggests the breakdown in the top cryptocurrency could be an advance warning of another liquidity crisis in the global markets.      Global equities took a beating in March amid a scare over the economic affects of the coronavirus pandemic, triggering a global dash for U.S. dollar cash, which saw investors sell everything from gold to U.S. Treasurys.      S&P 500 futures are signaling risk aversion at press time with a 1.2 percent decline. The drop comes as the number of coronavirus cases in China and Singapore surged over the weekend. However, European markets are closed Monday, an Easter bank holiday. It remains to be seen if investors resume liquidating assets for USD during the week ahead.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin is now operating in bearish territory and only a daily (UTC) close above the 50-day average at $7,145 would neutralize the outlook.

Brought in mid-2019 by investors who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to the scheme, the complaint accuses the heads of OneCoin, including ""Crypto Queen"" Ruja Ignatova and Konstantin Ignatov, of promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency investments and violating federal securities laws.      However, the federal judge presiding in the case in the Southern District of New York court said the lead plaintiffs, Christine Grablis and Donald Berdeaux, have not been filing the agreed monthly updates on their efforts to serve court papers to all the listed defendants.      District Judge Valerie Caproni warned in an opinion and order filed on Friday that Grablis and Berdeaux ""must show cause no later than April 16, 2020, why this case should not be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).""      Caproni also ""sternly warned"" the lead plaintiffs could see sanctions if they fail to comply with court orders going forward.      Last March, U.S. prosecutors in New York officially charged OneCoin's Ignatova and Ignatov, saying the project stole “billions” from investors through its alleged cryptocurrency pyramid scheme.

42431702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5iHh,1586766177,HTC Is Bringing Cryptocurrency Mining to Its Exodus Blockchain Phone,"Taiwan-based tech giant HTC will allow users of its Exodus blockchain phone to mine cryptocurrency, but it isn't going to make them rich.      As reported by Forbes on Friday, the firm has partnered with Mida Labs to use its DeMiner app on the Exodus 1S model. The app allows users to mine monero (XMR) and can earn users up to $0.0038 in the crypto on average daily. The electricity used to carry out the mining tasks would come to less than half the income from mining, according to the report.      That amount of income isn't going to repay the cost of the phone in any reasonable timespan and, in fact, would take around 13,680 days (roughly 37 years) to earn the value of one unit of XMR at the current price of $52 apiece.      See also: Bitcoin Halving: How Miners are Preparing for Lower Block Rewards      However, HTC says the effort is aimed at bringing further decentralization to crypto mining, a process that sees computers used to secure the blockchain and process transactions in return for block rewards.      Mining of cryptocurrency has progressed from using computer processors to graphics cards and even dedicated processors called ASICS for some blockchains as participants sought to maintain returns amid rising network difficulty. As such the ability to mine on a mobile phone is at least novel and may increase adoption and education around cryptocurrency.      HTC said the DeMiner app – expected to launch sometime in Q2 2020 – used on the Exodus is roughly equivalent to a desktop computer in terms of mining (or hashing) power, but brings far lower energy demands.      ""The question is not should we use an ASIC or a CPU. The question is how can we further decentralize and ensure a more inclusive monetary system?” Phil Chen, HTC's decentralized chief officer, said in the Forbes report.      HTC introduced the Exodus 1S last October, touting it as the only mobile phone that can run a full bitcoin node. The Exodus range allows users to store cryptocurrencies in the built-in Zion hardware wallet with claimed ""military-grade"" security.      Early last month, the firm revealed a 5G router that will also support a full bitcoin node.",NEUTRAL,XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/13/htc-is-bringing-cryptocurrency-mining-to-its-exodus-blockchain-phone,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53ed5e5a30942ff5816282fa98335927557a4b25-1500x997.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
