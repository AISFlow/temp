42379209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nY1L,1486421936,A Town in Illinois Just Announced It's Holding a Bitcoin Sale,"A small town located outside of Chicago is about to sell some bitcoins.  The village of Vernon Hills, Illinois, is currently in possession of roughly $10,000 worth of the digital currency, according to The Chicago Tribune. That amount, seized last year during a criminal drug investigation by local police and federal agencies, is set to be sold off in the days ahead. Local officials approved a plan to use Coinbase to sell the confiscated coins during a town meeting on 24th January.  While not as flashy as one of the US Marshals’ bitcoin auctions or the $19m worth sold in Australia last year, the Vernon Hills story illustrates the questions local jurisdictions face when coming into possession of bitcoin following a criminal investigation. The village has a population of about 25,000 people, according to US Census data.  The Tribune quoted Vernon Hills finance chief Nikki Larson, who told town officials:  ""[Bitcoins are] used to facilitate transactions online, but because the village doesn't have a use for bitcoins we're recommending that the village share be accepted and then subsequently converted into US currency.”  Curiously, it won’t be the last time that Vernon Hills receives a small windfall – which will be directed to local police coffers – from a bitcoin bust.  In the months ahead, local police are expected to finalize another criminal investigation that will involve a bitcoin asset forfeiture. As that process comes to a close, Vernon Hills officials will hold yet another bitcoin sale.

Taking a page from leading tech companies which offer cash rewards to developers that spot code issues, administrators for the market announced last week that it would pay 10 BTC for ""vulnerabilities that could severely disrupt HANSA's integrity"". The program was first reported by CyberScoop.  For bugs that aren’t as critical, admins said they would offer 1 BTC, with 0.05 BTC being put up for display issues and other minor problems.  There are rules for the program, however. Prospective bounty hunters are asked not to make the exploits public prior to disclosing them to the market’s operators, or undertake any attacks that might harm Hansa users. The more details that are provided, the admins wrote, ""the higher the chance a payout will be awarded"".  The admins went on to explain:  ""To be eligible, you must demonstrate a security compromise on our market using a reproducible exploit. Should you encounter a bug please open a ticket and inform us about your findings.""  In a way, the bug bounty program further highlights the dark market ecosystem’s continued use of bitcoin as a financial tool. Years before, it was the now-defunct Silk Road that relied on bitcoin as a payment tool, though today markets have begun looking to other digital currencies like monero.  Social media posts suggest that at least one site-critical bug has been identified, with CyberScoop reporting that others had been found since the program’s launch.

42379216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nY6N,1486403992,North Dakota Legislators Advance Plan for Bitcoin Regulation,"Legislators in North Dakota are quietly – but quickly – advancing a measure to study how the state should approach regulating digital currencies like bitcoin.  Public records  show that at the end of last year, the North Dakota Senate’s Industry, Business and Labor Committee put forward Bill 2100, which included language for a report on the feasibility of regulating bitcoin. The bill was introduced at the request of the state’s Department of Financial Institutions, the chief finance regulator for the state.  The measure was passed unanimously in the Senate on 12th January with 46 votes. The legislature’s lower chamber has since taken up the bill, though no hearings have been scheduled as of yet. However, the rapid pace in the Senate suggests that the study is likely to be approved once representatives put the measure to a vote.  If passed and signed by Gov. Doug Burgum, the study would put North Dakota on the path to introducing specific regulations for digital currencies.  As the bill explains:  “During the 2017-18 interim, the legislative management shall consider studying the feasibility and desirability of regulating virtual currency, such as bitcoin. The legislative management shall report its findings and recommendations, together with any legislation required to implement the recommendations, to the sixty-sixth legislative assembly.”  The legislative proposal comes amid a flurry of activity amongst US state legislatures on the bitcoin and blockchain front.  Last month, two lawmakers in Washington proposed prohibiting businesses in the state’s cannabis industry from using bitcoin and other digital currencies. That bill, still under deliberation, was the subject of a hearing on 27th January that saw both supporters and critics speak out.  Legislators in Hawaii are pushing for a study of how blockchain could benefit the state while New Hampshire is looking at how it can tinker with its financial oversight rules to account for digital currency traders.  And just last week, a state representative in Arizona filed a bill that would restrict the use of blockchain-based tracking systems for local firearms owners.

42379207,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nXyp,1486398495,France's Central Bank Wants to Work With More Blockchain Startups,"France’s central bank is opening up a new innovation lab, with an eye to collaborate with blockchain startups.  In a speech given late last month by Banque de France governor Villeroy de Galhau and published today, the central bank indicated that it wants to widen its work with the tech. In December, central bank officials unveiled details of a digital identity trial which saw the institution work with public-private investment office Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, Paris-based startup Labo Blockchain and a group of undisclosed domestic banks.  That trial came months after the Banque de France called for more research into blockchain.  According to de Galhau, who spoke at the Paris FinTech Forum, the central bank wants to promote more fintech innovation. To spur that effort, officials are opening a new lab through which it can work alongside startups on trials and prototypes.  Telling attendees of the forum that “we are learning from you”, de Galhau advocated for an expansive environment for startups, including those working with blockchain.  De Galhau explained:  “The digitalisation of the financial sector can accelerate this positive process: it helps to disseminate technological advances such as electronic signatures, solutions to defend against cyber-attacks or distributed ledger technologies. Innovative and secure payment solutions, such as tomorrow’s blockchains, are also helping to speed up the development of e-commerce and modernise physical trade.”  Few details are available as to when the lab will open. However, de Galhau indicated that the central bank would move forward aggressively with its fintech innovation plans.  “Rest assured we are fully mobilised towards this goal,” he said.

42379208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nY3r,1486393209,Blockchain Insurance Consortium B3i Adds 3 New Members,"A blockchain technology consortium spearheaded by a global group of insurers has added several new members.  The B3i project – short for the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative – was launched in October, an effort aimed at providing a way for insurers like Allianz and Swiss Re, among others, to swap information and collaboratively test prototypes and use cases.  While some insurers have been testing blockchain independently, B3i offered the chance to conduct those experiments under one roof. Since launch, other insurers, including Liberty Mutual, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and the Reinsurance Group of America have joined.  Now, the initiative is expanding its membership once again.  A trio of insurers – Hannover, Generali Group and SCOR – all announced that they are taking part in the B3i project. In statements, the companies indicated that, if successful, the project could have a material impact on how they do business.  Gerhard Ebeling, Hannover’s general manager and head of department IT operations, said in a statement:  ""Blockchain technology has the potential to optimize business processes and value chains in the insurance industry. With the B3i initiative we now have a platform of the efficient and trendsetting testing and improvement of inter-company processes.""  The entry of new members comes amid reports that B3i stakeholders are accelerating a key prototype.  A Swiss Re representative told Reuters last month that the group was advancing development on a shared platform for exchanging contracts. A prototype is expected to undergo testing in the coming weeks, with a plan to publish the results this year.  The insurers could spin that platform off into a separate company for commercial use by 2018 at the earliest, according to Paul Meeusen, who leads Swiss Re’s B3i efforts.

42379200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nXv3,1486390552,An Arizona Lawmaker is Trying to Ban Blockchain Gun Tracking,"An Arizona lawmaker has proposed banning the use of blockchain to track firearms.  House Bill 2216  , first proposed on 17th January, would make it a felony ""to require a person to use or be subject to"" firearm tracking, explicitly identifying blockchain tech as a platform for doing so. The bill was submitted by Representative Paul Boyer and has steadily advanced through the legislature since its introduction.  While it may sound unusual, the concept has been explored in the past by those working with the tech, perhaps most notably by way of the so-called ""Glockchain"" project developed as part of the Ideo coLAB initiative, as reported last year by BI.  The basic premise is that a gun would be fitted with some kind of hardware sensor that could broadcast a transaction to a blockchain every time the gun is used.  The Arizona bill suggests that there’s pushback against this idea, at least in some quarters of the US.  As the bill states:  ""For the purposes of this section, ‘Electronic Firearm Tracking Technology’ means a platform, system or group of systems or devices that uses a shared ledger, distributed ledger or block chain technology or similar form of technology or electronic database for the purpose of storing information in a decentralized or centralized way, that is not owned or controlled by any single person or entity and that is used to locate or control the use of a firearm.""  The measure does include some exceptions, including situations in which a law enforcement official obtains a warrant during a criminal investigation, or the person in question willfully consents in writing to the use of such a tracking system.  According to public records, the measure has already cleared two legislative committees, and on 2nd February was sent to the broader House of Representatives for consideration after approval by the Committee of the Whole.

42379203,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nXxZ,1486389601,Not Yet 'Do or Die': Experts See Slow Road For DLT in 2017,"In the wake of 2016's ever-escalating blockchain hype, 2017 has given way to sometimes dire predictions about the industry's prospects ahead.  Deloitte principal Eric Piscini, for example, has gone so far as to label 2017 the blockchain industry's ""make-or-break year"", arguing that unless the financial services industry can demonstrate ""real-world implementations"", the technology risks succumbing to ""boardroom fatigue"". And he's not alone in positioning this as the narrative for the year.  But, is this prognosis too dire? And just how patient can organizations, governments and consultants afford to be?  The consensus opinion among those interviewed by CoinDesk is that the technology is simply too new to pronounce this year – or even the next few years – as 'do-or-die' times for blockchain adoption in major industries.  Nicola Morris, senior vice president of corporate development at payment solutions provider WEX Inc, for instance, is in the early stages of work with the technology, but said she doesn't feel any particular rush.  ""I wouldn't say we are behind or that the industry is necessarily behind. I think we are all at various stages of the proof-of-concept stage,"" Morris said. ""We feel very good about what we’re doing this year.""  Yet, others say the pace of the industry's development is accelerating.  Scott Manuel  , head of product management at Thomson Reuters, said he expects ""some"" of the investments in blockchain the past two years may well turn into ""real revenue-generating products"" in 2017, but he said more work is likely ahead.  Manuel told CoinDesk:  ""We still have three-to-five years of real, hard education and investigative work before you can say this is or isn't going to go anywhere. I think there's a lot of time here.""  DLT, not blockchain  Indeed, 'in flux' may be the right way to describe it.  Several interviewees noted the difference between 'pure' blockchain and the emerging variations of the technology, often termed 'distributed ledgers', that do not batch transactions as a means to mediate between untrusted entities.  ""One of the conclusions that companies that have already invested in blockchain strategies are beginning to come to is that pure blockchain has limitations,"" said Mercedes Tunstall, a partner in the public policy practice at the Washington, DC, law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP.  As a result, she said, ""There is a bit of a sense that maybe [blockchain] isn't going to bear all of the promise that has been talked about.""  Tunstall continued:  ""When people who have invested in this are coming to that conclusion, then other companies start to think that maybe this isn't a direction to go.""  However, distributed ledger technology, which uses a modified version of blockchain, or a blockchain as part of a larger architecture, may have more promise for some applications, particularly in payments.  ""I think that's something that even companies that have invested in pure blockchain are looking at as something that can be more flexible and more secure, so they may be moving forward along those lines,"" Tunstall said.  No magic bullet  Still others say blockchain's biggest business impact in 2017 may be creating a market for other, ancillary solutions.  Tom Gonser, a partner at Seven Peaks Ventures and the founder of DocuSign, where he earned the nickname, 'the father of electronic signatures', is someone who falls into this category of thinking.  ""Companies should be evaluating the business value versus the technical possibilities of blockchain implementations. In many cases, the business value can still be achieved by other non-blockchain means,"" he said.  He continued:  ""I expect the conversation between the 'purist' view of 'trustless' distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies and the more business-focused discussion about the need for distributed transaction processing will continue for some time.""  For now, Gonser says bluntly, ""blockchain technology is still in the hype phase"". And for companies outside the financial services sphere, he believes ""there is plenty of time before they must weigh in"".  Waiting game  All in all, most interviewees expressed the sentiment that time is on the side of incumbents, but that developments are ongoing.  ""I think the real question is whether progress is being made, and that answer is unequivocally yes,"" said Angus Champion de Crespigny, blockchain and distributed infrastructure strategy leader at EY.  Even Deloitte’s Piscini agrees about that, though he said financial services remains an industry that should strongly consider action.  ""Outside of financial services, the level of awareness and understanding of the blockchain potential is generally lower,"" he said.  Andy Singleton, the CEO and founder of Maxos, a Boston-based team of IT professionals that helps larger companies unlock new advantages, perhaps summed up the collective mindset when he stated that blockchain is not yet considered ""a stable foundation for applications"".  He concluded:  ""Users can afford to wait until 2018.""

42379219,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYCf,1486384275,Meet the Ex-Banker Using Ethereum to Take On Traditional Hedge Funds,"In the world of hedge funds, the old adage really is true: you have to have money to make money.  The barrier to entry for an individual investor is frequently $500,000, with portfolio managers themselves needing as much as $200m just to get started. But the potential rewards are equally large.  It was a tough lesson to learn for Mona El Isa, a former Goldman Sachs vice president, who after being selected as a member of Forbes 30 Under 30 and raising $30m for her own fund, found herself surprisingly under-prepared to compete against other much more heavily capitalized firms.  Dismayed by a competitive environment that favored those who already had vast fortunes, El Isa ceased her fund’s operation and took year off to study blockchain, a distributed ledger she believed had the power to level the hedge fund playing field by lowering the barrier to entry and lessening regulatory burdens.  Today, the ethereum-based hedge fund platform she founded as a result of that sabbatical is announcing the hire of George Hallam, the Ethereum Foundation's former head of external communications to help bridge the gap between hedge fund demand and blockchain technology.  El Isa told CoinDesk:  ""For people who are willing to consider reinventing the space from scratch, the really interesting property that I feel that blockchain can apply to asset management is it’s not just about automation, it’s about enforcement.""  Lowering the barrier  Founded in February 2016 and formally launched in August, Switzerland-based Melonport consists of a series of ethereum-based smart contracts designed to automate some of the most expensive aspects of building a hedge fund.  El Isa and her co-founder, mathematician and Solidity contributor Reto Trinkler, are now joined by their third hire, Hallam, who will run Melonport's business development practice.  To serve those aspiring hedge fund managers – and existing managers interested in potentially cutting costs – the Melonport protocol consists of two sets of ethereum-based smart contracts, Melon Core and Melon Modules, comprised of self-executing code programmed to execute tasks human beings would have carried out in the past.  While Melon Core executes to ensure that portfolio managers build services which adhere to the underlying codebase, Modules is a mix-and-match series of functions including price feeds, volatility calculations and daily P&L calculations that can be crafted into any number of hedge investment ideas.  Taken together, the two elements of the protocol are designed to help managers easily set up hedge funds, code predefined, immutable, investment parameters into the smart contracts that ensure commitments are kept, and leave an auditable track record of a fund’s success to help attract future investors and simplify regulatory compliance.  ""The idea is to catch people before they set up their fund and say to them: You don’t actually have to worry too much about the software,"" said El Isa.  If successful, the hedge fund platform could significantly lower the barrier to entry for aspiring hedge fund managers with a new model they want to test and limited funds.  Benefits of blockchain  Those new market participants, in turn, could theoretically reduce the minimum amount required to invest from hundreds of thousands of dollars, to fractions of an ether (ethereum's digital currency) or any number of future currencies capable of running on a blockchain.  The bootstrapped Melonport is part of young, but rapidly growing pool of asset management platforms currently pursuing similar blockchain-based solutions.  But there’s plenty of market share to fight over.  According to the most recent Preqin Global Hedge Fund Report, the total hedge fund industry assets under management in 2015 was $3.2tn, and that doesn’t even count the hedge funds that don’t exist yet because the barrier to entry is too high or the assets are too new.  Battling for a slice of both the existing market share, and market share that doesn’t yet exist are about 10 different firms that we know of.  Newly launched, diversified blockchain portfolio, CoinFund provided CoinDesk a document listing 11 decentralized asset management platforms (DAMPs), two of which are marked as 'dead', and seven of which are marked as pre-beta, including Melonport, Iconomi and Iterative Instinct (i2).  At the core of these services is a new value proposition brought by blockchain into the existing hedge fund strategies.  ""A lot of these processes can be done much more efficiently and faster and more effectively and more transparently to the investors investing in those hedge funds, by using smart contracts,"" said El Isa.  Token sale  While bootstrapped so far, plans are already in motion for Melonport to raise additional funds via a token sale in mid-February.  In the build-up to that event, Melonport has been working with nine partners to beta test its smart contracts.  Current partners include CoinFund, Satoshi Fund, Technologies Capital, and Privatemarket.io, among others, with additional partnerships currently in the works. ""We’re in discussions with many, many more,"" El Isa said.  Advisors to the project are Andreas Glarner, who has been working with Swiss legal firm MME to create new ways for ICOs to be legally compliant, blockchain venture capitalist Jehan Chu, and Gavin Wood, ethereum co-founder and founder of venture-backed Ethcore.  At Melonport's expected launch later this year, the investment opportunities provided will be limited to ether-denominated digital assets 'custodied' directly on the blockchain – a decision that will potentially simplify regulatory requirements.  On 15th February, the startup is set to begin selling its tokens, dubbed MLNs, to investors and those who want to use the hedge-fund service.  In total, 1,250,000 tokens will be created and dispersed over two periods, the second expected to occur later this year.  After launch, an unspecified amount of additional token will be minted ""periodically"" to incentivize the construction and maintenance of open-source modules.  Melonport joins a growing list of innovative investment vehicles not marketing its product to US investors due to regulatory concerns.  Beyond ether  Core to Melonport's business model is the idea of an 'Internet of blockchains' similar to advisor Gavin Wood's Polkadot project, to which Melonport co-founder Reto Trinkler was a contributor.  The end result could be the creation of a suite of investment tools based on the hedge fund manager's strategy. High-speed trading, for example conducted on an enterprise-grade version of ethereum, and longer-term investments conducted via blockchains with slower settlement times.  By August 2017, Melonport expects to implement version 1.0 of its protocol and complete the first audit of its code.  Additional audits are planned to occur through to 2018, with version 1.0 of its governance model implemented in February 2019, along with the final deployment  ""We have just completed a second prototype,"" El Isa told CoinDesk.

42379218,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYDv,1486378815,Blockchain as a Geopolitical Tool,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  CoinDesk published a news item this week that, at first, seemed pretty ordinary. Dig deeper, though and you uncover an unusual development that highlights intriguing socio-economic and geopolitical trends.  To begin, let’s look at the ""what, where and why"".  The What  A bank is implementing a blockchain-based cross-border payments system.  The National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the second largest lender in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), announced it would introduce real-time cross-border payments using Ripple technology – a move that makes it the first bank in the Middle East to do this.  The Where  The UAE is the sixth largest originator of remittances in the world, sending approximately $19bn a year (staggering given that it ranks 93rd in population).  This stems from the fact that 90% of the UAE’s residents are expats. Most are relatively low-paid workers from India, who help to fulfill the demand for labor generated by high infrastructure growth.  The region’s finance, technology, transport and energy sectors also attract a large community of foreign professionals.  The Why  It makes sense for banks to invest in a technology that can boost remittances in a region with strong cross-border flows. And according to the bank’s statement, the aim is to offer customers cheaper and faster payments.  However, that’s not the whole picture.  NBAD already has an innovative remittance structure. Given the weight of cross-border payments in bank activity, innovation in the sector has been flourishing, and prices have been under pressure due to stiff competition.  Many bank cross-border payment services take less than an hour as it is.  But with prices coming down, margins are tight, and banks have a strong incentive to reduce the costs of managing remittances. So, it's likely that the move to the blockchain has more to do with the bank’s profitability than the client’s experience.  Yet, even that is unlikely to see a big immediate impact. To start with, NBAD will not be migrating its remittance services to a blockchain. Instead, it plans to integrate the new service into its current offering, which mitigates both risk and the benefit to the bottom line.  While the effect will eventually be positive, the most interesting part of this step does not lie with the bank’s business model.  The big picture  Let's take a look at the outlook for the region.  While infrastructure growth is expected to remain strong at least until the 2020 World Expo, declining oil revenues cast clouds on the capacity of the government to maintain the same level of expenditure.  A resulting drop in immigration would have a negative impact not only on bank profits but also on the region’s GDP, compounding the effect of falling commodity prices and shifting international trade politics.  Here’s where we see change.  Recently, UAE institutions have shown increasing interest in blockchain technology and its use cases. Dubai’s Ministry of Finance is co-hosting a blockchain conference later this month with the IMF. One of the UAE’s largest telcos recently began securing health records on the blockchain. The Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange has launched a blockchain-based voting system. The government of Dubai is looking into the technology as part of its Smart Cities drive.  And this is just scratching the surface…  So, the latest initiative seems to be part of a broader push to explore and implement a promising new technology, which itself is part of an even grander goal.  With its future as a global energy center uncertain, the UAE has for some time been looking for other ways to maintain its role on the world stage. The flourishing communities of academia and research, a favorable tax regime, and the push to attract FinTech and blockchain startups all point to a strategy of strengthening the emirates’ position as a financial and technology hub.  Assuming it succeeds, the resulting inflow of talent and investment will create a virtuous cycle of innovation and more investment, cementing the region’s global reputation and relevance.  The lesson to all of us is that the blockchain is about much more than efficiency and innovation. It also is a powerful tool that can help to future-proof the growth and wealth of entire regions.
