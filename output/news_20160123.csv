42378571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ic0T,1453569044,Is Bitcoin Dead? Not the Part that Matters,"E tu, TechCrunch?  Like many in the digital currency community, I’m tired of the ""bitcoin is dead"" line that has permeated mainstream coverage of high-profile software developer Mike Hearn’s decision to quit the ""failed"" bitcoin experiment.  Yet if we contemplate this misguided storyline, there's much to learn from it. It's up to those of us who believe this technology truly matters and that, in some shape or form, it will change the world, to shift the narrative.  Let's use this opportunity to restart the public conversation.  The first thing to acknowledge is that the doomsayers might be partly right. In one, narrow sense, bitcoin as a mass-adopted currency is dead. Not technically, of course – it would take the deletion of all versions of the blockchain ledger to kill it – but socially.  Bitcoin simply won’t be, not any time soon, a replacement for the dollar.  The big idea  But what drew me and many others into this project was not the prospect that Mom and Pop would buy their groceries with bitcoin. It was the expansive core concept behind it.  This new, decentralized system for achieving consensus contained a very big idea.  For me, the first phase of discovery meant opening my eyes to the flaws in our current system for exchanging value and for keeping track of those exchanges. It helped me realize how, in letting powerful intermediaries resolve our persistent problem of mutual mistrust, we’ve made an unjust and inefficient society even more so. The second part was discovering that it’s possible to do things differently.  That very big idea is definitely not dead. In fact, the core technological concept behind bitcoin – which it to say its software-driven governance system, not the currency per se – is very much alive.  It is making people and organizations, from Fortune 500 companies to G8 governments, rethink the means through which we share valuable information. Independently, both the UK government and the IMF brought that point home this week.  Yet an outsider reading of Hearn’s noisy exit might well conclude that Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of bitcoin, achieved nothing.  That's because news reports tend to reduce this nuanced issue down to simple, binary terms: either bitcoin fails completely and has zero impact on the world or it succeeds and we all start exchanging it for goods and services.  Solving a thorny problem  That perspective says nothing about the astounding wave of innovation that’s fervently seeking the most effective way to implement bitcoin’s core idea.  It ignores the many new models for disintermediating payments, remittances, securities settlement, asset registries, escrow, notary services, supply chain logistics, copyright, contracts, voting, data storage, communal infrastructure management, and so much more.  Treating bitcoin as a static product that customers either like or dislike – as if akin to Coca-Cola – doesn’t take into consideration the constant protocol updates, the ongoing proposals and counterproposals for improvement, or the countless new applications that open up new use cases.  Joe Public has no idea, either, that there are myriad copies and partial copies of bitcoin’s open-source code in operation, alternative decentralized models for exchanging assets, keeping records and managing shared resources.  Still, in one sense, Hearn’s depressing analysis is accurate. The particular version of the “bitcoin” idea to which he is referring – the original one – has not been well managed.  This isn’t a technical issue. It’s political.  Scaling bitcoin’s protocol – in particular, resolving the heated debate over increasing the data capacity of the blockchain’s component blocks – is a much knottier problem than can be solved with a software fix.  A solution requires competing bitcoin stakeholders to negotiate a deal in an environment in which a) there is significant money at stake, b) there’s no ultimate arbitrating authority, and c) arguments play out on public forums such as Twitter, Reddit and IRC where it’s difficult to trade away one’s principles.  Still, when the only other option is self-destruction, people tend to reach compromises – whether in governments, boardrooms, or marriage. The bitcoin community is no different. As venture capitalist Fred Wilson said on this topic: ""Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room.""  The bigger problem is the damage this fight has done to the image of the broader cryptocurrency project among a woefully ill-informed public. That matters because the stakes are higher than ever.  Finding a balance  The growing interest in blockchain and distributed ledger applications in London, Washington, DC and New York suggests this core technology could become the back-office foundation of our global financial system. Knowing the harm that system’s vulnerabilities can cause, everyone should care about how this new architecture is designed.  Will its consensus system for proving transactions and affirming the ledger match the optimally decentralized, “trustless” aspirations of bitcoin and Ethereum?  Will it mix both trust and trustlessness as Ripple’s protocol does? Will it be run by an association of “permissioned” stakeholders – perhaps a federation of financial institutions, not-for-profit and regulatory agencies? Or will it be controlled by a consortium of banks?  It seems clear that bitcoin’s governance and scalability problems have for now ended the pure decentralized model’s chances of being adopted by Big Finance. But somewhere along that spectrum of decentralization lies a workable balance.  I, for one, believe a network of validators coordinated by a transparently run federation of differently aligned entities could provide a robust, near-incorruptible system.  But there are many smart cryptocurrency minds who argue that such a permissioned structure will be, at best, impractical and, at worst, attackable. What I am sure of is that we need a rigorous public debate on such issues.  Few specifics have been reported about what Hearn’s new employer, R3CEV, is up to. It has some of the finest minds working for it and I don’t doubt they are striving to make our financial system more efficient.  But let’s also not forget that its 42 members comprise what regulators call ""systemically important financial institutions"" — too-big-to-fail banks, to the rest of us. They are the very same powerful intermediaries that are in the crosshairs of every fintech developer building on bitcoin, Ethereum and other disruptive platforms. Why wouldn’t those banks design a system that entrenches their interests? Would that be in the broad public interest?  We need to be asking such questions. Now.  And when we do, our benchmark starting point should be that, thanks to bitcoin, we now know that the core objective of decentralization is not only important but possible.  Bitcoin is not dead.

42378573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ic2z,1453526269,Big Miners Back Bitcoin Classic As Scaling Debate Evolves,"Following a months-long debate on how best to scale the bitcoin network to accommodate a greater number of transactions, bitcoin mining firms are voicing their support for a newly introduced proposal called Bitcoin Classic.  Though a new entrant to the debate, Bitcoin Classic so far has the support of bitcoin developers including former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen, Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik and Ledger Journal editor Peter Rizun, among others. If adopted, Bitcoin Classic would increase the size of blocks on the bitcoin blockchain to 2MB, up from 1MB today.  The proposal has created controversy in the industry for running counter to the recommendations of the Bitcoin Core developers, the network's main development team, which has introduced a road map that advocates for a change that would not directly increase block size, but boost transaction capacity four-fold.  However, bitcoin mining firms believe that the solution to the scaling debate must come in the form of a direct increase to the network's block size limit, and that Bitcoin Classic offers a more immediate solution to the perception problem that bitcoin as a whole is not doing enough to accommodate new users.  To date, miners including BitFury, Bitmain and Genesis Mining are among seven groups that the Bitcoin Classic initiative has said have pledged support to the project.  At The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) this week, all three groups were vocal in their enthusiasm, putting forth the argument that Bitcoin Classic is the fastest way to achieve a solution that moves the open-source project forward.  Speaking on a panel session, BitFury CIO Alex Petrov explained:  ""Right now, the Bitcoin Core team is slowly introducing a solution, and it’s a really complicated solution, and it's been a half a year and they are still in tests. Bitcoin Classic is a fast answer.""  Elsewhere on the panel, FinalHash CTO Marshall Long, Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng and Bitmain's Yoshi Gato spoke positively about the proposal, while underscoring that they believe the industry is in need of a solution that prioritizes speed.  ""The transition with Bitcoin Classic can happen in a few weeks,"" Gato said.  Despite the consensus among the day's panelists, however, some Chinese miners have suggested that their support for Bitcoin Classic may be wavering, with major mining firms in China putting forth an uncertain stance on which proposal they favor.  Notably, developers like Andresen have voiced support for both proposals, suggesting others may be willing to align with whichever concept gains traction in the market, thus helping the network scale.  'Straightforward' solution  In his statements, Long perhaps best spoke to Bitcoin Classic's merits, calling the proposal the ""most direct"" from a technology standpoint.  The panelists indicated their belief that the Bitcoin Classic proposal only intends to increase increase the block size, and that additional changes will not be included as part of the proposal despite confusion it would also aim to change bitcoin's mining algorythm  ""We’re supporting Bitcoin Classic because we feel it solves the current problem,"" Streng told the audience. ""Bitcoin Classic is a proposal for increasing the block size without changing the rest.""  Still, some in the community are worried about the message such an action would send to the Bitcoin Core team and its developers.  For example, Blockstream CEO Austin Hill, whose company funds the work of many of Core's more notable developers, has argued that Bitcoin Classic sends a message that the efforts and reasoned recommendations of developers are under-appreciated.  Dangerous upgrade  But while straightforward in its rule changes, Bitcoin Classic differs from the road map put forward by Bitcoin Core in that it would require a hard fork of the bitcoin blockchain, meaning that it would enact a change that makes the latest edition of the software incompatible with older versions.  ""Core is saying, well the miners might do it, the service providers might do it, but not the merchants or other entities. That’s their argument, saying we have to be sure that everyone wants it,"" Streng continued.  Gato noted that there is a potential danger that a certain segment of the community will continue running Bitcoin Core, thus creating a situation where there are two versions of the bitcoin blockchain, each with transaction histories that couldn't be reconciled.  ""I think the perception of Bitcoin Classic is that because it’s a hard fork change, the existing system will branch into two separate blockchains,"" he said.  Petrov also argued that, despite the risk, time was of the essence in dealing with the problem given that blocks on the bitcoin blockchain are becoming increasingly full.  Calling it a ""question of survival"" for the project, Petrov added:  ""If the Bitcoin Core team doesn’t deliver [a solution] in time, we should force the process and that’s why we’re supporting classic. It’s not the best way, it’s painful, but we should do it.""  Overcoming obstacles  Still, Long voiced his opinion that the bitcoin community needs to come together to solve the human challenge involved in a hard fork given that, as more businesses and consumers seek to use the blockchain, it's likely future increases will be needed.  The opinion is similar to one originally voiced by Garzik at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong, at which the community's developers considered a number of solutions and theories on how blockchains can and could be designed.  ""One benefit that I think everyone agrees on is that if we do [a hard fork] gracefully, it proves that we can actually do something that form the outside is hard, not from a technological level, but a communication level,"" Long said.  Petrov acknowledged that ""a lot"" of work would need to be done to increase the community's awareness about the change, but that this was preferable to waiting on a solution.  Petrov concluded:  ""It will be not easy to implement, but we can do it one month. This is why we are supporting Bitcoin Classic.""
