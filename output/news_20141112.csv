42426165,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQlh,1415836075,DigitalTangible Launches Mail-Order Gold-to-Bitcoin Trading Service,"DigitalTangible has launched a new precious metals service that aims to target gold bar and coin owners who may be considering the digital currency market.  Called Bitcoin4Gold, the service allows verified users to mail physical gold to its dealer network, which can then be exchanged for bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin or darkcoin.  The product is the latest from crypto 2.0-powered gold and bitcoin trading service DigitalTangible, which launched its exchange service in September. DigitalTangible allows users to move between bitcoin and gold, and to receive cryptographic tokens that represent physical gold holdings.  Precious metals dealer Agora Commodities and Texas-based refinery and wholesaler Dillon Gage are handling the shipping and review process, while prospective sellers will use DigitalTangible’s web wallet to retrieve their digital currency of choice.  DigitalTangible  founder Taariq Lewis said that his company is betting that the time is right to open a new channel for gold owners that want to get in on bitcoin, given that the market has recently seen multi-year lows.  Lewis told CoinDesk that the service grew out of experiences working with gold dealers and investors, which includes maintaining a focus on customer trust and security, explaining:  “They control the private keys and we have two-factor authentication, so for new customers, they have a certain level of security they can start with and our goal is to further give them access to new, different tools they can use to secure their bitcoins.”  One-week wait time  Bitcoin4Gold works like other mail-in gold services, in which sellers mail in their gold to be inspected.  When using the service, users first make an account and generate an on-site wallet. Then they select the type of coin or gold bar they wish to exchange, generating an estimated amount of bitcoin for which the gold can be exchanged.  Depending on the mail option users select when sending in gold for inspection, the process can take up to a week between the gold shipment and the payment in bitcoin, the company said.  Once the gold has been verified, Bitcoin4Gold re-issues an estimate to the customer which has to be confirmed before the payout is issued.  ""Roundtrip, this should be between four days to one week from packaging and receiving bitcoins,"" Lewis said.  Gold market access to bitcoin limited  Lewis cited a need in the precious metal community for access points where buyers or sellers can acquire digital currencies through familiar channels as inspiration for the launch. While some in the metals industry remain skeptical, he said, others are looking to shift into bitcoin entirely.  Most people who trade in bullion work within smaller, trusted circles of dealers who may either not own bitcoin or have the ability to sell or trade it on site.  Lewis told CoinDesk:  “Gold customers who have gold don’t have a clear path to get to bitcoin. Most dealers don’t deal in bitcoin, and if they do, they don't have bitcoin for sale. We sensed an opportunity to appeal to folks who do have gold, physical gold, but are looking to exit or change into a different assets.”  He added that in addition to giving this customer base a new onramp to bitcoin access, the service helps the digital currency ecosystem grow as a whole by bringing in new entrants.  Real demand for bitcoin  Lewis said that based on his company’s work in the precious metals market, he sees real demand among some investor for ways to shift directly from gold to bitcoin.  Outside of direct sales, investors often have to pay premiums using either bitcoin ATMs or online services that requires the use of a credit card.  He explained:  “What we’re being told is that education is still required, a large amount, but that folks are looking for ways to test bitcoin, to get a little bit and see how it works. We see ourselves as gently providing that onramp.”  Lewis' comments echoed previous statements from Agora Commodities founder Joseph Castillo, who in August said that there is grassroots support among precious metals investors who see long-term promise in the technology underlying bitcoin. However, slow adoption within the broader industry makes the acquisition process more difficult for some people.  Lewis added that despite the rise of bitcoin and problems in the gold market, bullion isn’t going anywhere any time soon.  “Bitcoin has a long way to mature, and we believe that gold has been here for quite some time and it will be here for a while,” he said.

42426167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQph,1415832660,Tim Draper-Backed Bitcoin Exchange Vaurum Rebrands as Mirror,"Vaurum, an institutional-grade exchange platform for bitcoin investors, has changed its name to Mirror.  The Palo Alto-based company aims to build out a ‘mirror’ of the traditional financial system by providing more liquidity to bitcoin markets.  In a blog post published today about the rebranding, Mirror presented its platform as one that would include several advanced services including escrow-based trading and liquidity. Mirror also announced some service consolidation that it said will allow the company to leverage technology it is building to develop cryptocurrency into a more advanced asset class.  Mirror  CEO Avish Bhama said that increasing liquidity in the bitcoin markets makes the ecosystem safer for everyone involved:  “We're focused on providing liquidity and facilitating trading in a safe way by eliminating as much counterparty risk as we can.”  The exchange is an invitation-only platform right now, but prospective customers can sign up to request access.  “We're currently onboarding investors, market makers, over-the-counter (OTC) traders and bitcoin businesses,"" said Bhama. ""We evaluate each sign up on a case by case basis and will be sending out invites at an increasing rate as we prepare to open it up publicly.""  Putting Silk Road bitcoins to work  Notably, Mirror was the beneficiary of Tim Draper’s purchase of almost 30,000 BTC seized from Silk Road and sold at auction by the US Marshals Service.  The company is now using those coins to help its investor user base.  “This inherently provides liquidity to all of our customers that are looking to get exposure to bitcoin,” said Bhama.  There are plenty of exchanges in the bitcoin ecosystem already, but Mirror wants to give investors liquidity access to bitcoin globally. It plans to do this by targeting specific markets where exchange structure is not robust.  Bhama added:  “It's especially helpful for customers in international markets where liquidity is harder to come by – we will be rolling our platform out to more geographies as we get to scale.”  The company also aims to reduce counterparty risk in order to ensure investor funds are secure, by using licensed escrow attorneys to make sure trades and coins are always protected.  Developing investor-grade products  Bitcoin is still very small by market capitalization when compared to the traditional markets, and the need for more liquidity within exchanges is an ongoing issue in the industry. However, a number of startups are looking to attract the traditional investment sector to cryptocurrencies.  SecondMarket was expected to launch an institutional bitcoin exchange this year, but it still only offers the Bitcoin Investment Trust, its managed investment vehicle. Other companies looking to cater to larger investors include exchanges itBit and Coinsetter, which are both based in the finance hub of New York City.  Mirror was part of the Tribe 2 class in bitcoin-centric startup accelerator Boost VC. In May, the company raised a $4m seed round from investors that included Battery Ventures, Tim Draper and former AOL CEO Steve Case.  It also recently brought on former SEC chair Arthur Levitt to advise on compliance issues.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in SecondMarket.

42426164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQjh,1415827863,BitPay Partners With Trucoin to Bring Bitcoin ATMs to Bowl Game,"BitPay has confirmed there will be at least five bitcoin ATMs installed either at or around Tropicana Field for the upcoming Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl to be held this December.  Trucoin will debut a custom bitcoin ATM solution and serve as the ""preferred provider"" of bitcoin ATMs for the event. The Georgia-based bitcoin brokerage indicated it would showcase five units manufactured by Genmega (which also supplies ATM hardware to Genesis Coin) and retooled with the company’s custom software and compliance features.  Trucoin  co-founder and president Chris Brunner stressed that Trucoin still aims to focus on its bitcoin brokerage service, and that its latest offering is simply an extension of its goal albeit in a new, high-profile setting.  Brunner told CoinDesk:  “BitPay reached out to us because they were looking for a compliant bitcoin ATM solution for the event. [...] As we’ve done in similar cases where we couldn’t find a solution, we've built it and this is the product of that.”  Trucoin's original ATM was purchased from Genesis Coin, using a custom version of its software that Brunner said could offer fans the ability to buy bitcoin with their debit cards at the big game.  Announced in June, the Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl will be held on 26th December in St Petersburg, Florida. The college football teams that will participate in the contest have yet to be announced.  A spokesperson for BitPay said that while it had previously advertised that bitcoin ATMs would be made available for the game, this marks the company's first step toward delivering on this part of its event planning.  Emphasis on familiarity  Brunner went on to suggest that Trucoin’s custom bitcoin ATM software will take a different approach than others currently on the market through a streamlined user experience and the addition of debit card purchasing.  This, Brunner argued, will be key to appealing to the more novice bitcoin users at the game.  “A lot of the bitcoin ATM solutions that exist today are not things that most people would recognize as ATMs,” Brunner explained. “We leveraged our ability to pay with cards and mitigate the chargeback risk and brought that to a physical form factor.”  Brunner plans to potentially enlist the services of traditional ATM manufacturers to help Trucoin with the refinement of its product. Ultimately, he said Trucoin could create what he called the first hybrid bitcoin ATM that connects to a traditional ATM network.  “We don’t want to change people’s behavior,” he said. “What we want to do is serve the general public, and if the expectation is that you can walk up to an ATM and get cash, we feel like we should be able to offer the same thing.”  Future of ATM service unclear  Trucoin indicated that it will wait to assess the interest level in its offering following the bitcoin bowl before integrating its ATM software fully into the company’s strategy. However, it cautioned that development is still fluid at this time.  At least one bitcoin ATM unit with the software is already operational, the company said, adding that it demoed the device at BitPay’s headquarters earlier this year. BitPay suggested that other bitcoin ATMs may be added for the bowl game at a later date, stating only that ""plans are still being finalized"".  Though it will act as the operators of the bitcoin ATMs for the game itself, Brunner said Trucoin is already looking for interested parties to offer the machines permanent homes.  If the response is strong and its final solution is compelling, Brunner suggested that Trucoin could press forward into an already crowded bitcoin ATM vertical.  Trucoin is currently seeking to refine its solution, suggesting it may partner with Genesis Coin for the final product or build a unique solution with other partners.

42426154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQNh,1415809034,Bitcoin Price Surges Past $400 Mark,"The price of bitcoin has surged past $400, gaining over 9% today at press time.  Last time the CoinDesk BPI closed at over $400 was in late September, although the price briefly hit $409 in mid-October.  For the first nine months of the year the price remained well above $400, aside from the BTC-e flash crash in August and a brief slump in April, likely caused by deposit freezes at Chinese exchanges.  Gradually declining from July onwards, bitcoin reached a low of $319 on the 5th October, by far the worst month of the year in terms of price.  By 14th October the price had rebounded, with the CoinDesk BPI hitting $398. The recovery was short lived, however, and prices tumbled below the $350 mark over the next two weeks.  November started on a low note, with the price hovering in the $320-$325 range for the first few days, before recovering slightly, albeit slowly, on the 9th November.  That morning, the price opened at $344, crossing the $360 mark by the day's close.  Aside from a brief dip yesterday, 11th November, the price has continued climbing, eventually crossing the $400 boundary earlier today.  Time for cautious optimism?  It should be noted that the biggest price rally in bitcoin history – rocketing from under $300 to over $1,000 – started almost exactly a year ago to the day.  This spike did not last long, however, and bitcoin's value began falling in December, followed by a protracted period of extreme volatility.  It's always hard, if not impossible, to pin down the exact cause of price changes. Last year’s rally came just a few weeks after the FBI closed illicit black market Silk Road.  While some may argue that the latest rally roughly coincides with the seizure of Silk Road 2.0 and numerous other dark web sites just days ago, it's impossible to correlate the two events for certain.  Other factors suggested by community members include the celebration of ‘Singles Day’ in China, which is known to generate a lot of e-commerce traffic.  Data from Blockchain points to a steady increase in the number of daily transactions, although that change is not followed by a corresponding rise in transaction fees. This, in turn, points to a greater number of non-commercial transactions taking place.  Correction: A previous version of this article omitted the fact that the price of bitcoin had crossed $400 on the 14th October. This has since been corrected.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/12/bitcoin-price-surges-past-400-mark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59b85c24c32c83a50e088050a25f3062c3062daa-744x421.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426168,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQrh,1415804713,Developer Mentoring Service Codementor Announces Bitcoin Support,"Online developers' marketplace Codementor has integrated bitcoin for payments and payouts for its online mentoring service.  Codementor  is a live help marketplace that allows developers around the world to get on-demand, live, one-on-one support via screen sharing, video and chat. The company is based in Taiwan and the San Francisco Bay area.  The service boasts more than 1,500 vetted experts, including a number of authors and engineers at major tech firms. Developers can apply to become mentors, set their own prices and join the marketplace with relative ease.  Demand for bitcoin  Codementor said it decided to embrace digital currency due to popular demand, as bitcoin support was one of the top requested features on the service. Another reason was economics, as the low transaction fees associated with bitcoin could boost the company’s profit margins.  Notably, the firm has partnered with Coinbase as its bitcoin payment processor.  Codementor CEO and founder Weiting Liu told CoinDesk that the company is experiencing rapid growth of about 30% month-on-month.  “Up until this point, users could only pay by credit card via Stripe. For pay-outs to mentors, we've been using PayPal and ACH Direct, which is US only,” said Liu.  Liu explained how bitcoin could help Codementor develop its business model and boost profitability:  “Codementor takes a platform fee between 10-20%. Bitcoin has the potential to increase our margin, as it lowers the processing fee we'd be paying for payment and pay-out processors.”  Developers keen to join the marketplace need to sign up, set their rate in 15-minute increments and, once they are approved on the platform, they can offer their services to fellow developers in need of assistance.  Codementor allows developers the choice of different prepaid credit options and also allows them to earn free credit.  Bitcoin adds even more flexibility and efficiency to Codementor’s model by streamlining the process and making the platform more appealing to a global audience of developers, Liu said.  “Bitcoin has the potential to help Codementor become a more efficient marketplace – some mentors are based in countries where existing payment solutions either don't exist or charge a high fee,” he said.  Liu argued that bitcoin could accelerate Codementor’s international growth by addressing these issues, thus making it a viable platform for developers in regions neglected by existing payment platforms.  Gap in the market  Liu pointed out that Codementor’s roster of expert coders includes O’Reilly authors, top Stack Overflow experts, creators of popular libraries and engineers at Amazon, Google and other top tech firms.  Liu explained explained that Codementor offers services that sites like Stack Overflow can't, saying:  “Not all issues are 'questions' that can be googled. For example, 'Can you help me design my architecture based on our unique criteria?' or 'Can you pair program with me?' If Stack Overflow could solve all worries, people would just hire an army of junior developers and ask them to search on Stack Overflow whenever they run into trouble.”  He added that his firm differs from expensive developer bootcamps too, since it provides more flexibility.  Most bootcamps, he explained, have a different business model, requiring applicants to make a substantial financial commitment and set aside significant time to complete their training programmes.

42426157,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQVh,1415794295,Singapore Event Puts Bitcoin on Mainstream Finance Agenda,"Singapore played host last week to a digital currency-centered conference led by two of its leading financial organizations. At issue were cryptocurrencies' place in financial industry innovation, and Singapore's own unique role in developing the ecosystem.  The inaugural CAIA-SKBI Cryptocurrency Conference on 4th November was significant as it was organized jointly by the Sim Kee Boon Institute (SKBI) for Financial Economics at Singapore Management University (SMU) and the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association – both of which lie outside the cryptocurrency industry.  Key points of discussion were the the correct definition of bitcoin and the various implications for cryptocurrency as a part of the mainstream financial industry, including markets, accounting and payments.  The event also looked at whether Singapore offered a conducive environment for digital currency innovation, and whether blockchain technology and/or 'smart contracts' could solve unique Asian problems.  Roughly 250 people attended, representing stakeholders from government to academia and the business community – both digital currency-related and 'mainstream'.  Problems to solve  The conference was organized by SKBI under the leadership of Professor David Lee, who is recognized for being at the forefront of new technologies in Singapore.  Guest panelists  included Scott Robinson of Silicon Valley startup accelerator Plug and Play Tech Centre; author and head of business development at Melotic, Tim Swanson; Anson Zeall from Coinpip; and venture capitalist Alyse Killeen.  Co-organizer Mikkel Larsen, an advisor to Singapore-based Tembusu Terminals and managing director at major bank DBS, told CoinDesk that while there are still fundamental unresolved issues for bitcoin in accounting and legal status, Singapore's regulators had provided clarity sooner than others.  This would be helpful in making bitcoin a viable and widespread currency, he said, while spurring innovation with other blockchain technologies.  That said, Larsen continued, bitcoin still faces numerous hurdles before it finds acceptance in the traditional financial system:  ""Trust is the primary issue for banks and consumers. An equally important impediment is, of course, regulation that is still missing in multiple aspects. It hampers the adoption of any currency, and ,perhaps more importantly, the underlying technology.""  Bitcoin's inherent problems would limit its chances of finding a place in the financial ecosystem, he said. Other altcoins offering technological improvements might be able to solve those problems, and Tembusu is working on its own 'proof of identity' concept that might be part of the solution.  [post-quote]  Alternative blockchain technologies may find their own logical use cases in different places within the finance industry.  ""Banks in general are looking at multiple platforms like Ripple, Falcon, Epiphyte etc for the most obvious uses like cross-border transfer,"" said Larsen. ""Smart contracts are still seen as holding promise with time for self-execution lending contracts perhaps, and so one needs to understand the technology and stay close to developments.""  'Unique opportunity'  CoinDesk also spoke to several of the other panelists to hear their perspectives on the conference's significance and the issues it covered.  Plug and Play's Scott Robinson said he is ""pretty excited"" about the Singapore ecosystem. The conference provided the opportunity for several key and forward-thinking stakeholders to interact.  ""I think Singapore is an interesting test bed due to its Internet connectivity (there is wireless/cellphone coverage everywhere) and an educated but incredibly diverse demographic with only around 5.5 million in population.""  As an early investor in companies like PayPal, Lending Club and Credit Sesame, he said at the conference, Plug and Play sees a unique opportunity to embrace FinTech in the growing innovation ecosystem embraced by Singapore.  Currency, commodity or asset?  Melotic  's Tim Swanson focused on bitcoin's status as a currency, commodity or emerging asset class – a topic he researched in depth for his book The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity: A Study of Bitcoin.  ""While this is ultimately an empirical issue, the market so far – based on blockchain behavior – suggests that it could be some form of commodity. As to whether or not it can go the distance and become an entrenched asset class is another issue altogether, largely due to the tendency for all proof-of-work based blockchains to ultimately 'self-destruct' due to block rewards.""  Perhaps this will change in future, he added, but bitcoin's built-in 'monetary policy' might not be able to incentivize its labor force to stick around long enough to make bitcoin a viable asset class.  Different perspectives  From his perspective as a bitcoin business operator, Coinpip's Anson Zeall said the conference was a valuable experience as it offered a ""reality check"" and a frank look at bitcoin's issues from outside its own ecosystem.  ""I have been to many different bitcoin conferences and there is a term for all the conferences that are bitcoin centric – 'preaching to the choir'. This conference was very different in the sense that regulation is a heavy topic and that we hear the feedback and opinions, not only from the bitcoin community, but from the people that work in traditional sectors such as banking, finance, accounting and so on.""  That said, Zeall remains sure that bitcoin will ""hit the mainstream, no doubt"".  VC Alyse Killeen, of March Capital Partners and Clearstone Venture Partners, was also optimistic. Bitcoin, she said, removed dependency on traditional financial institutions, thus offering more individuals and organizations access to the global marketplace.  ""In 10 years, the most important impact that bitcoin will be measured to have had is the global marketplace inclusion of billions of souls now unbanked and underbanked. Bitcoin is an advancement of currency in a similar way that email is an advancement of communication from the post.""  The efficiencies bitcoin creates will strengthen traditional global commerce and the global sharing economy, she added, and would catalyze the GDPs of countries that foster bitcoin innovation and adoption.  Solutions for Asia  As to the question of what blockchain and similar technologies could offer Asia in particular, Larsen agreed with Killeen's point about financial inclusivity.  ""Key amongst them are those of urban poverty, where penetration of mobile phones including smart phones are high and where digital currency technology can provide real solutions. Philippines is a good example, but Indonesia, Malaysia and India are others.""  Companies like Coins.ph put the initial focus on cross-border payments and remittances, but in Asia there are ""multiple native issues"", including crowdfunding, community-based lending and asset right registration, which also provided viable use cases.  While these issues existed both in and outside Asia, he suggested cultural differences, in addition to the different rates of mobile technology penetration and urbanization, suggest that Asia may need its own tailored solutions based on the same technologies.

42426159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQbh,1415779529,Huobi's BitYes Teams with EgoPay for Fee-Free USD Deposits,"BitYes, the international USD-based exchange operated by Huobi, has relaunched with a new design, stop orders and a fee-free promotion that should appeal to higher-volume customers depositing via payment processor EgoPay.  Until 31st December, BitYes is offering zero fees for deposits, withdrawals and trading for customers outside the US using EgoPay, claiming it is ""the cheapest way in the world for anyone to acquire a large amount of bitcoin for USD"".  Customers would still need to pay a roughly $30 fee to wire money to an EgoPay account internationally and a $12 EgoPay deposit fee, but this still works out cheaper than other major USD trading options for international customers in many cases.  China-based Huobi says for a customer seeking to trade an amount like $100,000 for BTC at market prices, the flat fees work out to 0.042%.  For that amount, the firm says, this is lower than Coinbase's 1% trading fee, Bitstamp's 0.22% plus deposit fees (all in addition to individual banks' wire transfer fees), or the premium asked to trade face-to-face via a service like LocalBitcoins.  BitYes is also running a competition in which two users who deposit $500 or more will win one prize of 1 BTC and another of $300.  As part of the site redesign, it has also added stop order functions for traders to set their preferred buy and sell prices.  No US fiat deposits  Somewhat ironically, despite being a USD-to-cryptocurrency exchange, BitYes does not accept fiat deposits from US residents due to its regulatory environment.  A Huobi spokesperson said about 35% of BitYes users are from China and the rest are international, with Canada, UK and Australia leading the list.  US residents are still able to deposit and trade both bitcoin and litecoin. Huobi is working with compliance experts to open up the market to US residents as soon as possible.  Huobi's Hong Kong-registered subsidiary, launched in September with the goal of capturing some of the US dollar trade. The company describes its compliance framework as ""robust"" with KYC/AML policies formed in cooperation with third-party experts and service providers.  In addition to EgoPay, BitYes also supports deposits and withdrawals internationally via OKPAY and wire transfer. Wire transfers typically take around two to four days to process, but transfers through the third-party payment processors are instant.  Normally, the exchange has a 0.2% standard trading fee, a 1% fiat currency deposit fee, a 2% Egopay withdrawal fee, or a 0.1% fee for withdrawal to bank card. Withdrawals in digital currency (BTC or LTC) are free.
