According to a blog post  , U.S. customers can withdraw their Coinbase balances to PayPal immediately and without any fees. The new arrangement allows customers to quickly convert their cryptocurrency holdings to cash, wrote Allen Osgood, who works on product at the exchange.  Coinbase announced it was bringing back a PayPal integration last month, noting that customers will only be able to make withdrawals using PayPal. Users won't be able to buy cryptocurrencies via PayPal.  The exchange previously had a PayPal integration, but the company ceased offering the service due to technical issues earlier this year.  A spokesperson for the exchange told CoinDesk that ""there is new functionality that was improved from the prior one,"" adding:  ""There is new technical work to make this possible, and that was done in conjunction with PayPal.""  On Friday, Osgood wrote that the partnership provides Coinbase customers an alternative to the traditional federal wire or automated clearing house (ACH) network that they were previously required to use.  He added:  ""These traditional finance networks can add up to two business days to a withdrawal. We’re always looking for ways to not only meet the bar set by traditional finance, but raise it. That’s why we rebuilt our integration to ensure that the speed and reliability of PayPal withdrawals does just that.""  The service is only available to U.S. customers for now, a Coinbase spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk. Support for PayPal withdrawals in other nations will continue to be added across 2019, Osgood wrote on Friday.

42402337,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41yl,1544810426,This Binance Labs-Backed Crypto Startup Wants to Anonymize Everything,"“We’ve been fucking up this mixnet idea for 39 years.”  That’s how lead developer David Stainton introduced the mixing tech that powers Nym Technologies, a stealth anonymity startup that sports a roster of privacy activists and cryptography heavyweights from around the world.  An open infrastructure based on a near-forgotten anonymity system named mix networks, Nym is now entering the proof-of-concept phase following a 10-week incubation program with Binance Labs.  The goal of the project? According to Harry Halpin – an advisor to Nym precursor Panoramix – the objective is ""to anonymize the world.""  Showcasing the new technology is a proof-of-concept cryptocurrency wallet built by bitcoin developer and revolutionary Amir Taaki – what he calls “Darkwallet 2.0,” named after privacy-preserving bitcoin wallet he built in 2014 that shares the same name.  “We’re gathering some of the top academics in the world so that we can develop fully anonymous, unlinkable cryptocurrency,” Taaki told CoinDesk.  In its first iteration, Taaki has coded up an implementation of Mimblewimble, a privacy-oriented protocol that achieves high scalability by fusing transactions together on the blockchain. Going forward, Taaki said Darkwallet 2.0 will be able to send transactions with potentially any cryptocurrency.  And that’s notable because, while existing privacy-centric cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash hide transactions on the blockchain itself, the method still reveals information at the network level.  For example, sensitive details like IP addresses and location data can be exposed. And while solutions such as Tor and VPN’s offer ways to conceal this information, they each come with their own tradeoffs – which Nym is positioning itself to solve.  And Darkwallet is only the first step towards a totalizing anonymity ecosystem that Nym plans to support. Going forward, Nym intends to provide an open platform for privacy-enhanced applications to realize themselves. This is something which, according to those involved in the project, is essential to preserve liberty in the digital age.  “It is impossible to have freedom under a regime of pervasive surveillance which attempts to control and manipulate all of your actions,” Halpin told CoinDesk, adding:  “The only way to fight for freedom effectively in such an age of surveillance is to build and use privacy-enhancing technologies.”  A cypherpunk dream  While the pursuit of Nym Technologies is wide in scope, the first step of the project is to design a cryptocurrency wallet that can offer network level anonymity for privacy-centric cryptocurrencies.  “We have not seen much progress in terms of what we call network level anonymity, the ability to essentially hide, not on the blockchain level, but on a peer-to-peer level, what peer a particular transaction is coming from,” Halpin, who is researcher at Inria de Paris, and former team member at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), said.  Mix networks solve this by obscuring information about who is sending to who, which will remain unlinkable even if an adversary is observing all corners of the network. Equally, Halpin said even if the mix network is infiltrated by adversaries, it only requires one honest node in order to maintain the same security properties.  As such, Taaki’s Darkwallet showcases that mix networks can be leveraged for cryptocurrencies to achieve more robust anonymity – even against a global adversary – something that Halpin calls the “cypherpunk dream.”  “Only by hiding metadata on the network level can you actually be assured that your application provides real privacy,” Halpin said. “Otherwise a powerful adversary can always violate your privacy.”  Taaki echoed this, telling CoinDesk that tools like fully anonymous cryptocurrency will enable individuals to resist oppressive regulatory forces – which is especially relevant as governments move to track even privacy-centric coins.  He explained:  “We’re in an arms race between regulators moving at the speed of law and technology which moves at the speed of light, and if we have a fighting attitude this is a battle that the state will lose.”  Mix networks  Stepping back, Nym Technologies evolved from research originally commissioned by the European Union in the wake of the Snowden revelations, in the form of Panoramix, a cross-university research project that has been active for the past four years.  As part of the Panoramix research, UCL’s George Danezis, author of the earliest mix net implementations, created a system named Loopix alongside his student, Ania Piotrowska.  “The Nym project will take some of those implementations effectively productize them,” Danezis said.  A legendary pursuit of the cypherpunks, mixnets were first conceived by David Chaum in 1979. However, they were later abandoned for products like Tor, the highly popular anonymous communications software that has been active since 2002.  Originally deployed for email services, mix networks work by shuffling information within a system so that by the time it exits, it is unmatchable with the information that was entered.  In their early days, mixnets were frustrating and expensive to use. But according to Danezis, mixnets are more viable now due to the shifting economics underpinning the internet, which enable Loopix to achieve higher anonymity at the cost of bandwidth, compared to existing systems.  In particular, early mixnet implementations used time delays to break the pattern of information as it entered and left the system. However, with no indication of how long a message might take to process, this came at a high cost to the user experience.  As such, Loopix keeps this time delay – also known as latency – low, but does so without sacrificing anonymity. In particular, it works by injecting high amounts of cover traffic into the system, which breaks the pattern between messages at the cost of bandwidth.  “We’re going to keep latency very low, so it will arrive quite fast, but we’re going to inject we’re going to inject lots of useless traffic that is only there to confuse the adversary,” Danezis said, explaining:  “Since bandwidth these days is cheaper that doesn’t bother anyone. Having a Loopix connection is going to be way less than watching Netflix or anything like that.”  Secure pseudonyms  Going forward, Nym Technologies hopes to build all the essential building blocks that are needed for different parties to interact in a privacy-respecting manner on a network.  For example, Taaki hopes to add smart contract functionality to the new Darkwallet, so that it can swap between different cryptocurrencies and even host decentralized autonomous organizations.  “The first step is development of fast, efficient, purely anonymous, unlinkable cryptocurrency. And afterwards, we can talk about decentralized exchanges and all new forms of applications that protect the individual,” Taaki said.  And Nym Technologies has other hopes to support the development of a full anonymous ecosystem as well. The mix network itself, for example, can be used for anything from secure messaging to digital voting.  Tying this together is a signature scheme named Coconut, that was developed by Danezis at UCL. Essentially, Coconut combines with the mixnet to provide an anonymous credential, that will allow users to verify identity on the mixnet without sacrificing any information.  “We are trying to solve that problem of both authentication in a privacy-friendly way. and secure transport that doesn’t leak your identity, in general for privacy-minded services,” Danezis said.  This can be used to authenticate users as they access services, Danezis said, as well as protect the mixnet against Sybil attacks. Additionally, it could also be used to provide incentives for the services in the future.  “It’s just a generic infrastructure, and an infrastructure that doesn’t really care at the end of the day about the application, as long as the application is privacy-friendly, there is no limit to what you can do,” he continued.  In this pursuit, Halpin said the cryptocurrency industry is uniquely placed. While historically, monetary support for privacy-enhancing technologies has been low, developments in blockchain allow for new kinds of funding models to take place.  “That has never been possible before this moment in history. It’s a very special moment to be alive,” Halpin said, concluding:  “I really hope that cryptocurrency community really doubles down on cypherpunk vision and tries to make it a reality. This may be the last best chance we have.”  Image: Harry Halpin and Amir Taaki at the Web3 Summit 2018, credit to the Web3 Foundation  The headline of this article has been updated to reflect that Binance Labs, not crypto exchange Binance itself, made the investment.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH | BNB,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/12/14/this-binance-labs-backed-crypto-startup-wants-to-anonymize-everything,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8439104625a735b90d6080566a72485e526fc53a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41pu,1544804453,Ethereum Chat Startup Status Lays Off 25% of Staff,"Ethereum browser startup Status.IM is cutting a quarter of its staff due to the ongoing downturn in cryptocurrency prices.  Announcing the move internally on Monday, co-founder Jarrad Hope said that the startup is much larger than can be sustained due to the fact that the company did not anticipate ethereum's price dropping more than 80 percent.  COO Nabil Naghdy first publicly confirmed the layoffs when reached by CoinDesk on Friday.  The company originally raised 300,000 ETH during a token sale last year, which was worth $105 million at the time (at present prices, the same amount of ether is worth roughly $25.2 million).  Status.IM also did not have ""solid banking partners"" until the second quarter of this year, exacerbating the issue, he said.  As such, Status.IM cut 25 percent of its staff – about 25 individuals – on Monday. Those laid off are considered ""non-essential"" to the project's long-term goals, according to Hope.  The company is looking to stretch its fiat currency holdings to cover its expenses for roughly another six months. Status is also asking current employees to accept pay cuts, “which will alleviate as the market picks up,"" Hope said. Employees will then receive a greater amount of SNT tokens ""to help offset the cut.""  Still, this may not be enough, as Hope went on to explain:  ""The reality is that we will have to make another assessment end of Q2 which if the market hasn’t picked up we will be forced to make the organization even leaner, and the remaining fiat and our large ETH holdings will be used to create a runway measured in years.""  The startup's priorities over the next several months are to deliver on promises made in its white paper and ""get the app into a usable state,"" he wrote.  Naghdy told CoinDesk that, despite the cuts, ""we continue to have a large and stable engineering team"" working on both the white paper promises and an ethereum 2.0 implementation dubbed Nimbus.  Aside from the fiat holdings, Status has roughly 190,000 ETH to tap as a resource, Naghdy said.

42402342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd422h,1544799659,EU Parliament Calls for Action on Blockchain Adoption in Trade,"The European Parliament (EP) has called for measures to boost blockchain adoption in trade and business across the region.  The legislative body adopted a resolution on Thursday, dubbed “Blockchain: a forward-looking trade policy,” setting out how the nascent technology could improve EU trade policies, including free trade and mutual recognition agreements.  Blockchain could improve supply chain transparency, streamline trade processes, reduce costs and corruption, detect tax evasion and improve the security of data, the EP said. Cybersecurity, it added, remains a key challenge, however.  The resolution went on to explain that, despite previous trade successes, EU free trade agreements still remain underutilized. On an average, only 67 percent of exporters and 90 percent of importers make use of the preferential tariffs in the EU and its partner nations.  Using blockchain tech, traders could upload all their documents in one place, including those related to compliance, to benefit from the preferential tariffs, it said. The tech could also help authorities to automatically get information from these parties and improve verification and trade processes.  Small- and medium-sized enterprises could also benefit from blockchain, the EP says, as it would allow better communication between parties, secure payments and simplify business through the use of smart contracts.  The institution stressed the need to develop “global interoperability standards” to facilitate transactions across blockchains for smoother supply chain processes.  It further called on the European Commission to track ongoing global supply chain pilot projects and draft rules for blockchain's applicability to international trade, as well as to set up an advisory committee on blockchain within the Directorate General for Trade, among other requests.  Lastly, the European Parliament reminded the commission that:  ""The EU has an opportunity to become a leading actor in the field of blockchain and international trade, and that it should be an influential actor in shaping its development globally, together with international partners.”  The resolution marks the latest positive step toward blockchain adoption in the EU region. Earlier this month, seven southern European states – France, Italy, Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Portugal and Spain – signed a joint declaration to promote the use of blockchain in order to transform their economies.

The firm announced Thursday that the new license will ultimately allow it to offer users an account to manage all their finances from a single place through its upcoming venture Revolut Bank.  That vision is a little way off, however. The firm said it must first build and test the features to be offered, as well as work with regulators over the coming months. Services enabled by the new license will be trialed in Lithuania next year and will expand to other European markets later in 2019.  All being well, the bank plans to launch full current accounts, overdrafts, personal loans, direct debits, an in-house payment processor, and other traditional banking services. Current account deposits of up to €100,000 (around $113,000) would also be protected under the European Deposit Insurance Scheme upon the banking launch, the firm said.  Founded in 2015, Revolut launched a bitcoin trading service in July of last year, after raising $66 million in a Series B funding round.  Later, in December, it added support for litecoin and ether, with XRP and bitcoin cash following in May of this year. The firm now supports a total of 5 cryptocurrencies and 25 fiat currencies.

42402336,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41xm,1544792446,Sephora Shoppers Are Getting Their First Bitcoin Using Crypto Startup Lolli,"This holiday shopping season, hundreds of women are earning their first bitcoin by buying items online with an in-browser app called Lolli.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, cosmetics chain Sephora has joined the list of retailers where shoppers can earn cash back, in the form of bitcoin, through an app called Lolli. The bitcoin rewards startup says it won over the beauty chain with data: specifically, 30 percent of the app’s thousands of users are women.  “We’ve gone back to a lot of these retailers that previously were not interested but now are coming on-board,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk. “One of the biggest ones that just joined us is Sephora, which adds an entire suite of retailers in the beauty category.”  Lolli’s partners, including beauty retailers like Ulta and fashion brands such as Everlane, pay it for customer referrals and give the e-commerce startup fiat, which it converts into bitcoin rewards for shoppers. Despite the broader bear market, or perhaps because of it, this lean 6-person startup is actually gaining traction while other crypto startups face layoffs.  Sephora did not respond to requests for comment, but San Francisco-based marketing consultant Thien-Kim Ngo said she earned her first bitcoin from Everlane and Sephora by using Lolli. Now, Ngo said, she wants to learn more about investing as she acquires more bitcoin.  “I had been kind of interested for a couple of years now,” Ngo told CoinDesk, adding that other ways of acquiring bitcoin felt “complicated” and time-consuming.  “All of the news about that volatility kind of freaked me out. I don’t know much about [crypto],” she said. “Lolli felt super intuitive and lower risk.”  Also notably, the head of Sephora’s Innovation Lab is a bitcoin veteran and co-founder of the SF Crypto Devs Meetup, Nelly Mensah. Travel may be Lolli's most popular category, but mainstream beauty and fashion retailers are gaining traction across the board.  Beauty and the bitcoin  Challenging the stereotype of cryptocurrency users as awkward men who pay little attention to hygiene or appearance, Adelman said Sephora rival Ulta has already attracted significant traction from Lolli users, and not only women.  “People were requesting Sephora,” Adelman said. “Beauty has been surprisingly big. Men and women have been buying beauty products. Ulta has been an incredible retailer for us.”  To acquire bitcoin with Lolli, users just have to install the app in their Chrome browser, then shop as they normally would on mainstream websites. Adelman said so far 60 percent of Lolli users become repeat shoppers, adding:  “Having places for them to earn bitcoin, and not just investing or mining but also shopping, has opened up a whole new audience.”  Since Lolli launched in September 2018, the company raised $2.35 million and has paid users an average of 0.0029 bitcoin per purchase, roughly $10. However, the rewards vary dramatically depending on the brand and the amount spent. Adelman said one user earned nearly $132 worth of bitcoin through a single travel purchase worth $4,400.  For now, that crypto loot is stored in a Lolli wallet, similar to an in-browser MetaMask wallet. Later this month Lolli will roll out the ability to cash out to users’ separate crypto wallet addresses.  Adelman said holiday shopping has attracted many first timers like Ngo, concluding:  “We doubled our sales in November ... I think Sephora is going to add a lot more. We saw an early trend there.”  Sephora image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/14/sephora-shoppers-are-getting-their-first-bitcoin-using-crypto-startup-lolli,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/267b0cff7b4cc3c38453e94a5fbfba77151349ee-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd426d,1544785212,Bitcoin Price Defies Oversold Conditions to Hit 15-Month Low,"Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to 15-month lows earlier today, dashing hopes of a rally signaled by current extreme oversold conditions.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell to $3,200 on Bitstamp at 00:15 UTC – the lowest level since September 2017.  BTC was trapped in a five-day-long narrowing price range 24 hours ago and showed signs that it might break upwards with a strong move toward the crucial resistance at $3,633.  These bullish expectations were based largely on a premise that the sellers are facing exhaustion, as indicated by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI), having engineered a 49 percent price drop in the last four weeks.  Further, evidence of bargain hunting had emerged earlier this week in the form of a three-day inverted hammer candle.  Even so, BTC dived out of the narrowing price range in U.S. trading hours yesterday, killing the prospects of a short-term inverted hammer bullish reversal above $3,633.  BTC's persistent failure to produce a notable price bounce despite extreme oversold conditions indicates that the bearish sentiment is very strong. As a result, a convincing break below the 200-week moving average (MA) support of $3,170 cannot be ruled out.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,250 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent decline on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart        The symmetrical triangle breakdown seen in the 4-hour chart indicates a resumption of the sell-off from the Nov. 29 high of $4,410.  The stacking order of the 50-candle moving average (MA), below the 100-candle MA, below the 200-candle SMA, is a classic bear indicator. The RSI has also fallen back into bearish territory below 50.00.  BTC, therefore, risks falling to the psychological level of $3,000. On the way lower, it may encounter support at $3,179 (200-week MA).  Daily chart  As seen above, BTC has charted lower price highs (marked by arrows) along the downward sloping 10-day exponential moving average (EMA). Notably, BTC persistently failed to close above that EMA hurdle at the end of the last month.  Hence, the 10-day EMA, currently at $3,465, is the level to beat for the bulls.  View  The range breakdown on the hourly chart may have opened the doors for a deeper drop to $3,000.  The 14-week RSI remains below 30.00, marking oversold conditions. Recent price action, however, indicates that the market is paying little heed to the indicator.  A UTC close above the 10-day EMA of $3,465, if confirmed, could be considered a sign of short-term bullish reversal.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402339,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd421i,1544781641,SeedCX Exchange Is Barring Employees from Crypto Trading,"Having traded cryptocurrency with his own money since 2014, software engineer Alex Wachli made a difficult choice when he joined the institutional crypto startup Seed CX.  He had to give up trading.  Seed CX forbids cryptocurrency trading by its roughly 40 employees. So Walchli effectively locked up his crypto holdings by handing the compliance team a list of all his wallet addresses, so they could monitor them and confirm his holdings stayed put.  The engineer says he understands how personal investments could create a conflict of interest with regards to the customers he serves and the way his team evaluates support for various assets.  “I think everybody here is not here to try and pick and choose winners, and to let the market to decide,” Walchli told CoinDesk. “If we didn’t have these policies we might be biased and we might not be focusing on the right goals.”  Seed CX's policy, quietly put into place last year, appears to be one of the industry's strictest. Few exchange startups have employee trading policies comparable to those found in traditional capital markets, in part because crypto is still considered by some to be a Wild West industry without clear regulatory requirements.  “We don’t necessarily know what ‘material, non-public information’ [MNPI] means in a crypto context,” Justin Steffen, a litigation partner at Jenner & Block LLP, told CoinDesk, referring to the legal term for information that would give insiders an edge over the investing public. “That will be worked out by courts.”  In the securities markets, for example, an executive who trades stock knowing that the company is about to announce a merger or recall a defective product might be a straightforward case of illegal insider trading. But in crypto, where the assets are created with open-source software and network activity is visible to all on a blockchain, different types of news move the markets.  And sometimes the people working at crypto exchanges are privy to such information – including trading trends, technical issues related to liquidity, and decisions to list certain assets – before anyone else.  In traditional finance, “it’s rare for exchanges to have this much power to change the price of a token or asset that they list,” said Edward Woodford, co-founder of Seed CX, which has raised $25 million of venture capital and is courting instititonal investors as clients.  As such, Woodford said his company’s no-trading policy aims to foster trust among institutions that are used to established corporate norms beyond MNPI contracts, which state employees may not trade based on internal information that could move the broader market.  Speaking of rumors that some crypto exchanges trade against their customers or allow front-running, where employees make personal trades based on information general customers don’t have yet, Woodford told CoinDesk:  “We wanted to avoid any risk that these [frontrunning] allegations could be levied against us.”  Lay of the land  To put Seed CX’s employee trading ban in perspective, CoinDesk reached out to several other prominent crypto trading platforms about their policies.  A spokesperson for Binance, currently the world’s second-largest exchange by trading volume according to CoinMarketCap, said the Singapore-based company has “a strict policy in place banning insider trading, similar to that of investment banks,” but would not share further details.  In Silicon Valley, industry unicorn Coinbase’s chief legal officer Brian Brooks told CoinDesk his company’s current policy requires a small group of employees with decision-making power to self-report their holdings.  “For rank-and-file employees there is no reporting requirement. There is an MNPI prohibition,” Brooks said, referring to a contract employees must sign. “And you may be subject to certain blackout windows depending on whether we are about to list an asset and other kinds of things.”  Employees are also routinely recused from participating in decisions based on their personal holdings, he said.  A Coinbase spokesperson said this policy has been in place for “several years,” but would not be more specific. The company is fighting an ongoing class-action lawsuit alleging employees engaged in insider trading when the bitcoin network forked in 2017 to create the alternative currency bitcoin cash. Among other claims, the plaintiffs allege that insiders traded bitcoin cash at inflated prices while trading was closed for retail customers.  Coinbase isn’t the sole crypto platform with MNPI contracts. Wall Street veteran and AirSwap co-founder Michael Oved told CoinDesk that, in addition to MNPI restrictions, all employees require written approval from the legal team for trades over a certain amount, a value which Oved declined to specify.  Speaking to this point about clearing trades with an internal legal team, Steffen said MNPI policies may be insufficient without supervision. He added:  “Traditional financial institutions are actively making you report trades, transactions, and issues that may constitute insider trading. That is the norm. That is the standard. When I say ‘every trade you make and every real estate transaction you do has to go through compliance,’ that’s what I mean by supervision.”  Winds of change  Some legal experts believe courts and regulators will encourage exchanges to follow even stricter compliance standards, beyond self-reporting, in the near future.  Attorney Jeremy Deutsch, a shareholder at the law firm Anderson Kill, agreed with Steffen that the standard norm among banks and capital market exchanges is for legal experts to monitor or restrict all employee trading, and communications such as emails, and external business transactions like purchasing property.  Even beyond securities markets, Deutsch said professional fiat currency and commodities traders also have numerous restrictions related to their personal assets, adding that he sees no reason why the same should not hold true for crypto:  “What would the justification be to not apply the full scope of compliance obligations to those who are entrusted with early information on the market direction, or potentially the ability to move the markets themselves with their trading, just due to their privileged position?”  Looking forward to 2019, Deutsch said courts and regulators may specify that lower-ranking employees at exchange companies who deal with “the flow of information or orders” also require monitoring, and approvals for most significant financial activities, from the compliance department.  “Otherwise, you’re going to see a tremendous amount of private litigation,” Deutsch said.  Steffen agreed. Crypto markets, he said, involve “very fact-intensive situations” that require legal expertise because “there’s not uniformity among everyone about what is material, nonpublic information or a security.”  That’s why Woodford of Seed CX believes a no-trading policy benefits his employees as much as exchange users.  “An employee may not deem something material whereas we as a company would deem it as material,” Woodford said, concluding:  “It’s also about protecting [employees] as well.”  Edward Woodford image via SeedCX",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/14/seedcx-exchange-is-barring-employees-from-crypto-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76c6da8214f8777db44e0a2a362dc90be801b4c1-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, announced Thursday that it is aware of such an email campaign worldwide.  “The emails claim that a device will detonate unless a ransom in bitcoin is paid,” the NCCIC said.  There have been several media reports stating that scammers are demanding hefty bitcoin ransom with the subject line, “I advise you not to call the police.”  The email reportedly read:  “My man carried a bomb (Hexogen) into the building where your company is located. ... I can withdraw my mercenary if you pay. You pay me 20.000 $ in Bitcoin and the bomb will not explode, but don’t try to cheat – I warrant you that I will withdraw my mercenary only after 3 confirmations in blockchain network.”  Some Twitter users also posted screengrabs of threatening emails, including some individuals.  The NCCIC advised citizens that, if they receive one of the bomb threat emails, they should not try to contact the sender or pay the ransom.  The agency also asked people to report emails to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center or to a local FBI field office.  The mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser has also released an official statement confirming that she has been briefed by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on the ongoing investigation into the several bomb threats nationwide, including DC.  “Each of the threats was received via email, requesting bitcoin ransom, but we have no knowledge that anyone has complied with the transaction demands,” she said.  Bowser added:  “MPD is investigating these threats with our federal law enforcement partners. This is an issue being reported in other cities nationwide and is not considered credible at this time. If you receive a threat or observe suspicious activity, please call 911.”  Australian and New Zealand government agencies are also reportedly investigating bitcoin bomb threat emails received by some residents, as confirmed by cybersecurity officials to Reuters.

42402344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd425e,1544763982,Violent Delights Lead to Violent Ends: Rebuilding After the Crypto Crash,"Dovey Wan is a founding partner of Primitive Ventures, a global investment holding company with a focus on crypto assets and blockchain. You can follow her on Twitter at @doveywan.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  While emerging assets are always turbulent, 2018 has been an especially violent year for the crypto markets.  Many investors who entered during the bull market of 2017 got badly burned during this year’s prolonged crash because they were deluded into believing that market prices accurately reflected underlying value. However, this should not be taken to mean that crypto as an industry is doing poorly.  There are, in fact, two facets to the blockchain industry: the investment side and the development side.  Unlike the traditional financial market where we usually tend to have a clear expectation guidance and consensus around valuation models that can align the two, in crypto we have experienced a significant disconnect between investors and developers due to the distorting effect of hype on market prices and an information asymmetry in regards to actual development.  So, while the bloodshed in the markets we’ve seen in 2018 is likely to continue into 2019, cryptocurrencies are actually making significant progress on the technology development front. This next year will be painful to force us to step out of the bubble, learn the lesson and do a reality check.  Still, a healthy consolidation and the development of fundamentals will lead to eventual prosperity.  We didn’t see another manic gold rush on the internet after the dot.com bubble, but the internet eventually ate the world  In the Market  In the past two months, I’ve had many hours of conversation with key players in all sectors of the industry, including exchanges, traders, miners, founders, primary market investors and regulators.  My conclusions follow regarding why 2019 will be the year our violent delights reach their violent ends.  Far too many projects raised far too much money, often at outrageous valuations in the hundreds of millions. Even zcash, a relatively mature project that is seeing significant growth, is now trading at a ~300 million market cap (fully diluted $1.2 billion). And yet, there were projects with less than six months of development which raised at a valuation on par with zcash’s.  A proper valuation model is missing, investments are largely ""FOMOmental"" instead of fundamental.  Additionally, many of these high-profile projects are set to launch their mainnets in 2019, and most fail to meet expectations. The underwhelming adoption they face will be a further bear signal to the market that the “real adoption” investors had been waiting for won’t arrive in time to bail them out.  The organic community is tiny, developers are disappointed by the infrastructure and tooling and many investors will cut their losses and sell when they no longer believe ""only the sky is the limit.""  Our failure in managing expectations well will set alternative cryptocurrencies up for a major correction, as the market is also highly correlated with BTC’s price. Hashrate and difficulty is a trailing indicator of price and will in return influence supply – for the first time since 2011, the bitcoin mining hashrate has significantly decreased with massive miners scaling back.  Many miners disassembled their mining operations entirely, because prices have fallen so much that bitcoin isn’t even worth the marginal cost to mine it. A big part of what landed us in this situation is the  ""hash rate bubble"" of 2017, during which many miners overextended their mining operations under the mistaken assumption that the price of bitcoin would surely rise in the short term.  Miners who used to hold their coins may be forced to sell, sending the price of the coins spiraling further downwards. A lesser-known factor that will affect prices over the next few quarters is the fact that many funds that popped up in Asia from late 2017 to early 2018 are on a one year cycle (6 + 6 month terms). This means that they’ll reach the end of their term and must liquidate.  Many western funds are on monthly redemption terms, but they also face panic redemption from LPs.  On Development  When I told my friends that Eric Melzter and myself were leaving our positions at large funds in order to strike out on our own with Primitive Ventures, many asked us “Why now in such a brutal market?” Our answer is that it’s in fact a fantastic time to start a fund.  Although temporary market trends may be brutal, that very condition creates the opportunity for extraordinary returns for anyone who can invests in truly valuable work while it is still massively undervalued by a spooked market. It may be the worst of times for the markets, but it is the best of times for real development.  During the bull run of 2017 and early 2018, there was too much noise in the crypto space. Projects raised tens of millions even before what would normally be a Series A, and became slow, distracted, and unmotivated. Further, even quality teams were forced to compete in the game of token prices and had to divert a significant amount of their time and money toward keeping token price up and investors satiated.  In this current colder climate, those who remain are truly committed, and they no longer feel as much pressure to issue pointless tokens that will only cause friction. It is more possible for a blockchain product to gain organic adoption now that investors won't be confusing popularity with real usage.  We are beginning to see fairer distribution models with real tech backing, such as Grin and Raven, which have attracted a dedicated community even without offering an opportunity to invest in a pre-sale or pre-mine. We are also observing the products of academic research being implemented in real-world settings, such as the integration of bulletproofs into Monero, the Sapling upgrade for zcash, and the Bitcoin_NG implementation in Aeternity as a part of their recent Roma launch.  We have seen the emphasis return to real developer usability instead of chasing vanity metrics such as transactions per second, and native use case discovery rather than endless discussions surrounding on-chain governance.  The non-technical development of the crypto industry is also by no means in hibernation during this winter. We have seen much activity amongst various jurisdictions hoping to become the “crypto capital” of the world and attract the talent, capital and enterprise that will gain them a share in an industry that could soon be worth many trillions.  Silicon Valley’s dominance in previous technologies won’t necessarily carry over to crypto since it’s crypto ecosystem is not complete. The miners who are a crucial component of the ecosystem are certainly not located in California, with its high electricity and operational expenses, and traders are also largely outside the U.S. due to its high taxes and strict regulations.  The distributed nature of crypto has fittingly allowed for the global distribution of the opportunities it creates.  What does this mean for 2019 and beyond? Crypto is set to radically upend the way we transact, privacy, ownership and many more things we can’t anticipate. In the near term, market conditions will be brutal, but that is actually helping nurture real value that is simply not reflected in the prices yet.  Investors and builders alike must not be blindsided by mistaking short-term market movements with real value. Now isn’t the time to put crypto on pause, but rather to take a much closer look at the projects addressing real needs in a way uniquely enabled by cryptocurrency, distributed ledger and blockchain technology.  In short, it’s the worst of times, but it’s also the best of times.  Have a hot take on 2018? CoinDesk is looking for contributors for its 2018 Year in Review.

42402330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd41ov,1544761816,SEC's Crypto Czar Signals Some Flexibility on Token Offerings,"Some blockchain token projects may be allowed to bypass U.S. securities registration requirements by obtaining so-called no-action letters from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an agency official said.  Speaking at a gathering in New York Thursday evening hosted by the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance (WSBA) and held at the offices of Signum Global Advisors, Valerie A. Szczepanik made it clear that such letters would be rare. Nevertheless, they are not unheard-of.  ""I think that’s a way forward for a lot of people who want to implement some of these things that may not exactly fit in the format of the rules that we want,"" said Szczepanik, who was appointed the SEC's first-ever senior advisor for digital assets and innovation in June.  Generally, token issuers have three options if they want to conduct an initial coin offering (ICO), she said: they can register as a securities offering, apply for an exemption or ""make sure they're not a security.""  But in limited cases, the SEC could decide that ""maybe this doesn’t fit the letter of our law or regulation but it fits the spirit and we can accomplish all the goals of investor protection,"" Szczepanik said.  In those rare instances, the SEC may issue a no-action letter, which states that the agency's staff will not recommend that the commission an enforcement action against the issuer. As Szczepanik explained:  ""The letters set forth exactly what the person plans to do or the entity plans to do and if it’s something that the SEC feels comfortable with we can release a no-action letter for exemptive relief saying 'we can recommend no enforcement action.'""  That being said, the letters are not binding, and are typically dependent on the securities issuers operating precisely by the terms laid out in the approved proposal.  Some projects may already have begun undergoing this process through the SEC's FinHub program, Szczepanik said.  ""In this space, I think there is room for people to come in and we have had folks coming in either on a confidential basis or with proposals,"" she said.  Her remarks signaling a modicum of flexibility are notable in light of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's advice last month to anyone raising money by selling a token that they should ""start with the assumption that it is a security.”  Is it really a security?  Speaking more broadly as to how a token may be classified as a security, Szczepanik explained that any determination would be based on how the sale is structured.  ""It's a rare set of circumstances"" where a token will not be classified as a security during a sale. Generally, investors in a project will be looking for a profit, which is sufficient for the classification.  It is possible that after a project is built out, token purchasers may use the token without looking for a profit, which may shift its classification, she said, referencing SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman's speech from earlier this year.  At the time, Hinman said that in his view, a blockchain platform like ethereum is sufficiently decentralized to the point that it does not qualify as a security at present.  And on the flip side, ""If it’s a fully developed ecosystem or a blockchain and a token will be issued that will be used …. And that’s what people buy it for, there’s no promise of profit, I think that’s a potential and that’s up to people to propose it so that it makes sense,"" Szczepanik said.  At various points, she noted that while the SEC is not looking to stifle innovation or prevent capital formation, its primary focus is investor protection. As such, she demurred when asked if the SEC was concerned about the U.S. falling behind other nations in terms of regulation.  Not only that, but in her view, most ICOs are likely looking to tap U.S. investors due to the size of the available markets. Szczepanik said:  ""Folks want to come to the U.S. and touch our investor and set up shop here and I think having strong markets encourages that in the long run, maybe not in the short run.""
