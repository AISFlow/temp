42424557,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2trnh,1631920386,3 States: Alabama Securities Commission Also Claims Celsius Violated Securities Laws,"The Alabama Securities Commission has ordered crypto lender Celsius to explain how it is not violating state securities laws. It has four weeks to comply.  In an order dated Sept. 16, the state regulator said it believes Celsius violated state laws through its “Earn Rewards” program. Texas and New Jersey state regulators announced similar findings on Friday, with New Jersey filing a cease-and-desist and Texas announcing it would hold a hearing in February to determine if a cease-and-desist should be ordered.  Celsius has 28 days to respond to the Alabama regulator and show cause why the regulator should not impose a cease-and-desist order. If the company does not respond, the regulator will assume Celsius is waiving its right to a hearing and immediately move to impose sanctions.  A Celsius spokesperson told CoinDesk via email:  “We are disappointed these actions have been filed and wholeheartedly disagree with the allegations being made that Celsius has not complied with the law. We always have, and will continue to, work with regulators in the U.S. and globally to operate in full compliance with the law. Given our commitment to regulatory adherence, we look forward to addressing this matter quickly. As of now, there are no changes in our services to any of our clients. We will keep our community updated with any development.”  Earlier Friday, CEO Alex Mashinsky said in an ask-me-anything that he looked forward to explaining the company’s business to regulators.  “They should be cheering for us as we’re effectively helping redistribute wealth and provide opportunity for everybody, not just the 1%,” he said on Friday.

As of July 2021, the NFT industry had garnered an estimated $2.5 billion worth of sales compared to only $13.7 million during Q1 and Q2 of 2020. Aversano, an artist known for deploying the first-ever NFT portrait photography, says he sold more than 100 NFT portraits between February and June. He said the sales earned approximately $130,000 within five months. The Twin collection in which he sold the 100 portraits are photographs of twins, which he says are in memory of his fraternal twin. What are NFTs? NFTs are non-fungible tokens which are real-life assets that are sold on digital platforms. The viability of NFTs depends on the uniqueness and the utility of possession. This means that tokens can only be relevant to an owner if he can prove ownership of the token. The tokens can range from unique pieces of art from artists to current assets like cars. The digital platform gives an easy and availed proof of ownership. Non-fugitive assets are made more desirable by the fact that they are unique and one of a kind. This makes them very valuable.

42424558,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2trph,1631914587,Christie’s to Sell Some of the Earliest NFTs – And Only for ETH,"Christie’s is listing a set of 31 Curio Cards and several other prominent non-fungible token (NFT) projects in a live auction on Oct. 1, furthering its foray into digital art sales.  The 254-year-old auction house made history in March when it auctioned a Beeple NFT for $69 million. Christie’s Asia branch is now taking bids for several rare CryptoPunks and Bored Ape NFTs as recent buyer appetite for NFTs approaches manic levels.  Launched in May 2017, Curio Cards is commonly viewed as the first digital art collectible on the Ethereum blockchain, predating both CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. The set depicts images ranging from mundane objects (#1 Apples) to reimagined corporate logos (#15 DigitalCash) to intricate black-and-white geometric drawings (#26 Education).  “A true full set of Curio Cards is one of the few holy grails as far as art projects on Ethereum go,” said Noah Davis, head of digital art at Christie’s. “It’s the first of its kind, predating Punks, even.”  The set of 31 numbered cards – including the misprinted #17b – is estimated to fetch between 250 and 350 ETH, or between $870,000 and $1.3 million based on current prices of ether.  The rarest of the batch is card #26, according to the Curio Cards website.  “There are only 111 of them. Five have been lost,” Curio Cards co-founder Travis Uhrig told CoinDesk. That puts the number of feasible full sets at 106 – one of which will be up for grabs at Christie’s.  As for the misprinted card, Uhrig chalked it up to a technical error.  “Cards 17, 18 and 19 were all initially misprinted, but there was a mistake that made 18 and 19 unsellable,” explained Uhrig. “Back in 2017, nobody cared that you had test code on Ethereum. We just re-deployed all three after fixing [the error]. People eventually found [card #17b] because it lives on the blockchain. The market has definitely spoken, people think of it as an essential in a full set.”  The Oct. 1 auction also marks the first time Christie’s live bidding will be denominated in cryptocurrency instead of the usual local currency. The bids, which must be placed in ETH, point to a new milestone as Christie’s descends down the crypto rabbit hole.  “I’ve been bidding in auctions on behalf of clients for almost a decade,” said Davis, the Christie’s digital art lead. “I’ve placed bids in USD, GBP and EUR – always fiat. To think I’m going to hear the auctioneer calling out my bids in ETH, that’s just incredible. It doesn’t happen.”  In addition to the set of Curio Cards, the auction will feature a second lot of three complete sets of 31 NFTs from the Art Blocks Curated collection. Art Blocks, a blockchain startup that helps artists create algorithmically generated art, handpicks releases for the popular collection.  On NFT marketplace OpenSea, the current floor price of an Art Blocks Curated piece is 1.7 ETH, or about $5,900.  “Both Art Blocks and the artists involved are incredibly humbled to be receiving this level of recognition,” Erick Calderon, co-founder and CEO of Art Blocks, told CoinDesk.  The first batch of NFT works will be part of Christie’s broader “POST-WAR TO PRESENT” live auction in New York, which will also feature more traditional artists and pieces.  As part of the same auction, Christie’s will also list five of entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk’s original doodles of his VeeFriends NFT collection, Davis confirmed to CoinDesk.  Just five days later, Christie’s is set to auction its first NFT photograph as part of its “PHOTOGRAPHS” series on Oct. 6. The auction will include the NFT Twin Flames #83, which will be accompanied by the full 100 physical photos in the collection.  “This can be a bridge between the traditional art collectors and new crypto art collectors,” said Justin Aversano, the photographer behind the Twin Flames project, which is estimated to fetch between $100,000 and $150,000 at auction.  The international auction house appears to be sprinkling NFTs into its traditional live auctions as part of a cross-pollination marketing strategy. The auctions from Christie’s will be mixing digital and real-life art, which would introduce traditional art collectors to NFTs and draw in crypto-native collectors who were not previously clients of the auction house.  “It’s amazing to see so many incredible artists succeed in the NFT space; that was always the dream,” said Curio Cards co-founder Uhrig.  “In 2017, Curio Cards was focused on explaining what NFTs were and why they had value. Now it has become this well-known ecosystem, with artists being showcased at big auction houses like Christie’s.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/christies-to-sell-some-of-the-earliest-nfts-and-only-for-eth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a33d3e63f163b902541795b40db0201605d1ef40-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424567,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ts3h,1631913298,Crypto Holders Sue Apple Over ‘Fake’ Wallet App Scam,"Apple is being sued yet again for damages resulting from an allegedly fake scam app available in its App Store, this time involving cryptocurrency.  In a class-action complaint filed on Thursday, the named plaintiff – Maryland resident Hadona Diep, described as a “full-time cyber-security IT professional” – accused Apple of knowingly “authorizing a malicious application” in its App Store that caused Diep to lose 474 XRP tokens, worth about $507 at the time of publication.  According to the complaint, the fraudulent app, a spoof of the legitimate Toast Wallet called Toast Plus, was used to steal Diep’s seed phrase and all of the tokens in the fake wallet. The complaint alleges that “hundreds or thousands” of users were victims of the Toast Plus scam app and that over $5 million in cryptocurrency was stolen.  The class-action lawsuit against Apple is the latest in a series of suits targeting Apple’s $64 billion App Store. Apple has defended its “walled-garden” approach by saying that it keeps users safe by preventing scams and viruses from being unknowingly downloaded – something that has been called into question by Diep’s lawsuit and others, including the developer of the FlickType app.  Critics of the App Store have also accused it of being an unfair monopoly, the debate at the center of the Apple vs. Epic Games lawsuit. Diep’s lawsuit also calls out Apple’s “near-monopolistic application market,” claiming that Apple must “take reasonable precautions to ensure that the goods it provides are reasonably safe and secure.”  Apple did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the lawsuit.  Scam Apps Are Rampant  Scam apps have long been a problem on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Apple has been criticized for unknowingly promoting fake apps, and according to a report from the Washington Post, around 2% of the App Store’s top-grossing apps are scams.  Apple has seemingly struggled to keep the quickly proliferating scam apps out of its App Store, causing damage to both businesses and consumers.  Julie Conroy, head of risk insights and advisory at research and advisory firm Aite-Novarica Group, told CoinDesk that the battle against fake apps is nothing new.  “Attackers have been using very sophisticated tactics for years to dupe unwitting consumers into downloading fake apps from the app stores in order to deploy malware and compromise credentials,” Conroy wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “While the app stores do have review processes in place to try to detect these, fraudsters have developed some ingenious ways to avoid detection,” Conroy added.  Conroy also wrote that consumer education has been a key component of the defensive strategy taken by financial institutions to protect consumers, but that can be challenging to deploy and measure because consumers are inundated with messages from various sources about cybersecurity.",NEGATIVE,XRP,MARKET | XRP | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/crypto-holders-file-lawsuit-against-apple-over-fake-wallet-app-scam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6854e65ac6e29d6a13a6bee814bdf166bd41d1d-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The statement is quite contradictory as crypto transactions and investments have picked up the pace all around the world. The wide adoption of cryptocurrencies also accumulates so many negative statements. The European Central Bank is also on the list.

42424576,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2tsHh,1631910526,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Traders Take Profits Amid Regulatory Crackdowns,"It’s been a quiet week in crypto markets as prices consolidate after last week’s sell-off. Returns have been mixed, especially among alternative cryptocurrencies, with Solana’s SOL token down about 19% over the past week due to network failures, compared with a 34% gain in Avalanche’s AVAX token that was driven by the network’s latest $230 million funding round.  Bitcoin was trading at about $47,000 at press time and is up 6% over the past week. Some analysts expect BTC to consolidate over the short term as the broader uptrend remains intact.  “The combination of fundamental metrics presented on-chain, bullish technical indicators and soft macro picture allows us to confirm our view of a bullish run through the remainder of the year,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a Wednesday report. “We are buyers of BTC and ETH into any near-term selling.”  Regulation, however, remains a headwind for cryptocurrencies. Last week, El Salvador’s Court of Accounts received a complaint from a human rights organization regarding the government’s handling of bitcoin purchases and crypto ATMs. Opposition to the country’s bitcoin law has been vocal with protests across the capital, reported CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair.  And on Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Treasury Department is preparing a report on stablecoins and their potential risks to the financial system.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $47,516, +0.1%  Ether (ETH), $3,421, -4.0%  S&P 500: -0.9%  Gold: $1,752, -0.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.378%  Market uncertainty  Similar to the spot market, the bitcoin options and futures market has also been relatively stable, albeit with some signs of caution.  “We’ve seen healthy spot buying demand in BTC, ETH and altcoins on the desk,” wrote crypto trading firm QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. “But we’ve also seen decent profit-taking in calls at current levels – mixed signals.”  A cautious stance among traders is apparent from the positive one-week and one-month bitcoin put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts – or bearish bets – relative to calls, which are bullish bets. The positive values imply that traders are seeking short-term downside protection, reports CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  QCP expects bitcoin to consolidate at around the $45,000-$50,000 range over the short term given mixed signals from the options market.  “At these levels we have turned slightly short spot as well in BTC and ETH against our long spot positions in the altcoins,” QCP wrote.  Coinbase trading volumes decline  Trading volume on the Coinbase exchange eased slightly last week but remains elevated compared with recent months. That trend largely reflects the recent price consolidation in large cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, while smaller alternative cryptocurrencies captured greater interest among traders.  In a Friday newsletter to institutional clients, Coinbase noted rising volume and said that it expected an eventful fourth quarter. “BTC volumes have caught up to ETH volumes,” Coinbase wrote. “While retail interest in ADA remains high, we have seen a significant rise in ALGO volumes this past week as the L1 [Layer 1] narrative continues to play out.”  Ether pulls back relative to bitcoin  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $3,400 at press time and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with bitcoin’s flat performance over the same period.  ETH is still outperforming BTC over the past week, although the pace of its relative upside is starting to slow. The ETH/BTC ratio declined from the 0.08 resistance level during last week’s crypto sell-off and is approaching initial support near 0.07.

The company is looking to recruit as many as 10 people and is focused on initially hiring a crypto trader with experience with arbitrage between different exchanges, and a marketing and sales person, who will be tasked with building relationships with liquidity providers and exchanges, the person said.  The new group will be divided among London, New York and Singapore.  After the publication of this article, a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk the firm is not currently looking to build a market-making platform for XRP.  Last December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple Labs and two of its executives with offering unregistered securities that raised more than $1.3 billion in XRP sales.  The news sunk the price of XRP, and within days after the announcement, it was reported that high-frequency trader Jump Trading and financer Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital had stopped making markets in the token.

The Court of Accounts, a constitutionally mandated state body responsible for the technical and legal control of the country’s Public Treasury, received a complaint on Sept. 10 from the regional human rights and transparency organization Cristosal, the group said.  Cristosal requested an audit of the authorization process for the purchase of bitcoin under its newly minted law, Reuters reported.  The watchdog has the power to impose administrative and asset sanctions and to present notices to the attorney general’s office asking for criminal proceedings to be brought forward.  El Salvador broke new ground this month after it officially recognized bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar on Sept. 7.  Cristosal’s complaint was made against six members of the board of directors of the Bitcoin Trust, which is made up of members from the Finance and Economic ministries.  “Having admitted the complaint, it will be proceeded to carry out the legal analysis report and, in a timely manner, forward such report to the General Audit Coordination,” the watchdog said.

He seemed to imply more state-level actions were inbound: “Celsius also received several requests for information, like from the state of Texas.”  Minutes later, New Jersey regulators ordered Celsius to cease offering new interest-earning crypto accounts by Nov. 1. It alleged that unregistered securities sales had generated $14 billion for Celsius.  The fracas was reminiscent of July’s state-led barrage against BlockFi. Then, five U.S. states alleged in quick succession that Celsius’ buttoned-up competitor was violating local securities laws. Interest-bearing crypto accounts were the target there, too.  Read more: BlockFi Is Pursuing Plans to Go Public – Even as Regulators Close In  Mashinsky, who spoke only of the Texas action Friday, seemed unfazed by the coming torrent. He framed his company’s lending offering, which promises returns far greater than in traditional banking, as equivalent to Robin Hood of yore.  “They should be cheering for us as we’re effectively helping redistribute wealth and provide opportunity for everybody, not just the 1%,” he said after noting that “regulators are here to protect consumers.”  Mashinsky welcomed the chance to effectively educate the regulators who he said might not fully understand Celsius’ product – or what it does. He made the coming fights sound like more of a bump in the road than an existential threat that could shutter billions of dollars in inflows.  But that’s exactly what the fight appears to be: New Jersey is giving Celsius just over a month before a cease-and-desist order kicks in. The action would stifle new account creation and cut off new deposits from existing accounts.  “We are committed to educate and protect investors from companies that attempt to bypass our laws,” New Jersey Bureau of Securities chief Christopher W. Gerold said in a press statement, adding:  “The Bureau’s action is intended to protect the public and put on notice those trying to circumvent regulated activities.”  Texas was more conciliatory Friday. TSSB Enforcement Director Joe Rotunda told CoinDesk he was not out to get Celsius so much as bring it in line with the law.  “I am not trying to put the company out of business or shutter its doors,” Rotunda said via email. “Instead, I recognize digital assets and blockchain technology are paving the way for exciting new opportunities and new financial services. We are simply trying to get Celsius in compliance with the law so it can continue to operate legally and legitimately while protecting its clients and their assets.”  If the AMA was any indication, Celsius is going full steam ahead. Mashinsky hailed Celsius’ growth and dangled a cash incentive to viewers who helped him bring more new clients on board.  “We just shower money on all you guys,” he said, contrasting his $50 referral bonus with the star-struck marketing campaigns of FTX and BlockFi.  “Why?” he said. “I’d rather you have it than Tom Brady.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/celsius-ceo-eager-to-educate-securities-regulators-in-brewing-legal-fight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d117c220e571ffdb7542ab185e3e5e709896efa-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shortly after Texas securities regulators issued crypto lender Celsius with an order to appear in court on Friday, New Jersey is piling on by filing a cease-and-desist order.  “If you sell securities in NJ, you need to comply with NJ’s securities laws. And that includes those operating in the cryptocurrency market,” tweeted New Jersey Acting Attorney General Andrew Bruck. “Our Bureau of Securities has ordered an NJ-based company – Celsius – to stop offering interest-bearing accounts.”  New Jersey and Texas were also among the states to slap crypto lender BlockFi with similar actions in July.

42424573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2tsFh,1631909954,"$3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers","Just another day in crypto.  One of the most bizarre hacks in NFT history played out on Friday morning, a front-end exploit that led to a tense standoff featuring miso soup, Kia Sedonas and threats to call in the FBI.  In the end, however, a cult non-fungible token (NFT) project has prevailed, having not just retrieved the stolen funds but also firmly establishing itself in the limelight in a space that’s often short on mindshare.  On Thursday night, SushiSwap Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong revealed that the 864.8 ETH ($2.93 million) proceeds from an NFT drop on the Miso auction platform had been stolen in an exploit.  Read more: $3M in Ether Stolen From SushiSwap’s MISO Launchpad  The drop, “Jay Pegs Auto Mart,” distributed DONA tokens redeemable for Kia Sedona-styled NFTs. The drop has a cult following driven by the developers pretending to be used-car dealers – an elaborate performance laced with tongue-in-cheek, Midwestern flavor.  The funds were returned on Friday morning after negotiations with the exploiter, a developer who works under the pseudonym “Eratos.”  Although Eratos has since posted a puzzling tweet in which he appears to be distancing himself from the hack, sources close to the Jay Pegs team have confirmed that the team has determined that he is responsible.  The team behind the Jay Pegs project, NGMI.global (which a team member confusingly referred to as the “evil parent subsidiary” of Jay Pegs Auto Mart) told CoinDesk that the negotiations were equivalent to a “financial hostage situation” from a “disgruntled [Sushi] employee.”  Meanwhile, Sushi team representatives told CoinDesk in a statement that while a forthcoming incident report found that “Eratos had a first degree funding relation to the exploit address” and that “Eratos purportedly held a lead position over this separate actor,” there is no definitive proof that Eratos and the attacker were the same entity.  In an effort to make sense of the events, CoinDesk reached out to the NGMI team. (NGMI is a popular shorthand for “not gonna make it.”)  However, during a wide-ranging interview with self-described “middle management representative” BasedMoneyGod, Senior Vice President McGhoul, “Sales Guy #2” and an unnamed fourth team member who joined and left the interview at various points throughout but who identified himself as an Amazon Prime member, it was difficult to discern who was saying what.  Also unclear: Which answers were part of the used-car-salesman role-play and which reflected the actual feelings of the developers, who at times sounded borderline delirious after the events of the last 24 hours.  “This has been one of the most surreal moments of my life,” said one NGMI developer. “But it’s also just kind of like what it’s like working in this space.”  The long con  Sales Guy #2 noted that the attack was planned and implemented well before the launch of the sale and that NGMI “only realized we were f**ked” after the sale concluded.  Given that the exploit could have applied to any Miso sale, it is unclear why Eratos chose the DONA drop. Miso has hosted sales worth upward of $350 million.  “He thought that the sale was going to be so awesome, he thought it was going to be great, so he wanted to exploit that one specifically,” claimed BasedMoneyGod. “It was going to be ‘the greatest NFT drop in the history of NFTs’ – of course, he’s gonna want to steal it.”  The drop raised just over 850 ETH, a not-unusual sum in these times of NFT euphoria.  The team spoke of the exploiter with a mixture of admiration and disdain.  “He put the code in the UI (user interface), and it redirected the funds into his address. It was actually kind of clever,” said one developer. This reporter was not able to discern which.  The team continually expressed disappointment throughout the interview that the hack was not more successful, given the elegance of the attack vector. They also said it would have made more sense to siphon off a small amount from every Miso sale, referencing a scheme from the 1999 cult classic “Office Space.”  However, Eratos, whose GitHubhttps://github.com/eratos1122 profile is highly self-promotional and contains easily identifiable information, was “sloppy” with his operational security, and the team “doxxed” him in short order – terms referring to how individuals maintain their anonymity online and for uncovering the real-life information behind an online persona, respectively,  Soup tactics  After identifying the exploiter, the team reached out to establish communications. Knowing his address, they ordered food for their foe, a common psychological negotiation tactic used to establish a bond with an abductor.  In this instance, however, NGMI sought to intimidate Eratos. Here’s a transcript of the bizarre episode as told by the NGMI team:  “We learned his home address pretty quickly.”  Legal action  Before the negotiations were cut short, the sales team brought on a high-powered attorney to weigh in on the possible legal consequences if the exploiter didn’t yield to the team’s demands.  Again, a transcript:  “This guy killed it. This old-ass white dude got on the call, and this dude was scary as fuck.”  Jay’s heart  The team noted that project founder “jaypegs” – a play on a derogatory term for NFTs referring to a popular image file name that has been lovingly reappropriated by the collector community – fell asleep during the negotiations, and that at the time of the interview he remained unaware that the attacker had returned the funds.  The delirious team told this reporter:  “He’s still sleeping at his sister’s house dude.”  The team has been promoting the hashtag #PRAYFORJAY on social media, and late in the afternoon on Friday the Jay Pegs Twitter account posted an “official statement” from Jay acknowledging the hack.  Waiting game  After the first round of negotiations, the team was unsure of its next move.  “We talked to him, and then he hung up, and we really didn’t know what to do.”  They noted that if they moved to involve authorities, it would be possible that they would never recover the funds at all, as the agencies would seize ETH, not fiat.  “We thought the best way to move forward would just be to scare the guy, just get him to send the funds back.”  The Ethereum community rallied around the event, however. Blockchain data site Etherscan quickly labeled Eratos’ address as an exploiter, and SushiSwap representatives reached out to centralized exchanges Binance and FTX, both of which Eratos had interacted with, to have his funds frozen, though Delong reported their efforts on this front were “stonewalled.”  “These big companies won’t release, or do anything, before authorities are involved,” said one of the developers.  The NGMI team said witnessing both their stolen money move and the community rally was “surreal.”  “The cool thing is that everyone can watch the funds moving in real-time,” said one. “I’ve never seen anything like that.”  Added another: “People from the community were just chiming in, reporting things and finding things about the attacker. It was really interesting to see the community come together.”  Not NARCs  At roughly 6 a.m. Eastern time on Friday, Eratos returned the funds. While NGMI can now pursue legal action without the risk of losing the funds to the justice system, they’re opting to work outside of the law.  “We settled it amongst ourselves, we’re not NARCs.”  In a show of cheek, a community member even sent Eratos’ address a DONA token, redeemable for a Kia Sedona NFT.  “We prefer to settle things on the dartboard,” said one developer.  Fumbled the bag  The team repeatedly expressed befuddlement that Eratos could mangle the hack so thoroughly, both losing the stolen funds and ending what was a promising development career.  Here’s the team’s telling:  “He just couldn’t pull it off.”  The team recommended that other hackers learn from this and “keep their opsec clean.”  “All scriptkiddies in the space need to learn a lesson.”  Cultural value  In a space where the success of a project hinges in part on historical significance, DONA tokens and NFTs may now have a chance at lasting cultural impact in the wake of the bizarre events.  However, the team says the community, including some 1,500 Telegram followers, were supporters before the attack and believers in the core product.  “They understand the value of a Kia Sedona.”  They pointed to the 1-689-JAY-PEGS hotline for further information, as well as their Pinterest account that they say reflects their “values.”  UPDATED (Sept. 18, 14:04 UTC): Updates to include statement from the Sushi team.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/17/3m-was-stolen-but-the-real-steal-is-these-kia-sedonas-say-anonymous-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c7a690bcf3ea2cf771028e1df14bf1317a896df-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stablecoins exchange reserve is an indicator that shows the total amount of fiat-tied coins currently present on exchanges. An increase in the value of the metric could suggest an increase in the supply of dry powder for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When the reserve starts declining, it may mean investors now want to enter into volatile markets and are exchanging these coins to do so.

The increase indicates strong revenue growth for the month.  The exchange’s token burn last month was 55% more than in July.  Burn total is positively correlated to revenue so a rise in token burn indicates revenue growth. Token burning is a process where crypto coins are removed from circulation to keep inflation low.  Huobi told CoinDesk it burns 15% of its revenue and allocates 5% of total income to repurchase and burn a portion of its Team Incentive Rewards.  The company rebounded from burning just $22.3 million of its Huobi token in July, a 54% decrease from its total burn volume in June.  Jeff Mei, director of global strategy for Huobi Global, expects that the crypto market “will continue to thaw in the next few months,” and that the company will continue to see a steady rise in its burn volume, he said in a press release.

These non-fungible tokens grant access to Tomi&apos;s token presale soon, so the limited-edition sets are in high demand. With 395 Ether (or roughly $1.37m) in traded volume, it is evident that this is the project to keep an eye on over the coming days. Massive TOMI Presale ROI Potential As Tomi Heroes generate more proceeds, the team will use these funds to purchase and burn TOMI tokens during the TOMI sale on SushiSwap. It is a no-brainer for any TOMI presale participant, as given the contribution by the TOMI team from the NFT sale, the return on investment potential is borderline astronomical. As more FOMO kicks in among investors who seek exposure to the TOMI presale rounds, the remaining NFTs will generate even more attention and return for the presale. It is essential to see this project for what it embodies. It is not just an NFT collectible, although these items will likely remain very popular on the secondary market after the token sale concludes. Instead, it is a tool to facilitate token presale participation and incentivize holding the NFT rather than flipping it for a quick profit like so many other projects.

42394442,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEiz,1631901983,Evergrande and China’s Looming Risk to Tether,"The stablecoin issuer Tether this week declared that it doesn’t hold short-term debt issued by troubled Chinese real estate developer Evergrande. Since Tether doesn’t disclose specifics about the commercial paper that substantially backs its “stablecoin,” this is a bit like serving a houseguest a sandwich and loudly assuring them that it is absolutely NOT made from diseased horsemeat.  It seems increasingly likely that Evergrande is fated instead for the glue factory. But it could still take Tether with it, depending on what’s actually in that stablecoin sandwich.  Though its main product since its founding in the 1990s has been housing, Evergrande has grown into a huge conglomerate with products ranging from bottled water to electric cars to a soccer team. It expanded by borrowing aggressively, including during periods when China’s economic outlook was seen in much rosier terms globally than it is now.  Evergrande has failed to execute on the promises backing its roughly $300 billion in debt, particularly in housing. Among other signs of serious mismanagement, customers have made large deposits on Evergrande apartments that were never built. Hundreds of customers have protested in front of the company’s offices alleging mistreatment or fraud.  But this is not just about one company: Even if Tether doesn’t specifically hold any of Evergrande’s short-term debt, it could have huge exposure in the form of other Chinese obligations. The developer’s debt is spread across an army of banks and other financial institutions, leading some analysts to worry that its collapse would have systemic impacts comparable to the fall of Lehman Brothers, which kicked off the Great Recession 13 years ago. Debate swirls about whether that impact would spread beyond China, but there’s broad agreement that impact within the country would be near catastrophic.  Evergrande is just the latest major Chinese firm to have serious problems due to apparent fraud or mismanagement. A wave of smaller stock frauds from 2010-2016 were chronicled in the documentary ”The China Hustle”, and Luckin Coffee put an exclamation point on the trend in 2019.  That type of heavy-handed control is at the core of China’s conundrum as an authoritarian state trying to reap the rewards of capitalism.  These frauds even show some sign of being tacitly approved by the Chinese government, to the extent that they have targeted investors abroad. It’s been going on for a long time – one analyst who warned about Evergrande’s practices as early as 2012 was temporarily banned from Hong Kong markets by regulators for his “reckless” claims.  China’s loose and reactive (at best) financial regulatory environment is one reason anxiety around Tether has largely centered on whether it holds Chinese commercial paper in general – not just whether it holds Evergrande’s.  Over the past two years, yet another headwind has entered the China mix. After a couple of decades of relative freedom for entrepreneurs (including, as mentioned, the apparent freedom to commit securities fraud), Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping has begun to aggressively intervene in markets. That has included harshly curtailing apparently successful fintech firms like Ant Group and, most recently, instituting restrictions on video games, which can’t be good for Tencent and other firms.  That type of heavy-handed control is at the core of China’s conundrum as an authoritarian state trying to reap the rewards of capitalism. Markets can’t function without transparent information flows, full stop. The systematic suppression that characterizes Chinese markets adds an opaque but potentially huge risk for the holders of any Chinese asset – even if that risk is wrapped up in a supposed stablecoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT,David Z.

42394423,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEED,1631901791,Speculation Is Good (for Crypto),"It was a busy week for the cryptocurrency industry in New York, with in-person conferences, workshops and parties filled to the brim with crypto enthusiasts. After the shutdowns of COVID-19, it had the feel of a revival. And while this was nothing like the crowds of Consensus 2018, it also felt like the continued gains in decentralized finance (DeFi) usage, non-fungible token (NFT) markets and altcoin tokens were showing up in that particular breed of hype and buzz this community tends to muster during times of speculative fervor. This week’s column explains why this is not only inevitable but, in a volatile but catalytic way, a key driver of growth.  Meanwhile, in this week’s episode of the “Money Reimagined” podcast, my co-host Sheila Warren and I conduct the second in our “OG” interview series with legendary investor Bill Tai, who began mining bitcoin in 2010 and has been an early investor in success stories such as Zoom and Canva. Tai is now helping a team called Nfinita harness the power of NFT communities to raise money for charitable causes. Nfinita’s CEO Danny Yang joined in the conversation.  Have a listen after reading the newsletter.  How the crypto hype machine breeds innovation  Two images prominently displayed on multiple LED screens caught my attention as I wandered New York’s Javits Center during Monday’s opening of SkyBridge Capital’s SALT conference: a sponsor board stacked with crypto companies’ logos and a promo for a talk by newly converted NFT fanatic Paris Hilton.  Juxtaposed, those images conjured a question that often arises whenever cryptocurrencies are in a bull market phase: Is the noise a sign the industry is poised for explosive, mainstream integration, or are we seeing the kind of over-hyped, celebrity-infused excess that portends an imminent collapse in crypto markets?  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is “both.”  That might seem contradictory. So, let me try to break down why it’s not and also explain why this Wild West, boom-bust state of affairs is an unavoidable, intrinsic feature of how this industry innovates and grows.  First, let’s separately consider each state for Schrodinger’s Cat here.  On the one hand, the hyped-up presence reflects a cashed-up industry with both the financial wherewithal and the motivation to try to woo the deep-pocketed institutions attending one of the investing industry’s biggest annual conferences. Why would digital asset companies like lead sponsor NYDIG take on such a large, expensive presence at SALT if they didn’t sense a huge, growing opportunity from institutional investors?  After all, the SALT main stage, featuring multiple crypto-themed sessions, delivered story after story of hedge funds and other traditional financial institutions exploring ever more adventurous investing strategies in bitcoin, DeFi and even NFTs.  On the other hand, there was a very late-2017 feel to the crypto presence, not only with SALT’s own celebrity lineup but at numerous other sideline conferences in New York, such as the Digital Assets Summit, and at late-night parties at rooftop bars and expensive dinners. It’s hard not to worry that as NFTs and various “Eth-killer” altcoin tokens reach lofty new heights, that we’re due for a rerun of the 2018 “Crypto Winter” that followed the previous year’s initial coin offering (ICO) bubble.  Here’s the thing: it’s possible to project – and to prepare – for that selloff while still remaining strongly convinced that the frenetic investment and marketing activity is a sign of bigger, more important things to come. An amped-up money and hype machine is a fundamental driver of the self-perpetuating cycle of innovation and development that is growing and will continue to grow the crypto ecosystem.  People will lose their shirts, yes. But before then, these unfortunate buy-high-sell-low victims will have contributed to the rapid capital formation and opportunity creation that’s building the technical and social infrastructure of a new, decentralized financial system.  Bubble booms  Economist Carlota Perez has famously shown that at key technological turning points in history, speculative bubbles have been integral to how society incorporates transformative technologies into the economy. Even as it fuels hype, along with momentum trading and big price overruns, the cheap money generated by investor speculation flows into a growing variety of new projects and enterprises that are built on the new technology. This helps to establish the technology and create a base for the economic transformation it later enables.  A good example was the dot-com bubble of the late nineties. At the time, a great deal of attention went to investor losses from doomed projects such as Pets.com. There was far less discussion of how the financial capital unlocked during the bubble funded the rollout of fiber-optic cable, the development of key technologies such as algorithmic search or the advances in mobile computing. That money laid the foundation for the creation of new, massively marketable services in the Internet 2.0 era, led by companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.  Bubbles in crypto play a similar function – including the derisively viewed ICO boom – and, arguably with even more impact, for two structural reasons.  One key difference between crypto and important late-90s software, such as Google’s search algorithm, is that the major breakthroughs in the former tend to be based on non-proprietary open-source code. When developers don’t need to ask for permission to build on a new technology, it’s an inherently more powerful driver of collective innovation and new products.  People will lose their shirts, yes. But before then, these unfortunate buy-high-sell-low victims will have contributed to the rapid capital formation and opportunity creation  The other is that money cycles through the crypto ecosystem at a much faster rate than it has in any other tech boom. That’s not only because token price gains tend to be so large, enriching investors and developers who then reinvest their winnings in new projects. It’s because cryptocurrencies literally have faster velocity, mostly because they are based on near-real-time, intermediary-free settlement. Check out Coin Metrics research on how frequently a single tether token changes hands and a picture emerges of a sub-economy that’s generating income and wealth far more quickly than the one that depends on fiat money.  Fueled by passion  Those structural differences between the crypto and fiat economies are important. But I believe there’s also something more intangible yet no less catalytic at play: passion. That, and the hype that comes out of it, are intrinsic to the crypto innovation cycle.  We can think of crypto as an ever-burgeoning market for ideas.  Think of all the dreamers it attracts, the kind of people who go for broke on an idea that normal people would consider impossible – like inventing an entirely new system of money.  At every crypto conference I go to, there seems to be an entirely new batch of newcomers who’ve just found the opportunity too big to resist: everyone from high-school-age engineers building new DeFi “legos” in their basement to Wall Street traders who’ve given up on the button-down world of TradFi to build a very different system.  This represents a powerful cauldron of creativity. Most of the creations that emerge out of it – the new protocols, the apps, the projects and schemes – will fail. Some of those failures are because the projects are built on nothing but hot air and, sadly, in many cases, on outright scams.  But a good number will win. And that’s greatly helped by the fact that in this entrepreneurial culture, to a degree I’ve never encountered before, failure is entirely acceptable. It is viewed as a learning opportunity upon which to iterate.  So, yes, there will be wild ups and downs. Prices will fluctuate and the mainstream media will continue to point that out to the outside world. But it’s all part of the process. There is no straight-line route to where we are going.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

But another provision in the bill could impose new surveillance and reporting requirements on peer-to-peer crypto transactions, claims the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA). And unlike other tax code reporting violations, violations of this provision – Tax code section 6050I – are felonies.  The law requires recipients to verify the sender’s personal information and record their Social Security number, the nature of the transaction and other information, and report the transaction to the government within 15 days.  POSA, a crypto lobbying group, called for the reporting mandate to be struck from the infrastructure bill in a report published Friday, calling it intrusive and overly broad.  Abe Sutherland, an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia Law School, penned the report.  Sutherland wrote that the provision has largely escaped public scrutiny because it uses a nearly 40-year-old law that was meant to apply to in-person cash transactions over $10,000.  Applied to digital assets, which could include cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Sutherland believes that the law would be nearly impossible to comply with.  “The details are complicated and rely on sweeping Treasury Department power and discretion to apply the statute,” wrote Sutherland.  The provision is reminiscent of a proposed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) rule published last December.

42421756,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpKCj,1631895547,Ethereum’s Design Choices Are Inherently Political,"In early August, Ethereum’s long-awaited London upgrade went into effect. It contained a package of Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most consequential of these was EIP 1559, which changed the core fee logic.  Prior to the change, Ethereum blockspace was auctioned off on a “first price” basis – effectively users would have to make educated guesses regarding the likely clearing price of blockspace. For the sake of guaranteed inclusion, they’d often end up overpaying. That was seen as inefficient.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  Thus, EIP 1559 was proposed: Every transaction in a block would pay the same price. The objective was to simplify fee logic, especially for blockchain developers, increase predictability and reduce the variance of gas prices.  Based on the data we have so far, this looks like it has worked. Fees are indeed less volatile than they were before. They are, however, no cheaper, to the chagrin of some users. Ethereans close to the process insist that the tweak was never intended to cheapen blockspace. Insiders blame the surge in fees mostly on non-fungible token mania. Indeed, a cursory analysis lends some support to that theory.  The latest surge of NFT enthusiasm happened to coincide with the rollout of EIP 1559, so we won’t be able to tease apart the causality until this NFT episode subsides. Early analysis supports the idea that EIP 1559 has instituted a de facto near-term price floor on the price of gas, effectively eliminating periods of downtime (typically at night or on the weekends) when blockspace is cheaper.  Based on a visualization of gas prices post EIP-1559 created by data scientist Takens Theorem, it looks like the change eliminated much of the downside volatility in gas prices but did not eliminate the right tail. Extreme fee spikes during periods of congestion still happen.  Removing the left tail of fees disempowered users who would set low “limit orders” on gas and were happy to wait for it to clear. Effectively, this change homogenized the way users had to bid on gas, pricing out those who were price sensitive and preferred to wait for low gas prices.  And then there’s the fee burning. The base fees are now burned, while miners collect some residual “tips.” This mechanic was included for a couple reasons: first of all, to privilege ether as the sole native currency of Ethereum, similar to the manner in which only USD can extinguish a tax liability in the U.S. Additionally, it eliminates the attack mode in which miners might stuff blocks with high fee transactions to bid up the clearing price of gas and force users to pay extortionate fees. This fee recycling attack doesn’t work when the base fees are burned.  But the fee burning design choice has economic consequences, too. For one, it disadvantages miners, stripping away a good chunk of the revenue they were previously earning. As a consequence of the change, only about a quarter of the fees users pay to access the blockchain today go to miners. Previously, they earned them all.  The remainder are burned, effectively constituting an ongoing “stock buyback” and retirement. This has amounted to more than 300,000 ETH burned in the 41 days since the change, representing a reduction of 2.3% of supply on an annualized basis. During days of high usage, the fee burn has fully sterilized the normal issuance associated with the protocol (in other words: the burn was sufficient to fully offset the new inflation).  If you look at the chart, it’s clear that miners have seen their fee revenue dramatically reduced, with the majority of fees being burned instead.  So the change has reallocated a continuous flow of economic rewards from miners (who eked out a living competing in the thin-margin game) to the existing holders of ether. By burning the fees, Ethereum has also decreased its expenditure on security. While Ethereum appears to be secure, reorganizations on smaller proof-of-work blockchains aren’t unheard of.  Ethereum is likely just fine at this level of security spending, but it’s not worth fully discounting the service that the miners perform. Their job is to create valid, linear blockspace with no forks. Decrease the wages paid to the mercenary army that defends your terrain, and it can more easily be paid off by an attacker. There’s a point where further decreasing miner revenue would put Ethereum at risk; granted, it’s probably at a much lower threshold.  The more serious problem with the fee logic change is that it pits token holders against blockspace consumers  Ethereum insiders are well aware of the effects of this policy on miners, and indeed disempowering miners has long been on the agenda. Miners don’t feature in the long-term plans for Vitalik & Co; in the fully proof-of-stake future that Ethereum is haltingly progressing toward, miners won’t have a role at all. Thus, their interests are not often considered when protocol changes are concerned; they are just near-term contractors and will eventually be discarded.  There’s a few problems with that. If you treat miners as expendable, they won’t maintain a duty of care toward the blockchain. For now, miners still occupy a privileged position in the transactional life cycle, as they control the ordering of transactions in a block. It’s well known that reordering (or selectively including or omitting) transactions offers economic rewards to the entities that control transaction selection.  Some miners have delayed taking advantage of this so-called “miner extractable value” (MEV) – which is hostile to end users – out of principle. Now that they are being squeezed out, they have no reason to seek to maximize the long-term value of the protocol. Indeed, especially as their fee revenue has been dramatically reduced, they are incentivized to seek revenue any way they can, even if it comes at the expense of users. Less direct protocol revenue could mean more MEV-based revenue and more exploitation of end users.  The more serious problem with the fee logic change is that it pits token holders against blockspace consumers. Holders now directly benefit from sustained high fees. The higher fees are, the more units of ether are retired. This is likely accretive to the unit price of ETH. However, it comes at the expense of actual users of the blockchain, who, ceteris paribus, prefer lower fees.  In a world where token holders are users (and vice versa), this isn’t a problem. But as Ethereum matures and seeks to attract mainstream corporate users who may seek to simply transact rather than hold, this apparently extractive relationship with transactors could well make it a tough sell. The analogy I’d draw here would be an electrical utility company raising prices for its consumers to buy back its shares.  The best evidence that Ethereum has entered a new phase of life – from a scrappy upstart, to a mature protocol now extracting rents from consumers of blockspace – is a chart of monthly active users versus the unit price.  For virtually its entire history, the two variables have moved in tandem. That stands to reason: More usage meant more demand for ether itself. But, since July, the relationship has decoupled. Monthly actives have steadily declined, but ether has rallied strongly. Much of that rally is attributable to hype around EIP 1559 and the subsequent high rate of burnt fees. But one wonders how long the rally can last if the fee burning paired with high fees comes to antagonize large consumers of blockspace.  Even if EIP 1559 isn’t directly responsible for high fees, it’s hard to argue that the Ethereum insiders who make these decisions and own significant quantities of ETH are particularly upset about the fees, as they now financially benefit from the more deflationary environment that the change has brought about. If you are a large consumer of blockspace, you may bristle at the fact that your fees are not paying for security, but are instead being redirected to token holders.  This could come to a head in a future conflict over, say, block size. I can easily imagine a faction of transactors lobbying for a higher block size, in an attempt to create more blockspace and push down the clearing price of gas. But will large token holders, benefiting from the deflationary effect of the high fees, want to reduce the size of their user-financed stipend? The fact is that, due to the fee-burning mechanic, which has clearly been quite good for the price of ether, the individuals in control of Ethereum protocol design now have a meaningful incentive to keep fees permanently high.  The arbitrary change to the monetary policy is both short-termist and dangerous in terms of precedent-setting  The arbitrary change to the monetary policy is both short-termist and dangerous in terms of precedent-setting. It is short-termist in that it disempowers transactors, upon whom the entire investment case for ether is built. If you can’t attract firms and users to hold ether as working capital for transacting, that source of reservation demand will ebb away. Speculators are ultimately guessing that the protocol will see sustained future usage. The value of ether is at partly the discounted future expectations of token holders, contingent on future adoption. For those expectations to materialize, they will have to continue to persuade users that Ethereum is a stable and non-rent-seeking transactional venue.  It also sets a troubling precedent. Sure, the price rallied in anticipation of the change, and a good number of ETH have been burned, but the decision is no less arbitrary. Sound monetary policy is about setting monetary rules that cannot be interfered with – creating supra-human institutions that are indifferent to short-term political pressures. That was the objective of the gold standard, an institution that governed for hundreds of years.  Ethereum thus far hasn’t been able to commit to a stable monetary rule. If the issuance can be dialed down after a mere few months of discussion by insiders, the throttle can be opened up at a later date. Ethereum’s policymakers should consider committing to a rule that will guide policy for decades, not months. And given that this policy is redistributive, one wonders what protocol insiders will do next. Certainly, there is an unacknowledged political tinge to all of these decisions that are represented as merely engineering choices.  Against this backdrop, “Ethereum killers” have thrived. Alternative platforms like Algorand, Avalanche, Near and Solana promote themselves on the basis of low fees and fast transactions. Of course, they make (possibly unacceptable) decentralization tradeoffs to get there, and these blockchains are not without their own issues. But their case for an alternative is easier to make if the incumbent smart contract protocol is charging extremely high fees – $500 for a single Uniswap transfer is not uncommon – and arguably extracting rent in the process.  In an environment in which stablecoins are highly portable across chains and investors are eager to finance wallets, infrastructure and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on novel blockchains, liquidity is less of a moat. It has never been easier for large consumers of blockspace to move their affairs to a new protocol. The fee pressure on Ethereum, which large token holders now perversely benefit from, could well push transactors to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Why choose to transact on a blockchain where you will inevitably face high fees – thus enriching insiders with the burn mechanic – when you could find another blockchain with cheap, or even subsidized blockspace?  EIP 1559 may well have been sound engineering in terms of meeting its core objective of reducing the variance in blockspace pricing. However, its largely unacknowledged externality – the redistribution of fees from miners to token holders – is troublesome. First, it’s an arbitrary decision made by a small number of insiders, and it affects the core economics of the protocol.  Second, it compromises the monetary credibility of the network and resets the monetary “Lindy clock” to 0. If issuance can be engineered downward, it can be raised later on. EIP 1559 also antagonizes miners, who still occupy an important position in the network and are now less disposed toward being fair stewards of the protocol. And lastly, it puts the interests of large token holders against those of current and future blockspace consumers. This could well harm Ethereum in the long run, if its alternatives are able to better align incentives and gain traction.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/ethereums-design-choices-are-inherently-political,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5a64fe12028504033f76ebe6ef59c2b5ee02009-5005x3417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terms were not disclosed, but Animoca said the deal was not “material.”  Animoca said its investment in Bondly will help drive mass NFT adoption across its portfolio companies operating in gaming, sports, entertainment and collectibles.  Bondly’s technology includes NFT swap protocol and cross-chain NFT minting which will allow gamers to move NFT assets from one blockchain to another. The firm created and distributed YouTuber Logan Paul’s first-ever NFT collectibles for fans.  Animoca has focused its recent investments on the NFT space, including OpenSea and Dapper Laps, and raised $139 million in funding this year at a valuation of $1.1 billion. The money will be used to fund strategic investments, product development and licenses for popular intellectual property.  “Bondly has developed powerful tools to help onboard brands and individuals to the world of NFTs, and has built valuable relationships with many leading brands and artists,” said Yat Siu, the co-founder and chairman of Animoca Brands, in the announcement.

On Friday, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) alleged Celsius’ interest-bearing crypto deposits are unregistered securities. It ordered the startup to appear before a hearing in February 2022 where a cease-and-desist order will be considered.  “We are accusing Celsius of selling these investments in Texas without first complying with important laws designed to protect investors,” TSSB Enforcement Director Joseph Rotunda told CoinDesk via email, adding:  “I am not trying to put the company out of business or shutter its doors. Instead, I recognize digital assets and blockchain technology are paving the way for exciting new opportunities and new financial services. We are simply trying to get Celsius in compliance with the law so it can continue to operate legally and legitimately while protecting its clients and their assets.”  The order is the latest in a string of U.S. regulatory actions against the biggest names in crypto lending.  Offering clients sky-high yields (compared to banks, at least) in return for staking their crypto, firms like BlockFi, Coinbase and now Celsius have drawn state and federal authorities’ ire.  Texas regulators privately informed Celsius of potential securities violations in May, according to the Friday filing. But Celsius continued to pitch its interest-bearing accounts to Texans, it said.  BlockFi received a similar TSSB warning in April and by July was facing its own cease-and-desist hearing. Rotunda said the Celsius case is “substantially similar” to BlockFi’s.  “Texas is aware that parties other than BlockFi and Celsius are promoting investments in interest-bearing cryptocurrency depository accounts,” Rotunda told CoinDesk.  The order comes days after BlockFi CEO Zac Prince asserted that crypto lenders need federal guidance on the status of their products. He said the piecemeal efforts launched by states alone will not be enough for the industry to flourish.  “We’re not going to decide what box crypto lending belongs in based on what New Jersey does or what Texas does or what any one other state does,” Prince told New York’s SALT conference on Monday.  A request for comment sent to Celsius was not returned by press time.  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42422130,pwSSwvY9oXIAw80qplcWrY,1631876771,Babel Finance Sets Up Shop in Singapore,"Crypto financial services provider Babel Finance is expanding into Singapore.  The new company, called Babel Asia, will be independent of Babel’s Hong Kong office, according to a Thursday press release.  “Singapore’s trusted legal system, well-developed wealth-management industry and openness to fintech” are welcoming to crypto firms, Babel Asia CEO Shanshan Yu told CoinDesk in an email.  Singapore’s 2019 Payment Services Act set up a regulatory framework for crypto, giving digital-asset firms a pathway to legality.  Founded in 2018, Babel Finance started out as a lender to crypto miners in China and has grown to serve institutional clients and high net worth individuals.  It is these institutional investors that Babel is after in Singapore. Yu’s experience in banking will help her win over traditional finance players, the company said. She has been working in Singapore’s banking sector since 2013, with roles at Bank of Singapore, Development Bank of Singapore and United Overseas Bank.  Babel Finance’s co-founder Del Wang said in a press release that there is “increasing appetite for differentiated asset classes” among Singapore’s qualified investors.  Over two-thirds of Singaporeans with personal investments have crypto in their portfolios, and over one-third of those who don’t said that they plan to invest in digital assets in the next year, according to a July survey by crypto exchange Gemini and crypto information provider CoinMarketCap.  Still, Babel Asia has its work cut out for it in terms of compliance and faces joining a long queue for licenses. Singapore’s Monetary Authority has reportedly received over 170 applications for licenses from crypto exchanges.  Only one digital-token payments license has been granted in full to a local fintech player, FOMO Pay, which received approval this month.  Babel Finance raised $40 million in a Series A round in May.

42422146,pwSSwvY9oXIAw80qplcX4u,1631871040,Bitcoin Continues to Chop Around $48K as Ether’s Exchange Outflows Spike,"Bitcoin is in stasis as lingering macroeconomic risks keep gains in check. Ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, is seeing little action in the wake of supposedly bullish record daily outflows from exchanges.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading around $48,000 for a second day. The upside momentum ran out of steam after the United States posted unexpectedly strong August retail sales numbers on Thursday, reviving concerns of an early scaling back of Federal Reserve stimulus. Speculation about a so-called taper had subsided earlier this week following a weaker-than-estimated U.S. core inflation number.  Analysts at Standard Chartered expect the Fed to announce the taper next week after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets. “The 22 September FOMC will likely signal a tapering decision at the next meeting, providing few details. The [interest rate] dots will likely signal one 2022 hike, and two added hikes in both 2023 and 2024. The risk skew is for more rather than less hikes; the added hawkish lean in not fully priced, in our view,” the bank’s analysts noted, according to efxnews.com.  Meanwhile, some observers are worried that Chinese property giant Evergrande’s debt problems may roil financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Market activity in bitcoin futures and options suggests investors are cautiously bullish.  The bullish bias is evident from the mildly positive funding rates, or the cost of holding long positions, in the perpetual futures market, as Glassnode founders Jan Happel and Jann Allemann pointed out.  The cautious stance is apparent from the positive one-week and one-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts – or bearish bets – relative to calls, which are bullish bets. The positive values imply that traders are seeking short-term downside protection.  Record Ether exchange outflows  According to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, centralized exchanges registered an outflow of more than 360,000 ETH worth $1.2 billion on Wednesday. That was the largest single-day net outflow in dollar terms on record.  Exchange outflows are typically considered bullish as they represent a decline in the coins available for sale in the market. Ether rallied by 60% within 30 days after centralized exchanges registered a single-day outflow of $1 billion on April 16.  As such, the crypto community is cheering the latest outflow. However, drawing definite conclusions based on blockchain metrics can be risky because not every outflow represents a withdrawal by investors. It could be an exchange’s internal transfer.  That said, ether’s exchange balance has been falling for over a year and reached a 2 1/2-year low of 15 million at the end of August. Meanwhile, the amount held in the ETH2 deposit contract continues to rise and currently sits at over 7 million, data source Glassnode shows.  Furthermore, in excess of 311,000 ETH – worth over $1 billion – has been burned or permanently taken out of supply since the activation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 on Aug. 9.  Combining these factors with Ethereum’s increased usage in decentralized finance suggests the path of least resistance for ether is to the higher side. Delphi Digital foresees a renewed rally in the ether-bitcoin exchange rate. At press time, ether is changing hands near $3,530, representing a 1% drop on the day.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/17/bitcoin-continues-to-chop-around-48k-as-ethers-exchange-outflows-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ada1780aa697a4020a2bc6b6d53b26b1698deb5e-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The experiment will be conducted by the new Shanghai ShuTu Blockchain Research Institute established by Conflux and the state-owned Shanghai Maritime University, according to the statement.  The Shanghai government confirmed the news with its own announcement Thursday.  China’s central bank digital currency has been in trials since April 2020 but has been applied in only a few cross-border scenarios.  Lingang’s Pilot Free Trade Zone was approved by the People’s Bank of China to test the free capital inflows and outflows and free currency exchange of the yuan in July. The region is pegged to be a high-end manufacturing and shipping hub.  The financial liberalization is meant to support China’s cross-border trade and investments, according to state media.  China is using restricted-access blockchains across a vast array of industries as it tests the technology, including in pilots for the central bank digital currency.  The research center will also look into developing blockchain standards for trade and shipping, Conflux said.  The area is also home to Tesla’s Gigafactory, as well as Siemens and General Electric manufacturing plants.  The Shanghai government invested $5 million in Conflux in January.

42422132,pwSSwvY9oXIAw80qplcWsI,1631857509,$3M in Ether Stolen From SushiSwap’s MISO Launchpad,"A non-fungible token (NFT) auction on the MISO token launchpad built on the SushiSwap platform appears to have been hacked, with the attacker making off with roughly $3 million in ether, SushiSwap Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong tweeted Thursday.  Delong said that an anonymous contractor using the Github handle “AristoK3″ injected malicious code into Miso’s front end in a supply chain attack. He added the link to an Ethereum address showing ETH 864.8 transferred at approximately 16:00 UTC on Thursday.  Etherscan has identified the address as part of an exploit.  Supply chain attacks happen when a malicious actor changes a contract address to one they control. That type of attack can occur with open-source software libraries, according to the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center.  Only one contract appears to have been exploited, according to Delong, for the JayPegsAutoMart NFT sale.  The attacker, who has done work with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol yearn.finance, replaced the auction’s wallet address with their own, Delong said.  Delong said SushiSwap “has reason to believe” the attacker was eratos1122, linking to a Twitter account that identifies as a blockchain and mobile games developer.  SushiSwap has asked crypto exchanges FTX and Binance, to hand over the hacker’s know-your-customer information of the individual.  CoinDesk hasn’t been able to independently verify the attacker’s identity as of press time.  If the funds are not returned by 12:00 UTC, the DeFi exchange will file a complaint with the FBI, Delong said.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,"Eliza Gkritsi, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/17/3m-in-ether-stolen-from-sushiswaps-miso-launchpad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8181224cad35eb5cfa397b7878ab56a011e45a0-1205x1152.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is a great tool for ensuring that digital transactions and everyone involved are safe, which can help casinos keep up with regulatory standards. It also allows you to due diligence someone based on their payment history rather than who they are as a person. This is why casinos that allow you to pay with crypto are so popular. In regions like the Netherlands and Belgium, regulations for online casinos and payments are quite strict. Meaning it can be difficult for many companies to comply with regulations and provide service that meets user e...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13Ag8S6pRyWBn31d0VB8z-7c,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

The decentralized nature of these fundraising campaigns has led many in the traditional VC community to question their utility and viability long-term. What if this new way of raising capital leads to misaligned incentives? The concern is that blockchains like Ethereum were not designed with investor protection in mind. In response to these naysayers, business leaders note that &apos;what the ICO markets are showing is that the world has incredible demand for future-looking projects.&apos; In short, blockchain is revolutionizing fundraising. Since the early days, there have been a number of different fundraising methods, including the ICO, the IEO, the IDO, and now the ITO. Let&apos;s dive into each of these in detail. What Is An ICO? Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a method of crowdfunding using cryptocurrencies as the currency. They work similarly to an IPO (Initial Public Offering), except buyers purchase tokens instead of shares of stock. Ethereum is considered the first well-known ICO, with its 2014 token sale raising 3,700 BTC in its first 12 hours, or roughly $2.3 million at the time, though that amount of Bitcoin is worth over $165 million as of writing.

42422134,pwSSwvY9oXIAw80qplcWtm,1631844874,South Korea’s Ruling Party Looks to Delay Next Year’s Crypto Taxation in Amendment: Report,"Noh Woong-rae of the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea has proposed a “Partial Amendment to the Income Tax Act” that would delay the country’s taxation of profits on cryptocurrency assets until 2023.  The legislation, which Woong-rae hopes to pass in October, counters Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki’s intent to start taxing crypto profits in 2022 as outlined in the original version of the Income Tax Act.  Nam-ki said in April that taxation on crypto trading gains was inevitable. The Finance Ministry has previously said that cryptocurrency users will face a 20% tax on profits over 2.5 million South Korean won ($2,262).  Woong-rae and other critics argue that the “relevant taxation infrastructure is not sufficiently developed,” according to a report on Thursday by the news outlet Financial News.  “Insufficient infrastructure for taxation of virtual assets, deferral is inevitable,” said Noh who criticized the finance minister’s statement earlier this year.  Noh also said that Ministry of Finance did not have authority to start taxing cryptocurrency and that the decision was instead a legislative matter. He said that failing to mediate through proper channels would undermine citizens’ trust in their government and encourage tax evasion.  Legislation for the taxation of crypto gains has been delayed several times since it was first proposed last year.  Noh said the country’s National Assembly is expected to pass the amendment, provided the ruling and opposition parties agree, according to the report.

Kyber aims to enable dynamic fees and higher capital efficiency for decentralized finance (DeFi) users on Avalanche. It’s putting up $5.8 million in liquidity mining incentives, a common tool for DeFi projects looking to attract users with juiced token returns.  Kyber has already launched its so-called “Dynamic Market Maker” protocol on the Ethereum, Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains.  “We’re going after the users, so at the end of the day, whichever ecosystem has the growing community, we’re going to be there,” Kyber Network co-founder and CEO Loi Luu told CoinDesk in a video call,  The move comes as Avalanche attracts capital from major crypto investors. Thursday saw the announcement of a $230 million investment led by Polychain and Three Arrows Capital to provide liquidity on Avalanche-based DeFi platforms.  KyberDMM’s “Rainmaker” liquidity-mining campaign, which currently runs on Ethereum and BSC, will be combined with incentives from the $180 million “Avalanche Rush” initiative. As such, KNC and AVAX token rewards will be distributed in two stages across seven eligible pools, including USDT-USDC, ETH-AVAX, WBTC-ETH and KNC-AVAX.  “Enhancing liquidity opportunities is a key factor in growing the DeFi ecosystem and welcoming new participants into the community,” Avalanche’s Emin Gün Sirer said in a press statement.
