42383912,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAUv,1591309806,Bitcoin Is a Way to Repair Economic Injustice: Author Isaiah Jackson,"Last week, Minneapolis police officers killed a 46-year-old Black man accused of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Ongoing protests have erupted across the country, condemning police brutality and systemic racism.      Part of this conversation – taking place on the streets, over the airwaves and in people’s homes – is that economic inequality is what separates Black Americans from the rest of the nation. In Minneapolis, for example, the median income for Black households is $38,200, less than half of their White counterparts.      Like everywhere else, the protests are also a divisive issue in the crypto ecosystem. There is, however, a general agreement that there are no easy technological solutions to the larger problems plaguing the nation.      While naive claims that “Bitcoin Fixes This” are outwardly derided, Isaiah Jackson’s book title “Bitcoin & Black America” is gaining traction. The mantra, painted on signs seen in Raleigh, N.C., and across Twitter feeds, promises nothing but contains a kernel of insight.      Jackson, founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and the author of Bitcoin & Black America, thinks that bitcoin can play a crucial role in addressing economic disparity in Black communities.      CoinDesk sat down with Jackson to get his take on this week’s protests and what role bitcoin can play in bettering Black lives.      What do you think sparked the massive protests happening across the country?      The protests we’re seeing now were sparked by police violence, but the undertone – a lot of the anger that people are expressing – is economic in nature.      There are 40 million people unemployed, you have people sitting at home angry that the economy they helped build can no longer support them. Some of them received this bullshit $1,200 check, but most of the stimulus was given right back to the millionaires.      The economic injustice that we have today is the result of history. Take redlining, for example, most people don’t understand that generational wealth is accrued through homeownership. Being able to purchase a home in a community that increases in property value over time has given other communities the ability to gain that value without having to do much.      The ability to buy a home, pay off your mortgage and enrich future generations wasn’t available to the Black community [because of redlining]. Black people were excluded from receiving home loans, and when they did, were offered extortionary rates and relegated to neighborhoods that could never really gain in property value – by design.      If you look at where major highways are built and where the exit ramps are located, you’ll notice it’s mostly in Black areas. This destroyed the property value in Black neighborhoods that were already built. In North Carolina, where I’m from, there was an investigation into why I-85 runs along predominantly Black counties. All of this comes out of historical injustices that are still propagated today.      How exactly can bitcoin benefit Black lives?      Police violence is terrible, and it’s not something that could just be solved with bitcoin. But some of these solutions that I’ve seen that can work for the Black community are rooted in group economics.      Living in Los Angeles, I've learned from places like Koreatown, Chinatown and smaller communities like Little Ethiopia that understand how group economics works, that the ability to circulate dollars in a community enriches everyone and makes them inherently self-sufficient. Bitcoin offers a similar dynamic.      If you look at the Black church, compared to the catholic church that has billions of dollars in gold and real estate, the Black church lacks tangible long-term assets. Over 80% of the Black community attends some form of group service. If the church begins accepting bitcoin donations as a 501(c)(3) and stores it, that could help support the community in the long term. You can’t stop Bitcoin.      Are there political solutions to bolster civil liberties?      If we actually had a democratic system, where one person equals one vote, we would see a huge difference. Unfortunately, at the national level, there’s the electoral college where states have the authority to overturn the voters’ will.      I’d like to see that repealed. Right now, voting is really just the suggestion of democracy, no one is really electing their leaders. At the local level, I think we need to get money out of politics, where mid-level politicians can co-opt the vote. Fundraising should be standardized, and everyone should only be allowed to give the same amount. That’s where blockchain can be effective, to be able to track how much and where money is coming from, without manipulation.      There are some interesting blockchain projects that allow decentralized communities to foment. Most of these projects are still very early, so the liquidity isn’t there for them to be as effective as bitcoin has. But you have projects based on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, like smart-contract-based voting that could improve local politics.      I believe that blockchain itself isn’t hot sauce, as my friend says, you can’t put it on everything, However, I do think there will be technological solutions to help Black communities.      You’ve mentioned before that the real way to help Black communities is by voting with their dollars. Could you break that down?      From a numbers standpoint, most of the wealth in this country is stored in corporate investments. One of the things I write in the book is that 99% of venture capital flows into other communities, while only 1% goes towards Black founders.      You don’t have to give your money to Black people, I’m not asking for donations, but at least look at Black businesses and shop with Black businesses every now and then. Most are passed by or haven’t built trust with people from other communities. In my own experience, being in the fintech sector, I’ve been questioned plenty of times about my knowledge of finance.      You have to realize that Black people are just as viable in every business sector. In short, if you want to help: shop with Black businesses. That’s what will help build a strong middle class. And, of course, speak out if you see something.      Andreessen Horowitz announced a $2.2 million fund Wednesday dedicated to funding underrepresented founders. Last month it raised $515 million for a second crypto fund. Does this demonstrate the misplaced priorities of the financial sector?      I think most of these companies are just realizing now that they want to give to Black tech founders. It’s better late than never. At the very least you are doing something.      There’s a lot of wealth created through venture capital, which can support the creation of businesses for the long term, so that investment is needed. $2.2 million is a start, and once we prove ourselves with companies that actually work, we can go from there. Money talks and bullshit walks.      How do you make sense of the violence that has erupted during the George Floyd protests?      In terms of the violence going on, it’s clear it’s not just Black protestors, there are some other forces at work here. I’ve seen too many videos of random people and organizations – I’m not sure who these people are – showing up and breaking glass. I’ve seen kids being paid off, bricks left in random places like its Fortnite. It seems too coordinated for me to think that it’s all spontaneous.      Are there opportunists there? Yes, absolutely. It’s a small percentage of the protestors, but they exist, and it's all the news is going to show. The way I feel about it is, you have angry people who are going to go on the streets and do whatever they feel.      Obviously the collateral damage is affecting small businesses, and I would like to see local businesses not get touched. Some of these corporations have mistreated people for years, so I don’t really sympathize with them. They’ve underpaid and overworked people. Like I said before, the undertone of these protests is economic in nature. People are starting to see that they cannot trust anything in this system and our money has to be tied to that thought process.      What do you make of major corporations making statements in support of the protests: Is it empty virtue signaling or representative of a greater sea-change?      I think most of it is virtue signaling. There are genuine actors who want to help, but there are also those who put out empty statements who don’t want to be seen on the wrong side of history. It is what it is, it’s what they have to do. A great form of peaceful protest is to not shop with businesses that don’t show full support of ending systemic violence. That’s how you hurt people, if they can’t make money, then racism becomes really stupid, really fast.      Why do you suppose the slogan “Bitcoin & Black America” has gained a bit of traction during the protests?      I’m glad it has caught on. I went through about 10 different names but I think I found a catchy one. If people think about it there is some synergy between bitcoin and Black America.      Once the smoke clears – what are we going to do, go back to the same system? – the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet past $6.5 trillion. Inflation is going to destroy a number of industries, so we have to find a way out. But the message is out there, it’s on sweatshirts and posters.      Where do we go from here?      We need solutions. The rioting and looting is not going to last forever, people do not have the gumption to be violent for months at a time.      First, we need police reform. From my standpoint, there has to be an emphasis on increasing the wealth of our community, and rebuilding trust, and being able to build something like Black Wall Street.      There was a time when, in the 1800s, where Black communities had established financial centers in Tulsa, Okla., in Richmond, Va., outside of Cincinnati, there was also a plan for something called Soul City. If Black people were left alone, we’d have been able to build ourselves up, but of course all of those places were burned to the ground by racist White people.      What I’m trying to show now is that we can do that now. But we need systems in place that can protect us and enable us to flourish economically. I don’t think people want handouts, I just think they want to be left alone.      What will George Floyd’s legacy be?      He’ll be remembered as the spark that may have changed the world. It was a spark during a perfect storm of economic distress and growing inequality.      When we look back at 2020, I hope everyone will remember his name and, hopefully, we will not have to do this again.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/04/bitcoin-is-a-way-to-repair-economic-injustice-author-isaiah-jackson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a24ea7de1f30035611beb4f9bee643545a90424-1300x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In October 2017, it launched the world’s first cryptocurrency index fund, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, as a basket of the largest coins, weighted by 5-year diluted market capitalization.  It also manages the Bitwise Bitcoin Fund, the Bitwise Ethereum Fund and the Digital Asset Index Fund, the latter together with Morgan Creek Capital.  The firm also creates and maintains indices, some of which are used by other fund providers.  In March 2020, Bitwise revealed that it was working to list shares of its Bitwise 10 Index Fund on OTCQX, an alternative trading system regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, retail investors and advisors will be able to trade the fund on popular platforms including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade.  In July 2018, Bitwise submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This proposal was denied, and in January 2019, the firm submitted another ETF proposal, this time tying the value to bitcoin plus any “meaningful hard forks.” This was also rejected, although the SEC later decided to review this rejection. Bitwise withdrew the proposal in January 2020.  In May 2019, Bitwise presented a report to the SEC that was the first to detail some of the dubious practices that many exchanges use to artificially enhance trading volume. It argued that the actual spot bitcoin market was smaller and more regulated than public perception understood, and went as far as to identify 10 exchanges that had “clean” volumes: Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | FORKS,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/bitwise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a26ab0bde41741ada6d09db6d06463789970398d-1100x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383905,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAM7,1591307141,EU's Europol: Bitcoin Privacy Wallet 'Not Looking Good' For Law Enforcement,"Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, has its eyes on the popular bitcoin privacy tool Wasabi Wallet, documents verified by CoinDesk show.      Marked for “law enforcement only,” a two-part report by Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) analyzed the privacy tool’s impact on using the Bitcoin blockchain to investigate crimes.      ""Things are not looking good"" for law enforcement thanks to this relatively new software, the EC3 warned, citing data from leading blockchain analysis company Chainalysis estimating how much money is filtering through Wasabi for criminal purposes.      ""According to [Chainalysis], over the last three weeks, BTC in the amount of nearly 50 million USD were deposited into Wasabi with almost 30% coming from dark web markets,” says the first part of the report, circulated to law enforcement members in April. “This is a significant amount, relatively speaking, given the dark web transactions are estimated to have only 1% share of total transactions.""      Europol’s observations highlight a long-simmering tension between governments around the globe and Bitcoin privacy advocates. The blockchain is transparent, making it a useful tool for the former to thumb through accounts and transactions to track down criminals.      Privacy advocates, on the other hand, want to make bitcoin transactions harder to trace, partly so that more people will want to use the payment system, but also as a matter of principle.      EC3 is in the business of ""combating crime in a digital age"" – often online financial crimes. Its report mostly just outlines what Wasabi is: A wallet that tries to get around Bitcoin's radical transparency, giving users more privacy by scrambling transactions together and confusing the trail. The second part of the intelligence briefing, published in May, dives into how a law enforcement officer can try to detect Wasabi transactions on the blockchain, and how to use the wallet to make a transaction.      The report was leaked on Telegram recently, and Europol’s press department confirmed its authenticity.      It was written ""only for a law enforcement audience,"" Europol's press department told CoinDesk, adding that ""the report does not contain any operational information.""      Reports like this one ""are regularly sent out from the Cybercrime Centre at Europol to the EU Law Enforcement Community and our partners in those countries with which we have working arrangements in place,"" a spokesperson added. ""Europol has a number of different kinds of strategic reports and operational, analytical reports. The report at hand falls in the category strategical report.""      Still, it offers a peek into the law enforcement agency’s thinking.  ""How popular is the service?"" the guide reads, answering: ""Clearly popular enough to spark our interest.""      It asks whether law enforcement can ""demix"" these transactions, answering that ""realistically speaking, in most cases the answer is negative,"" though if a user messes up, there are ways to do it.      zkSnacks, the company behind the Wasabi wallet, did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Plaintiff Dennis Nowak, a German resident, and his counsel, longtime crypto lawyer David Silver, filed their demand for jury trial Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. They alleged the exchanges aided and abetted an unnamed thief who they claimed stole 500 bitcoins from Nowak and the exchanges remain in possession of the funds.      The suit accused Xapo and Indodax of aiding and abetting unauthorized access of a computer in violation of federal code. It also alleged they unlawfully assisted that access and are in possession of stolen property, which are violations of California code.      The suit said Xapo and Indodax “knew” their know-your-customer and anti money laundering policies “were inadequate” and have permitted, “whether intentionally or not” criminal activity to persist.      Xapo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.      Nowak sought the return of his “stolen personal property” and additional relief, according to the suit. His bitcoin was worth about $2,300,000 at the time of the theft, the suit said.      Nowak’s bitcoins appeared to have fled his account almost as soon as he had deposited it. According to the suit, Nowak deposited 500 BTC at his unnamed U.S.-based exchange on Nov. 20, 2018. “John Doe” had taken all 500 of it by 4 p.m. on Nov. 23.      Plaintiff claimed his bitcoins followed a handful of relatively transparent steps over to Xapo and Indodax. Investigations firm Kroll, who traced the transaction, found “no obvious attempts” to hide their path, according to the suit.      The suit alleged Xapo held 19.99 BTC and Indodax held 479.69 BTC of Nowak’s original 500.      Silver, the lawyer, declined to elaborate on the original hack beyond what is alleged in the suit.

In an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking published Thursday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said it was reviewing its regulations around digital bank activities to ensure that these regulations “continue to evolve with developments in the industry.”      The notice, one of two published Thursday, was signed by Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, the former chief legal officer of Coinbase who took office at OCC last week.      In an emailed statement, OCC spokesperson Bryan Hubbard said:    “The request for stakeholder comment is part of the OCC’s commitment to responsible innovation and aligned with our understanding that banks must be able to evolve to meet the needs of the consumers, businesses, and communities that rely on them. Our role is to ensure there is a clear, supportive regulatory framework for banks to do so. The request for comments helps ensure we hear from stakeholders of all kinds on those important issues.”    The notice specifically asked what sort of cryptocurrency-related activities banks and other financial institutions are currently engaged in, and what activities customers engage in that impact banks.      It also asked:    “What are the barriers or obstacles, if any, to further adoption of crypto-related activities in the banking industry? Are there specific activities that should be addressed in regulatory guidance, including regulations?”    Separately from crypto assets specifically, the notice asked about the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in banking activities and – as with the crypto-related activities section – asked if there are any specific issues that need to be clarified.      “What new payments technologies and processes should the OCC be aware of and what are the potential implications of these technologies and processes for the banking industry? How are new payments technologies and processes facilitated or hindered by existing regulatory frameworks?” the filing said.      Read more: Coinbase Legal Chief Says Private Sector Should Build US Digital Dollar      The notice also briefly addressed Brooks’ suggestion that his office could issue a national charter for cryptocurrency exchanges, which would essentially allow it to bypass the state-by-state framework that right now requires companies to secure 50 money services business (MSB) registrations to operate nationwide.      “The OCC is not seeking comment on its authority to issue a special purpose national bank charter,” it said.      In a statement, Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith said, “It’s heartening to see a top banking regulator understand the power of cryptocurrency. The notice today indicates that Acting Comptroller Brooks is serious about modernizing banking regulations so that innovators can bring new solutions to the legacy financial system.”      Individuals interested in providing public comment can email, mail, hand-deliver, fax or file feedback online, with comments due by Aug. 3, 2020.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/04/us-bank-regulator-occ-asks-for-public-input-on-cryptocurrency-use-in-financial-sector,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a623e61743b25176fc14fe8438bbe43ad09a982b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAdj,1591302801,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Closing in on $9,900 as Crypto Market Volatility Persists","A quick rally followed by a sharp decline earlier this week in bitcoin prices spelled trouble for bulls. However, volatility is back in the spotlight and that could bring other opportunities, according to market players.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,816 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 2.5% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Thursday (8:00 p.m. Wednesday EDT), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands around $9,655 on spot exchanges like Coinbase. The price stayed close to that level until 13:00 UTC (9 a.m. EDT), when the price traded up as high as $9,891. Bitcoin is now above both its 50-day and 10-day moving averages, indicating bullish sentiment.      Bitcoin had been in a bit of a holding pattern since June 3, when price dropped as quickly as it rose to $10,000 late June 1.      “Bulls had been shaken out in the last few days with the bull trap the bears set up,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha.      Read More: Traders ‘Whack the Beehive’ as Bitcoin Surges Then Plunges      While the action over the past few days had seemed sleepy until Thursday’s breakout, steep price appreciations and subsequent drops are the norm for crypto traders. When compared to global stock markets, bitcoin is maintaining a higher level of volatility. Despite the recent global bout of economic turmoil, stocks are experiencing diminishing volatility.      “Bitcoin is realizing two to three times the volatility of the S&P 500, with altcoins registering well beyond that,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of a new crypto derivatives exchange called Alpha5. “By no means is crypto more stable, and there is no chance that it can be if it is to grow.”      Continued crypto volatility can partially explain why May was the best month ever for digital asset derivatives in May, to over $600 billion, according to data from aggregator CryptoCompare.      Volatility remains the name of the game for professional traders in the crypto market. Josh Rager, cryptocurrency trader and founder of educational platform Blackroots, throws out price movements in bitcoin that are rarely heard of in traditional markets.      Read More: Bloomberg Analysts Predict $20K Bitcoin This Year      “Bitcoin still has to break above $10,400 on a weekly chart for me to feel bullish,” Rager told CoinDesk. “I am looking to short if price hits the $9,800s again, and $8,500 needs to hold if it drops to there. Just taking it level by level.”      “Crypto traders have a high psychological threshold and expectation for volatility,” said Alpha5’s Shah. The market for derivatives will only grow because it gives traders something to do during flat trading. “When price action pauses for a few sessions, frustration channels into moans about the lack of opportunity,” Shah added.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mostly in the green Thursday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, climbed less than a percent in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

In a new report Thursday, London-based data aggregator CryptoCompare found crypto derivative volumes increased 32% to $602 billion. That's a new all-time high, squeaking past the previous record of $600 billion set in March.      Most of the heavy-lifting came from Huobi, OKEx and Binance. The three exchanges made up 80% of May's derivative activity. Huobi was the largest, with $176 billion in volume, up 29% from April. OKEx and Binance came in with $156 billion and $139 billion, respectively.      But CryptoCompare also found there was a notable increase in trading activity around crypto options, contracts giving the owner the right to buy or sell the underlying at a specified date and price.      Volume on options exchange Deribit more than doubled to $3.06 billion in May. On the 10th of that month, the day before the Bitcoin halving event, $196 million worth of trades passed through Deribit, making it the single-biggest day in the platform's four-year history.      Similarly, institutional exchange CME, which only released its own crypto options earlier this year, reported a 16-fold increase in monthly activity compared to April. Like Deribit, there was a significant uptick in trading activity in and around the Bitcoin halving event.      Speaking to CoinDesk, CryptoCompare founder and CEO Charles Hayter said the surge in crypto options trading suggested a ""more sophisticated, diverse class of investor"" is getting involved during a period when not only was there a halving event, but also ""unprecedented financial measures"" taking place around the world following the coronavirus outbreak.

Listen or subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, iHeartRadio or RSS.      This episode is sponsored by Bitstamp and Ciphertrace.      U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last Thursday, seeking to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 prevents social media companies from civil liability for the content posted on them. The order targets Twitter and Facebook after Twitter fact-checked two of the President’s tweets.      Today, CoinDesk tackles the topic with Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, privacy reporter Benjamin Powers, New York Law School professor and past president of the American Civil Liberties Union Nadine Strossen and Amy James, author of the Open Index Protocol.      See also: 'We Need 30 Different Words for Censorship,' Feat. Andreas M. Antonopoulos      On this podcast, the CoinDesk team brings listeners up to speed on the leadup to and aftermath of the executive order, and discusses the fairness implications of editorializing on social media, the business models that enable and are empowered by all of this and how decentralized protocols can chart an alternative path forward.      First, we talk about the First Amendment and Section 230 itself, what it does and doesn’t do as it pertains to social media platforms and moderation.      Then we talk about fairness and the if-you-don’t-like-it-leave argument, as well as related topics.      We’ll talk about the business models and assumptions implicit in the current state of dominant social media platforms before turning to alternatives or possible solutions in decentralized protocols and multi-layered approaches to moderation or censorship.

Top shelf    Ethereum The most popular way to use bitcoin off-chain is on Ethereum, data suggests. Ethereum projects including WBTC and imBTC hold 70% more bitcoins than Bitcoin-native scaling solutions Lightning or Liquid. Separately, researchers have found that governments and private entities can strip away anonymity from Ethereum, and users are making it easier for them by revealing links between deposits and withdrawals. This could also ""impact the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,” the authors write.      Bitcoin The 20th iteration of Bitcoin Core, the open source software powering the Bitcoin blockchain, was released Wednesday. Included in the update is an experimental software called “Asmap"" to protect against a theoretical “Erebus” attack, which allows nation states and/or large internet providers such as AWS to spy, double-spend or censor bitcoin transactions. Meanwhile, HDR Global Trading Limited, BitMEX’s parent company, has awarded its second grant to a Bitcoin Core contributor. (The Block)      Mining The Bitcoin blockchain adjusted its mining difficulty downwards, dropping 9.29%, to reach the lowest level since January. This is the eighth-largest negative difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin’s history and the eighth instance of two or more consecutive negative adjustments. Elsewhere, mining firm Argo reported a 34% dip in May mining margins, possibly as a result of the bitcoin halving event. Last but certainly not least, Micree Zhan Ketuan, the ousted Bitmain co-founder, sent a letter calling for employees to return to the office to join him rather than his rival co-founder Wu Jihan. The message offered cash bonuses to loyalists, and said Zhan would complete the company’s long-awaited IPO while pushing its market capitalization to over $50 billion in the coming years. Decrypt reported that Zhan retook the office with a dozen security guards in tow.      Banking Arival Bank is launching in beta Thursday with a 20-person team and offices in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Saint Petersburg, Fla., to provide banking accounts to crypto startups via a sponsor bank.

The Last Last Word on Bitcoin’s (Horrifying) Energy Consumption Michael Reece Purson responds to Nic Carter’s op-ed, “The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption.” Challenging Carter point by point, Purson apparently made his first factual error when saying the VC has “‘analyst’ in your job description.”    Market intel    Bitcoin Doth Protest too Much? Wall Street traders appear to be looking past the protests roiling across the nation, focusing instead on prospects for an improving economy as states reopen and business activity picks up. The dollar weakened Wednesday against the euro and British pound, seen as a sign that investors in traditional markets are ramping up, not ratcheting back, risk-taking. The bitcoin market, too, has barely reacted to the news. Prices nudged 0.4% higher on Wednesday to about $9,600, leaving the cryptocurrency squarely within the range where it has traded since late April, between $8,500 and $10,200.      Bloomberg Is Bullish A Bloomberg analyst thinks bitcoin will hit $20,000 this year, after comparing the price action seen over the last 2.5 years to the patterns over the 2.5 years following the leading cryptocurrency’s rise to record highs in December 2013, when bitcoin printed a lifetime high of $1,100 before crashing.

42383915,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAXR,1591286108,"Bittrex, Poloniex Added to Lawsuit Claiming Tether Manipulated Bitcoin Market","A lawsuit alleging stablecoin issuer Tether and sister exchange Bitfinex manipulated the bitcoin market is getting bigger.      On Wednesday, cryptocurrency exchanges Bittrex and Poloniex became the latest defendants accused of fraudulently toying with crypto asset prices in an ongoing class action whose plaintiffs have been pursuing Tether and Bitfinex on allegations of fraud, deception and market-manipulation since October 2019.      The 156-page amended suit filed Wednesday continues to allege that Tether and Bitfinex orchestrated a grand scheme to launder and circulate billions of allegedly unbacked USDT stablecoins through the market to the detriment of their customers – the crux of plaintiffs Matthew Script, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz and Pinchas Goldshtein’s case.      Plaintiffs further claim that Poloniex and Bittrex were essentially backdoor conduits in that scheme. They claim the pair set up wallet addresses “specifically” to receive huge USDT transfers and “knew” that Bitfinex was the one sending it along.      “Given the size and regularity of these transfers through a mechanism they created for that exact purpose and their perfect visibility into the transactions, Bittrex and Poloniex knew the manipulative effect of the transactions on their exchanges,” the plaintiffs allege.      The plaintiffs point to USDT inflow patterns as evidence. On Feb. 6 2018, for example, they allege Bitfinex transferred $2 million of allegedly valueless USDT to Poloniex right when bitcoin was hitting a low for the day. A cross-crypto market rally and higher trading volumes ensued.      Read more: New York AG Report Faults Crypto Exchanges for Manipulation Risks      “For otherwise peripheral exchanges, these large trades of purportedly fiat-backed USDT created an impression of legitimacy and consumer trust, leading to further trades and fees for the two exchanges,” the suit alleges.      They also allege that the cabal coordinated USDT transfer patterns in response to the news of the day, including in the wake of the Tether Report.

42383898,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAFp,1591281328,Bitmain's Feuding Co-Founders Are Fracturing the Firm and Staff Are Caught in the Middle,"Staff at Bitmain now have a decision to make: whether to return to the office and which executive they choose to take orders from.      Micree Zhan Ketuan, the Bitmain co-founder who was ousted in a coup by his rival Wu Jihan last October, sent out a letter addressed to Bitmain employees via his WeChat feed on Thursday, saying he had returned to the company's Beijing office starting from June 3.      He further called for staffers at Bitmain to return to the office to join him and said he will ""lead the company to complete an initial public offering as soon as possible and push Bitmain's market capitalization to over $50 billion in the next three to five years.""      Due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, most of Bitmain's Beijing staff have been working from home since earlier this year. A video circulating online and verified by Chinese crypto media source BlockBeats shows that Zhan led a group of private guards and forcefully entered Bitmain's office in Beijing on Wednesday.      According to one Bitmain employee, who spoke to CoinDesk under the condition of anonymity, Zhan was also handing out cash bonuses worth 10,000 yuan ($1,500) to those returning yesterday and 5,000 yuan ($700) for those that turned up today.      The news marks the latest twist in Bitmain's bitter internal fight which has cast doubts among investors and customers over the management of the world's largest bitcoin miner manufacturer.      Recently the dispute even descended into physical confrontation between the management factions as Zhan regained his official status as a legal representative of the Beijing Bitmain Technology Limited, the main operating entity of Bitmain.    Twin seals    Going by Zhan's letter on Thursday, it also looks like there's been a ""hard fork"" of the company's official seal, of which there are now appears to be two.      Early last month, as Zhan recovered his status as legal representative of Beijing Bitmain, he was entitled to receive a new business license for the company issued by a Beijing government agency that oversees corporate registrations.      However, at the time, Zhan was not in possession of the official seal of Beijing Bitmain. In China, a company's official seal is as important as the role of the legal representative in terms of signing a company's decision into effect. Forging an official seal is an offense under China's criminal laws.      Since the tussle at the government office, Bitmain has been discussing with staff the transferring of their employment contracts from Beijing Bitmain to another parallel subsidiary, Beijing Guiyuan Dalu, according to one person familiar with the plan. Like Beijing Bitmain, the new entity is wholly owned by Bitmain Technologies Hong Kong and was officially registered on May 26. But the legal representative of Beijing Guiyuan Dalu is not Zhan.      On May 27, it was reported by Chinese crypto media that Zhan had issued a document on May 25 in an effort to fire Liu Luyao from his role as Bitmain's CFO, who was also involved in the May confrontation.      The document, signed by Zhan, did not bear the official seal of Bitmain. On the same day, Beijing Bitmain issued a statement with the official seal via its WeChat account, saying Zhan had no authority to act as a legal representative to give notices or directions to its staff.      The firm further said it was in possession of the effective official seal with a serial number of 1101070056574 and no employees should take Zhan's directions or otherwise it will take legal actions.      However, Zhan's June 4 letter bears a different official seal for Beijing Bitmain with a serial number of 1101081651178. Zhan also posted a statement on June 3 saying the previous seal – ending in 6574 – had been voided.      In the latest chapter of the saga, Bitmain issued a statement via its official WeChat account on Wednesday accusing Zhan of forging an official seal of the company and said it has hired lawyers to take legal action against him.      Zhan already has ongoing legal cases against Bitmain regarding his voting power in the company in the Cayman Islands, where Bitmain's ultimate controlling holding entity resides.

42383910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAR9,1591275734,Japan's Biggest Banks Are Talking About Building a Digital Payments System,"Three of Japan's largest banks are among major players joining a study group looking at developing a digital payment system that may address concerns about cryptocurrencies.      Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group – institutions that control more than $6.6 trillion in assets between them – will participate in a study group to determine the feasibility of a national digital payments solution.      Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DeCurret, which is hosting the study group, said in a statement Wednesday, that the members would ""examine and discuss challenges and solutions concerning digital currencies and digital settlement infrastructure, to find a consensus toward their realization.""      Aside from major banks, the group will include big players from a whole range of sectors. Telecoms giant KDDI Corporation, for example; as well as the East Japan Railway Company, the country's largest rail operator; and Mori Hamada & Matsumoto, one of the ""Big Four"" law firms.      On the regulatory side, both the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Financial Services Agency (FSA), will participate as observers, alongside representatives from government departments, including Finance and the Ministry of Economy and Internal Affairs.      Topics up for discussion include how a proposed digital payment system would operate, and potential use cases, both in Japan and overseas. They will also examine service provision and conversations around the setting of infrastructure standards.      See also: Fearing ‘Currency Struggle,’ Japanese Politicians Want G-7 Response to China’s Digital Yuan      Reuters, which reported the story, argued that a digital payment system shared in common between banks, big business and regulators could harmonize and re-focus existing attempts to encourage Japan to move away from physical cash.      While 96% of transactions in neighboring South Korea are electronic, Japan is seeking 40% cashless transactions by 2025.      But as well as weening Japan off cash, DeCurret's suggests the study group will address preexisting worries about cryptocurrencies. While digital payments can improve efficiency and convenience, the statement reads, ""concerns are emerging over issues including privacy protection, crime prevention measures, and technology risks.""      Concerns about the safety of cryptocurrencies may not altogether be surprising. Japan experienced firsthand two of the worst ever exchange hacks – Mt. Gox and Coincheck. Exchanges now need a license from the FSA before they can operate legally in the country.      See also: BitMEX Restricts Access to Japanese Residents, Citing Changes to Local Law      DeCurret, which has been licensed since 2019, said that the study group will provide ""the need for a direction for the realization of valuable digital currencies in Japan.""

42383914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAWB,1591274685,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops 9% to January Levels,"Bitcoin has just got easier to mine.      At block height 633,024, reached on 12:30 UTC Thursday, the Bitcoin blockchain adjusted its mining difficulty to 13.7 Trillion with a 9.29% drop and reached the lowest level since January this year.      According to data compiled by CoinDesk Research, today saw the eighth largest negative difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin's history and the eighth instance of two or more consecutive negative adjustments.      The Thursday adjustment also follows a 6% drop recorded on May 20, which was the network's first difficulty change after Bitcoin's quadrennial halving event.      The halving – a scheduled event coded into Bitcoin's protocol – reduced mining rewards from 12.5 bitcoin (BTC) per block to 6.25 units. The event also squeezed out operators that ran older, less efficient equipment who could no longer return a profit.      Remaining miners who have access to cheap electricity and more state-of-the-art equipment will see today's adjustment as good news, since the drop in mining difficulty means bitcoin has become easier to mine.      But even as difficulty drops, the hashrate (or total computing power) on the network has grown over the past week as miners started switching on newly shipped machines ahead of China's rainy season.      Bitmain and MicroBT, the two major Chinese mining equipment makers, have been dispatching their most efficient ASIC miners like the AntMiner S19 and WhatsMiner M30S since May. According to their official websites and major distributors, pre-orders for these top-of-the-line machines for July, August and September batches are mostly sold out.      Read more: Bitcoin Mining Pool Poolin Partners With BlockFi to Expand Crypto Lending Service      Meanwhile, China's monsoon is now bringing down hydropower electricity in the country's southwestern region to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). With that rate, even older mining equipment like the AntMiner S9s can still operate with profits at bitcoin's current price and difficulty level.      The Bitcoin network changes its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, in order to keep the average block production interval at every 10 minutes.      If more people have joined the mining game, resulting in a higher hashrate and an average sub-10-minute interval, the network will automatically increase the difficulty again. Conversely, if more people have unplugged from the network during any cycle, leading to a lower hashrate and longer block intervals, the network will ease the difficulty to make it easier to mine.      Data shows the seven-day rolling average of Bitcoin's hashrate initially dropped to 90 exahashes per second (EH/s) around May 27 – a week after the last adjustment on May 20.      At that point, it was more than 15% below the average hash rate (108 EH/s) before May 20. But over the past week, the total computing power has steadily climbed up to above the 100 EH/s level.      Indeed, the average block production time from May 20 to May 27 was over 12 minutes, longer than the intended 10-minute interval. The increased hash rate since May 27 until now has shortened the time to within 11 minutes over the period.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | RESEARCH,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/04/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-drops-9-to-january-levels,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ec5f688f52d28e83a2fd67710cab2f61fd4e04d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383908,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAPt,1591273810,Crypto-Friendly Arival Bank Is Launching Today for Those Willing to Disclose Their Bags,"After two years of laying the groundwork, crypto-friendly Arival Bank is launching in beta Thursday. (Yes, even a bank can ""launch in beta"" these days.)      To be precise, Arival is more of a fintech startup than a bank in the traditional sense. A team of 20 with offices in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Miami, Fla., it plans to provide banking accounts to crypto startups via its sponsor bank, Puerto Rico-based San Juan Mercantile Bank and Trust.      But there's a catch: If you want to bank with Arival and you own crypto you also need to show what’s in your wallet.      The firm is using tools from the blockchain analysis firm Elliptic to scan the crypto addresses that onboarding clients provide and see if there are any suspicious transactions.      “To the extent that Arival will be servicing crypto customers, we take very seriously the need to complete due diligence to ensure they are regulated and legally compliant issuers. Arival has no intention of servicing non-compliant entities or bad actors,” such as those under the U.S. sanctions, co-founder and chief operating officer Jeremy Berger said.      The conditions are a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency industry's uneasy relationship with the legacy banking system. Traditional institutions have largely been loath to provide even basic accounts to the young sector's startups, for fear of enforcement actions if they even inadvertently facilitate money laundering, sanctions violations or other financial crimes. The revenue from the relationships often isn't enough to justify the risk in bankers' minds, and the few willing to do business with crypto firms, therefore, take a belt-and-suspenders approach to customer due diligence.      Read more: JPMorgan Bank Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as Its First Crypto Exchange Customers      While monitoring a client's crypto dealings, Arival's compliance department would pay attention to things like where the clients and their own customers come from, transaction volume on the wallets, “specific cryptocurrencies utilized, conducting a transaction with a shell company” and other factors, Berger said.      The clients are obliged to report if they own crypto, and Arival will be looking out for publicly available information pointing at that, he said. “We do media checking so we see if the client has involvement in the crypto space, and then we make an educated guess that they do have a crypto wallet.”      A failure to report the fact of owning crypto would put a client “in a high-risk category” and potentially lead to suspending the account “until further investigation and receipt of corroborating information,” Berger said.    Early days    In the “beta” stage, clients will only be able to open a business account with Arival, park their funds and transfer it around the world if they need it, with more options coming later this year, Berger said.      In the pipeline for the coming months are individual accounts, card issuance, analytics products for businesses and remittances in different currencies. Arival is also aiming to introduce lending and deposit and savings products down the road.      According to Berger, there are around 3,000 prospects on Arival’s waiting list, and the firm will now start onboarding those clients. They come mostly from U.S., U.K, EU, Hong Kong, Singapore and more than 60 other countries.      Read more: Crypto Firm Deposits Jump 24% in Q1 at Metropolitan Commercial Bank      Potential clients, Berger said, include new venture-backed crypto and fintech startups; crypto exchanges overseas that want to allow dollar deposits but have a hard time opening a U.S. bank account; independent contractors; and micro-businesses of three to five employees.      All of those businesses can open an account with Arival without visiting a physical office, Berger said. Crypto disclosures aside, the know-your-customer (KYC) procedure is quite painstaking, he said: A potential client needs to submit a selfie, a video, and three types of identifying documents.      Then, Arival runs the data through multiple datasets, from social media monitoring to face-recognition tools.    Licensing challenges    Arival applied for a Puerto Rico International Financial Entity (IFE) license in August 2018 because it is easier to get than a U.S. bank charter. However, the process turned out to be far from easy anyway: Arival has only received a preliminary approval (“permit to organize”) so far.      Part of the reason was the Puerto Rico authorities have been dealing with hectic times recently, with U.S. regulators cracking down on the country’s banking industry last summer and the coronavirus pandemic leaving government offices shut for almost two months this year, Berger said.      However, Arival is on its way for a full IFE license and has made overtures in other jurisdictions as well. The firm applied for a digital wholesale banking license in Singapore and an electronic money institution (EMI) license in Lithuania, Berger said.      Read more: Brazil Regulator Votes to Continue Probe Into Banks’ Rejection of Crypto Firms      Igor Pesin, Arival's co-founder and chief financial officer, said having a variety of licenses will help the firm become “a borderless digital bank and banking-as-a-service partner for global fintech startups.”      Arival was founded more than two years ago by a small team of fintech professionals from Russia and the U.S. with a focus on crypto entrepreneurs and gig economy workers, who may find it hard to get business accounts with traditional banks.      The company raised $2.4 million via a crowdfunding campaign at SeedInvest and is now raising its Series A round, Berger said.

42383918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAcT,1591271880,Bloomberg Analysts Predict $20K Bitcoin This Year,"Bloomberg analysts are the latest to jump on the bandwagon of experts expecting bitcoin to revisit its record high in 2020.      The bold prediction is largely based on the fact that price action seen over the last 2.5 years looks similar to the patterns over the 2.5 years following the leading cryptocurrency's rise to record highs in December 2013.      “After 2014's 60% decline, by the end of 2016 the crypto matched the 2013 peak. Fast forward four years and the second year after the almost 75% decline in 2018,” noted Bloomberg Crypto in a monthly report. “Bitcoin will approach the record high of about $20,000 this year, in our view, if it follows 2016's trend.""      Let's take a look at those patterns.    2013 to 2017    Bitcoin printed a lifetime high above $1,100 in early December 2013 and fell by over 55% in the following year.      The bear market ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015 and bitcoin turned higher in the fourth quarter of that year. Prices then rose back to levels above $700 ahead of its second mining reward halving (a coded-in supply cut), which took place on July 9, 2016.    2017 to present    Having topped out at a record high of $20,000 in mid-December 2017, bitcoin fell by 75% in 2018. The cryptocurrency bottomed out near $3,100 in December 2018 and rose 90% in the following year.      Moreover, prices remained largely bid (barring the March sell-off) in the five months leading up to the third halving on May 11, 2020. The cryptocurrency clocked highs above $10,000 in early May.      With bitcoin tending to move in these long-term cycles, prices may indeed challenge $20,000 this year, as expected by Bloomberg.      ""Something needs to go really wrong for bitcoin to not appreciate,"" the analysts added in the note.    Macro factors    “This year is about increasingly favorable technical and fundamental underpinnings for bitcoin,” Bloomberg's note continued.      Indeed, with increased institutional participation and other factors accelerating the maturation of the bitcoin market, the odds appear stacked in favor of continued upward move in prices.      Open interest, or open positions in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is considered synonymous with institutions and macro traders, has increased by over 500% so far this year, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Further, bitcoin-based exchange-traded instruments like Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest by assets under management (AUM), have recently been on an accumulation spree. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent firm of CoinDesk.)      ""So far this year, its increasing AUM has consumed about 25% of new Bitcoin-mined coins vs. less than 10% in 2019. Our graphic depicts the rapidly rising 30-day average of GBTC AUM near 340,000 in Bitcoin equivalents, about 2% of total supply. About two years ago, it accounted for 1%,"" Bloomberg said.      The trust has accumulated coins 1.5 times the total coins mined since the May 11 halving, according to crypto analyst Kevin Rooke.      Put simply, demand looks to be outstripping supply and that is a classic factor driving price rises, regardless of the asset.      Additionally, the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus lifelines launched by central banks and governments across the globe to counter the coronavirus-induced economic crisis and joblessness is widely expected to push up inflation, leading to a further increase in demand for bitcoin.      Most analysts consider bitcoin a hedge against inflation, given its supply is capped at 21 millions and its monetary policy is set in code to cut cut by 50% every four years.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,500, representing a 1.4% decline on the day.

42383916,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAYh,1591270638,"First Mover: Bitcoin Market, Like Wall Street, Shrugs Off Nationwide Protests","There, in the midst of a protest against police brutality in Austin, Texas, stood a man holding a makeshift cardboard sign that read, ""Bitcoin will save us.""      The image, tweeted earlier this week by the ProPublica journalist Jessica Huseman, generated 789 retweets and 2,400 likes. Some twitterati said bitcoin had nothing to do with the protests, while others argued that flaws in the current financial economic system have contributed to the wealth inequality now helping to fuel the foment.      The protests, some of which turned violent and led to vandalism and looting, have spread internationally following the death of George Floyd, 46, a black American who died in Minneapolis after being taken into police custody followin a report that a $20 counterfeit bill had been passed at a nearby corner store.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      So how might the spreading protests affect the price of bitcoin?      The answer isn't clear, but the premise of the question speaks to economic and philosophical considerations that could, at some point, impact the market.      Judging from the reaction of U.S. stocks, which have climbed this week, Wall Street traders appear to be looking past the protests, focusing instead on prospects for an improving economy as states reopen and business activity picks up. The dollar weakened Wednesday against the euro and British pound, seen as a sign that investors in traditional markets are ramping up, not ratcheting back, risk-taking.      The bitcoin market, too, has barely reacted to the news. Prices nudged 0.4% higher on Wednesday to about $9,600, leaving the cryptocurrency squarely within the range where it has traded since late April, between about $8,500 and $10,200.      One of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, Kevin Hassett, told Fox Business Network on Wednesday that ""there definitely are signs that we're turning the corner"" on the economy. He acknowledged the hopes rest partly on the ""biggest policy response in history."" That would include total fiscal support globally of at least $9 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank, as well as some $5 trillion of fresh liquidity pumped into financial markets this year by central banks, according to Bank of America.      Bitcoin analysts have touted such money injections as a reason for buying the cryptocurrency — to hedge against an inevitable surge in inflation.  But there's also been discussion of the deflationary impulse that comes with recessions: When unemployment is high and consumers aren't in a buying mood, prices tend to fall. The collapse in crude oil to unprecedented negative price levels earlier this year shows how that market reacted in the face of demand destruction: nobody was driving or flying.  Scott MacDonald, chief economist at Smith's Research & Gradings, noted in a report on Wednesday that the property damage from the protests could ""further impair the comeback of small businesses to reopen.""  ""Angry mobs, tear gas and burning police vehicles is never a good sign,"" he wrote.  Perhaps more troubling, the social unrest could damp consumer confidence, which could further dim the prospects of a quick economic recovery, MacDonald said in a phone interview.  ""I think it's going to take much longer than people want to admit,"" MacDonald said. ""There's so much that's gone wrong here and been disrupted, and if you add political uncertainty on top that, that just doesn't give people the feeling they need to go out and spend money.""  Some infectious-disease experts are now warning the protest-related mass gatherings might spur a new wave of coronavirus infections — another potential risk to the hoped-for rebound.  A prolonged downturn could be a double-edged sword for bitcoin. On the one hand, sluggish economic demand could prove deflationary. With unemployment rates soaring, possibly to 20% based on some predictions, economists would expect downward pressure on wages. On the other hand, the distress wrought on businesses and households might prompt authorities to undertake new rounds of monetary or fiscal stimulus. As the popular meme goes, money printer go brrrr.  Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, says the thesis that bitcoin should act as a hedge against inflation is, as yet, untested — since inflation has never really picked up since the cryptocurrency's debut in early 2009.  What's beyond doubt, he says, is bitcoin was initially launched by its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a potential alternative to government-issued currencies.  There's no indication at this point that the protests will undermine the dollar's stronghold as the world's reserve currency, according to Greenspan, or that they will spread to the point where trust starts to erode in the U.S. government, and perhaps by extension, the Federal Reserve.  Even if that were to happen, it might not be good for bitcoin — at least at this moment in time.  ""If fiat collapses, all of a sudden you're going to have strains on the bitcoin network, and it's not prepared to handle billions of new users,"" Greenspan said in an audio chat over Telegram. ""Bitcoin's best-case scenario is for the economy to do well.""  MacDonald predicts it's going to be a ""long, hot summer in America.""  Health authorities are battling a global pandemic. Governments are grappling with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 40 million people have lost their jobs since early March. It's a presidential election year in the U.S., and Trump is once again ratcheting up tensions with China and sowing doubts about the viability of mail-in voting ballots.  How the international protests spurred by George Floyd's death will affect bitcoin aren't yet clear. But the unrest could certainly affect the economy and possibly trust in the system — two things crypto traders usually care a lot about.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,552 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,690| 24-Hr Low: $9,519      Trend: Bitcoin has recovered over 4% from Monday's low, however, the bounce could be short-lived, the price-volume analysis indicates.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,630, having put in a low of $9,298 on Monday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices clocked a high of $9,690 during Asian trading hours.      The recovery has taken the shape of an ascending channel on the hourly chart. However, the bullish pattern is accompanied by anemic volumes. A low-volume rise is often reversed. Supporting the case for a fresh move lower is the hourly chart relative strength index (RSI), which has breached the bullish trendline.      The failed pennant breakout, or the bullish continuation pattern, seen on the daily chart is also painting a bearish picture.      On the way lower, bitcoin may find support at the 200-hour average at $9,495. Acceptance below that support would open the doors to $9,000, beyond which a major support is seen at $8,630 - the higher low created on May 25.      On the higher side, $10,000 remains the level to beat for the bulls, as the cryptocurrency has failed multiple times this year to keep gains above this key psychological hurdle.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/04/first-mover-bitcoin-market-like-wall-street-shrugs-off-nationwide-protests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6bf4da0ce69dd81a37e45082e6a7adcbcf618fde-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383913,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zATf,1591266653,Ex-Yang Aide Is Running for Congress With Bitcoin and UBI on His Mind,"For would-be U.S. lawmaker Jonathan Herzog, financial exclusion isn’t just a talking point, it’s lived experience.      When launching his congressional run, he said, Herzog went to Bank of America and Citibank and tried to open a campaign checking account but was denied. Herzog saw it as an example of the ways centralized institutions can hold power over people, even someone like him who is privileged.      That’s in part why he’s stumping for open, permissionless financial systems as part of his campaign.      “There’s acute urgency to ensure that bitcoin and cryptocurrency have mass adoption and have a regulatory framework that enables their innovation in New York and in the United States,” Herzog said.      An alum of the Andrew Yang presidential campaign and a legal advocate, Herzog is running for Congress in New York's 10th District, which encompasses the West Side of Manhattan and South Brooklyn. It’s a long shot, with the 25-year-old currently trailing in polls against incumbent Jerry Nadler, who has occupied the seat for 28 years, for the Democratic nomination. The primary is scheduled for June 23.      For a politician, Herzog appears to know quite a bit about bitcoin, even casually dropping a reference to the cryptocurrency’s recent, once-in-four-years halving event in an interview this week.      Herzog spoke to CoinDesk by phone from his campaign’s de facto headquarters near Battery Park Square in lower Manhattan. Looking out his window at the rebuilt One World Trade Center (also known as the Freedom Tower), he explained why he thinks about bitcoin through a civil rights framework and why he sees a pressing need for a universal basic income (UBI), a signature issue for Herzog’s former boss Yang.      And despite his party alignment, he minced no words about the impact of the state’s BitLicense, written by a fellow Democrat, former Department of Financial Services superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, in the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo.      This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.      So you were working on the Yang campaign, and now you’re running for office yourself. Tell me more about that trajectory.      I’m running for congress in the New York 10th District and I am a civil rights organizer and legal advocate. I’ve spent my time really invested in movements that are combating dark money and politics, combating poverty and hate and most recently joining the founding team that built Andrew Yang's 2020 presidential campaign. I joined as the sixth hire, helped get Yang on Joe Rogan, helped him qualify for the [Democratic National Committee] debates, and really bring this then-unknown entrepreneur to become the internet candidate, the crypto candidate and a top contender for the nomination.      The urgency of the issues at the time was immense. Andrew was calling out the fact that we were going through the fourth industrial revolution and that we had automated away millions of the most common jobs. He was fighting for a set of solutions like a universal basic income, data dignity, including a data bill of rights and data property rights, and public financing of elections. I said, “Holy shit, we have to do all we can to make sure this guy is our next president.” And right now we're in the midst of this global pandemic where more than 100,000 Americans have died and one in five of those are New Yorkers. More than 40 million people are unemployed and 40% of those jobs are not going to return. I'm running because we need to wake up and we need new representatives who have 21st century solutions to these 21st century crises. And we don't have the time to delay.      See also: Andrew Yang Says Current Stimulus Payments to Americans Aren't Enough      What do you think about the viability of UBI, particularly after COVID-19? Should some form of a digital dollar be pursued to give us the infrastructure to help distribute money to American’s quickly in a crisis?      Yes, and yes, in short. But in long form, what's most stark to me is that even though it might seem in this moment that a universal basic income or recurring direct cash relief, at least during the pandemic, seems an inevitable thing that we have to do, the reality is there is nothing inevitable about it. We've entered a new Great Depression. We can't allow tens of millions to fall by the wayside, especially with what's happening around police brutality and riots. There's this saying that it's only in times of crisis where ideas that seem politically impossible, can become inevitable. But only if they've been brought to the fore in that moment in time, and that to me was why the work on the campaign in particular, and building this movement was so critical.      If you look at it now, from members of the Trump administration to Republican congresspeople, from the far left to the far right, there is a sense that direct cash relief has to be part of the solution. But Congress has been on recess and when they returned to session, the two bills passed by the House only included a tiny fraction of the multi-trillion dollar bailout as in a single cash payment to people. Some people have to wait months for the processing to go through the pipes of the federal government and to get a paper check mailed to them, if it even reaches them. This crisis has only underpinned and accelerated the urgency and need of universal basic income, but also the need for the internet of money, for a decentralized, blockchain-enabled, Bitcoin/crypto solution.      Look at the history of governments and societies amid depressions and the historic devaluation of currencies. In some cases, authoritarian regimes place restrictions on capital flows and enable repression. There’s acute urgency to ensure that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have mass adoption and have a regulatory framework that enables their innovation in New York and in the United States. If you look at where the halving block was mined, it was mined in China. We need to have the computing resources and the federal investment to ensure that we can compete at the scale and scope in this kind of fundamental arms race.    I view cryptocurrency as part of the vanguard of this era's civil rights and civil liberties.    What sort of regulations or guidelines would you try to reform in a meaningful way when it comes to having a more tolerant framework for cryptocurrencies?      One example is Wyoming, which has the nation's most supportive crypto framework. The partnerships that led to that is exactly the kind we need at the federal level. Because this hodgepodge of regulations right now is the Wild West and it’s unsustainable. What it results in is innovation and investment happening offshore and unregulated. I think bringing Caitlin Long, Jack Dorsey and those who've been in the trenches to the table is needed at a federal level. Look at the BitLicense example here in New York. We essentially ensured that crypto innovation would flee from the world's financial capital, which is so backwards. And we're talking about a city and district where one in six people before COVID-19 lived in poverty and couldn't meet their basic needs, even though median income is over $90,000, and the most common profession is working in financial services.      Bitcoin is part and parcel of civil rights fights to bank the unbanked and to offer a real decentralized alternative to the fact that even before COVID-19 nearly half of all Americans couldn't afford an unexpected $500 bill. The federal government has yet to even define a taxonomy of how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies should be regulated. And that incoherence certainly does not help with innovation and investment in an extremely important and increasingly necessary domain.      See also: Yang 2020 and the Search for the Next Crypto Candidate      How viable is blockchain and the systems that it enables such as cryptocurrencies as a pillar of a candidate’s platform more generally?      It's not only viable, it's going to become increasingly essential. Frankly, I'm a fairly new entrant into the crypto space. In the context of running in the 10th district, it can be an asset. If you look at the numbers in the 10th district there are tens of thousands of people here who are either directly involved or interested in cryptocurrency. And certainly there are the political buzzwords and one liners that can be used to denigrate it, but that's why I think speaking about cryptocurrency and bitcoin through the lens of what the Upper West Side community talks about, which is civil rights, is important. I view cryptocurrency as part of the vanguard of this era's civil rights and civil liberties. I think not only is it something that is politically viable but increasingly so as more and more people get exposed to the power and importance of cryptocurrency they'll see it's a necessary part of any political platform.      Could you explain that framing of cryptocurrencies within a civil rights context further?      Absolutely. So one example is the 10th district has the largest LGBTQ population in the country. I was learning about the LGBT token cryptocurrency as an example of decentralized identity verification, particularly in countries where homosexuality and gender variance is criminalized. What their LGBT wallet offers is an alternative to sidestep the repressive criminalization in the still 70 UN member states that criminalize being gay. And those punishments can range from capital punishment to fines, to jail time and life imprisonment.      And fundamental access to capital is the civil rights fight of this era. Before Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, he was fighting for a guaranteed minimum income, not for some, but for all. And what the LGBT Foundation, for example has done is put HIV self-tests on the blockchain. One of the main healthcare issues is people not even knowing their status, with 2 million people each year becoming infected. Blockchain-integrated HIV testing can enable traceability, transparency, and scalability. This is just one example of how communities that have been marginalized and disenfranchised, even right here in New York City, can move forward. That is part of how we bridge the crypto community with the sort of establishment voter who may have a particular preconceived notion of what cryptocurrencies mean.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/04/ex-yang-aide-is-running-for-congress-with-bitcoin-and-ubi-on-his-mind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3f85d4c226e9c79823a9db7a230ac6a3c6ab60b-1200x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383902,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zAJb,1591264835,The Neil Ferguson Affair Shows the Limits of Science During COVID-19,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on public blockchains. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      One dramatic subplot in the COVID-19 saga was the sad tale of Neil Ferguson.      The British epidemiologist (no relation to the historian, who is lovely) rose to prominence in March with his landmark model for Imperial College London, which predicted 250,000 deaths in Britain and influenced lockdown policy in the U.K. and abroad.      Very quickly, he became a figurehead for the pro-lockdown scientific establishment. His star rose further once it emerged that he was suffering from the virus himself. The lockdown-acquiescent public saw him as a sort of Bruce Banner analogue, an ailing scientist suffering for his truth.      But it wasn’t long until our demure, bespectacled hero fell into disarray.      First, he revealed that his fêted model was a mess of undocumented spaghetti code, raising eyebrows among some in the scientific community seeking to replicate and audit his results. Then, it gradually became clear that his prognostications had been overly pessimistic, even for the much-afflicted U.K. To make matters worse, nations like Sweden, which didn’t impose a lockdown, failed to suffer the disastrous consequences that he had foreseen. The public began to sour on his model and its harsh lockdown stipulations. The criticisms began to stack up. And then, worst of all, he committed an unforgivable transgression by violating lockdown for a rendezvous with a married woman.      This turned him into a perfect scapegoat. An unaccountable member of the policy-making elite, handing down stipulations from on high, audacious enough to violate his own lockdown policy – for a tryst no less? You could hardly devise a better story to satisfy the public’s lockdown-induced lust for catharsis.      On the face of it, his sacrifice has been somewhat devalued, as tens of thousands march through London in close quarters with barely a mask in sight. But Ferguson’s sacking was never about protecting the public. It was about extracting a pound of flesh from the policy elite, as a revenge of sorts for locking down the public. We lost our jobs, how about yours? That’s skin in the game.      Now in the postscript of his career, the National Review asks, “Why did anyone ever listen to this guy?” This is a more interesting question than it might appear. Indeed, if you look at it, his track record is decidedly mixed. According to the Telegraph, he warned in 2001 that as many as 150,000 people could die from ""mad cow"" disease, a claim which led to the culling of 6 million livestock. In the end, only 200 Brits died. His “reasonable worst-case scenario” for the 2009 Swine Flu entailed 65,000 deaths in the U.K. The fatality count was 457. In 2005, he predicted that the death toll from Bird Flu would be on the order of 200 million globally. The ultimate death toll: 282.      Now, all these predictions were clearly wide of the mark by several orders of magnitude. In this context, his rise to the upper echelons of the British public health policy establishment beggars belief. How to explain this apparent puzzle? I’d posit that there’s an alternative explanation. Maybe the professor’s overly pessimistic predictions were actually the point.      Imagine for a moment that the science really is as imprecise as it seems. Now let’s entertain the thought that the role of epidemiologists may not be actually to create accurate forecasts of diseases as they advance through society. That seems to be largely unknowable anyway. Instead, they act as a kind of societal immune response, reminding policymakers that we have to act now, even if the numbers themselves are fuzzy. You could even suppose that societies informed by overly pessimistic public health professionals tend to do better, in the long run, because disproportionate paranoia about pathogens better suits their fat-tailed nature.      With that in mind, a different historical reading emerges. Society’s anointed doomsayer, tasked with raising the alarm about pandemics, cries wolf for decades. He stays out of the spotlight because the costs of complying with his prescriptions are relatively low and not borne by the public. And far from being punished for his predictions, he’s rewarded. After all, he’s shouldering the individual burden of taking on risk, and acting as a kind of policy white blood cell.      And then one day, the big one comes along, the 100-year pandemic that he has been waiting for. His prediction, as usual, is pessimistic: We have to act now or many will die. This is the apotheosis of his career; his chance to help society fend off a genuine public health disaster. But this time, things are different. The immense cost that his model demands of society causes a reprisal. His unreadable code becomes a public concern. Suddenly, his comfortable, pre-epidemic quiet life is broadcast in the papers. He is destroyed professionally and personally. The Great Big Pandemic that was meant to be his vindication ends up being his undoing.      This raises some uncomfortable questions. Could it have been any different? Could we realistically have expected the imprecise guesswork involved in epidemiology to accurately model out the trajectory of the virus in an informationally impoverished environment? Or do we instead select for epidemiologists who are pessimistic, because that’s their societally ordained role?      Why were his overly pessimistic prior forecasts forgiven when he paid the ultimate price for this one? Are the reprisals directed towards Professor Ferguson a proportional reaction to a poor projection, or are they instead rooted in more atavistic demands for penance from a public fed up with containment?      In the final analysis, the depth of the outrage reveals just how scandalized the public can become when trusted institutions are revealed to be less reliable than expected. Combine the shrugging off of his previous poor projections with the fact that epidemiologists were generally unable to forecast the disease's trajectory with any reliability, and it can be posited that epidemiology, as practiced today, might be more of a pseudoscientific institution that seems to have more in common with augury than biology.      In this context, Ferguson’s legacy can perhaps be rehabilitated somewhat. Instead of this being a case of an unaccountable scientist run amok, what happened may instead have been societal rebuke to a doctrine of excessive precision – with Professor Ferguson’s career as the collateral damage.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/04/the-neil-ferguson-affair-shows-the-limits-of-science-during-covid-19,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74b284f4de2015375343b5253dad8112ea3048f8-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zASP,1591261693,'Careless' Users Are Ruining Ethereum's Privacy: Paper,"Ethereum is losing its privacy, warns a new paper, as ""careless"" users make linking their addresses to real-world identities easy.      With the disquieting title, ""Blockchain is Watching You,"" the paper – a joint-publication from researchers at the Institute for Computer Science and Control in Hungary, Eötvös Loránd University, Széchenyi István University and HashCloak – argues governments and private-entities are quickly learning how to strip away anonymity from Ethereum. And that's in part because users are making it easy for them.      “Careless usage easily reveals links between deposits and withdraws and also impact the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,” the authors write.      The researchers argue that Ethereum's account-based model makes it more susceptible to surveillance than some other protocols, such as Bitcoin.      ""The lack of financial privacy is detrimental to most cryptocurrency use cases,"" they continue. ""We do believe if users were using the technology in a sound way or a privacy-focused wallet software would have helped them and abstracted away potential privacy leaks.""      This concern isn't new: news organization Decrypt identified a number of Ethereum users by connecting addresses to personal information, citing user actions as being partly to blame.      Unlike Bitcoin, which relies on an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, the Ethereum protocol keeps track of a user's ether. Rather than effectively creating a new address for each payment (as with Bitcoin), Ethereum records what a user has sent out, say, 1 ETH, but still has 10 ETH, remaining.      A good analogy is Bitcoin is like physical cash in a leather-wallet, with a balance being the amount of unspent cash. Meanwhile, Ethereum is more like a bank account, where a bank, or in this case protocol, knows how much money the account holder has and updates it accordingly.      See also: Ripple Engineers Publish Design for Private Transactions on XRP Ledger      While this difference has often been glossed over, the paper's authors argue that a dearth of understanding of the ramifications of Ethereum's account-based model has left many users, unknowingly, wide-open to the possibility of full-scale surveillance.      Third parties know when an account is most active, allowing them to determine the time-of-day and infer a user's timezone. Another one is gas-prices. Most users rarely change their gas-price settings, instead of leaving it on the default settings. What this means is that accounts with adjusted gas prices become very easily identifiable and can be tracked across the protocol.      The report also highlights that Ethereum's account-based model makes it possible for hackers to perform Danaan-style attacks – where they send a user a very specific amount of ether and use that as a ""fingerprint,"" again to track them around the protocol.      Of course, the researchers argue, it is easy to stop the surveillance. All Ethereum users need to do is use their accounts a couple of times and make sure they don't put any identifiable information, such as their addresses, on any public forum.      But, if anything, Ethereum users seem to be doing the exact opposite.      Rather than discarding accounts, many users are in fact customizing them, using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to add human-readable names, which makes it even easier to identify a user on the blockchain.      Not only that, but many users publicize their ENS names on their social media profiles, in particular Twitter – which gives third-party surveillance everything they need on a platter. Researchers said they were able to connect 890 Ethereum accounts to real people, just by searching for them on Twitter.      ""We observed that the publicly revealed ENS names already expose sensitive activities such as gambling and adult services,"" the report reads. ""Therefore, users should avoid sensitive activities on addresses easily linkable to their public identities, such as ENS name or their Twitter handle.""      There are also freely available resources online that can help tack identities to Ethereum addresses. The Humanity DAO, for example, acts like an address book, giving third parties access to an immutable registry of real names and Ethereum addresses.      Bad luck if you've already registered.      In the end, researchers were able to use the Ethereum block explorer, to link more than 1.1 million transactions to over 4,200 addresses, where they knew the real people. ""[C]areless usage easily reveals links between deposits and withdraws and also impacts the anonymity of other users, since if a deposit can be linked to a withdraw, it will no longer belong to the anonymity set,"" they said.      See also: The Problem With Money Is ‘Too Much Privacy,’ Says Ex-US Treasury Secretary Summers      But are Ethereum users entirely to blame? Considering the speed of innovation in blockchain technology, Hudson Jameson, one of Ethereum's main developer liaisons, says ""it's not fair to put all of the onus on Ethereum users to know best practices to preserve privacy.""      He reckons more can be done by developers and project teams to create applications that instill best privacy practices in by default. That could already be well underway, he said, with solutions such as Tornado Cash – a private ether mixer – already providing users with a means to break the traceability link and restore financial privacy.      But Jameson argues, education is also very important. More should be done to ensure users understand the rudiments of blockchain privacy, possibly even going so far as to tell them they need to treat their Ethereum account information like they would their bank accounts.      He isn't the only one. Ethereum lead Peter Szilagyi highlighted there should be more done to ensure users remain aware of the vulnerabilities inherent in an account-based model. ""We can't expect people to be aware of every single sensitivity in all the layers,"" he tweeted. ""Anything we can fix, we must fix.""      See also: How Decentralized Tech Can End the Privacy Crisis in 2020      Ethereum isn't the only account-based model – TRON and EOS use the same system too.

The report points out there isn't much time as the vultures may already be circling: ""state-sponsored companies and other entities like Chainalysis are already ""performing large-scale deanonymization tasks on cryptocurrency users.""

42404671,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvXc,1591257644,Ethereum Has Become Bitcoin's Top Off-Chain Destination,"The most popular way to use bitcoin off-chain is on Ethereum, recent data indicates.      Since 2016, software engineers have worked to extend the oldest and largest cryptocurrency's use cases through a variety of companion protocols, like the Lightning Network for payments or the Liquid Network for trading. But to date, the most popular off-chain protocols that use bitcoin (the currency, with a small ""b"") run on the largest rival to Bitcoin (the network, uppercase).      In fact, Ethereum projects including WBTC and imBTC hold 70% more bitcoins than Lightning or Liquid.      This is “ironic” to Camila Russo, author of ""The Infinite Machine"", a forthcoming book about Ethereum, but she’s not surprised.      Ethereum was designed to be “more flexible,” Russo explained, which allows these tokenized protocols to “thrive.” Bitcoin, on the other hand, was built “to do one thing well, which is to transfer value trustlessly and in a censorless way.”      “Tokenized bitcoins,"" as these projects are called, allow users to denominate in bitcoin when transacting in the Ethereum network’s emerging ecosystem of decentralized financial products. Instead of using ether (Ethereum's native currency) to make loans or earn interest, for example, transactions are, in effect, made with bitcoin.      The supply of tokenized bitcoin has grown 330% year to date.      See also: Ether Leads Bitcoin on Price as Investors Prepare for Staking Arrival      It’s important to note that the total amount of BTC held off the Bitcoin blockchain by both Ethereum- and Bitcoin-based protocols is tiny – only 8,285 BTC (worth $79 million as of Wednesday) – relative to the 18.4 million BTC issued since 2009.      Recent growth in tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum is “only the beginning,” said Jack Purdy, a decentralized finance analyst at Messari.      “Ethereum has an incredibly diverse set of financial applications built on it,” Purdy explained. “We're going to start seeing a multitude of other use cases as the market for bitcoin on Ethereum continues to grow.”    Not a competition    Despite the disparate growth levels between protocols using bitcoins off the Bitcoin blockchain, some tokenized bitcoin projects see themselves as complementary to – instead of in competition with – Bitcoin’s Lightning and Liquid networks.      “Wrapped Bitcoin represents a digital asset – bitcoin – on the Ethereum chain, and is really complementary to Lightning,” said Kiarash Mosayeri, product manager at crypto custodian BitGo, which helped spearhead WBTC at launch in January 2019.      Growth on Ethereum- or- Bitcoin-based off-chain protocols will “drive adoption and increase the network effect for Bitcoin, attracting more applications and developers in the space,” Mosayeri said.      Built on Bitcoin, Lightning and Liquid also aim to extend the leading cryptocurrency’s utility, similar to the goals of tokenized bitcoin projects. But these protocols have a narrower focus of improving the speed and privacy of small and large off-chain bitcoin transactions, respectively.      “Both approaches offer different capabilities and security tradeoffs,” said Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis, which launched tBTC in May. “I'm a huge fan of the Lightning Network, and I believe it will become more and more relevant in commerce and in new applications like gaming.”      See also: RenBTC Quietly Goes Live in Latest Bid to Bring Bitcoin to Ethereum      Growing interest in using bitcoin on other blockchains shows that “there is interest in building more advanced features that might not be directly realizable on the Bitcoin blockchain itself,” said Christian Decker, engineer and researcher at Blockstream, the technology company that launched the Liquid Network and the c-lightning implementation of Lightning.      Both types of off-chain protocols are important, explains Olivia Lovenmark, previously at BitGo and Thesis.      “Tokenized protocols like tBTC and wBTC can be more personally exciting because they expand a bitcoin holder’s financial options, whereas tokenless protocols, like Lightning, improve network infrastructure, which is broadly a community benefit,” said Lovenmark.    Is this good for Bitcoin?    Ultimately, whether on Ethereum or Bitcoin, recent growth suggests users want to transact in bitcoin.      According to Decker, interest in using bitcoin on other blockchains is “a strong signal that the interest in Bitcoin itself is increasing, and that other tokens are losing ground when it comes to bitcoins.”      “I'm not really surprised that users on Ethereum are looking to get exposure to bitcoin, but don't want to switch over to the Bitcoin network,” Decker added. “That'd also explain why these wrapped bitcoins exist on Ethereum and not on Bitcoin, since the base functionality of Bitcoin already covers what the users are looking for.”      Regardless of the motivations behind tokenized bitcoin projects, these Ethereum-based protocols could benefit bitcoin through broader adoption, Lovenmark said.      “Growth of off-chain Bitcoin protocols means greater optionality for holders,” she said. “This increases use cases for bitcoin and, thus, adoption.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/04/ethereum-has-become-bitcoins-top-off-chain-destination,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ad7168ea2e32a55fd0e100eb2e3bfebdf6ef102-925x622.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421872,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwlkz,1591253229,What is Hyperledger Fabric?,"Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, permissioned distributed ledger developed by the Linux Foundation-hosted Hyperledger consortium. It is intended to provide businesses with a customizable technological framework for a variety of use cases.  The Hyperledger Foundation was launched in 2016 with 30 members including IBM, Accenture, BNY Mellon, Intel and Digital Asset Holdings among others. Hyperledger Fabric was one of the consortium’s first projects, and incorporated aspects of code already developed by Digital Asset, IBM and Blockstream.  Hyperledger Fabric does not have a native asset, a feature which its creators claim lowers operational costs and the risk of attacks on the network. Likewise, unlike public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, only ‘known’ parties can run nodes, participate in governance and carry out actions on the ledger.  Read more: What Is an Enterprise Blockchain?  How does Hyperledger Fabric work?  Hyperledger Fabric’s creators characterize its design as “modular,” meaning that it can be flexibly arranged to meet the varied needs of businesses.  Its central components include:  an “ordering service,” which validates transactions  a “membership services provider,” which assigns “cryptographic identities” to network participants  a “peer-to-peer gossip service,” which informs network participants of the “blocks’ output.”  Additionally, Hyperledger Fabric incorporates “chaincode,” a type of smart contract that handles transactions differently than those utilized on other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum. More specifically, chaincode changes the process through which transactions are validated.  With traditional smart contracts, transactions must be validated, ordered and broadcasted to nodes prior to being executed. With chaincode, transactions are executed and checked for “correctness” by a small number of network participants in accordance with an “endorsement policy” designated for the particular transaction type.  They are subsequently ordered, and finally validated in accordance with the “endorsement policy” and recorded on the ledger. Chaincode is operated in isolation from the rest of the ledger as a “trusted distributed application.”  Further reading on blockchain technology  What Is Cryptography?  Cryptography allows digitals assets to be transacted and verified without the need for a trusted third party.  What Is Blockchain Technology?  Blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted party to facilitate digital relationships and is the backbone of cryptocurrencies.  What Is an ICO?  At their peak in 2017, ICOs had overtaken venture capital as the main fundraising method for blockchain startups.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | WALLET,John Metais,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-hyperledger-fabric,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d1e365a773a6a482b3e7750d587ca5040f114e4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
