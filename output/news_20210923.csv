The asset had seen a number of rallies that pushed it over two-month highs, successfully breaking above the $52K resistance range on a number of occasions. Throwing the entire market into a stretched-out period of positive sentiment. September has now come with its own unique set of problems for the digital asset.

42396882,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT6Ogo,1632432607,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Even as Indicator Shows Extreme Bearish Sentiment,"Bitcoin is in recovery mode as some indicators suggest the sell-off is approaching oversold levels. For example, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from oversold territory. But the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is approaching extreme levels last seen in May, which is a bearish sign.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at about $44,800. It is up 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in ETH and an 11% rise in Avalanche’s AVAX token over the same period.  Altcoins are outperforming bitcoin on the way up after they took a relatively bigger hit during the sell-off earlier this week, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma wrote.  Some traders have been buying the dip, especially long-term BTC holders, according to blockchain data. Still, some analysts remain skeptical of the recent rebound and expect BTC resistance at $47,000 to stall the upside.  Other traders remain active, seeking opportunities for investments that will outperform BTC by using options and futures strategies. “Over time, a lot of folks that deployed in crypto went for vanilla (passive) strategies, but saw that they could get more alpha and mitigate risk with active strategies,” crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $44,786, +3.5%  Ether (ETH), $3,144, +4.3%  S&P 500: +1.2%  Gold: $1,748, -1.1%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.427%  Extreme market fear  Meanwhile, bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index is sending bearish signals. Some analysts view that as a contrarian signal and expect bullish sentiment to return into the fourth quarter.  “Bitcoin lost its momentum before the greed level was hit, when another market crash happened, and the Fear and Greed Index fell right back into the fearful levels,” Arcane Research wrote in a report on Tuesday, highlighting the recent whipsaws in market sentiment.  Historically, extreme levels in the Fear & Greed Index preceded turning points in BTC’s price, like when it hit an all-time high of about $63,000 in April and sunk to a recent low at around $30,000 support in July.  Spot BTC volume remains muted as BTC consolidates below the $50,000 price level, suggesting bearish sentiment could take some time to wane.  Bitcoin holder behavior  Small bitcoin holders, or those who own fewer than 10 BTC, have accelerated their accumulation of BTC after large sell-offs, according to blockchain data compiled by Glassnode.  The chart below shows the distribution of small bitcoin holders at about 13% of total supply. These holders have increased their stake in BTC since the crypto sell-off in May, suggesting that investors remain active above $30,000, where the price has stabilized over the past few months.  Glassnode data also shows long-term holders continue to accumulate bitcoin. Therefore, “this leg down was likely caused by speculators taking a risk-off stance in anticipation of macro and regulatory headline risk factors,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a blog post.  Altcoin roundup  Altcoins rebound after sell-off earlier this week: Prominent tokens such as Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and Terra’s LUNA were up between 6% and 25%, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche open-source platform, added 24% to hit a record of $79.58, according to data from Messari.  Grape Network raises $1.2 million despite causing Solana outage: The project’s token sale caused a nearly daylong Solana outage last week, but Grape Network still pulled off a $1.2 million funding round that was led by Multicoin Capital. The venture funding comes on the heels of last week’s $600,000 public sale that was so overheated with bot-buyers that it knocked host blockchain Solana offline, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. “We didn’t break it out of intention,” Grape Network founder and core contributor Dean Pappas told CoinDesk in an interview. “But we were part of the reason it got broken.”  Miami Mayor Suarez says MiamiCoin going mainstream ‘faster than bitcoin’: In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” Suarez, who is working to attract crypto businesses to Miami, claimed MIA has “been mainstreaming significantly faster than bitcoin,” even though holders can’t yet buy anything with the token. People can “mine” MIA by sending STX, the native token of Stacks, to a smart contract, which forwards 30% of those contributions to a wallet reserved for the city, CoinDesk’s Helene Braun reported. Last month, the city voted to accept those funds, which are now worth $7 million. Suarez said Thursday the project is generating over $2,000 every 10 minutes for the municipality.

Reports have emerged this week that interest-yielding platform Nexo is pursuing an acquisition of an SEC licensed broker dealer with the intent to offer a &apos;modified version&apos; of the company&apos;s products. How this would impact their current offering is unclear. The move comes at a time of seemingly increased rocky roads for DeFi platforms. Interest-Generating Products &amp; Disruptive DeFi Along with the company&apos;s pursuit of a licensed broker dealer, Nexo is also in talks with nationally chartered banks.

Additionally, reports state that the platform is looking at applying for an exemption to offer securities to non-accredited investors.

42396872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT6OZv,1632427494,"Grape Network, the Startup That Broke Solana, Raises $1.8M","Grape Network, the project whose token sale broke Solana last week, has raised $1.8 million in total from venture capital (VC) firms and that now-infamous $GRAPE offering.  The community toolkit developer closed a $1.2 million round led by Multicoin Capital on Thursday. The venture funding comes on the heels of last week’s $600,000 public sale that was so overheated with bot-buyers that it knocked host blockchain Solana offline for nearly a full day.  “We didn’t break it out of intention,” Grape Network founder and core contributor Dean Pappas told CoinDesk in an interview. “But we were part of the reason it got broken.”  His startup has been building tools to help non-fungible token (NFT) holders prove their JPEG bona fides since a Solana hackathon in May. Now, top Solana projects like Degenerate Ape Academy and Saber use Grape, among others, perhaps explaining the excitement around its token sale.  Grapes of wrath  That a rather niche project like Grape could break the blockchain with the highest-claimed transaction capacity of any major project raised serious questions for Solana’s tech stack. Project leads plan to issue a full post-mortem in the coming weeks, but early assessments from the Solana Foundation point to the $GRAPE IDO, or initial decentralized exchange (DEX) offering, as the likely culprit.  Pappas told CoinDesk he was rather unfazed by the debacle. For starters, he knew the public sale would be hot. Prospective $GRAPE buyers had signaled $8.7 million in interest for a sale capped at $600,000. And nabbing IDOs on Solana’s Raydium platform have been lucrative plays lately, Pappas said.  “The last IDO before $GRAPE went up who knows how much,” he said. “Everybody knew that this was going to be doing very well, so that’s why these bots were set up to do 400,000 transactions per second, attacking the Serum market.”  Their automated onslaught was too much for Solana; it went dark for 17 hours, nixing the Grape team’s plans to put $GRAPE, whose holders get perks in the project’s Discord server, to use. Solana was righted by morning, Pappas said.  Build mode  Besides Multicoin, crypto venture firms SkyVision, Definitive, LongHash, Double Peak Group and Solana Capital also participated in the $1.2 million private token sale whose proceeds will be used to add staff.  “That’s all gonna be for team expansion,” Pappas said of the cash, highlighting a particular need for engineers.  He said Grape has at least three “future tools” planned that will help crypto-based communities – from decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to NFT clubs – connect their members’ JPEG personas with internet messaging hubs, such as Discord.  “The way our system works is it validates that this person who’s talking to you on this Discord has that NFT,” Pappas said of Grape Access, the flagship product that’s already live.  Degen community  Building a metaverse-meatspace verification bridge is nothing new to crypto. A handful of projects like Collab Land are at work on Ethereum. But Pappas said Grape is the biggest yet on Solana, which he claimed is a preferable blockchain for DAOs because he said it has lower fees.  Grape is two months away from launching a non-custodial tipping feature that will let community members pay each other without leaving the DAO. Little features like this are essential in building out crypto-infused online communities, Pappas said.  For now, Grape’s main utility is in ensuring Discord degens own the apes they claim to. Pappas said the five-year plan is far more “grandiose” – turning Grape into a community-builder’s toolkit that can support the backbone of any project, “all the way up to a government.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/grape-network-the-startup-that-broke-solana-raises-18m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9615afd345f419b3a2356ebdd4ede09ab24cb6fc-5472x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of 05:44 UTC Thursday, visitors to the site were greeted with “This site can’t be reached.” An entity or person who uses the pseudonym Cobra, who has been the site’s operator but whose current affiliation isn’t clear, said the site might be down while they were looking into the hack.  Earlier Thursday, a pop-up message blocked the homepage screen, inviting visitors to send money to a bitcoin wallet. The funds will be doubled and sent back, the message said. The message claims it is because the Bitcoin Foundation is “giving back to the community.”  The message said only the first 10,000 users could take advantage of the offer. The message included a QR code for the wallet as well as its address. All other site functionality at the time was limited as users couldn’t get around the message.  These messages are associated with giveaway scams; these schemes give false promises of doubling one’s funds after sending an initial amount to a wallet address via QR code. Victims, in fact, receive nothing in return and lose the crypto they sent.  CoinDesk has confirmed the messaging.  Bitcoin.org is an open-source project that aims to support Bitcoin development.  While it isn’t affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation, it is often the first result on search engines when looking for “bitcoin.”  The giveaway scam’s address has received over $17,700 in small transactions as of the time of writing, according to bitcoin explorer blockchain.com.  In June, U.K. courts ordered the site to stop hosting the Bitcoin whitepaper over copyright infringement.  Just days later, the site was hit with a massive denial of service attack.

42376297,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Xd,1632423543,Is the Dollar Doomed?,"The dollar’s predominance in the global financial system has given the United States enormous financial and geopolitical power that hurts its rivals and rankles even its allies. The uncomfortable reality that other countries face is that the preeminence of the dollar makes it difficult for them to avoid the dollar-based financial system, tying them to the currency and exposing them to U.S. sanctions.  Eswar Prasad is the Tolani Senior Professor of International Trade Policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  In his 2018 State of the Union speech, then-European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker noted:  It is absurd that Europe pays for 80% of its energy import bill – worth 300 billion euro a year – in U.S. dollar [sic] when only roughly 2% of our energy imports come from the United States. It is absurd that European companies buy European planes in dollars instead of euro. This is why, before the end of the year, the Commission will present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro. The euro must become the face and the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe. For this, we must first put our own house in order by strengthening our Economic and Monetary Union, as we have already started to do. Without this, we will lack the means to strengthen the international of role of the euro.  This amounted more to a plea than a statement of – the euro’s role in international finance has continued to decline while Europe continues to be racked by political dissension and centrifugal forces that threaten to pull the continent apart rather than bring it together.  Nevertheless, U.S. government officials are certainly aware that dollar dominance is not preordained, with particular risks of blowback from the rest of the world in response to overreaching when applying U.S. sanctions. Jack Lew, who was Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, provided a clear articulation of these concerns:  Sanctions should not be used lightly. They can strain diplomatic relationships, introduce instability into the global economy, and impose real costs on companies here and abroad. . . . The risk that sanctions overreach will ultimately drive business activity from the U.S. financial system could become more acute if alternatives to the United States as a center of financial activity, and to the U.S. dollar as the world’s preeminent reserve currency, assume a larger role in the global financial system. . . . The more we condition use of the dollar and our financial system on adherence to U.S. foreign policy, the more the risk of migration to other currencies and other financial systems in the medium-term grows. Such outcomes would not be in the best interests of the United States for a host of reasons, and we should be careful to avoid them.  This worldview has not generally been reflected in U.S. policy on the ground, which has more closely resembled an approach that, in American parlance, can be characterized as “my way or the highway.” Secretary Lew noted the particularly insidious effects of secondary sanctions – threats to cut off foreign individuals or companies from the U.S. financial system if they engaged in any activities with sanctioned entities, even if such activities did not touch the United States directly. He noted that this could cause resentment even among close U.S. allies, who view these as extraterritorial attempts to force them to comply with U.S. foreign policy. Indeed, there are reasons aplenty for resentment of the dollar’s preeminence.  Competition could trim the dollar’s dominance  The demand for Bitcoin as a store of value has stoked discussion about whether such cryptocurrencies could challenge the role of traditional reserve currencies, in particular the dollar. It is more likely that as the underlying technologies mature and as better validation and consensus mechanisms are developed cryptocurrencies will start playing a bigger role as mediums of exchange. Even that proposition is a tenuous one given the high levels of price volatility that such currencies are prone to. Nevertheless, this shift could occur over time as the payment functions of cryptocurrencies take precedence over speculative interest in them, especially if private stablecoins gain more traction.  The changing landscape of cross-border payments will have repercussions. The decline in costs and easier settlement of cross-border transactions across currency pairs could weaken the dollar’s role as a vehicle currency and as a unit of account in international transactions. It is hardly a stretch to conceive of the denomination and settlement of contracts for oil and other commodities in other currencies, perhaps even emerging market currencies such as the renminbi.  Indeed, China’s purchases of oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia could easily be contracted for and settled in renminbi since those countries could use those revenues to pay for their imports from China. China has also begun issuing renminbi-denominated oil futures as a way of shifting more financial transactions related to oil purchases and sales, including in derivatives markets, away from the dollar. Such developments are important but should be kept in proper perspective. While the very existence of renminbi-denominated oil derivative contracts is a noteworthy development, this is a far cry from such contracts playing a major role or in any significant way displacing dollar-denominated contracts.  Notwithstanding any such changes, the role of the dollar and other traditional reserve currencies as stores of value is unlikely to be affected. Safe financial assets – assets that are perceived as preserving their value even in times of extreme national or global financial stress – have many attributes that cannot be matched by cryptocurrencies.  One important requirement of a store of value currency is depth. That is, there should be a large quantity of financial assets denominated in that currency so that both official investors such as central banks and private investors can easily acquire those assets. There is a vast amount of U.S. Treasury securities, not to mention other dollar-denominated assets, that foreign investors can easily acquire. Another characteristic that is important. for a store of value, and one that is very much related to its depth, is its liquidity. That is, it should be possible to easily trade the asset even in large quantities. An investor should be able to count on there being sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers to facilitate such trading, even in difficult circumstances. This is certainly true of U.S. Treasuries, which are traded in large volumes.  The dollar’s status, in particular, is not under serious threat  Read more: Money Reimagined: Inflation Is Here? Always Has Been  For an aspiring safe haven currency, depth and liquidity in the relevant financial instruments denominated in that currency are indispensable. More importantly, both domestic and foreign investors tend to place their trust in such currencies during financial crises because they are backed by a powerful institutional framework. The elements of such a framework include an institutionalized system of checks and balances, the rule of law, and a trusted central bank. These elements provide a security blanket to investors, assuring them that the value of those investments will be protected and that investors, both domestic and foreign, will be treated fairly and not subject to risk of expropriation.  There are legitimate concerns that Donald Trump and his enablers inflicted irreparable damage on the institutions that underpin trust in the dollar. More troubling, America’s vaunted system of checks and balances did not work well during his administration. Republican members of Congress abrogated their role to act as a check on the powers of the president, tolerating his attacks on the independence of the Fed, the evisceration of the rule of law, and a range of capricious economic policies.  Fortunately for the United States (and the world), the self-correcting mechanisms of democracy ultimately prevailed. Some of the damage to the U.S. institutional framework and investors’ faith in it could prove to be long-lasting. Still, in international finance, everything is relative. The U.S. institutional framework might have taken some body blows, but there is no rival that can match the combination of economic, financial, and institutional strength that anchors the dollar’s dominance.  While reserve currencies might not be challenged as stores of value, digital versions of extant reserve currencies and improved cross-border transaction channels could intensify competition between reserve currencies themselves. In short, the finance-related technological developments that are underway or on the horizon portend some changes in domestic and international financial markets, but a revolution in the international monetary system is not quite in the cards for the foreseeable future.  The dollar’s status, in particular, is not under serious threat. Is that too sanguine a perspective if it is not just cryptocurrency enthusiasts but the world at large clamoring for change?  New safe havens  The fervent desire of government leaders and officials around the world to knock the dollar off its pedestal has converged with the quest for alternative safe assets. These desires have been given new life by the genesis of crypto currencies and their newfangled technologies.  In September 2019, Benoît Cœuré, then a member of the Governing Council of the ECB, gave a speech in which he speculated on whether a global stablecoin such as Libra/Diem “may be a contender for the Iron Throne of the dollar.” He argued that “in specific circumstances, and if allowed to develop, private digital forms of money could challenge the supremacy of the U.S. dollar more easily, and faster, than currencies issued by other sovereigns.”  Cœuré made two key points. First, it was no longer the case that the widespread use of existing reserve currencies would confer on them a persistent advantage over new currencies. Such network effects usually make it hard to dislodge incumbents. Cœuré noted that the costs of switching are much lower in the case of retail consumer payments (as we saw in Chapter 3) than they are for traditional currencies used for wholesale cross-border trade and finance. Second, he argued that the factors driving international currency use are also changing and that new currencies have advantages. He noted that “it is probably easier to connect a new currency to an existing network – the case of Libra – than to build a new network on an existing currency – the case of the euro.”  This line of argument suggests that international currencies could piggyback on other uses, turning on its head the conventional paradigm that a currency used for payments or, for that matter, an electronic payment plat form is then put to other uses over time. Adding a payment function using a digital token or a global stablecoin to an existing messaging platform such as WhatsApp would enable direct transfers of money between users of the platform. The underlying business model, a messaging and communication service, would not be affected by these additional payment-related functions.  Such stablecoin initiatives built on top of service platforms that have extensive international reach could indeed make domestic and cross-border payments, at least between individuals and small businesses, relatively seamless. Thus, competition between international currencies both new and old could become more heated and dynamic in the future, with the advantages of incumbency no longer as powerful as they once were.  Given the extensive frictions that beset international payments, it is certainly a plausible proposition that stablecoins could gain traction as mediums of exchange that supplement, but do not supplant, existing payment currencies. In any event, the dollar is least likely to be hurt by any competition from alternative payment currencies.  A more likely outcome is an erosion in the shares of currencies such as the euro, the British pound sterling, and the Japanese yen, while the dollar remains largely unscathed. After all, stablecoins pegged to the dollar would simply make it easier to gain access to the world’s leading currency. If Diem were to provide equally accessible versions of coins linked to the dollar, the euro and a few other major currencies, it is a fair bet that, at least initially, demand would be strongest for the dollar-backed coins.  Moreover, it is a stretch to suggest that such stablecoins would represent alternative stores of value. Indeed, the allure of stablecoins is precisely that their value is tightly linked to existing reserve currencies in which savers and investors around the world are willing to place their trust. In short, the emergence of stablecoins linked to existing reserve currencies will reduce direct demand for those currencies for international payments but will not in any fundamental way transform the relative balance of power among the major reserve currencies.

In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” Suarez, who is working to attract crypto businesses to Miami, claimed MIA has “been mainstreaming significantly faster than bitcoin,” even though you can’t yet buy anything with the token.  He noted that the coin is trading for pennies, which Suarez suggested may make holders more willing to spend it than bitcoin, which changed hands Thursday afternoon at $44,639.18.  “What’s interesting about bitcoin is that its use case has essentially been a store of value, and the question is, does MiamiCoin remain a store of value ... or does it have a different use case?” Suarez said. “We feel that if MiamiCoin metamorphoses into a currency ... there exists a possibility that it could have wide use and applicability.”  MIA runs on the Stacks protocol, which in turn runs on top of the Bitcoin network. People can “mine” MIA by sending STX, the native token of Stacks, to a smart contract, which forwards 30% of those contributions to a wallet reserved for the city. Last month, the city voted to accept those funds, now worth $7 million. Suarez said Thursday the project is generating over $2,000 every 10 minutes for the municipality.  MIA has jumped more than 10 times in value since its August debut, to around 4 cents, which Suarez said shows how “exciting Miami is in the crypto world.” Regarding concerns of a potential crash of the token, the mayor reiterated that the city “bears no liability whatsoever for people’s investment decisions.”  “There’s absolutely no reason to believe that it wouldn’t be volatile based on the way bitcoin has performed,” he cautioned.  The coin is listed on just one exchange, Okcoin, which is also advertising an “estimated” (but not guaranteed) 430% yield (paid in STX) for customers who deposit MIA on the platform for lending. Okcoin announced last month it was opening a Miami office.  Suarez sounded nonplussed when asked about that 430% offer, which is high even compared to the bank-beating rates of the crypto lending and decentralized finance (DeFi) markets.  “I don’t know exactly how they earn that yield,” Suarez said. “Maybe you can try it out with a dollar and see if you get that kind of a yield, and it works or not.”",POSITIVE,STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | STX,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/miamicoin-going-mainstream-faster-than-bitcoin-mayor-suarez-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b012c2bae20c47a206d59fbe9ca160463e220206-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This occurs because the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency globally, Bitcoin, has been on a bearish streak for more than a week. As Bitcoin plummets in price, token futures enthusiasts migrate to alternatives, such as Ethereum. According to crypto analysts, this change of investments in ETH futures could add value to the token. BTC futures could be affected by new adoptions Since September began, BTC futures have been trading well below the mark. While Bitcoin was trading above $45,000, the futures market did not exceed the $40,000 range. According to crypto researchers, this would be a setback for BTC trading as this reflects how low the demand is among business promoters who often use these contracts to make a profit on crypto. It must be considered that BTC futures trade above their official value. If the token is worth $42,000, the BTC future should exceed that value.

42394441,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdEdr,1632421111,How Bitcoin Is More ESG-Friendly Than You’ve Heard,"The idea of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, in theory, is beautiful. But those standards can quickly run into obstacles when growth is demanded.  Furthermore, ESG efforts are sometimes complicated by greenwashing, where a company presents itself to the public as being more eco-friendly than it actually is. If you examine the largest ESG-mandated exchange-traded funds (ETFs), for example, it may not be long before you see a company listed that violates one of the fund’s ESG criteria. Clients with an ESG mandate may point to various companies that don’t fit their goals, get frustrated and vent to you.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  How can we break that cycle? If you guessed bitcoin, congratulations! In my view, bitcoin is one of the most ESG-friendly options for clients to bring about a better world in the future. I’ll explain by going through each pillar of ESG, addressing common concerns about bitcoin and highlighting how bitcoin aligns with ESG principles.  Environmental  You have likely read or heard in passing how bitcoin’s network uses more energy than small countries and how it’s harmful to the environment. But that narrative is inaccurate.  First, energy consumption is not evil in and of itself, and humans’ increasing energy consumption has helped improve the quality of life over the last 100 years. The goal of energy consumption is not to be wasteful but rather to use sources that are clean or renewable.  According to the Bitcoin Mining Council’s Q2 2021 Global Review, 56% of the energy used to power the Bitcoin network is renewable. Bitcoin mining companies do have a financial incentive to lower their energy costs and be sustainable. In a memo in April, ARK Funds, led by Cathie Wood, and Square Crypto, led by Steve Lee, elaborated on research into how the Bitcoin network will lead to the growth of renewable energy. They made the case that bitcoin will likely do more than any government subsidy or program to grow renewables.  The mission of one U.S.-based company, Great American Mining, is to work within the oil and gas industry, helping producers that flare gas from oil wells to mine bitcoin and lower carbon emissions. That allows various energy companies to add revenue while improving their carbon footprint. Without tapping into that wasted energy, more emissions are unavoidable.  And suppose you look at the total energy used from bitcoin’s network, compared with the total energy consumed worldwide. In that case, it is less than one-tenth of one percent, as Lyn Alden, a global macroeconomic strategist, noted in a recent piece. Alden explained that Christmas lights and dryers are using more energy per year than bitcoin, but I have yet to hear calls for energy to stop being consumed for those uses.  Lastly, a question that should be asked is, how much more environmentally friendly is bitcoin from the traditional system? In a piece in Bitcoin Magazine in May, former engineer and bitcoin mining expert Hass McCook noted that bitcoin mining emits less than 5% of the legacy financial sector’s carbon emissions. In context, energy consumption should not be as great of an issue for bitcoin as is often depicted. The facts don’t follow the mainstream narrative.  Social  On Sept. 7, El Salvador officially rolled out bitcoin as legal tender and provided $30 worth of bitcoin to each of its citizens. Large legacy financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank criticized the move as rash and irresponsible. But bitcoin arguably offers the fairest and most equable form of money in human history. Some 70% of the citizens of El Salvador are unbanked according President Nayib Bukele, and yet most have a phone. Accordingly, they can use a mobile bitcoin wallet, which is now plugged into a worldwide monetary system.  Because the supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, foreign leaders cannot make decisions that affect the savings of Salvadorans. Bitcoin holders rely on a decentralized network and code to secure their wealth. Bitcoin and the layer 2 Lighting Network allow all global citizens, from El Salvador to many countries in Africa, the opportunity to secure long-term wealth protected from inflation, with bitcoin also being a means of payment via Lighting Payments that settles almost instantaneously.  Many people in lower-income rungs can’t save into 401(k)s and investment brokerage accounts. If they keep their earnings into a bitcoin wallet versus a traditional bank account, they’ll see their savings grow instead of dwindling in purchasing power.  If adopted more widely as a global currency, bitcoin has the potential to do more for social justice than any government program or stimulus checks. It would allow people to regain financial freedom, work, save and live within their means and pass down wealth from generation to generation.  Governance  Rules without rulers – what is fairer than that? S&P Global defines the “G” in ESG as “the governance factors of decision-making, from sovereigns’ policymaking to the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in corporations, including the board of directors, managers, shareholders and stakeholders.”  Bitcoin has no decision-makers. Bitcoin is for all, and whether you have 0.00001 BTC or 10,000 BTC, the rules are the same, and you have the same benefits. There is no insider information – Bitcoin is open-source for all to review and see. The power and gravity of that are critical. Bitcoin does not discriminate by faith, sex, creed, gender – or anything. And the network is fiercely defended by those who value freedom, hence the term “freedom money” (which I prefer over “magic internet money”).  Because it removes leaders from the equation, the ability to discriminate against others cannot happen with Bitcoin. If you have a mobile phone and Wi-Fi (or a satellite connection), you can plug into one of the most incredible and fair monetary systems ever created.  Bitcoin in the future  Though ESG has had its critics, you would be hard-pressed to find someone who’s against what ESG tries to stand for – fairness, inclusion and transparency. Bitcoin not only accomplishes everything that the ESG movement wants, but it also takes it one step further, offering an ideal model for companies and individuals. Bitcoin holds the promise of helping usher in sweeping changes over the next decade and beyond – and to help your clients get involved, it’s as easy as holding bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/how-bitcoin-is-more-esg-friendly-than-youve-heard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ab4e941f9819056d99cb59273dbd0c320092d3c-5398x3567.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Thursday, the startup said its “Strike API” – a payments plugin that processes bitcoin transactions over the Lightning Network – will roll out across a series of business partners. The identity of those businesses will be made public “in the coming months,” according to a Medium blog post.  “Soon, any internet network, online marketplace, merchant, business, developer and more will have access to cheaper, faster, global payments of any size with the Strike API,” Mallers wrote in the post.  Mallers said a “select group” of businesses are preparing to integrate Strike API in the weeks ahead. That promise raises the prospect of massive new adoption of the Lightning Network, a layer 2 technology that allows users to make faster and lower-fee Bitcoin transactions.

42396870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT6OWy,1632420142,Altcoins Surge as Crypto Market Regains Steam,"The crypto market is bouncing alongside equities Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve announced monetary policy in the U.S. is about to become a lot tighter.  While bitcoin and ether are trading 1% higher over the past 24 hours, prominent alternative cryptocurrencies like ADA, SOL and LUNA are up between 6% and 25%.  AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche open-source platform, added 24% to hit a record of $79.58, according to data from Messari.  Altcoins are outperforming bitcoin on the way up after they took a relatively bigger hit during the sell-off earlier this week. The price action highlights bitcoin’s long-held status as a crypto market haven, given its higher market cap. The cryptocurrency’s price is a lot more stable than the prices of most altcoins.  “The added volatility of a lesser known coin makes it much more risky, and so they tend to fall a lot harder when things are moving down and rise much sharper on the way up,” said Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics.  S&P 500 e-mini futures also traded in positive territory, adding as much as 0.5%.  The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it will prepare the ground to possibly start phasing out some of the stimulus program support that it has given during the pandemic.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also said that the central bank’s quantitative-easing (QE) program will likely conclude by mid-2022. Low interest rates and QE in the U.S. add to bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge, according to Matthew Lam, a research analyst at Aspen Digital.  “We believe BTC continues to gain institutional appeal as a hedging asset and the end of QE next year is not likely to become a major driver of BTC price,” Lam said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/23/altcoins-surge-as-crypto-market-regains-steam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e50c46a03676af19689136918162aac45e8d311-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT6OO7,1632420114,Binance ‘De-Platforms’ Russian OTC Firm Suex That Was Sanctioned by US,"Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that earlier this year the world’s biggest crypto exchange deactivated accounts associated with Suex, which was designated as a money laundering vehicle by the Office of Assets Control (OFAC) on Tuesday.  The U.S. government blacklisted 25 blockchain addresses for bitcoin, ether and tether that the regulator said Russia-based Suex used for its operations.  “We de-platformed these accounts based on internal safeguards,” Zhao said in a blog post on Wednesday. “Information regarding the addresses in the announcement, as well as other information from our internal investigation was shared with the appropriate authorities and we continue to collaborate with law enforcement to cast sunlight on those threat actors that seek to abuse our platforms, such as Suex.”  Some of the addresses listed by OFAC were last active in 2019 or 2020, but some were used as recently as August. Binance didn’t immediately respond to questions about when it deactivated the accouts.  Earlier, crypto sleuthing firm Chainalysis said it helped OFAC identify the Suex’s crypto wallets, adding that the OTC firm helped launder money coming from major scams, hacker groups and drug traffickers. Elliptic, another blockchain analytics firm, wrote in a blog post the addresses received about $934 million worth of crypto in total.  Particular pattern of use  Analysis of the 25 addresses listed by the OFAC shows all but two are exchange deposit addresses that had apparently been used by Suex to buy and sell crypto on behalf of its clients.  The addresses have a particular pattern of use: Identical amounts of crypto hit the addresses and leave immediately without accumulating or getting split. That most often indicates an address designated by an exchange for users to deposit money. Crypto flows from such wallets to the exchange’s hot wallets. The pattern can be seen, for example, on this BTC address, ETH address and USDT address.  Further research on the addresses indicated that most belong to two exchanges: Binance and Huobi. When contacted, Huobi declined to comment on whether the listed addresses belonged to it.  It’s also possible that Suex used other addresses, which OFAC has yet to identify, Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk by email.  According to Chainalysis, Suex processed almost $13 million of crypto from ransomware operators, including Conti, Maze, Ryuk and others; over $24 million from scams, including Finiko, a major crypto Ponzi scheme that operated in Russia and Ukraine; more than $20 million from darknet markets, especially the Russia-based Hydra; and over $50 million from BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange whose alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik, recently went to jail for money laundering in France.  The Finiko scam heavily relied on Suex’s services, said Scott Pounder, head of investigations at the blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain.  “We noticed that most of the USDC fund flows, $11.5 million out of $14 million, came directly from the Finiko Ponzi scheme, more than $9 million in bitcoin came from Finiko, as well as $2.7 million in ERC20 tether,” Pounder said. “Over $155 million of the overall flow of more than $930 million funds received by Suex OTC could be deemed as high risk,” he added.  Suex founder Egor Petukhovsky declined to comment by press time.  UPDATE (SEPT. 23, 12:13 UTC) Adds Huobi declined to comment in the eighth paragraph.

42396876,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT6Ocs,1632419955,Bitcoin to Remain Resilient to Fed’s Impending Taper: Analysts,"Crypto experts said they don’t see the Federal Reserve’s impending unwinding, or tapering, of its liquidity-boosting stimulus program as a major bearish hangover on the bitcoin market.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank could begin tapering as soon as next quarter, and end the program by mid-2022.  “Tapering is a matter of when. I think that has already been factored in,” said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital..  Since March 2020, the Fed has been buying assets worth $120 billion a month via a monetary-stimulus program known as quantitative easing, or QE. The program, launched to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, triggered unprecedented asset price inflation. Bitcoin, for one, charted a 10-fold rally to $64,801 in the 12 months to April 2021.  The taper talks began doing the rounds in the first quarter of this year and strengthened in mid-May after the U.S. reported inflation at a 13-year high. Bitcoin took a beating in the second half of May, falling from $58,000 to $30,000, perhaps in response to an increased possibility of the Fed taper. The move coincided with Tesla’s decision to suspend bitcoin payments for its electric vehicles amid environmental concerns regarding cryptocurrency mining.  Anthony Vince, global head of trading at GSR, said, “The crypto [world] isn’t paying too much attention to quantitative easing [stimulus], and there is certainly a lot of money floating around the system though looking to invest in crypto projects at the moment.”  Indeed, the Fed won’t just shut the money printer next quarter, and the program will be phased out slowly over six to eight months, assuming there are no new shocks to the economy. And while the central bank has brought forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to 2022, borrowing costs are likely to stay below the pre-pandemic high of 2% for a prolonged period of time.  Bitcoin hasn’t shown signs of weakness since Powell signaled the tapering at Wednesday’s press conference. The cryptocurrency is trading at $44,100 at press time, representing a 1.3% gain on the day, having risen 7% on Wednesday. That was the biggest single-day gain since Aug. 13.  “Since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), markets including equities have remained bullish. We do not see any short-term risk from this flowing into cryptocurrencies,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds.  Too early to call a bottom  Dibb is eyeing bitcoin’s 11% recovery from recent lows to near $40,000 with caution.  “It’s simply too early to say [if bitcoin has bottomed out],” Dibb told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “We have seen some good flows of spot buying over the last 24 hours after some favorable macro headlines; however, some fear this is a ‘dead cat bounce’ after what was a heavy and swift sell-off to support.”  Signum Capital’s Pangilinan said, “Bitcoin needs to be above $45,000 to be safe, its trading range at the moment.”  A dead cat bounce is a temporary recovery in price after a substantial fall caused by speculators squaring off bearish positions. Bitcoin fell from $49,000 to $40,000 in the three days to Sept. 21 as investors sold risk on concerns that the crisis at Chinese property giant Evergrande would spill over to the global economy. The Fed and renewed crypto regulatory fears added to uncertainty in the market.  The Fed is now out of the way, and the Evergrande fears look to be subsiding with media reports stating that China may take over the cash-strapped property developer. However, regulatory risks linger and could play spoilsport.  “Regulatory clarity is the main threat to crypto growth at the moment, I would say increased clarity will allow institutions into the market since they have a very stringent reg-stack to comply with,” GSR’s Vince said.  Earlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commission Chair Gary Gensler renewed his call to regulate the crypto industry and compared stablecoins with poker chips. According to a New York Times article, regulators could designate stablecoins as systemically risky or treat them as securities or like banks.  Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies with values pegged to a reference such as the U.S. dollar, are widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases and as collateral in decentralized finance. Their market capitalization has ballooned from $20 billion to over $100 billion in one year. So a regulatory crackdown on stablecoins poses a short-term risk to bitcoin and the wider crypto market.  “A lot of headlines, including Gensler’s remarks, have certainly affected the short-term sentiment of BTC,” Stack Funds’ Dibb said. “While this will be an ongoing saga, we are also seeing some promising signs of regulatory development, including some fresh optimism that a physical or futures-based [exchange-traded fund] may be getting the green light soon.”  “Perhaps Dubai becomes a crypto center to capitalize on this uncertainty and offer a safe haven,” Vince said, adding that bitcoin would eventually resume the uptrend.  “I see BTC pushing through $50,000, with September and October being traditionally highly volatile months as the market comes back from the summer break,” Vince said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/23/bitcoin-to-remain-resilient-to-feds-impending-taper-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ec0e31ef39662feee8253fd18be6e3fcba41002-1300x817.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Targeted communities include Gitcoin, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Alchemix, BadgerDAO, 1inch, Compound, Curve, Balancer, Maker and 0x, according to a press release.  “While there was no deliberate intent to exclude DAO stakers and LP providers from the initial airdrop, the DAO offers the structure to address such opportunities through governance proposals,” Willy Ogorzaly, FOX Foundation head of decentralization, wrote in the press release, adding:  “This is an example of the process working as intended, with strong participation and solidarity across DAO communities.”  Read more: ShapeShift to Shut Down, Airdrop FOX Tokens to Decentralize Itself Out of Existence  In July, ShapeShift airdropped 340 million FOX tokens to past users of the ShapeShift exchange and to those participating in affiliated DeFi communities.

That will include the ability to link both Bitcoin addresses and Lightning Network addresses.  Twitter also announced today that it will add non-fungible token (NFT) verification features to the platform, a key step in the evolution of the booming trend for unique digital art, particularly as social media avatars. No specific timeline was laid out for the feature, which remains in development.  The “Tips” feature will roll out on Twitter’s iOS app today and will come to Android systems “soon,” company representatives said in a press call.  The feature is part of a broader push to increase the options for Twitter users with large followings to monetize their content. The announcement didn’t address whether or when the functionality will extend to Twitter on the web.  The tipping feature will rely entirely on third-party payments services like Jack Mallers’ Strike app. Twitter is “not in the flow of funds” and won’t take a percentage of tipping proceeds, the company said. Different payments options or tipping services will be available to users in different parts of the world.  The exception, according to Esther Crawford, who works in Twitter’s product department, will be Bitcoin and Lightning options, which will be available to all Twitter users worldwide.  “There’s this great opportunity for us to choose global, barrier-less options,” Crawford said during the call. “And Bitcoin represents one of the best options. We know not everyone around the world transacts with bitcoin yet, but … we think it’s one of the better solutions.”  Dorsey’s continued bitcoin push  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had foreshadowed the move, writing in June that it was “only a matter of time” before Twitter integrated Lightning payments in some way. The Lightning Network is a “second layer” technology that allows users to make faster and lower-fee Bitcoin transactions, which is likely crucial to the viability of sending small-dollar tips in BTC. Dorsey, a longtime supporter of Lightning, invested in Lightning Labs’ $2.5 million seed funding round in 2018.  Read more: Strike’s Jack Mallers on Fixing the Fiat Problem  Twitter’s addition of NFT verification is arguably just as significant as the new tipping feature. Over the past six months, the use of NFTs as avatars on the platform has exploded, with even celebrities like Jay-Z displaying multimillion-dollar CryptoPunks. A system for verifying the ownership and provenance of NFTs will likely add fuel to that practice and, in turn, reinforce the NFT ecosystem more broadly.  Other initiatives  Twitter today also announced plans for more automated content oversight, more options for users to control their experience on the site and a “Spaces Fund” to give an “initial boost” to creators who want to use enhanced audio features and pursue long-term monetization on Twitter.

42394413,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdDZB,1632414473,What Happens to a Social Token When Its Creator Dies?,"What happens to a social token when its creator dies? That may be an odd question to ask about a technological tool that’s only beginning to take off, but thinking it through may help you understand what’s new in the “new digital economy” and what may never change.  Part of an effort to make “ownership” central to digital goods – broadly defined as Web 3.0 and including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – social tokens allow creators and fans to interact through novel financial relationships. At heart, they give holders a stake in the success of some “creator.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Countless musicians (including Grammy winner RAC and BT), artists (like Jen Stark), sports legends and prospects (Washington Wizards point guard Spencer Dinwiddie and UCLA sophomore guard Jaylen Clark) and even investment gurus (like Kerman Kohli) have moved into the market.  Fans buy, acquire or earn tokens, which represent a share in a creator’s career. Tokens should be, but aren’t always, wholly owned by someone and can be transferred or sold at will. They often come packaged with added utility – the ability to use a platform, like accessing a gated Discord channel or the right to meet your hero.  Putting money at the center of a community will no doubt influence how those communities develop. As Kinjal Shah, a senior associate at Blockchain Capital, said, “Crypto networks facilitate stronger relationships between creators and users. These relationships will introduce economic rewards and incentives to strengthen network effects.”  Shah’s statement might be premature, but it does get to how crypto is changing how behavioral economics, platform design and finance interact. “We’re [going] to need new mental and legal frameworks,” Wharton professor Kevin Werbach said about crypto and fintech on Twitter. “And a bigger boat.”  There are already mental models for understanding “the creator economy.” A decade ago, Wired editor Kevin Kelly noted how the internet allowed small-time creators to sustain themselves with only “1,000 true fans.” For instance, crowdsourcing platforms like Bandcamp made it possible for musicians to produce their own albums – without the help of a label.  The same theory holds for social tokens. What’s new here is the financial relationship between creators and fans – and one that can metastasize in interesting ways. The upside is clear: Creators can fund their work, communities may flower and fans have something to cherish and hold.  It’s possible that “empowered” fans may go too far. Giving someone an economic stake in your career may make them feel entitled to make decisions on your behalf. Artists may be less incentivized to experiment or change direction, and super-fans may become your most vocal critics. And it’s not just your art that affects a token’s price, but potentially anything you do or say. Of course, some people, like Kohli, have designed their token ecosystem to precisely give token holders a say over their “investment” decisions.  Read more: Get Ready for Investor Fan Tokens: Polychain Backs Prysm’s Approach to ‘Social Investing’  There’s also the unknown effects of conflating artistic worth with financial success. In a great introduction to social tokens, venture capitalist Rex Woodbury wrote, “In the future, instead of measuring a creator’s clout based on her Instagram following, we’ll point to her market cap.”  So what happens after the token creator dies? Assuming crypto is as “unstoppable” as claimed, the tokens should still exist and be tradeable. It’s possible death spells the end for a community, or, as so often the case in the history of art, a new critical awareness of the artist’s work.  There’s no single answer to this question, in part because tools like social tokens allow for the creation of so many different types of communities. There will be as many tokens as there are ideas and individuals willing to strike out on their own. That much is new, but the question of death is one for lawyers to work out.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/what-happens-to-a-social-token-when-its-creator-dies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cadc1072b8d6975aba72e4c0bfd0c39800aa56e5-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411973,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWZjY,1632412845,Why Civic Technologies Is Building DeFi Identity Tools on Solana,"Identity verification is coming to Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) apps courtesy of Civic Technologies.  Solrise Finance, a decentralized fund management and investing platform that uses the Solana blockchain, has partnered with Civic to create a decentralized exchange (DEX) with permissioned access based on digital identity verification, the companies announced Thursday.  Solrise DEX Pro, as it’s called, is built on Serum, a Solana-based DEX with a traditional order book experience. Serum was built by FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange helmed by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, whose Alameda Research is among the market-making firms on the Solrise DEX at launch.  Adding a flexible digital identity layer to DeFi creates a permissioned environment that’s going to be attractive to institutional players, according to Civic CEO Chris Hart. This stands in stark relief to the permissionless nature of DeFi, where all you need is a wallet address and some assets to participate in a bevy of bank-like functions.  Indeed, a solid commercial use case for digital identity has perhaps been lacking, Hart added – until DeFi came along.  “Looking back two years, there was a lot you could do and you didn’t need identity,” Hart told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  “I think that’s starting to really shift, and it’s not just for DeFi, but for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), for virtual assets in virtual worlds, whether that’s a plot of land or a virtual building or whatever it is.”  It’s a far cry from the days of Civic’s 2019 work on beer vending machines.  Nuts and bolts  Civic Technologies uses technology from nonprofit Identity.com to vet users. Its know-your-customer (KYC) process starts with the usual email address, phone number verification, photo ID scanning, plus a 3D face-map, after which a Civic Pass is issued.  That pass is then synced up with entry rules for a given decentralized application to check if users have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The digital ID is reactive so that it can be frozen or revoked if the entry rules are breached.  In the case of Solrise DEX, this could result in pruning the order book and removing orders dynamically, said Hart. For the time being, Solrise DEX Pro won’t be available to U.S. citizens, he added.  “Civic Pass enforces the rules mandated by the dapp creator, Solrise in this case, under which market participants – trading firms like Alameda Research and others – are willing to participate,” Hart said, adding:  “If the dapp [builders] decide to change their rule set, such as to allow for U.S. participants, Civic Pass will enforce those new rules. We understand there are no immediate plans to allow U.S. participation at this time.”  Why it matters  Grafting some form of KYC onto anonymous pools of DeFi liquidity is a problem being tackled by others in the sector looking to bring in institutional money.  For instance, Aave, a DeFi platform, has announced the launch of Aave Pro, which will create a list of approved users to create regulation-friendly lending pools.  However, Civic is striving to create a toolkit for developers in the DeFi market, or any decentralized app, irrespective of what protocol or blockchain, said Hart, adding:  “The idea is they can just reach on the shelf and grab this kind of ‘identity Lego’ and put it into their project.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/why-civic-is-building-defi-identity-tools-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb70403fd62abddeb78d2473d56cbd7ad3e89cf3-5000x2939.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411962,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWZ7N,1632412292,Biden to Nominate Crypto Critic as Top Bank Regulator: Report,"U.S. President Joe Biden is reportedly moving forward with the nomination of a crypto critic to run a federal bank regulatory agency.  The Biden administration intends to nominate Cornell University Professor Saule Omarova to be the next Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The administration was first rumored to be vetting Omarova last month.  An OCC spokesperson declined to comment.  Omarova has criticized the existing bank structure and cryptocurrencies in recent years, according to the Bloomberg report. She has advocated for having the U.S. central bank, rather than private banks, provide consumer banking services.  In a 2019 paper, “New Tech v. New Deal: Fintech as a Systemic Phenomenon,” Omarova wrote that fintech, including cryptocurrencies, is changing how financial transactions and services in the U.S. operate, but she was critical of the idea that cryptocurrencies or fintech at large may “‘revolutionize’ the provision of financial services.”  “Bitcoin’s amazing journey from an obscure techno-utopian experiment to Goldman Sachs’ market-making books and institutional investors’ portfolios is also fascinating in a deeper sense,” she wrote. “It provides a vivid example of how fintech technology can be, and is used to synthesize tradable financial assets effectively out of thin air.”  If nominated and confirmed, Omarova will be the first full-term Comptroller since Joseph Otting, who headed the federal banking regulator between 2017 and 2020. Former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks took over the agency last year, overseeing a handful of guidance letters and conditional approvals allowing crypto companies to have greater access to banking services and letting banks interact more closely with cryptocurrencies.  Since May, the regulatory agency has been run by Michael Hsu, who called cryptocurrencies innovative but warned the industry has to be more realistic about what it is doing and how.  “Those in traditional finance may laugh at this. But crypto/DeFi is able to pose a threat to the status quo because many people feel ignored, taken for granted, or exploited by banks,” Hsu said in a presentation with the Blockchain Association on Tuesday, referring to decentralized finance.  He advised crypto companies to present both the potential benefits and the drawbacks to different projects in the sector, likening crypto to “fool’s gold” due to the number of scams and fraudulent projects in the space.  “I strongly support the goal of increasing financial inclusion,” he said. “It is difficult to see how the current set of activities is achieving that goal however. How is crypto … making it less expensive to be poor? How is it helping to expand access to these banking services?”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/22/biden-to-nominate-crypto-critic-as-top-bank-regulator-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/868ea212b0db055e77f3e6c70250686fa95d58c2-920x690.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Exchanges and government investigators use blockchain analysis tools to get ahead of suspect transactions and tamp down on illicit crypto flows, Castaño said. He said TRM will “ingest raw blockchain data” on Solana transactions in part by running nodes.  “We’re not doing other forms of large-scale data collection,” he said, emphasizing that TRM focuses instead on “enriching blockchain data.” He said TRM maintains a database of rug pulls and bad actors against which to track assets.

All new users must complete a verification process to access its products and services. Existing users who have not yet done so will have their account restricted to “withdrawal only” whereby services will be limited to withdrawal and order cancellation.  Binance Australia said the measures are intended to bolster its Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) efforts. In a bid to minimize disruption to its users, the exchange said its efforts will be carried out in phases from Wednesday through Oct. 19.  “We would like to contribute in forming a safer trading environment for all users,” Binance Australia CEO Leigh Travers told CoinDesk. “We have other initiatives to come to meet our core values.”  Binance’s global platform this week announced it would be ending its derivatives offerings to Australian crypto traders by year’s end. Binance is a separate entity from Binance Australia, which, in turn, is operated by InvestbyBit. The latest moves can be viewed as an attempt to stymie the fallout from regulatory ire that has recently focused on the Binance brand worldwide, in a bid to bring the exchange in line with other crypto providers.

42394427,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdETb,1632401400,Why NFTs Are So Appealing – And How Anyone Can Start Learning for Free,"NFTs are all the rage these days. At a first glance, they may seem like a fun pandemic distraction, a Twitter trend inspiring collectors to change their profile pictures to colorful little avatars, like the $280,000 Serena Williams CryptoPunk pin Alexis Ohanian wore to the Met Gala.  Wait – a pixelated cartoon valued at $280,000? Maybe NFTs are worth a deeper look.  As more financial advisors are learning, NFTs are starting to catch on, even among non-celebrities. And it may not be long before a client asks you how to include NFTs in their portfolio.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  While the jargon used by the NFT community may be head-spinning, there’s something to these pieces of digital art. The technology itself isn’t too hard to grasp (at least not on a conceptual level), but what’s truly exciting is the potential this technology brings – and where it could take us in the future.  So what exactly is an NFT? And how will you advise clients when they wonder if they should buy digital tokens? Ahead, I’ll help demystify this new form of a digital asset.  What are NFTs – and will they live up to the hype?  The acronym “NFT” stands for non-fungible token. That’s a fancy way of saying irreplaceable, or not interchangeable. Dollar bills, for instance, are fungible. One dollar bill represents the same thing as the next dollar bill. As long as none are counterfeit, a cashier will accept any of the dollars you have in your wallet. It makes no difference which one you choose to pay with.  Most cryptocurrency is also fungible. One bitcoin, for instance, is equal to one bitcoin, is equal to one bitcoin. The actual file transferred is irrelevant to its value, even though there is a finite number of bitcoin out there.  Non-fungible tokens, however, are not fungible. Minted on the blockchain, these digital files represent an asset that is unique and therefore scarce. Those cute CryptoPunk cartoons might look similar to one another, but the digital record stamped upon the blockchain can verify which is which, and, more importantly, who owns it. When ownership is transferred, the blockchain records that, too.  If you’re tech-minded at all, it doesn’t take a lot of imagination to understand how this new technology opens up a world of possibility that could change how we record and transfer digital ownership. We already understand how to send digital files like PDFs, JPGs, and more – but NFTs add a new layer of data validation.  There’s even such a thing as smart contracts, where a creator can code royalties into their NFT, so that any time the asset is sold again on a secondary marketplace they (and anyone else they want to write into the code) keep getting paid. Compared to the ‘90s when any neighborhood kid could simply burn a CD or download their favorite songs on Napster, exchanging NFTs on blockchain creates a record that is stored into, as far as we can comprehend, perpetuity.  Last, NFTs aren’t just about art, though that is the most popular context in which they’re being discussed right now. Technically, an NFT can be any kind of file, says Jordan Lyall, chief product officer and co-founder of the NFT marketplace Nifty’s.  “It’s almost just a kind of new file format,” he says. “Netflix used to put movies in the mail, but when the technology got good enough, they started streaming. It’s kind of the same thing.”  Now, NFT technology is winning over the art community, but it’s just a hop, skip and a jump away from being used for ticketing, property deeds – and maybe even for financial security ownership, says Lyall.  “I can see at some point Nasdaq is running completely on a blockchain,” says Lyall, who started the NFT farming site dontbuymeme.com before he founded Nifty’s. Having experienced firsthand what kind of innovations come about through experimentation, he expects NFT technology to keep snowballing until it is ubiquitous.  But now we’re getting speculative (see how easily excitement creeps in?). Let’s refocus and discuss where and how your clients can trade NFTs.  What is an NFT marketplace?  To buy and sell NFTs, your clients must first pick the NFT marketplace and wallets of their choice.  Similar to Amazon or eBay, an NFT marketplace is a platform where users can store, display, trade and, in some cases, mint (create) NFTs.  Users will need a funded crypto wallet that’s compatible with whatever blockchain network used by the marketplace they want to buy or sell an NFT in. MetaMask, for instance, is a popular wallet run on perhaps the most popular blockchain platform, Ethereum. Marketplaces that use Ethereum include OpenSea, Rarible and SuperRare, to name a few.  Sometimes, users can fund their wallet with U.S. dollars through automated clearing house (ACH) transfers or other means. Nifty’s, for instance, lets users put in their credit card number and make transactions in USD, even though the money is linked to a cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin, which is designed to have value against the USD. (This is to make cryptocurrency exchanges more accessible to newcomers.) The currency used in every scenario and whether currencies are interchangeable depend on the platform.  Just like with any financial account, users will need to sign up and share personal identifying information, such as bank accounts and credit card numbers. There will be transaction and processing fees for making purchases, just like with any kind of online shopping. Users should use their discretion.  Why NFTs are so appealing  Simply put, people love collectibles. And thanks to the growing accessibility of NFT marketplaces, the title of “collector” now applies to someone trading free Space Jam tokens just as much as it does to prominent figures like the pseudonymous Whale Shark, who owns more than 220,000 pieces of digital art and has consulted Paris Hilton on how to break into the market.  As a financial advisor, your first priority is to look out for the long-term financial security of your clients. It might be helpful to think of NFTs the same way you would a rare stamp collection, for instance, or a signed original manuscript of the great American novel. NFTs are a lot like old-school comic book collecting, or baseball cards and Pokémon cards. Except, thanks to blockchain, their true scarcity (and value) is much less speculative because we have an irrefutable record of every token.  Assuming your clients have a healthy amount of money invested for their retirement, a sizable emergency fund and enough disposable income that they can experiment with NFTs, collecting can be a fun and innovative way to feel a part of the future.  But if someone isn’t in the position to invest money on speculative art – whether a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars here and there – there are ways your clients can dip their toes into the NFT market for free.  How to get involved with NFTs without spending a dollar  “Check out Twitter,” Lyall says. And he’s right.  With a quick scroll through the feed for #NFT and #NFTs, you can find artists, platforms and companies chatting about anticipated drops (releases), industry news and more.  Lyall also suggests checking out projects like OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, to learn about well-known artists, exclusive collaborations and how much your favorite NFTs cost. Monitoring these developments costs nothing, but it helps you become a more informed buyer when you are ready to start collecting.  And don’t be discouraged by the most expensive NFTs, Lyall advises. Tokens from one of the first-ever NFT collections, CryptoPunks, for instance, are valued at extremely high prices now, even though they were free when they first dropped in 2017.  Instead, “find an artist that really resonates with you,” Lyall says. Notice an emerging creator whose work isn’t yet known or valued. Buy early when the price is low – it could pay off later. But most importantly, do it for enjoyment, not for potential profit. That’s been Lyall’s secret to success.  ‘There are dozens of artists every day that are dropping collectible projects. It’s so hard to decipher. What’s good? What’s bad? What’s interesting?” he says.  The playlists featured on Nifty’s attempt to help newcomers answer these questions, offering curated collections for people to learn about, including such categories as collectibles, animated art, photography and more.  Bottom line  At best, NFTs signify a revolution. Stamped on the same blockchain as cryptocurrency, this new technology makes it possible to track ownership and authenticity unlike ever before. That will perk the ears of art collectors, curators and alternative investors interested in owning original digital imagery, music files and other forms of intellectual property.  But at their worst, NFTs can appear to be exclusive – which is ironic given the battle cry of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the NFT community’s overall sense of optimism. Many expect NFT technology will democratize digital property ownership and empower the little guy, but while we wait for everyone to get familiar with the new technology, encourage your clients to have fun without many strings attached.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/why-nfts-are-so-appealing-and-how-anyone-can-start-learning-for-free,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d4a1ad7158f002baf46957bfc9356904eaafca7-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411968,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otWZWp,1632400200,Umbrella Network Acquires Digital Advertising Oracle Lucidity for ‘Tens of Millions’,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) oracle Umbrella Network has acquired Lucidity, a major blockchain-based digital advertising oracle, in a bid to increase transparency in the digital advertising industry.  While the exact terms of the acquisition of Lucidity by Umbrella weren’t disclosed, a spokesperson told CoinDesk Thursday the deal was in the “tens of millions.”  Umbrella acts as a bridge between smart contracts and off-chain data feeds. The network aims to provide the most current price for smart contracts. The network also recently shifted from the Ethereum blockchain to the relatively low-cost smart contract platform Binance Smart Chain in a bid to reduce costs.  “For a long time, the advertising industry did not have access to the technology needed to combat the problematic issue of data manipulation, which causes ad fraud,” said Lucidity adviser David Moore. “Now that Lucidity is becoming a part of the Umbrella Network, we have access to the long-awaited blockchain technology that will empower the protection of our essential data.”  In Defi, oracles are third-party services that collect data off-chain (such as real-world information) and then plug them into smart contracts. The data happening off-chain is used to trigger those contracts and self-execute based on certain information, once a specific set of circumstances have been met.  Lucidity has processed more than 600 million transactions, according to a Thursday press release shared with CoinDesk. The problem Lucidity has set out to solve, it says, revolves around increasing transparency in ad spending for digital advertising. Over $30 billion in advertising spending is wasted every year, the companies claim. Specifically, Lucidity says it is attempting to solve the issue by allowing advertisers to identify and cut down on the waste involved in the advertising process.  Built on the Ethereum, Lucidity says its oracles resolve data discrepancies by targeting fraud and waste as well as enabling a transparent supply chain evaluation so advertisers know where their budget dollars end up.  With Lucidity’s integration, the Umbrella Network will be among the highest transaction volume oracles in the world, the companies said.  “Lucidity is delivering marked improvements in the performance of advertising campaigns for its current client base by taking off-chain data stored in multiple centralized databases and moving it to the blockchain securely,” said Sam Kim, a partner at Umbrella Network. “By combining its advanced analytical capabilities with Umbrella’s oracle network, we will be able to deliver unparalleled insights to marketers.”  The companies said the deal will add to Umbrella Network’s earnings beginning in the first quarter of next year.

The $200 million fund said in a press release on Wednesday that its management strategy will “manage downside risks and maintain substantial upside potential while seeking to defer taxable events for their investors.”  Cambrian claims this strategy has helped its hedge funds cut downside volatility by over 70%, while delivering higher returns than a digital asset passive index in the past three years.  Only institutional and accredited investors can buy into the trusts with an initial minimum investment of $50,000.  The trusts will charge 4% in management fees, almost double the fees charged by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, according to Bloomberg.

The Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) will use Ripple’s CBDC Private Ledger to run retail, cross-border and wholesale-payments pilot tests of a digital version of the ngultrum, Bhutan’s national currency, the company said in a press release on Thursday. The pilot will be built atop the country’s current payments infrastructure and will be conducted in phases.  Bhutan’s stated goal is for its population to reach 85% financial inclusion by 2023. An RMA report published in December last year puts one measure of Bhutan’s financial inclusion at 67.6% in 2019.  No date was announced for the trials to start. Ripple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The private ledger, which is based on the open-source XRP Ledger, claims to be 120,000 times more efficient than standard proof-of-work blockchains making it desirable for a carbon-neutral approach, according to the release. The ledger seeks to provide central banks with “flexibility” and “control” without sacrificing financial stability and monetary policy objectives.  “Our collaboration with Ripple is testament to the potential of CBDCs to provide an alternative and sustainable digital payment instrument in Bhutan,” said Yangchen Tshogyel, deputy governor of the RMA. “Ripple’s groundbreaking technology will allow for the experimentation of a CBDC with our existing payments infrastructure while ensuring efficient and cost-effective cross-border transfers.”  Ripple has been making headway in the cross-border sector with a number of collaborations with banks and other financial institutions.

The collaboration is “one of the first cross-medium projects between authors and artists representing two promising emerging technologies: AI and blockchain,” the statement said.  Founded by former Christie’s Deputy Chairwoman Xin Li-Cohen, TR Lab is an NFT platform for fine art. In August, it auctioned an original artwork by Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang for $2.5 million.  “AI 2041″ is a collection of 10 stories about how artificial intelligence might change the world in the next 20 years.  Five artists were tapped to interpret the stories: 3D artist Alex Ness, who has worked with musicians Lil Nas X, Travis Scott and Diplo; graphics designer Ash Thorp, whose work has been featured in “Ender’s Game,” “Assassin’s Creed” and “Ghost in the Shell,” as well as AI-focused artists Brendan Dawes, Joshua Davis, and Refik Anadol.  More artists will be announced in the future, TR Lab said.  Formerly president of Google China, Lee is one of the most followed figures in China’s tech industry, according to the statement. His venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures has invested in some of China’s most prominent startups, including AI giant Megvii, crypto mining rig maker Bitmain, and drone maker XAG. His 2018 book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was a New York Times bestseller.

In business, NFTs are being used in commerce and supply chains. There has been a buzz in the business sector due to the new trend of Non-fungible Tokens. NFTs have taken over the digital market by storm due to their properties of provenance. Artists have been the beneficiaries, but the digital assets have now diversified to the whole sector. The main reason for the rapid growth of NFTs is their uniqueness. The digital assets classified as NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated. Artists have less worry about counterfeit and their art pieces becoming valueless. NFTs are traceable, which promotes originality, and the artist can trace their works as they change ownership and earn royalties when an exchange is done. NFTs cannot be destroyed. Once the code has been set up for an NFT, personal detail is on it to remain original. Since QR codes cannot be changed, once art is created, it can last forever. Transforming the Education Technology Apart from art, NFTs have been incorporated in various sectors of the economy. In business, NFTs are being used in commerce and supply chains.

KLAY Price Analysis: General price overview Klay&apos;s price is in a very good spot today, as the market recovered from a $0.99 retracement around 6:00 a.m. and established a new high of $1.154 over the 4-hour period. Our forecast foresees a consolidation in the price for the KLAY/USD pair, with potential support at $1.20 and resistance at $1.5. On the other hand, we expect the token to consolidate or retrace down and test $1.80 on the upswing, although retreating downwards is less likely to happen. The chances the price will break below $1.90 are low. Our technical model is bullish for today, although an impulsive move toward the upside looks less likely to happen, given that volumes are still on the decline, signaling a lack of interest in buyers to enter at higher prices. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is gaining ground for the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin all posting gains of 3.54%, 7.11,%, and 11% respectively. Dogecoin has been the best performer during this time after posting the record daily gains. Klay price movement in the last 24 hours The overall market for digital coins is acting well.

XMR/USD picked off the five-day Litecoin price analysis chart while the bulls had taken control of the market. The coin traded in a rising wedge forming several triangles. XMR has recorded a 25 percent gain in the last week. On the 5-day price analysis chart, the green bars seem to be more than the red ones. This is a good indication that the XMR/USD market is trading in bullish momentum. On the daily chart, the XMR/USD has formed a triangle descending channel, which has been developing since October. If we assume that this trend continues and we see a break into the upside of the channel&apos;s resistance at $250, we can see another strong run-up in prices. At this point in time (and for quite some time now), there is simply too much uncertainty across the globe for solid investment decisions like these - so proceed with caution when investing in XMR or any other coin/asset. Don&apos;t bet more than you are prepared to lose Our outlook for Monero is negative, and we expect it to weaken further. We anticipate the decline to continue throughout the day, with a first bear target of $210 set. This is in case the buyers don&apos;t consolidate enough power to withstand any future upside rejections.
