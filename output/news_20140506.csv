42397615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDSQl,1399416094,Chinese Exchange Huobi Considers Future As Bitcoin Marketplace,"Amid ongoing uncertainty regarding their ability to continue operations, the top executives of five major China-based bitcoin exchanges abruptly cancelled scheduled appearances at this weekend's Global Bitcoin Summit.  The move, a response to continued pressure from the People's Bank of China, however, is unlikely to have a significant impact on what has become a core problem for these businesses – that the country's central bank is looking to limit their interaction with key financial partners.  Now, a new report from Sina Tech suggests major Beijing-based exchange Huobi may be seeking to reposition its company's services in response to the measures.  Speaking to the media outlet, Huobi co-founder Jun Du suggested that the company is considering a plan to use its exchange platform as a marketplace and price aggregator for digital currency buyers and sellers.  Under this proposal, Du told Sina Tech that users would form their own online chatroom group using a popular tool offered by the tech giant Tencent. Buyers and sellers within this group would then exchange bitcoin or recharge codes for RMB, interacting independently of the exchange.  Du explained that this workaround would relieve a current pain point, that Huobi must handle the transition of bitcoin to fiat currency, stating:  ""What we are most focused on is the inflow of [fiat] monies.""  Although the comments are surprising, Huobi has been one of the more open exchanges when discussing a potential repositioning of its business.  The company previously reported that it has registered for overseas incorporation and offshore accounts that would perhaps allow it to continue as an exchange abroad.  Decline in volume and activity  Du also gave a glimpse at how the PBOC's still-unofficial policies have affected the exchange. He noted that as Huobi lost key business partners, it kept open voucher deposits. This, Du said, led to a decrease in the speed of the exchange's ability to bring in capital.  In total, Du estimates that the loss of these partner banks resulted in a 10% decline in user activity.  Further, he estimates that prices dropped 30% across all China-based exchanges in the month following these actions. The price of bitcoin had held steady above $500 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index before the rumors began in late March.  Uneven enforcement  The report also suggests that Huobi may have been more greatly affected by the PBOC's warnings due to its location in China's capital.  Sina Tech notes that BTC China, which is based in Shanghai, has been ""under far less pressure"", complying with requests to close accounts, but otherwise continuing to operate normally.  BTC China CEO Bobby Lee has been outspoken about the ongoing regulatory issues in China, moving to calm international fears amid fears that the country would act aggressively against domestic exchanges.  However, it, too, is facing increased setbacks. On 6th May, BTC China announced it would suspend RMB deposits from the Bank of China. For more on this story, read our full report.

GuestLeader is being advertised as a way for hotels to quickly integrate bitcoin payments and take advantage of the benefits enjoyed by bitcoin-accepting merchants.  Customers can use GuestLeader to make a reservation and then pay using bitcoin at checkout, while hotels that want to accept bitcoin as a form of payment can do so without the technical know-how required by other solutions.  REVPAR said in its 6th May announcement:  ""Hotels of any size will have the ability to accept payment in bitcoins (and by doing so, attract a new and emerging customer) without having a great deal of technical knowledge.""  How GuestLeader works  GuestLeader functions like most traditional hotel booking tools - the customer fills out guest information and selects the room they would like to reserve.  At checkout, the customer can opt to pay using bitcoin instead of a credit card. They scan the QR code that appears on the screen, which authorizes the transaction.  BitPay acts as the payment processor, converting bitcoins into fiat and depositing the funds into the hotel’s bank account. In this way, a hotel that uses GuestLeader is only indirectly accepting bitcoin. GuestLeader also features smartphone and tablet functionality, and can also be deployed across social media platforms such as Facebook.  More hotels sign up for bitcoin  As bitcoin becomes increasingly prominent as a payment system, a rising number of hotels have begun accepting digital currency.  In February, California-based travel booking agency CheapAir announced that it would accept bitcoin payments. The service offers bitcoin reservations for more than 200,000 hotel locations worldwide.

42425645,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIef1h,1399409416,Blockchain's Nic Cary: Banks Should Embrace Digital Currency Innovation,"Blockchain CEO Nic Cary spoke at New York Ideas – a conference featuring thought leaders in the business, finance and technology industries held by The Atlantic and the Aspen Institute – on 6th May as part of a panel discussion entitled 'Cash, Credit or Digital: What Happened to My Money?"".  The panel  featured Cary, Pryor Cashman partner Jeffrey Alberts and McKinsey & Company principal Philip Bruno, and was moderated by NPR Planet Money podcast host David Kestenbaum.  The half-hour talk covered a host of current debates in the bitcoin industry, including whether digital currencies are best suited as a payment mechanism, how governments should regulate the industry, and the potential for governments to shut down bitcoin and similar payment methods should they so choose.  The most notable comments came from Cary when he was asked if, given the anti-bank sentiment common to bitcoin enthusiasts, he would welcome the entrance of more traditional financial players like Bank of America into the space.  Cary responded that he would ""love if Bank of America got involved in bitcoin"", suggesting that he would like the company to embrace the wider adoption of technology taking place across all industries, stating:  ""When I think about the digitization of things – we used to send mail, now we send email, we used to buy books, now we got them on Amazon.com – not to expect the digitization of money would be naive.""  Alberts has previously represented clients in digital currency disputes and most recently spoke at Inside Bitcoins NYC, while Bruno is known for his expertise in global payments.  Bitcoin as a payment system  The conversation kicked off with Kestenbaum sharing his experience trying to buy lunch using bitcoin – one that occurred before the technology's more recent uptick in adoption. The comment sparked debate about bitcoin's potential use as an everyday payment tool.  Though Cary related his own experiences living entirely by using bitcoin as a currency, Bruno countered that he believes the speculative nature of bitcoin will perhaps be an obstacle that prohibits mainstream users from achieving a similar experience.  He cited his belief that most bitcoin transactions are speculative, saying:  ""To get from here to something that is less speculative and something that is more commerce, is going to be a messy process.""  Alberts offered a different take, suggesting that bitcoin's speculative, deflationary nature – although perhaps prohibiting it from becoming a foundational currency – would not be terribly relevant given that bitcoin could evolve to offer a lower-cost back-end to payment providers.  Regulator interest in bitcoin  Bruno was the most outspoken on the topic of digital currency regulation, suggesting that these institutions are genuinely intrigued by the prospect of a lower-cost payment system:  ""Regulators and central banks are really looking at [...] how to design payment networks and what they can learn from the technology.""  One key benefit that these organisations see potential in, he suggested, was the social impact of a technology that could enable more underbanked consumers to gain access to financial services. Bruno also noted that major financial institutions are ""very serious about studying bitcoin"", though they have not made any commitments to the technology.  Alberts chose to view the increasing interest in bitcoin among regulators as a sign of the industry's development, while Cary suggested the initial responses from governments – as in the case of the most recent IRS decision on the matter – are a sign more education is needed.  Bitcoin as the new Internet  Over the course of the conversation, Cary did his best to frame anti-digital currency sentiment as misguided, given the larger transitions happening around the world. He said that those who do so are ""putting [their] head in the sand of the financial future"".  Cary compared bitcoin to email, suggesting that while consumers may not understand it, they will eventually be able to successfully use it to obtain benefits at a lower cost.  Further, he indicated that given this long-term appeal, digital currencies are still an attractive investment, saying:  ""Imagine if you had the opportunity to invest in [a system like email]. That's what's at stake today.""

42425641,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeevh,1399407941,Bitcoin Foundation to Announce Election Winners Friday,"Voting in the ongoing election to fill the Bitcoin Foundation's two vacant Board of Directors seats has officially resumed with the start of a second round of voting featuring the top three remaining candidates.  The Bitcoin Foundation launched the second round of voting after the first ended with no candidates reaching the minimum vote threshold necessary for election. The outcome was one of several possible conclusions owing to the wording of the Bitcoin Foundation’s by-laws.  The runoff round began at 9am EDT on 6th May and will last until 11.59pm EDT on 8th May, according to Brian Goss, chairman of the foundation’s election committee, who also told CoinDesk that the two winners are scheduled to be announced on Friday.  The three candidates who received the most votes in the initial round were BTC China founder Bobby Lee, Gyft co-founder and CEO Vinny Lingham and technology entrepreneur Brock Pierce.  In the first round of voting, Lee received the highest number of votes with 44 votes. Pierce and Lingham garnered 34 and 21 votes, respectively. More information about these candidates can be found in our full coverage of the election candidates.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42425640,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeerh,1399401036,47% of Bitcoin Companies Are Open to Paying Employees in BTC,"A newly released survey from Bitwage, a bitcoin-focused payroll solution provider, has revealed that 47% of bitcoin companies are open to paying their employees in the digital currency.  The survey  sought to assess the sentiment toward bitcoin payroll options held at more than 150 bitcoin-friendly companies, most of which were based in the US. In total, 38 companies responded, with 18 reporting they would be open to paying bitcoin wages.  Of the companies surveyed, 10.5% of the employers who responded are currently paying employees, at least in part, in bitcoin.  Notable bitcoin companies that pay employees in the currency include Coinbase, Blockchain and Alix Resources.  Bitwage noted that the responses it received also serve as evidence that bitcoin payroll solutions are attracting talented professionals, stating:  ""The bitcoin wage is opening companies up to entirely new talent acquisition markets that they would have previously been unable to reach, while also facilitating low cost international payroll payments.""  The study follows a notable January survey conducted by Tech in Motion that sought to assess the sentiment of bitcoin payroll solutions in the broader tech industry. That report found that 51.12% of 847 respondents would happily work for the digital currency.  Employee incentivization  In addition to new data on how bitcoin companies feel about digital currency payments, BitWage also gathered more general information on cryptocurrencies by allowing respondents to freely comment on questions.  For example, it highlighted two companies – AcademyX and IVPN – that are incentivizing employees through bitcoin payments.  Bitwage noted AcademyX is now implementing contests with bitcoin prizes that encourage employees to increase their IT knowledge, while IVPN has offered bitcoin to customers in exchange for help with product testing.  Bitcoin payroll roadblocks  Still, such innovation is being blocked in some countries by what the report cited as problematic regulatory regimes in countries like Belgium, Canada, Holland and Italy.  In addition, employees who do accept bitcoin must conduct additional tax calculations on capital gains earnings, while also navigating the still-growing bitcoin economy when purchasing essential everyday items.

42425650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIefBh,1399395832,How Bitcoin is Thriving in Argentina's Black Market Economy,"James Downer is a student of International Relations and Computer science, and is interested in the collision between the two. Here, he discusses bitcoin's growing role in Argentina and the nation's thriving black market for dollars.  The US dollar black market doesn’t just thrive in Buenos Aires, it’s published in the paper every morning.  Swinging by one of the city’s newsstands, you’ll find the official peso to dollar rates published next to the ‘dólar blue’ rates at the top of the morning edition of La Nación, and if you walk downtown to Calle Florida, the arbolitos (street traders of black market currency, literally 'little trees') that stand planted on the busy commercial street greet any foreigner they see with barks of “Cambio! Cambio! Cambio!”.  Currency restrictions have become more stringent in Argentina in recent years as the government struggles to prop up confidence in the peso by restricting the dollar. These restrictions have held the official rate down to around 8 to 1, but the blue rate at around 10 to 1 is so favourable that dollars determine tourism prices and denominate everything from technology purchases to property.  A history of inflation  Confidence in the dollar and lack of faith in the domestic peso is deeply woven into the culture of Argentina. While it strikes foreigners strange that a vast portion of the country thinks in dollars, periods of inflation are so frequent in Argentinian history, those who don’t have an escape from the inflationary currency are quickly left behind.  Inflation over the past year reached 100% by private estimates, but that pales in comparison to the economic crisis of 2001, when Argentina declared bankruptcy and ruptured peso parity with the US dollar, freezing bank accounts for many. At the peak of the crisis, when one woman couldn’t get money from her account, she doused herself in gasoline in the middle of the bank floor and set herself on fire.  Before that, back in the late ’80s, Argentina saw one of the worst periods of inflation in modern history, reaching 5,000% over the course of 1989, resulting in massive food shortages and riots around the country. Haunted by decennial crises, Argentinians rationally hoard dollars, with a sum total of around $50bn allegedly hidden in walls and under sofa cushions.  Hoarding bucks  Those who have the means and access look for banks outside the country dealing in dollars or euros, and some choose to invest in domestic property (also denominated in dollars, or pesos at the blue rate), but many turn to cuevas (underground exchange houses, literally 'caves') or arbolitos to guard their savings in physical dollar bills.  This means that the black rate is dependent on the flow of physical dollars into the country. Each physical dollar needs to come from abroad, either withdrawn from an ATM in Uruguay and brought back across Rio de la Plata, or flown in from the US or Europe stored in wallets and stuffed in underwear.  Bitcoin leader  By the 2010 Argentine census, the Greater Buenos Aires area had a population a shade over 12.8 million people. Each marker on the map above (numbers denote a collection of sites) represents a point where bitcoin is accepted in Buenos Aires as reported on Coinmap.  Within the cryptocurrency community, Coinmap is widely used to identify bitcoin-accepting sites around the world. The total number of sites in the Buenos Aires area is 78. To scale the number of sites to the size of the city, we can divide the sites by the number of people, making the index for Buenos Aires 6.1 sites for every million inhabitants.  Argentina leads Latin America by leaps and bounds for bitcoin development. São Paulo with a population of 20.8 million shows 16 sites (0.8 sites per million), Mexico City with 21.2 people shows 14 reported sites (0.7 sites per million), and Santiago with 6.3 million reports 6 (1.0 sites per million).  But how does Buenos Aires compare as an early adopter to an area which brought us Bell Labs and the Manhattan project?    New York currently has 111 sites in the metropolitan area of 23.4 million people. With an index of 4.7 sites per million, Buenos Aires still comes out ahead with a notable adoption advantage.  Premium price  So bitcoin is certainly seeing accelerated adoption in Argentina. Potential reasons why include everything from high Internet penetration, to the ideological base which drives many bitcoiners: that the central bank and politicians are not to be trusted.  And while not one of the half dozen arbolitos I interviewed had heard of bitcoin, there is a community eagerly buying up bitcoins for pesos, and bitcoin adoption, while the majority of the public is still not aware of it, is growing quickly.  In addition to the stats published by Coinmap, BitPay, a bitcoin payment implementation service, has just opened offices in Argentina.  Without access to an exchange, the best way to get a bitcoin in Argentina is to find someone online interested in selling and meet in a cafe for a quick conversation to switch a pile of pesos for the digital currency.  This naturally means the data is scattered, but the several sites that act as dealers or deal facilitators (such as digicoins.tk, unisend.com, localbitcoins.com and the lively Bitcoin Argentina Facebook group) publish daily buy/sell rates for bitcoin.  These numbers are naturally a bit subjective, but provide a historical metric to compare what people are willing to pay for a bitcoin compared to the dólar blue.  For 54 of 72 days with data since the beginning of the year, the per dollar cost of a bitcoin exceeded the dólar blue rate, meaning people were paying a premium of up to 30% above the 20% extra a dollar cost to buy BTC.  The relation in price makes sense, as those providing currency from abroad frequently have access to both bitcoins and dollars, but the degree is startling.  Liquid asset  What’s the connection between the rise of bitcoin in Argentina and encroachment on the black market? While bitcoin still exists as an outsider method of payment, a core group of passionate developers have identified its utility as a protocol and are willing to brave the swinging volatility that has brought the price down 50% since the start of 2014, but up nearly 6,000% since a year ago.  A traditional currency should be widely accepted and a relatively constant store of value, but a significant advantage of bitcoin is its liquidity. Entirely legal and giving more diverse options, bitcoin can be used less as a currency and more as a protocol.  What’s driving this boom? Many in the community here speculate that philosophy and frustration with the government is driving adoption.  Whatever the cause, bitcoin won’t change the world overnight, but it has a distinct adoption advantage in certain sectors. The black market in Argentina may well just be one such area.

42425635,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeejh,1399392959,Bitcoin Speakers Announced for US Banking Task Force Hearing,"The US Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) is planning to hold a public hearing on emerging payments issues, including digital currencies.  The hearing will be organised by the CSBS Emerging Payments Task Force and it will take place in Chicago on the 16th of May.  The task force was formed earlier this year to examine new trends in payment systems and determine their potential impact on consumer protection, banks and laws governing the industry.  The CSBS says the purpose of the hearing will be to obtain information from a variety of entities and individuals involved in the payments system.  The hearing will include panel discussions on legacy payment systems, retail payment innovations and digital currencies, and will be open to both the public and the media.

The commissioned report was compiled by Value Partners Management Consulting, which also produces bi-annual reports on ATM trends.  Called 'Bitcoin: Virtual Currency with Real Opportunities', the document appears to be largely positive, as the title indicates.  ATMIA CEO Mike Lee said the ATMIA and the EFTA are keen to develop industry positions on bitcoin and he sees room for synergy, adding:  “This excellent report presents a history and comprehensive international analysis of bitcoin, while at the same time showing how virtual currencies and ATM systems can interface for their mutual benefit.”  Bitcoin is here to stay  As for the future of bitcoin, Lee does not appear to be overly concerned:  “I think bitcoin will still be standing, despite its ups and downs, in the medium term, perhaps even in the long-run.”  Franscesco Burelli, Partner at Value Partners, said digital currencies are proving to be a “new opportunity” for ATM operators.  “The ATM is an ideal touch-point channel between the not-so-intuitive cryptocurrencies and the consumers who may want to leverage the new payment methods but may not be sufficiently technically savvy to liaise directly with exchanges and cryptographic wallets,"" he said.

42425647,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIef9h,1399388601,Why Bitcoin Exchange Audits Don't Go Far Enough,"Bitcoin exchanges have further to go to prove their good standing to customers, say the experts that inspected them – but solutions are just around the corner.    Last week  , CoinDesk explored bitcoin exchange Kraken, and showed you how the company did its best to prove it possessed the bitcoins it claimed.  Bitcoin luminary Stefan Thomas used cryptographic proofs to confirm that the US exchange wouldn’t be caught short if there was a run on its bitcoins, and that it wouldn’t suddenly be embarrassed, Mt. Gox-style, to find that a hacker had secretly been stealing its coins.  Kraken passed the inspection with flying colours, as have others. But did the inspections go far enough? How in-depth should an audit be, and what else should it cover?  Why improvements are needed  The audit that Thomas conducted focused on how many bitcoins the exchange possessed, and how many it owed to customers. In a legitimate exchange environment, the former should be greater then the latter.  The Kraken audit followed a flurry of activity in the wake of the Mt Gox debacle, in which exchanges rallied to reassure customers that they had the bitcoins they claimed.  ""It’s a reaction to Mt Gox,"" says Thomas. The company, which suspended withdrawals and then said that it had lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, left angry users in its wake.  Things used to be even worse, Thomas told CoinDesk, stating:  ""I remember when these services were run anonymously and the MyBitcoin.com calamity happened, and then almost no one would use an anonymously run service anymore.""  This was a reference to the anonymously operated wallet that claimed to have lost just over half its users’ bitcoins.  He added: ""In future, people won’t use exchanges that don't allow any form of audit.""  These inspections were a best-effort attempt to deliver something tangible in a short timeframe, but they are unlikely to be the ultimate solution.  When is an audit not an audit?  Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, says that he’s already planning a follow-up to his exchange's initial audit in the near future.  [post-quote]  A spokesperson from Coinbase, which also carried out a third-party inspection of its bitcoin reserves, added that it, too, is conducting more comprehensive follow-up inspections.  What should such inspections cover, and what was omitted the first time? We can learn a lot from Andreas Antonopoulos, Chief Security Officer at Blockchain, who was called in to inspect Coinbase’s bitcoin reserves back in February.  ‘Audit’ isn’t a throwaway word, said Antonopoulos, who specifically didn’t refer to his inspection as an audit the first time around.  He prefers to call it a spot check, adding: ""I purposefully used less strong language, because in my mind an audit is far more comprehensive and rigorous. If you see an audit that takes less than three or four weeks, it isn't an audit.""  ""[In an audit] they take visits to the sites, and they have teams to create a comprehensive report, and to sign off on that.""  Implementing comprehensive audits  A proper audit wouldn’t focus solely on the bitcoin reserves, continued Antonopoulos, arguing that there are three broad areas a satisfactory bitcoin exchange audit would require:  Bitcoin reserves    Auditing the bitcoin reserves proves that the exchange has the bitcoins it claims to.    Fiat operations    An unscrupulous exchange without enough bitcoins to cover its customers' accounts could simply buy more of them with dollars or another currency, and hiding any gaps in its accounts by simply moving money from fiat currencies to bitcoin and back again. Auditors of a bitcoin exchange would ideally nose through the company’s fiat accounts to spot if this is happening.    Security    Checking the firm’s current cybersecurity systems would confirm that nothing had been visibly hacked.    However, these points alone do not satisfy Antonopoulos’ criteria for a true audit.  Companies don’t stand still, and a proper audit would include an element of future proofing. So, he divides each of these three areas into a further two areas: immediate checks, and forward governance.  That gives us a structure like this one (pictured), which, he said, any truly comprehensive bitcoin audit would have:  There are challenges in both the spot check and the governance areas. For a start, a truly comprehensive bitcoin audit would span multiple disciplines.  There are a lot of very good bitcoin technologists in the world, and there are a lot of good accountants, but there isn’t much of an overlap.  ""It is a business that could generate a lot of revenue and create a useful service to the industry,"" said Antonopoulos. ""It would be a business combining CPAs and financial auditors, security auditors for infosecurity and knowledge of cryptographic currencies, and it would be able to do specialised audits for these kinds of businesses.""  Right now, this is something that exchanges must cobble together for themselves, however.  Jesse Powell, who said that he is working on audits covering the fiat side of his operation, elaborated on Antonopoulos' ideas:  ""The firm would need to independently have a strong grasp of bitcoin, crypto, the ability to review code or write their own, be aware of opportunities for either party to compromise the audit and have the ability to prevent those compromises. Traditionally, this skill set is not what accounting firms are known for.”  Kraken’s future audit will take these issues into account. The firm is working towards a fiat-based audit, he said, explaining:  ""The next one will be comprehensive, including all cryptos, and fiat. Following that would be other types of audits on the company as a whole, [including the] management team, security, etc.""  Coinbase has also confirmed that it’s focusing on both fiat and cryptocurrency checks for its next audit.  This challenge is daunting enough for exchanges trying to grow their business and deal with a plethora of regulatory and technical hurdles. And, this is just one snapshot in time. Audits are supposed to happen repeatedly to ensure that businesses remain compliant.  Why exchanges need repeat audits  As it stands, Kraken and Coinbase’s proof of reserves are ageing: they’re snapshots taken in the past. The older those snapshots become, the less relevant they are. Repeat audits keep validating the exchange, which assures customers their funds are safe.  However, there’s another reason why audits should be repeated, says Thomas: having subsequent audits handled by different parties reduces the need to place trust in one expert, such as himself.  “The way you get trust in these audits is that they're repeated by different people. It seems to be less likely that the exchange will lie, or bribe the auditor.”  To this end, he has resolved not to carry out any follow-up audits for Bitfinex or Kraken, because he wants to encourage the firms to use other third-party auditors. Although he has none planned at present, he is happy to conduct audits for other exchanges, though.  There are ways to increase the ongoing impact of an audit, by ensuring good governance, and this can be done across several of the audit areas highlighted here.  On the cybersecurity side, white-hat programs are certainly laudable ways to find software bugs, but it’s also important to check that companies have sufficient controls in place to avoid getting hacked in the future. There are well-established standards for this, such as the ISO 27000 series, and COBIT.  On the bitcoin reserves side, it should be possible to conduct regular automated spot checks that are automatically updated each day, suggested Antonopoulos.  An exchange could automatically hash the Merkle root for its cold storage, to create a proof of its assets – the bitcoins it has in hand.  It could also hash the balance of user accounts to create a Merkle root for the bitcoins held in its customers’ accounts, which would be a proof of liability.  These two Merkle roots could then be compared together.  How would the users automatically check that their balances were included in the proof of liabilities, though? They could use the same feature implemented during the Kraken audit, whereby users can personally check that their address was included in the tree that created the Merkle root.  Automating the process  The problem is that currently, an exchange’s users have to be technically adept to carry out these checks, meaning that many of them won’t. Instead, this check could be done for them using independently verified software, Antonopoulos said:  “One of the things we might want to see in the industry is essentially a much more user-friendly widget. Let's imagine that you have a third-party JavaScript widget that pops up inside the page from a third-party service, that runs the crypto check for you. You get a green check mark with the balance.”  The bitcoin community doesn’t stand still for long and at least one such system already exists. This proof of solvency system can be plugged into exchanges to offer both proof of liability and proof of solvency, says its creator.  And, yes, there is a browser-based widget designed to automatically check that a user’s balance has been included in a hash representing an exchange’s liabilities.  Bitcoin exchanges that have made an effort to reassure customers in this way are headed down the right track, but conducting a financial audit is a daunting task when you're a new organisation dealing with an entirely new asset class that many accountants don't even understand.  Hopefully, more exchanges will soon step up to prove not only their bitcoin reserves, but also their good governance in other areas. Like the bitcoin network and business ecosystem itself, exchanges’ ability to prove their good standing to customers remains a work in progress.

42425638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeenh,1399384848,CheapAir Now Accepts Bitcoin for Amtrak Railway Bookings,"California-based airfare and hotel booking provider CheapAir.com has announced it is now accepting bitcoin for Amtrak railway reservations completed on its platform.  The move is the latest in a broad rollout of bitcoin payments across the company's services, starting with flights in November before continuing to CheapAir's network of 200,000 hotels in February.  CheapAir added Amtrak listings to its site in April, but has only just completed the necessary back-end work to accept bitcoin payments for the travel option.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Jeff Klee suggested that this measured rollout of bitcoin payments was not part of the company's strategy, though he acknowledged it has helped boost awareness of the company and its offerings within the digital currency community.  Klee said:  ""Once we saw how well it did with flights, we said we should definitely add this to hotels. Amtrak was a new product, but because bitcoin had done well on flights and hotels, we thought to continue our support for bitcoin.""  Notably, the move follows Spanish travel agency Destinia.com's decision to accept bitcoin for railway ticket purchases in late March.  Adding the payment option  Though CheapAir has been accepting bitcoin for some time, Klee said adding it as a payment option to its Amtrak offerings required some work.  He explained the issues the company had to account for during the process, given that its suppliers are not yet accepting the currency:  ""When someone pays by bitcoin, we have to bypass that traditional process, we accept the payment, we process it and then we have to pay the suppliers in some other way.""  The CEO also noted that the move was made not because of customer demand, but as a way to round out the company's service.  He stated: “We thought it would be a good idea, just because there are a lot of routes where people don't realize how viable [trains are] as an alternative or just never thought that train results would be included in a predominantly airfare site.""  Steady revenue  Klee also elaborated on the success of CheapAir's other bitcoin initiatives, noting that while the platform has not seen a significant spike in bitcoin sales, revenue via this payment stream has not declined.  Klee's comments suggest that he has been paying particular attention to the lack of expansion in bitcoin sales, however:  ""To be honest, initially we were pleasantly surprised by the response. It hasn't declined, but it hasn't grown that much either.""  However, Klee did indicate that his company will continue to support the digital currency ecosystem. He added: ""Ever since we started with bitcoin on flights, anything new we add, we're trying to include bitcoin wherever possible.""

42425630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeeZh,1399378120,Fortress CIO Mike Novogratz Explains Why He is Bullish on Bitcoin,"Fortress Investment Group CIO Mike Novogratz is bullish on bitcoin. Why? The digital currency is attracting some of the smartest people around, he says.  In an interview with Bloomberg TV from the 2014 Sohn Investment Conference in New York, and reported by Business Insider, Novogratz argued that bitcoin is attracting some serious talent, including some of the brightest programmers on the face of the planet.  Furthermore, there is a lot of smart money flowing into the digital currency, he added.  Human and financial capital  Novogratz claims there are an estimated 30,000 individual programmers working on bitcoin, which is a lot given the size of the niche and market cap of bitcoin at the moment.  In the interview, Novogratz explained why he is intrigued by the human capital side of bitcoin:  “So there’s this open source community where there’s huge brain power, let alone all the VC money that’s going in. And so from Marc Andreessen and his company to Benchmark… there’s lots of smart money going in. I’ve never seen a small project with more human capital going into it, and so I kind of want to bet just on that alone.""  When asked whether bitcoin could fade away, Novogratz said the basic concept will ultimately lead to the decentralisation of finance.  He argued that new concepts such as peer-to-peer lending will emerge and that the banks are already feeling threatened, as similar concepts have already taken off in other industries.  “The Internet disintermediates large players and I think bitcoin is just one of the threats that the finance industry [...] has coming against it,” said Novogratz.  Already a bitcoin backer  Fortress Investment Group already has a substantial presence in bitcoin: the company teamed up with Benchmark Capital, Ribbit Capital and Pantera Capital to launch a bitcoin investment fund back in March.  Previously, back in 2013, Fortress became the first Wall Street investment firm to enter the bitcoin space. It was rumoured to be buying bitcoins and a regulatory filing in February revealed that the company invested $20m in bitcoin holdings in 2013.  Novogratz clearly has more than one reason to want bitcoin to succeed – about 20 million reasons, in fact – but his comments on human capital and the long-term development potential of bitcoin do ring true.

In its second such announcement since 26th April the exchange said in a (since-removed) tweet:    Dear users, Due to regulations, we have suspended CNY deposits from Bank of China. For further enquiries, pls email: support@btcchina.com      — BTC China (@btcchina) May 6, 2014    Chinese exchanges have suffered major setbacks recently after banks finally responded to repeated directives from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) – China's central bank – and shuttered all relationships with bitcoin businesses.  All are said to be looking for new business opportunities after seeing trade volumes plummet.  Bank forces closures  Some smaller exchanges have shut down their businesses altogether, including FXBTC and the boutique exchange Linkcoin.  Both exchanges cited central bank policy as the reason for shutting down, acknowledging they could not stay in business without banking access.  Linkcoin, which reportedly had only a handful of customers, posted the following statement:    ""May 1st announcement: due to policy reasons the deposit channel is blocked – our site will be closed on May 11th. Users please withdraw your RMB and cryptocurrency. If you still have assets after the 11th our website [sic] you can contact us to process it manually.      We will keep the contact channel active for one month, if there is any policy change we don't deny the possibility of bringing our website back online.""

42425642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeeth,1399361178,Five Chinese Exchange CEOs Pull Out of Conference,"CEOs of five major Chinese bitcoin exchanges have withdrawn from this weekend's Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing, after banks forced most of them to close accounts related to bitcoin activity.  The five exchanges: OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, BtcTrade and CHBTC, made a lengthy joint statement on Weibo late Tuesday that they would no longer participate in large bitcoin meetings or gatherings. The statement continued that the companies agreed to: Curb excessive speculation and protect investors, comply with all state policies and regulations, promote transparency in exchange processes, pay a flat fee for high-frequency trades, and report the latest industry developments to authorities.  The speakers' list would have included OKCoin's Star Xu, BTC China's Bobby Lee and Huobi's Leon Li. Pulling out of the event will lower the exchanges' profile and avoid provoking unhappy authorities into further action by having management speak in public.  Conference still fine  Despite the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) disapproval of bitcoin, ticket sales for the two-day Summit on 10th-11th May are said to be ""stellar"" and representatives from other bitcoin businesses will still play a part.  There is far more to China's bitcoin economy than just exchanges, and Summit speakers will discuss new innovations, startup advice, communication with outside markets and future directions for bitcoin in China.  The Summit's president is Li Xiaolai, whose bitcoin private equity company bitfund.pe is organizing the event with UBM Chinahttp://www.ubmchina.com/Home/tabid/709/language/en-US/Default.aspx.  Other Summit speakers  Scheduled international speakers who still plan to attend the Summit are Roger Ver, Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin and Anthony di Iorio from the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. The list also includes a number of representatives from Chinese bitcoin startups and organizations including Peat.io, BTC123, BitAngels and Bifubao.  What actually happened in China?  Commenters on bitcoin forums have been bewildered at events in China this year, sometimes mistaking the actions of businesses and central bank for a series of policy backflips and creating the inaccurate 'China banned bitcoin again' meme.  In reality, nothing much changed. The PBOC announced its desire for banks not to engage in business with bitcoin exchanges in December last year, and has not changed its position since then.  Bitcoin entrepreneur Zhang Weiwu put events into perspective with this experienced analysis of Chinese business politics and the orders of magnitude affecting both profit and power.  Bitcoin, he wrote, represents too small a sector for an authority the size of the PBOC to deal with directly on a political level, leaving consumer banks confused as to how to act. This allowed exchanges to sidestep the directives for a time, until the PBOC was forced to reaffirm its opposition to bitcoin in more certain terms.  This may also explain why bitcoin exchanges never received any official notice from the PBOC itself: An authority representing 1.3 billion people does not deal directly with local business, and bitcoin is still relatively obscure.  What's next for bitcoin?  The way forward for other sectors of China's bitcoin economy will be interesting. Businesses less reliant than exchanges on fiat-crypto gateways, such as merchant services and secure wallets, and the ASIC hardware manufacturers keeping China's booming mining operations equipped, are reportedly shrugging at the bank bans and pushing on with their growth plans.  As for exchanges themselves, they will go about their business under the guidelines listed in their joint statement above, guides that appear to keep a tight rein on their activities.  CoinDesk will be attending the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing for further reports.
