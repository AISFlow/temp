42398521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpnj,1437596173,Australian Securities Regulator Puts Brakes on Bitcoin IPO,"An Australian cryptocurrency firm is facing fresh delays on its road to debuting on the Australian Securities Exchange.  Australia's chief securities regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), has issued an interim stop order on the investment prospectus submitted by Bitcoin Group Ltd for undisclosed reasons.  According to the ASIC's website, such orders may be issued if any documents submitted contain ""misleading or deceptive"" content, omit any required information or are subject to pending revision following entry.  ASIC initially extended the exposure period on 6th July before issuing the interim stop order one week later.  Bitcoin Group received a public scolding by ASIC in February after the company used social media channels to garner interest in its anticipated stock offering. At the time, the regulator said that the company must file a prospectus before such statements could be made. Bitcoin Group announced that it had filed its prospectus on 29th June.  ASIC and Bitcoin Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42398547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpwa,1437594613,Expedia's Connie Chung: Purchases With Bitcoin Are Down 40%,"Despite a decline of approximately 40% in bitcoin purchases, Connie Chung, senior payments product manager at Expedia, says the option to pay with the digital currency will remain as long as there is a demand for it.  In interview with CoinDesk, Chung, who helped launch bitcoin payments for Expedia's US website last year, says the decision to accept payments in the cryptocurrency was also a response to demand, and that this is perhaps the most important factor in its selection of payment methods.  It was not, she added, about Expedia making a statement or taking a stance on digital currencies.  She told CoinDesk:  ""We accept bitcoin as a way of just allowing customers to pay with whatever method they want to pay. For us, bitcoin is on an even playing field with the other payment types we offer.""  Consumer adoption  Chung noted other merchants had been more affected by what she called a recent decline in bitcoin payments – with some reporting a decrease of up to 90% at various industry events.  For Chung, the general drop in payments can be correlated with bitcoin's declining price, a reasoning that appears in line with the current narrative about declining interest in bitcoin as an e-commerce tool among major merchants.  To put this into context, according to CoinDesk's BPI, bitcoin's price stood slightly over the $600 mark at the time of Expedia's integration in June 2014. Since then, the digital currency has seen a somewhat dramatic – and widely reported – price drop, hovering mostly around $200 since the beginning of this year.  CoinDesk's recent State of Bitcoin report found that the number of new bitcoin-accepting merchants continued to increase in the second quarter of 2015 but that this growth was below levels seen in previous quarters.  According to the report, the fundamental challenge facing bitcoin as a medium of exchange of legal goods continues to be low consumer adoption and a lack of advantages over credit and debit cards.  However, more niche use cases – such as in international e-commerce – continue to remain of interest to merchants in the e-commerce space.  Industry nuances  Expedia's bitcoin payments offer – only available for hotel reservations – is restricted by the nuances of the company's role in the travel industry, said Chung.  ""We accept bitcoin on hotels only where we are a merchant of record. So for some of the hotels that we sell we are the merchant, meaning that you, as a customer are the one paying on our site directly when you are trying to book,"" she continued.  In these cases, Chung noted, it was possible to offer the bitcoin payment option to consumers because the payment was made directly to Expedia. For 'pay-later' hotels – where guests are expected to settle their bill at the venue – that's a different story.  ""Obviously at that point you are restricted to whatever the hotel can take. So if you try to pay with credit card we'll still take it as a deposit if you are a no-show, but in those cases we would not be able to offer bitcoin because the hotel is the one that's actually charging you.""  Here she suggested that the lack of overall understanding regarding bitcoin was again an inhibiting factor. ""If we give them a bitcoin payment, they don't know what to do with it, it's not a currency they understand.""  In terms of airline ticket purchases, Chung explained that Expedia acts as an agency, passing on payment information to the majority of airliners. Similarly to 'pay-later' hotels, in these cases, Expedia can only accept the payment types accepted by the airline.  Is this a problem native to the payments industry? Chung doesn't think so. It is, she said, a problem in the way that the suppliers are set up in the payments sector.  Frictionless payments  Aside from noting the growing interest in mobile payments, Chung placed special emphasis on frictionless payment methods.  ""We are going to get higher and higher uptake with whatever there is less friction in payments, people are going to move that way.""  Citing car-ride sharing service Uber – which has no checkout – and PayPal's One Touch service – which eradicates the need for the user to login every time they wish to make a payment – as examples, Chung noted how consumers are looking for easier options.  Although Chung said the payments space is already moving in the direction of frictionless payments, she suggested that security concerns could potentially hamper this progress. ""I think the payments space sometimes, you know, people are really afraid of security lapses.""  As for how bitcoin as a technology could grow to become a larger part of Expedia's operations, Chung was less specific in her responses, saying:  ""We are always actively looking at all different types of payment related implementations that we might have but [there's] nothing specifically in the works that I could report right now.""

42398525,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpph,1437590428,French Megabank Société Générale Seeks Bitcoin Expert,"One of France's biggest banks is looking to hire a developer with a focus on bitcoin.  Société Générale (SocGen) posted a job listinghttps://careers.societegenerale.com/job-offers/IT-Developer-on-Bitcoin--Blockchains---Crypto-Currencies-M-F---VIE-London-RQ00112083-fr?localeHidden=en_EN on 2nd July for an ""IT developer on bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies"". SocGen is the third-largest French bank in terms of assets, reporting $1.3tn in assets in 2014.  The 12-month contract, according to the post, would entail research and development involving cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Though no specifics were outlined, the post suggests that the bank is looking to develop in-house software, citing ""prototype programming"".  The listed responsibilities of the position include:  Developing proof-of-concept in any language/protocols used in cryptocurrency protocols and blockchains 1.0-3.0  Programming in C#/C++/Python/Other against bitcoin, altcoin, blockchain different altchain APIs  Running statistics against blockchains and engineering ways to gather quantitative information on what’s really happening in the cryptocurrency world.  The position also calls for the organization of internal reports, staff presentations and training programs. The VIE – a kind of international volunteer or internship role – will be tasked with ""engaging with the FinTech community and gathering information on the crypto-currency sector in London and elsewhere.""  SocGen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Research push  Assuming the bank can find the cryptocurrency developer it seeks, SocGen would become the latest bank to begin devoting resources to bitcoin and blockchain research.  SocGen stated in the post how the position is part of an effort to evolve in the face of technology-driven changes in the financial sector.  ""The type of position that is offered is at the forefront of SocGen’s attempt at anticipating sweeping changes in the banking sector caused by FinTech and adapt to it,"" it wrote.  The bank itself has been relatively quiet on the subject, though it made headlines in 2013 amid the financial crisis in Cyprus and a large-run up in the price of bitcoin after the island nation's banks received a bailout.  SocGen sent a note to investors after receiving numerous requests for information on the valuation of bitcoin. At the time, analyst Sebastien Galy suggested that the price of bitcoin – which had risen from roughly $13 at the start of 2013 to more than $130 by 1st April – was in the midst of an ""aggressive"" bubble.

42398517,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpio,1437583274,Blockchain Project Factom Raises $1.1 Million in Crowdsale,"Factom has received $1.1m in new funding as part of an equity crowdsale hosted by crowdfunding service BnkToTheFuture.  Billed as a data and record keeping layer for bitcoin, Factom had offered 7.8% equity toward a $700,000 minimum investment goal to be reached by 9:39am GMT today.  The project ultimately exceeded this goal, drawing 323 investors; each providing an average contribution of roughly $3,400.    Factom Foundation chairman David Johnston credited the positive perception of the company as a key factor in the raise, telling CoinDesk:      ""The community has been very supportive of Factom Inc and I believe people are encouraged to see recent in roads being made with large enterprise groups using the blockchain.""            Factom had raised 2,278 BTC (then roughly $540,000) through the public sale of factoids, the transaction token for the Factom network, earlier this year. Previously, it was bootstrapped through an undisclosed network of private investors.  In March, the Factom Foundation, the community body that overseas development of the Factom protocol, relocated to London. At the time, it credited its permissive attitude toward software sales as a key factor.  Growing interest  The funding comes on the heels of growing interest in the Factom project from state governments and financial institutions.  For example, Factom recently partnered with the government of Honduras on a land title initiative, and serves as an informal consultant to insurance giant USAA.    Alex Marquez, managing director of corporate development at USAA, explained the relationship to CoinDesk, stating:      ""Factom have given us insight and perspective on the technology, which has gone a long way toward informing the team at USAA that’s studying how blockchain might help us better serve our members.""            The raise follows the debut of the project's first release candidatehttp://blog.factom.org/post/124249017699/technical-update-release-candidate-one this week, a step in the product rollout that precedes its forthcoming beta client.

42398555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUq0W,1437575180,Bitcoin in the Docks: 7 Crypto Court Cases,"Bitcoin is back in the headlines again this week, but for all the wrong reasons. It surfaced yesterday that two operators of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx were being charged by US prosecutors for working without a money transmission license.  This is by no means the first time characters associated to bitcoin have had a brush with the law – the space has certainly witnessed more than its fair share of scams, hacks and deception.  With this in mind, let's take a trip down memory lane and remind ourselves of some of the more high-profile bitcoin-related court cases.  1. Charlie Shrem: bitcoin's 'first' felon  Back in August 2014, bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  The former CEO of bitcoin exchange BitInstant violated anti-money laundering duties in his dealings with Robert Faiella, who supplied $1m in digital currency to people buying drugs on the now defunct Silk Road marketplace.  As part of his plea, Shrem agreed to forfeit $950,000 to the US government.  Having been sentenced in December last year, Shrem is currently serving a two-year prison term in Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp, a minimum security prison in Pennsylvania.  2. Ross Ulbricht: life in prison  Perhaps one of the most familiar faces in the bitcoin space, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced in May to life in prison, without the right to parole, for operating Silk Road.  Ulbricht was found guilty on all charges – including trafficking of narcotics, trafficking on the Internet, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and computer hacking – on the first day of jury deliberations in February this year.  The ruling, considered harsh by some, sent shock waves across the world and is perceived as the benchmark case that will set precedents in cases on online crime and privacy.  3. Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges: Silk Road saga  Handed down by US District Judge Katherine Forrest in New York, Ulbricht's life-long sentence put an end to a year and a half-long saga which saw the emergence of various bitcoin auctions as well as the surprise indictment of two former federal agents involved with the Baltimore-based Silk Road investigation.  In a twist of events worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster, Carl Mark Force IV, a former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent admitted to stealing over $700,000 worth of bitcoin whilst working on the investigation. Force, the lead undercover agent, who communicated with Ulbricht, said he had used fake online personas to steal bitcoin from both the US government and the investigated parties.  US Secret Service special agent Shaun Bridges is also expected to plead guilty to charges of money laundering and wire fraud during his time investigating the online drugs bazaar. Court documents in March indicated Bridges had diverted $800,000 in digital currency to his personal bank accounts without receiving prior authorisation from law enforcement officials.  4. Mark Karpeles: the disgraced CEO  The disgraced CEO of the now defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox came under scrutiny after the exchange filed for bankruptcy following the loss of approximately 850,000 BTC (more than $450m at the time) in February last year.  Karpeles filed for bankruptcy in Japan that month and in the United States in March.  In April 2014, the former CEO was subpoenaed by the United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. However, Karpeles declined to appear to testify.  According to some media reports, Karpeles was allegedly found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in his native France in 2010. He was sentenced to a year in jail but has not yet served his sentence.  The CEO was also implicated in the Silk Road trial, after Ulbricht claimed Karpeles was ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" – the pseudonym used by the marketplace's mastermind. Karpeles denied the claims publicly.  5. Jed McCaleb: a legal battle  Jed McCaleb is currently involved in a legal battle over $1m in disputed funds.  In essence, the battle has seen Ripple Labs, its founder and ex-employee McCaleb and the Stellar Development Foundation – McCaleb's current employer – fight over $1,038,172 currently being held by digital currency exchange Bitstamp.  Both Ripple and Stellar have voiced their opinion on whether the court should grant Bitstamp's request to be discharged from the court case, after the exchange filed a complaint for interpleader on 1st April, where it requested permission from the court to transfer the funds to Stellar.  The argument put forward by Bitstamp is that it was unable to determine whether Ripple Labs or the defendant, Jacob Stephenson (McCaleb's cousin) was the rightful owner of the funds in dispute.  It is believed that Stephenson sold the XRP – the Ripple network's native currency – to Ripple through a sale on Bitstamp, an action that, according to Ripple, was done on McCaleb's behalf in violation of a settlement agreement.  6. GAW Miners: breach of contract charges  GAW Miners is facing non-payment and breach of contract charges following the filing of a suit by the Mississippi Power Company (MPC).  The company is requesting repayment of approximately $224,000 for services as well as almost $50,000 in installation costs.  Additionally, MPC is looking to collect a further $73,493.48 for breach of contract charges.  A couple of months after the filing was submitted, MPC requested a default judgement in its favour against GAW, citing the firm's unresponsiveness.  7. Bryan Micon: avoids prison  Having avoided a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Bryan Micon, who ran the now-defunct bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs, pleaded guilty to one count of operating an unlicensed gambling site in the state of Nevada.  Micon will have to pay a $25,000 fine and serve a probation term, the duration of which is yet to be determined.  Additionally, the former operator will have to forfeit property seized during a raid carried out at his home; including $900 cash, around 3 BTC and electronic equipment.

42398546,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUpxZ,1437558047,62% of People Say Bitcoin Will End 2015 Below $500,"Some 62% of bitcoin enthusiasts believe the digital currency's price will be less than $500 at the end of this year, according to the results of a CoinDesk poll.      The survey results show 1,682 of the 2,702 respondents predicted the price of bitcoin would end the year between $0 and $499.    The price predicted by the greatest number of respondents was $400, with 281 (10.4%) of people guessing this value. This was followed by $500 and $350, with 277 and 232 votes, respectively.  The most popular predictions can be seen in the table below:  PriceNumber of predictionsPercentage of total$3001485.5%$3502328.6%$40028110.4%$4501535.7%$50027710.3%  Of the respondents, 47 thought the price would fall to between $0 and $100 at the end of the year.  A total of 309 people predicted the price would drop below bitcoin's current value (at press time) of $279 at the end of the year. However, 2,393 felt the price would be higher than $279 on 31st December.      Bitcoin Price Predictions: $0-$1,000 | Create infographics    Some 262 of the report's respondents said they thought the price would be over $1,000 by the end of the year, with only 43 respondents predicting the price would reach more than $11,000.  These findings come in stark contrast to the results of last year's survey, which showed 56% of CoinDesk readers believed the price would reach $10,000 in 2014.    Bitcoin Price Predictions: $1,001-$11,000 | Create infographics    Price volatility  Bitcoin's volatility does not come as a surprise to bitcoin enthusiasts, who watched it spike beyond $1,000 in late 2013, drop in price throughout the following year and saw a further 40% decrease this January.  Despite its notorious instability, CoinDesk's latest State of Bitcoin report shows the cryptocurrency's price stabilised somewhat in the last quarter.  Price rationale  One survey respondent, who predicted a valuation of $180 by the end of 2015, claimed bitcoin's current value was unrealistic.  ""I think the price is still overvalued based on available and foreseeable use cases and the corresponding user base. In the next year, I think some of the pump and dump culprits will run out of money and a real correction will bring a further dip in the price below $120 with a slow resurgence from that point as the global user base grows organically,"" they said.  Economic instability, said another commentator, would help drive the digital currency's price as people looked to bitcoin for an alternative.  They explained: ""Contiuing global financial crisis will highlight advantages to the public, while innovation will make bitcoin easier to become involved.""  The responses to the poll proved that, generally speaking, bitcoin's followers were largely aware of the consequences that macro-economic changes could have on the digital currency's price.  Influence of the Greek crisis  Given the media's ongoing association between the digital currency's value and economic instability in Greece, it is hardly surprising that some aficionados also made the connection.  Some 22.57% of the survey respondents said their outlook on the digital currency's price had been influenced by Greece's economic crisis, which has seen citizens subjected to strict capital controls since 29th June.  When questioned, 39.87% of respondents admitted their opinion on bitcoin's price had been slightly influenced by the Greek crisis. However, 23.64% of those surveyed did not correlate the digital currency's recent price movements with events in the Southern European country.
