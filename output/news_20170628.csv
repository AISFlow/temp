42400098,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb3D,1498687272,Ether Rebounds As Price Rises Back Above $300,"The price of ether, the digital token that powers the ethereum blockchain, rebounded above $300 today.  The cryptocurrency rose to as much as $329.43 during the session, up roughly 12.4% from the day's opening, an increase of more than 20% in the last 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.  After experiencing a sharp rally that pushed it to nearly $415 around mid-June, the price of ether suffered a correction of sorts, causing the alternative asset protocol to fall below $300 on 26th June.  As for what caused ether to experience its recent upswing, analysts provided mixed responses. Some market observers, for example, Redwood City Ventures investor Sean Walsh, stated that ether's rise was merely a natural response to the recent correction in cryptocurrencies.  ""The recent ether sell-off was a little drastic, so there's undoubtedly a reversion-to-mean scenario playing out here,"" he said.  Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Fund, offered similar input, stating that ether prices rose in response to the short-lived pullback that cryptographic tokens underwent during recent sessions.

The carmaker announced the completed test today, working alongside Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), Germany's largest state-backed wholesale banks group, to create a testbed for issuing the one-year corporate bond known as a Schuldschein.  The test also included a trio of savings banks based in Esslingen-Nürtingen, Ludwigsburg and Ostalb, respectively, who along with LBBW simulated lenders within the prototype system.  According to Daimler, the entire transaction cycle – from origination, distribution, allocation and execution of the loan agreement, to the confirmation of repayment and of interest payments – was automated digitally through the blockchain network. Lending technical support were the IT subsidiaries of Daimler and LBBW, which also adopted the blockchain's cryptographic signature to prevent manipulation of transactions.  Daimler and LBBW are now looking at other applications, including the issuance of syndicated loans by way of a distributed ledger.  The test comes months after Daimler linked up with the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project. As CoinDesk reported in February, the automaker joined the initiative as part of a broader bid to explore possible uses.  ""We see blockchain as a promising technology, not fully mature yet, but continuously growing. Now is the right time to get into it, build up knowledge and form a network of like-minded people to share experiences,"" Jan Brecht, Daimler's CIO, said at the time.

42400101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb79,1498674656,Europe's Second Largest Port Launches Blockchain Logistics Pilot,"The second largest port in Europe by container capacity is now running a pilot blockchain project focused on logistics automation.  Belgium-based Port of Antwerp has announced that it is looking to use the tech to automate and streamline the terminal's container logistics operations. The test is being conducted in conjunction with a blockchain startup called T-Mining.  The goal, port authorities said in a new release, is to speed up the interactions between port customers to prevent the malicious manipulation of data.  According to the terminal authority, moving containers from point to point often involves more than 30 different parties, including carriers, terminals, forwarders, haulers, drivers, shippers and more. This process results in hundreds of interactions between those parties, conducted through a mix of e-mail, phone and fax.  ""The paperwork accounts for up to half of the cost of container transport,"" the authority noted.  The trial is the latest to center around shipping logistics and involve a notable player in the global terminal industry.  According to data from the World Shipping Council, the Port of Antwerp ranked fourteenth globally among container ports by terminal capacity in 2015. It's also the second largest in Europe after Rotterdam, which has been testing blockchain for logistical purposes as well.  And as CoinDesk reported earlier this year, Danish shipping giant Maersk completed its first live blockchain trial designed to simplify the shipping of trillions of dollars of goods around the world – signaling that it's not just the ports themselves that want to integrate blockchain into the shipping process.

42400140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb97,1498669191,Pantera Capital to Raise $100 Million in Investment for ICO Hedge Fund,"The $600m market for initial coin offerings may soon be set to expand.  Announced today, investment firm Pantera Capital is launching a new hedge fund focused on investments solely in tokens that power public blockchain protocols.  Called Pantera ICO Fund LP, the fund intends to raise $100m, with $35m already raised in support from the firm's existing investor base, undisclosed new investors, and according to the company, unnamed venture capital firms. The new fund will complement Pantera Bitcoin Partners, a joint investment fund launched by Pantera, Fortress, Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital in early 2014 to invest in the cryptocurrency.  In interview, Pantera's leadership team framed the fund as an extension of its past investments, which have included traditional investments in startups that have sought to incentivize distributed networks through the use of tokens. Included in the Pantera portfolio are Ripple and the Zcash Electric Coin Company, which use the XRP and ZEC tokens, respectively.  Pantera CEO Dan Morehead and Augur co-founder Joey Krug will serve as chief investment officers for the fund. With the move, Krug is also joining Pantera full-time.  The fund is currently open only to US institutions and individuals, though it intends to eventually open up support to non-US participants.  As explained by Paul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital, the fund creation was sparked by the recent rapid uptick in interest in tokens and protocols. According to CoinDesk data, funding for ICOs has already surpassed traditional venture capital banking in 2017.  The mechanism has gone so far as to attract mainstream brands, with messenger service Kik announcing it would soon test a network token.  ""Six months ago, ICOs were a few million dollars,"" Morehead told CoinDesk. Even ethereum's crowdsale was only $18m. I think, with Kik, we're at a watershed moment, a company with millions of active users is transitioning to open source.""  However, Pantera's investment strategy will be more nuanced than simply working with major brands that may be interested in the concept.  According to Krug, the fund will primarily seek to fund new protocols, ones which they believe will use cryptographically unique data in a way that's integral to their operations.  ""If you look at the tokens, they fall into two categories. Rent-seeking tokens, where you can remove the token and the network will be better off, and non-rent seeking tokens, where you remove the token and it doesn't work,"" he said, adding:  ""The latter have the strongest chance of generating longer value.""  Market strategy  In interview, Pantera further opened up about how it would seek to inject its capital in the market, comments that shed light on how its movements could impact the day-to-day holdings of retail investors who may also be seeking exposure to crypto assets.  In this way, Morehead said that the market shouldn't expect Pantera to be frequently entering and exiting deals, though he said the fund would take steps to preserve its profitability and maximize opportunity if warranted.  ""We're going to make relative value judgements. If the token has reached a fair value and there's a new token that's inexpensive, we would trade,"" he said. ""But, we're investing in tokens, we're not making markets.""  Krug also explained a bit about how it will seek to make technical evaluations on the prospects of various projects, evaluating the technical foundations of the designs of proposed protocols, as well as the strength of the team.  It's worth noting that investing in ICOs is still an inexact science, as, owing to the difficulty of changing blockchain infrastructure protocols, its unknown whether pivoting will be as easy for entrepreneurs building on top of the tech.  That's where Pantera is hoping Krug's experience will pay dividends.  Augur raised $5.3m in an ICO for its ethereum-based prediction market platform in 2015 through the sale of tokens that power its reputation system. Today, its network is valued at $305m, with tokens trading for $27 at press time, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  'Bubble' talk  Also discussed was the rapid escalation in value observed in the total cryptocurrency market, which surpassed $100bn earlier this year, up from $18bn on 1st January, and the effect of what some have called a ""bubble"" forming in the market.  Still, Krug sought to take a more long-term view, asserting that despite short-term fluctuations, he's confident that the ICO process will emerge as a compelling way to fund protocol development, one that will continue to interest investors and entrepreneurs.  ""In the long term, we're at the very beginning,"" he remarked.  Likewise, Morehead said that, as with its bitcoin fund, the ICO fund is likely to see ups and downs. Overall, he focused on the fact that the funds would expand Pantera's investment capabilities while helping to fund and fuel growth in the market.  Krug concluded:  ""Hopefully, this will see through corrections.""

42400092,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzazH,1498663817,CFTC Chief Asks Congress for More Money to Oversee Blockchain,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cited the advance of technologies like blockchain in a request to obtain additional funding for oversight activities.  Testimony  from acting CFTC chairman J Christopher Giancarlo reveals that the agency – which oversees the sale and trade of commodity derivatives in the US – wants an additional $31.5m in funding (for a total of $281.5m for fiscal year 2018) to help support its market surveillance work in an era of rapid technological change. Giancarlo's request was sent to the US Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.  Among those technologies is blockchain, about which Giancarlo has struck a broadly optimistic note in the past. In a CoinDesk op-ed from December, he wrote that he believes ""in its promising benefits for the financial marketplace and financial regulators"".  That said, according to his testimony, the tech is likely to create new issues for regulators.  Giancarlo told the subcommittee:  ""Other breaking digital innovations present equal regulatory challenges....[like] distributed ledger technology, more commonly known as blockchain, that will challenge orthodoxies that are foundational to today’s financial market infrastructure.""  The CFTC isn't the only agency pointing to the impact of blockchain as part of its requests for federal funding.

42400096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzb4C,1498661105,Blockchain Startup ChromaWay to Launch 'Hybrid Database' Product,"Swedish blockchain startup ChromaWay has announced a new distributed database product called Postchain.  Revealed today at the Money2020 Europe in Copenhagen, ChromaWay positioned the new technology as one that would combine the benefits of an SQL database, while adding elements of blockchain technology.  While that may sound antithetical to its past blockchain work, ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte instead framed the product as one that was perhaps more in line with the needs of enterprise companies.  ""We can do the implementation directly in your database, but you get the same security properties as a federated blockchain. Postchain is one implementation of that idea,"" Hjelte said.  A benefit, according to the CEO, is that Postchain works with established enterprise database systems like Oracle and Microsoft, or open-source databases like PostgreSQL, he said.  Hjelte told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain is often described as a database, but when you look at it, it's not really suitable for storing and retrieving data in the same way a relational database is. Blockchain, the core idea is a linked list of transactions, but a database is designed to have certain properties for managing information over a long time.”  The idea for the Postchain product came from previous ChromaWay projects in which the team was attempting to speed up the transaction capacity of its designs in line with the demands of corporate users.  Already ChromaWay’s customers, including a media sector consortium, are currently trying out Postchain, Hjelte said. It will further serve as the back-end for smart contracts on the company’s project with the Swedish land registry, which records property transaction deals.  ""You’ll have a secure replication of data between databases, so every node that is participating in a consortium will have the same copy of the database,"" explained Hjelte.  The source code for the project will be released later this summer, according to the firm.

42400083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzarP,1498657842,Bitcoin Legal Experts: nChain SegWit Criticisms Are Flawed,"An effort by stealth bitcoin startup nChain to raise awareness of supposed issues with code that would boost the capacity of the distributed payments network is coming under fire.  Following its publication yesterday, legal experts raised concerns about a view put forward in a CoinDesk opinion article by nChain legal officer Jimmy Nguyen that asserted the upgrade, called Segregated Witness, could face problems under US electronic signature law if activated on the network.  Nguyen's criticisms fly in the face of what has emerged as broad support for the network optimization, which has been largely embraced by the network's developers, miners and startups as a pragmatic step forward, though the specifics on how it should be enacted vary.  Analysts went so far as to question the motives of the commentary, suggesting that they showed a lack of understanding about how the bitcoin protocol functions today, as well as the functionality it is intended to provide.  Chief among the critics were lawyers versed on the intricacies of blockchain law in the US.  Marco Santori, a fintech lawyer who leads the blockchain tech team at Cooley LLP, for example, took issue with what he argued was the confused framing of the allegation.  Santori told CoinDesk:  ""It took the concept of what is a legal contract, and took the position that if you have a blockchain signature it has something to do with a legal contract.""  Stephen Palley, counsel at Washington, DC, law firm Anderson Kill, remarked similarly that the argument perhaps put too much weight on the idea that the ""signatures"" involved in executing transactions on the bitcoin blockchain were or should be equivalent to signatures used in digital documents.  ""It elides the distinction between signature and witness data and a digital signature, and they're two different things,"" Palley said.  The comments come at a time when nChain is beginning to open up about its larger strategy after raising what it claims (but has yet to prove) is the most funding ever for an industry startup. nChain was sold to private investors in April, and is allegedly staffing up in advance of the launch of an alternative bitcoin software implementation, a move that would find it competing with Bitcoin Core's established software.  Adding to the narrative is that nChain employs controversial developer Craig Wright, an Australian native who once claimed to be bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto only to retract that claim amid scrutiny. He has not since provided proof to satisfy the claim.  Technological underpinnings  One of the core critiques of the piece, however, pertains to its understanding of how the network would handle ""witness data"", or the cryptography that proves unspent bitcoins are able to be sent to another party.  At issue is that under Segregated Witness, nodes running this version of the software would send transactions and blocks in a new format, meaning transactions would be cryptographically linked differently than they are today. One merkle tree would be used to record the data, while another would include data and a signature. Nodes receiving blocks in the older format, by not upgrading to Segregated Witness, would not receive the witness data.  But even without receiving this data, technologists argue users would still be able to prove that the transactions were confirmed, and that they contained the correct signatures, if desired. Should they require it for business reasons, the argument is that not running a SegWit-enabled node would be impractical.  Even assuming the argument that digital signatures need to be stored by the network itself to prove the legal validity of the transfer, technologists argued this could be satisfied by other means – namely, the proper storage of this data by the companies involved.  ""There are other ways to cryptographically prove a transaction is correctly signed other than having a full node,"" said BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp. ""The assumption that if a transaction is in the blockchain, it's probably valid, is a fairly good guarantee.""  Legal experts asserted that, because of this design, it's possible to prove that the transaction occurred between parties, even if those involved did not store signatures.  For this reason, Coin Center director Jerry Brito argued that nChain is overstating the issues that would arise from the absence of this data.  ""If you have one-time proof that you have the bitcoin, if you don't have it and I have it, logically it was signed over to me. As long as somebody in the world keeps the signature data and it's accessible, it's fine,"" he said.  Florida lawyer Drew Hinkes went so far as to call the argument ""sound and fury"" that would have limited impact on the network, even if bitcoin transactions were applied to contracts.  ""If the transaction made it on the blockchain, didn't it already have provably correct enforceable signatures that the two transacting parties can both keep?"" he asked.  Question of intent  In remarks on Twitter, bitcoin legal specialist Patrick Murck expanded on the argument, honing in on nChain's claims this would be a problem perhaps only in instances where parties used the bitcoin blockchain as a way to establish legal contracts.  The nChain article states: ""Years later, if you want to prove that you signed (or did not sign) a specific contract, you could find the signature block identifier, but you may not able to retrieve the physical signature block itself.""  Here, Murck argued that, discounting the technical reasoning, the claim conflates bitcoin's signatures with the legal intent to execute a contract, which he argued isn't true.  Santori went on to suggest that the technological change wouldn't have any impact on startups seeking to use the blockchain to prove that something occurred for this reason.  ""E-sign law is talking about human assent to particular contractual terms. Just because cryptographers call this a signature, doesn't mean it's an assent to terms,"" he said.  Lawyers queried also stressed that just because the word ""signature"" is used to define this process, that shouldn't mean it is captured under related law. As such, they pointed to a larger problem in the blockchain industry in which newcomers may equate the words used to express a concept incorrectly with other ideas.  ""Calling something signature data, and assuming because it's signature data, it's a legal signature,"" Palley said. ""That may be the logical flaw here.""  Representatives for nChain in response indicated that they ""stand by"" the article and welcome the debate that it has created.  ""[We feel] this opinion piece is reasonable and it certainly does not misconstrue the law in any way,"" the company said, though it declined further engagement.

42400085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzatN,1498653002,New York Preschools Accept Bitcoin and Ether for Tuition Payments,"Two private preschools in New York City now accept bitcoin and two other cryptocurrencies for tuition payments, according to their co-founder.  Montessori Schools, based in the Flatiron and SoHo neighborhoods of Manhattan, began accepting bitcoin, ether and litecoin in June. Payments are accepted by way of an integration with digital currency startup Coinbase, which automatically converts the crypto payments to US dollars.  The preschools ascribe to the Montessori philosophy of education, an approach to learning developed in the early 20th century by Maria Montessori. According to online materials, tuition at the schools can run as high as $30,950 per annum – worth roughly 12.3 BTC at current prices.  Marco Ciocco, co-founder and chairman of the schools, told CoinDesk that the move to accept digital currencies for tuition payments began more than a year ago, following requests from parents. As more requests came in, Ciocco said, school officials started to seriously weigh how it could work.  He went on to explain:  ""Parents who were early adopters are now able to take advantage of the appreciation of their digital assets and use them to pay for their children’s education – something that will ultimately have a lifetime impact on their families.""  Ciocco, who said that he had personally been following the cryptocurrency space for the past several years, added that ""many"" parents had begun to utilize the payment option – a trend he expects to continue as time goes on.  ""As a forward-thinking administration, we like to stay ahead of the curve and would not be surprised if the percentage of tuition paid in digital currencies continues to grow every year and becomes a substantial portion of our payments,"" Ciocco told CoinDesk.

42400090,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzayI,1498649404,Silicon Valley Accelerator 500 Startups Isn't Backing ICOs – Yet,"Long known for backing exciting early-stage investments, the absence of 500 Startups from the nascent market for blockchain-based initial coin offerings (ICOs) is notable.  An early investor in bitcoin entrepreneurs, 500 Startups backed both ChangeCoin, which was acquired by Airbnb, and Gyft, which later sold to First Data. Yet, even as investors that frequently back similar startups – including Union Square Ventures, Boost VC and DFJ founder Tim Draper – embrace the new investment vehicle, 500 Startups has been on the sidelines.  But it's not for lack of interest that the venture fund and accelerator has so far side-stepped ICOs.  According to the company's newest fintech investor, Mike Sigal, not only is 500 Startups interested in ways to let retail investors back projects by buying digital tokens, he's even open to the idea of his own portfolio companies supplementing their cash flow by leveraging blockchain.  Still, it's Sigal's accountability to investors that he said is keeping him from participating in an ICO.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk at the Exponential Finance conference earlier this month, Sigal explained his hesitation:  ""The idea of an ICO potentially changes the representations that I've made to my own investors. So, I am limited in some ways – and we've not really investigated it yet – but I'm limited in what I can invest in because I'm a custodian of other people’s money.""  Since launching in 2010, 500 Startups has raised roughly $350m in funds from investors – capital it mostly invests in $150,000 seed rounds in cutting-edge technology startups in exchange for a 6% stake.  Each of the investors in a 500 Startups funds receives a prospectus from the venture capital firm, one that details what kinds of returns might be expected based on historic patterns and forecasts when private stocks might become liquid.  By contrast, Sigal, who was hired last year after helping launch interbank payment platform Swift's startup incubator, said many of even the most successful ICOs haven't achieved a product market fit, or even clearly identified what they will be selling or who are their customers.  ""I feel sorry for those investors,"" he said, adding that, without that certainty, its more than just investors that could be harmed.  Sigal explained:  ""I don’t know what impact on my investors, and my own compliance investing in ICOs would have.""  Alternative option  But that doesn't mean the 500 Startups portfolio companies are going to sit and wait while others are making millions of dollars through the funding method – and Sigal it just fine with that.  For now, the potential for founders to easily fill out an investment round without diluting seed investment stakes is just too great to resist, he said.  And with over 2,000 companies in the 500 Startups portfolio, Sigal said it is nearly impossible to know for sure how many might be planning an ICO or preparing to release a token that incentivizes their network.  However, based on information provided by the firm, CoinDesk was able to independently confirm that at least one 500 Startups investment company is in the early stages of an ICO launch later this year.  ""Should my companies use it after I invest as a way to make their lives easier, to reward their customers in different ways, I'm fascinated,"" said Sigal.  Watching and waiting  If 500 Startups starts were to make the move into ICOs, it would be a significant shift in the industry for another reason: it's been a while since 500 Startups put its money into a blockchain business.  In addition to the firm's two previously mentioned exits, Gyft and ChangeCoin, 500 Startups was an early investor in the now defunct bitcoin lending platform, BTCJam. Blockchain enterprise platform Chain is the only notable industry startup still on the 500 Startup portfolio. (CoinDesk was also an early portfolio entry before its sale to Digital Currency Group in 2015.)  However, Sigal acknowledges that he's a relatively new investor in the space, and that he is curious to learn how other venture capital firms who have backed ICOs represent the investment to their fund owners, among other regulatory considerations.  ""You've seen at 500 Startups, we have a very diversified approach. We like to experiment,"" he said, concluding:  ""So if there's a way we can do it, I imagine we'll end up doing something. I just don't know how yet.""

As a next step, the four banks expect to work with R3 to move the project toward possible production, though not before absorbing industry expertise from software vendors and short-term debt issuers, and seeking feedback from regulatory bodies.

42400086,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzauM,1498640414,"'End Poverty, Restore Trust': World Bank Dives into Blockchain with Lab Launch","The world's largest multilateral development bank is launching a blockchain lab as part of a bid to pilot projects that can improve governance and social outcomes in the developing world.  The World Bank, based in Washington, DC, officially launched the venue Tuesday morning to serve as a forum for learning, experimentation and collaboration on distributed ledger technology. The blockchain lab will now seek to bring together internal and external participants to work on blockchain use cases of significance to the bank's more than 80 client countries.  Core focus areas will include land registry, digital identity, aid distribution and financial infrastructure.  Trust and poverty  At the event launch, Denis Robitaille, vice president and chief information officer of the World Bank's technology division, said that the lab's objective is to explore and build with its non-profit and technology partners, and to produce proofs-of-concept that can then be rolled out in the field.  The lab will focus on empowering the bank to be a thought leader in the space as more countries explore blockchain solutions. It has been set out to do this through facilitating greater understanding of the technology itself, as well as its accompanying security, legal and policy implications.  These pillars, bank officials emphasized, are critical to the World Bank's mission of eliminating extreme poverty and raising living standards worldwide.  The institution is also viewing blockchain as a potential vehicle for building and restoring trust in institutions, which has fallen precipitously around the world in recent years. New research by Edelman recently found that only 15% of people trust the systems in their countries to work for them, and that trust across every sector declined for the first time ever in 2016.  Sebastian Molineus, director of the World Bank's finance and markets global practice, argued that blockchain's true potential is not just in individual use cases, such as payment facilitation, but in rewiring the entire financial infrastructure of developing countries.  Molineus told the audience:  ""This is not just a fad or something that people are talking about in the abstract, it is something that is real and something that will trickle into our development work.""  Project origins  According to Molineus, the impetus for the lab was organic demand among bank staff, client countries and stakeholders, as well as the rapid exploration of DLT by other multilateral institutions like the United Nations.  ""One of the surprises was how often private sector banking clients are asking for more information, more guidance and more 'mind partners' as they think about how to deploy this technology in their areas,"" said Susan Starnes, head of supply, trade and supply chain solutions at the International Finance Corporation, a division of the World Bank.  Bank officials also emphasized that they believe there is ample potential in using the technology to improve transparency and streamline procedures within the institution itself.  ""What really struck me is that we can actually now track every single dollar that our development partners are giving to members,"" said Molineus.  He went on to emphasize that such increased efficiency and transparency in project lending could dramatically improve project outcomes.  Arunma Oteh, the bank's vice president and treasurer, said that using blockchain as a structured finance vehicle could allow the bank to issue debt and raise funds more cheaply on capital markets, and therefore enable it to issue project loans to developing countries at lower rates.  Understanding the risks  However, the bank is also keen to understand the potential challenges and pitfalls associated with blockchain.  Randeep Sudan, a digital strategy and government analytics advisor at the World Bank, called for a tempered approach to blockchain, stating that the potential benefits must be embraced with an accurate grasp of the risks.  He remarked that environmental and energy consumption issues must be considered, particular as the World Bank is highly sensitive to climate change and environmental aspects.  Sudan noted, for example, the electricity use that bitcoin mining, the process by which the protocol verifies transactions and rewards participants, requires, stating:  ""These are hugely energy intensive efforts. Obviously, one would have to think about the implications as far as energy consumption as we pursue this technology.""  Sudan also pointed to other concerns, such as the consumer's ""right to be forgotten"", which has been legislated in the European Union, and the potential development of quantum computing in the future that could break modern cryptography.  Starnes emphasized that the technology must be accompanied by proper understanding, training and value systems for its full potential as a development tool to be realized  She said:  ""What we recognize is that whenever there is a new technology or process or development, whether it's small or large, is that the success of those individual systems and innovations are primarily dependent on the human processes that accompanies them.""

42400084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzasO,1498639138,World Economic Forum Publishes Blockchain Governance Taxonomy,"The World Economic Forum has published a detailed white paper arguing that blockchain stakeholders should organize in a way that would dwarf even the largest consortia.  Released today, ""Realizing the Potential of Blockchain"" proposes that a new distributed network of ""ecosystems"" should emerge to maximize the impact of the distributed ledger technology across three areas: a blockchain platform layer, an application layer and an overall ecosystem layer, where participants analyze legal structures and regulation from a scientific and business perspective.  Among those who have already publicly expressed interest in the concept are the founder of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Jeremy Millar; the executive director of Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation, Brian Behlendorf; the founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Perianne Boring; and Jamie Smith, chief communications officer at Bitfury Group.  Released in coordination with the beginning of the World Economic Forum’s annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian, China, the paper argues for the creation of a network that would include innovators, venture capitalists, financial institutions, academics, government agencies and individuals.  Wary of several skeptics who have previously argued against large-scale efforts, authors Don and Alex Tapscott focus on creating a taxonomy for how such a system would function, while proposing that such structures might arise organically once a structure is established.  In the preface to the white paper, the head of the World Economic Forum's Center for the Global Agenda, Richard Samans, described the impact such large-scale coordination could play on the impact of blockchain.  Samans told CoinDesk:  ""The extent to which this new technology realizes its potential will depend in substantial part upon how well stakeholders steward its development. There remain important open governance questions regarding both the functioning of the technology and its current and potential applications.""  The report was submitted by the non-profit Blockchain Research Institute, founded by Don and Alex Tapscott, with feedback provided by the recently launched World Economic Forum Global Future Council on the Future of Blockchain.  Central to the 46-page document is the concept of what its authors call ""stewardship"" of the blockchain technology, or the idea that various stakeholders have a responsibility to ensure benefits of the technology accrue to more than just individual projects, but to ""citizens"" of the world.  Instead of viewing the proposed multi-stakeholder infrastructure as a competitor to the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, founder Jeremy Millar said that such large-scale coordination aligns with the spirit of his own organization.  He remarked:  ""Governance is critical to accelerate mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, and the work of the World Economic Forum, along with Don and Alex, is a most welcomed.""  Anticipating challenges  The report kicks off with an analysis of lessons gleaned from the early days of the internet and interviews with several prominent blockchain innovators.  What follows is a breakdown of each of the three ecosystems proposed in the introduction: an ecosystem of platforms (including bitcoin, ethereum, Hyperledger and more); an ecosystem of applications built on those platforms; and the bigger-picture look at the ""overall"" blockchain ecosystem.  The ecosystem of platforms is then divided into the actual technology that comprises each system, and technologies such as those provided by Hyperledger and Cosmos that seek to facilitate interoperability of each blockchain solution.  Amidst a detailed analysis of scaling problems facing the platforms and difficulties maintaining incentives for ""mass collaboration"", the report's authors warn that inadequate governance could result in ""invisible powers"" emerging to exercise influence that poses a potential security threat, and goes against the interests of the overall network participants.  ""Such an immature technology would be susceptible to capacity problems, system failures, unanticipated bugs and, perhaps most damaging, the huge disappointment of technically unsophisticated users, none of which it needs at the moment,"" the authors write.  The parallel network of applications proposed in the WEF paper deals with how various parties interact with the blockchain. On the surface, the network of applications appears to be about how those tools interact with their respective blockchain platforms. But in reality, this section is about how regulators and users interact with the applications.  Citing examples such as distributed computer processing startup, Iconomi, built on ethereum; distributed internet application MaidSafe, built on Omni; and blockchain-as-a service startup Ardor, built on NXT, the report argues that unfamiliarity with the way the technology works is restricting the potential growth of each technology.  From a regulatory perspective, the biggest challenge that could potentially be overcome by a more concerted effort is uncertainty about who might oversee initial coin offerings (ICOs), whose ""off-chain equivalents"" could end up being regulated, the paper argues. From a customer perspective, a lack of user-friendly interfaces for the non-coding community could result in the creation of systems that leave some of the potential applications of blockchain unfulfilled.  ""Our research indicated that there's much work to be done in basic user interface and experience,"" the authors wrote. ""Many of these apps are inaccessible to the average person.""  Bigger picture  A third ecosystem proposed in the paper would interact with the platform ecosystem and the application ecosystem in a different way.  Based largely on comments made by National Center of Scientific Research researcher, Primavera De Filippi, and her co-author of a forthcoming book about blockchain by the Harvard University Press, Cardozo Law School Professor Aaron Wright, the white paper concludes that new methods are needed for governance that substitute software for centralized decision-making.  Focusing largely on how consensus is made regarding regulation and scientific research, the paper argues this third network of stakeholders should be designed in part to prevent ""powerful incumbents"" from exercising disproportionate influence over the direction the stakeholders as a whole are able to proceed.  To guide the interaction of these three networks building with blockchain, the report's authors advocate for the implementation of a ""framework"" of seven groups based on the Tapscotts' Global Solutions Network.  Specifically, they call for the creation of a standards network, an institutional network, an advocacy network, a watchdog network, a policy network, a knowledge network and a delivery network.  The report concludes:  ""We believe people, institutions and industries throughout the world need blockchain technology, and we must do all we can to make it available. Here is a set of actions that will move this technology forward. Our hope is that these will prompt discussion and provide positive steps that could be taken.""
