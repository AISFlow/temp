This continued accumulation as well as trading in a very tight range could mean a very significant breakout when it finally happens and one crypto analyst has predicted an incredible surge along these lines. Cardano Could See A 16,500% Surge Tim Warren, one of the hosts of the Investing Broz show on Discord, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a rather bullish Cardano chart. In the chart, Warren points out Cardano’s previous price performance which has been nothing short of phenomenal. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Addresses Continue To Fall, What Does This Mean For ADA Price? As the chart shows, the ADA price had fallen around 98% from its prior all-time high which it had hit in 2018. By 2020, ADA’s price was sitting as low as $0.018, but the imminent turnaround would take the entire market by surprise. ADA would go on to rally a total of 16,500% by the time it hit its new all-time high of $3.10 in 2021. Chart shows 16,500% ADA rally | Source: X Applying this historical performance to the current price level of ADA could suggest another such rally. Cardano’s price is currently sitting around 92% below its all-time high, which puts it close to the same level it was back in 2020. If ADA sticks to this historical performance and does a repeat, a 16,500% surge from the current price level would put the digital asset’s price at $40 at its peak. ADA continues to trade in a tight range | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com The Value Proposition Of ADA Responding to Warren’s post, another X user, Chris O chimes in with the value proposition of the digital asset. Chris, who is the founder of Ghost Fund DAO, a protocol on Cardano, explained that ADA’s previous 16,500% surge had happened without having support for smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), among others. But now that the network supports this, the founder believes this could trigger a large rise. Chris points to the presence of DeFi, a rising Total Value Locked (TVL), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and sidechains which are now prominent on the network. He also points out the various protocols which have been launched on the network across these different sectors. #Cardano fam, simple chart showing FUTURE opportunity.

The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF could increase the price of Bitcoin in the near term by bringing in demand from investors who find owning Bitcoin directly cumbersome. However, I believe that Bitcoin is a negative sum game and the introduction of an ETF will only increase the negative, as investors will suffer a constant cash drain without any cashflows from Bitcoin itself. It is looking increasingly likely that there will be some sort of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Spot ETF in the near future. Brief account of events In late August, Grayscale ( OTC:GBTC ) won a court ruling over the SEC’s block of its launch of a BTC spot ETF. On Friday, October 13 th it was revealed that the SEC is not appealing which allowed Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to move forward with its application for an ETF. It also potentially paves the way for other companies to make Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin’s price has risen materially as the news came out. The spike on the 16 th is likely related to the late Friday news release. SA Crypto enthusiasts are excited about the prospect because they think it will increase the price of Bitcoin. There is a clear mechanism by which it could increase the price: The ease of trading an ETF could bring in demand from those who find owning Bitcoin directly to be too cumbersome. Note, however, that this does not actually improve the value of Bitcoin, it merely has the potential to increase the price in the near term. While it is possible there are some flip trading profits to be had here, I think it will overwhelmingly be a bad investment and people will lose more money on it overall than they will make. In my opinion, Bitcoin is a clear negative sum game and the introduction of ETFs further increases the negative. Negative sum game Those familiar with economics or its sub discipline game theory will be familiar with the term “zero sum game.” It refers to any sort of closed system in which the winnings to some equal the losses to others. Think of your standard kitchen table game of poker. The winner of a given hand gains chips equal to the chips lost by other players in that hand. Bitcoin is more like poker played in a casino with a rake. The money won by the winner equals the money lost by other players but then the croupier takes their rake. It is still zero sum, but with outflows which makes it negative sum. The rake for Bitcoin comes in the form of trading commissions, margin interest expense for accounts that hold it on margin, payment for order flow, and any other frictions involved in trading and or owning BTC in whatever form it is owned. What is paying for LeBron James crypto ads at the Super Bowl or 30 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust commercials a day on CNBC? That is the rake. It is possible for some professional gamblers to individually make a profit playing in casinos with a rake so long as the differential in their skills to the rest of the table is greater than the magnitude of the rake. The best player will on average make X while the others at the table will lose X. If X is greater than the rake, the pro makes money on average. Perhaps Bitcoin is similar. Extremely good traders may be able to make a profit by timing it vastly better than the other traders. If they are better traders by enough margin, perhaps they can overcome the Bitcoin rake. That is not a sustainable source of profit. It works great during popularity surges in which tons of less experienced traders are pouring in, but it does not work once those guys lose their money and exit the game. Eventually it will only be sharks left at the table and no matter how good they are at cards or trading Bitcoin it will not be enough to overcome the rake because the others they are trading against are now equally as good. I believe that BTC is a money losing negative sum game and the rake is only made bigger by the introduction of an ETF. ETFs adding to Rake Functionally, what an index or commodity tracking ETF does is it layers on a fee in exchange for removing some of the difficulty of buying the assets by other means. If we look at a broader market ETF like the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) you can see an expense ratio highlighted in yellow below. SA Investors are paying 0.09% annually to own the ETF. As compensation for this fee, the investors are getting to trade hundreds of stocks with a single click rather than having to track each constituent of the index down individually and manually enter the proportional amount they want to buy. It is functionally a convenience fee. To see how this relates to Bitcoin, it behooves us to dig a bit deeper. Specifically, what determines how large the fee is and where the money is coming from. Size of fee There are significant expenses involved in running an ETF. Compliance alone is quite costly so there is a minimum revenue for the ETF to be viable. Most of the costs are fixed in nature with almost no variable expenses – meaning that increasing AUM does not incur much additional cost. Thus, the larger an ETF, the lower the percentage fee it can charge. SPY is among the biggest and also among the cheapest at a 9 basis point expense ratio. Source of fee The fee is of course paid by the investor. In the case of SPY, the fee can be covered by the dividends the investor receives. SPY pays a 1.49% dividend so the 9 basis point fee is well covered for the investor and they can still net cashflow. The dividend itself is covered by the cashflows of the underlying securities. These stocks have positive earnings and pay a portion of those earnings out as dividends. Bitcoin ETF fee and source of fee If we look at these same concepts with regard to the potential Bitcoin ETF, some problems appear. The Bitcoin ETF will almost certainly be smaller than SPY. SPY has AUM of $402B which is a tiny fraction of the market caps of the underlying securities. Bitcoin as a whole has a market cap of $552B. Even a wildly successful Bitcoin ETF would have just a fraction of the market cap. Thus, it will be much smaller than SPY and therefore will have to charge significantly more than 9 basis points. Smaller ETFs tend to charge between 40 and 100 basis points. So it will be more expensive and where is that money coming from? Once again, the fee will be paid by the investor. However, in this case, there is no dividend stream to cover it. Bitcoin pays zero dividend and it can’t pay more than 0 dividend because it has no cashflows. Thus, in holding a Bitcoin ETF an investor will suffer a constant cash drain. How long can one endure a cash drain when they are not getting any sort of cashflows? I’m sure it will vary by the individual, but it certainly doesn’t seem like something one would want to buy and hold forever. Why Bitcoin Investors are so excited by the prospect of an ETF Open ended ETFs are terrible traders. They buy securities when AUM inflows and sell securities when AUM outflows. That is just their mechanical nature. AUM inflows tend to happen after the underlying stocks rise. The market gets excited about a particular sector because it has performed well so it pours money into the related ETFs. Similarly, when a sector crashes, ETFs experience significant outflows. Since the ETF’s job is to buy the targeted securities on behalf of its investors, it doesn’t really have a choice in the timing. It has to buy or sell according to flows. The result is buy-high and sell-low. Bitcoin traders are salivating at the concept of this being introduced because it dilutes the skill of the other players at the table. It will make it more possible to have a large enough skill gap to overcome the rake. So a Bitcoin ETF is great for Bitcoin traders but any profits they make will come straight from the pockets of Bitcoin ETF investors. Don’t be the patsy that feeds the professional trader’s profits. The decentralized finance angle and the ETF absurdity One of the key founding principles of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized. Fiat currency like the U.S. dollar implies some sort of trust in the U.S. government as it is the backing of the U.S. that gives dollars their value. Bitcoin is intended to be “trustless” in the sense that it being stored on a decentralized blockchain means no single entity has the power to control it. The decentralized angle is probably the closest thing Bitcoin has to a fundamental thesis. It is an angle that at least potentially makes it something other than speculation. I don’t think this actually provides intrinsic value to Bitcoin, but many people do. An ETF is antithetical to the decentralized concept. The ETF itself is going to be run by a specific centralized entity. So while Bitcoin might be decentralized, if one owns Bitcoin through an ETF their ownership is dependent on a specific entity. Whatever freedom or security supposedly comes from decentralization is lost. I find it far more likely that some financial entity running the ETF will break trust than the U.S. government failing to protect the dollar. Already in the brief history of cryptocurrency there are quite a few scandals, such as FTX (FTT-USD). Recall that before the scandal Sam Bankman-Fried was regarded as one of the most trusted and knowledgeable in the crypto space. When it comes to alleged fraud or other forms of abuse it is really hard to detect the bad actors until it is too late. Bitcoin ETF compared to other investments or ETFs Many of these problems are also true of other ETFs. Non-crypto ETFs also require placing some trust in a specific entity. Other ETFs also come with a rake. The key difference here is the underlying securities. Ownership of most other investments comes with cashflows or at least the prospect of future cashflows in the case of early stage growth. It is these cashflows that make most forms of investment such as SPY positive sum games. The cashflows coming from the underlying companies are much larger than the rake such that there are gains to be had for all. When trading an individual stock or ETF comprised of companies’ stocks you can still make the trading profits from potentially timing it better or otherwise outsmarting fellow traders, it just has a base return on top of that which makes it better for all investors involved. I just don’t see a practical reason to play the negative sum game when positive sum investments are so widely available. Earnings and cashflow are simply better than no earnings and no cashflow.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4641661-inherent-problems-of-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19032750.jpeg

19031288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=556003,1697666409,Crypto-Terrorism Concerns? Senator Warren And 100 Lawmakers Push Biden For Swift Response,"In the middle of escalating tensions between Israel and Hamas, over 100 legislators, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall and Representative Sean Casten, have issued a bipartisan note urging the Biden administration to address alleged close relations between crypto and terrorism. The lawmakers express alarm over reported evidence suggesting that Hamas successfully evaded US sanctions, acquiring millions of dollars through crypto assets. They are now pressing the administration to clarify its strategy for tackling this critical national security threat. Lawmakers Sound Alarm On Crypto-Financed Terrorism The bipartisan letter, addressed to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Brian Nelson, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Department of the Treasury, highlights the concerns surrounding Hamas and Palestinian use of crypto funding. The letter states that between August 2021 and June of the following year, these organizations allegedly raised over $130 million in digital assets, with millions being transferred between them. Related Reading: Binance Traders Go Bearish On Bitcoin, But Here’s Why They Might Regret It The lawmakers stress the urgency of the situation, given the danger posed by the financing of militant organizations, and call on the Biden administration to provide details about its plan to prevent the use of crypto for terrorism financing. In their letter, the lawmakers cite an article from the Wall Street Journal, which reports that researchers studying Hamas’s financing allegedly confirm that crypto remains one of several tools employed by the group to raise funds. While it has not been determined whether the crypto received by Hamas directly financed the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel, the group’s explicit solicitations for crypto have left no doubt about their intentions. Furthermore, the lawmakers highlight that both the Israeli and US governments have previously warned about the threat posed by crypto in the fight against terrorism. Israel has even seized crypto assets from terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. However, experts believe that only a fraction of the digital asset funds flowing through Hamas have been successfully captured. Urgent Call To Curtail Alleged Illicit Activity In light of this, the lawmakers call for decisive action to address the risks associated with illicit crypto activity to prevent further tragedies. As Congress considers legislative proposals to mitigate alleged money laundering and illicit finance risks, they urge the Biden administration to swiftly and comprehensively act to curtail such activities and safeguard national security, as well as the security of US allies. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Price Reach $1,000,000? Pundit Lays Out A Timeline The lawmakers have set a deadline of October 31, 2023, for the Treasury and the Biden administration to respond to questions about their plans to address the serious national security threats arising from using crypto to finance terrorism.

42392266,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3z5r,1697665243,How a Crypto Fraud Gave Florida Its First Forward Party Candidate,"Brian Beute had never personally encountered the world of politics, scandal and corruption before he decided to run for local office in 2019. He was even less familiar with cryptocurrency and blockchain.  This article is part of State of Crypto Week.  And who could blame him? Under normal circumstances, a race for county tax collector does not make headlines of any kind. It rarely involves presidential advisors, national representatives or prolific criminals with illicit bitcoin mining equipment.  But this was not a normal race.  While Beute worked as a music teacher at a local school, his future opponent flew to Miami with influential Republicans, used public money to build a crypto mine on government property and helped traffic minors for sex work.  A conservative from Michigan, Beute moved to Florida and noticed how systems of legacy finance were manipulated for the profit of powerful land developers and politicians.  As controversy about the incumbent tax collector trickled out to the public, Beute declared himself for the election. The consequences of that decision are still reverberating through Beute’s life today.  He was a Republican before vowing earlier this month to help clean up corruption as election supervisor and the first candidate for the Florida Forward Party, a centrist organization founded by former presidential candidate and pro-crypto booster Andrew Yang.  See also: A Tech-Bro Like Us  This is the story of how that local Republican primary challenger became the first candidate for an emerging third party; a story that shows how disruptive technology can have unexpected effects on existing systems and how growing discontent among moderates could change the trajectory of American politics.  The Joel Greenberg operation and Brian Beute  In his first campaign, Beute challenged now-convicted cryptocurrency fraudster Joel Greenberg in the 2019 Republican primary election for tax collector in Seminole County, Florida. Beute was motivated to run by the rumors about Greenberg’s illicit crypto mining and other abuses of power (which embroiled U.S. House Rep. Matt Gaetz [R.-Fl] in a scandal).  Greenberg began acquiring cryptocurrency in 2017, later borrowing money from family members to replace public funds that he commingled with his own. He requested more and more public funds for the purchase of crypto and $90,000 in mining equipment, which was eventually lost in a fire.  He also created a mysterious corporate entity called “Government Blockchain Systems LLC,” which had only the tax collector’s office as a client, and hired a convicted real-estate scam artist named Keith Ingersoll to acquire property for the office. This employee, Ingersoll had connections to a fraudulent $15 million initial coin offering scheme called Organic Fresh Coin, which never publicly distributed a digital asset.  With these connections in mind, perhaps it would come as no surprise that within the first week of Beute’s candidacy, Greenberg launched a retaliatory campaign designed to smear his opponent's reputation. Greenberg and associates sent emails and letters to the school falsely accusing the music teacher Beute of sexual misconduct with students.  I view cryptocurrencies with a great deal of skepticism as do most people that I know,” Beute said. “Fortunately, the Forward Party is a place where differences of opinion are observed and embraced  Just as rumors of Greenberg's malfeasance convinced Beute to run to replace the tax collector, it was Greenberg's false rumors about his opponent that kickstarted the process that landed him behind bars. The county sheriff found Greenberg’s fingerprints on letters sent to Beute's employer, which helped set off the cascade of charges and litigation that eventually fell around the tax collector.  Beute stayed in the primary race, hamstrung by accusations at first and then unable to participate fully in local media around the primary because of ongoing investigations. He eventually lost to J.R. Kroll, who went on to replace Greenberg as tax collector in the general election.  In time, Greenberg pleaded guilty to six counts related to his crimes while in office, one of which convicted him for making false accusations against Beute. In 2022, Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in prison. The scale of the operation was so vast that Greenberg’s sentencing was delayed repeatedly while investigators pursued his connections to other crimes.  Though three years have passed since Greenberg resigned, those who held significant positions in his tax office are still active in Florida politics, including Beute’s Republican opponent Chris Anderson, the incumbent supervisor of elections for Seminole County.  The ‘crypto party’ strategizes for 2024  Last month the Forward Party announced a 12-state battleground map that included Florida. Forward Party managing director Joel Searby told me they are looking for more party switchers like Beute.  “The Forward Party is an incubator for independents and moderates who genuinely care about discussing, designing and delivering consensus solutions outside of the current political structure,” Beute said, adding that his decision was not just about breaking with Republicans but a rational response to polling.  A 2022 Gallup poll showed that 60% of voters believe that a new party is necessary. In Seminole County, third-party registration is up compared to the two major parties. As Republicans’ grasp on Florida politics has tightened, more moderate voters may have felt stranded in the center by shifts in the political landscape.  Whether or not an organization like the Forward Party can represent a meaningful pole of political power in the U.S., voters are sympathetic to voices beyond the traditional two-party system.  And while Joel Greenberg’s cryptocurrency fraud helped motivate the Florida Forward Party’s first candidate to get involved in politics, leadership has been friendly with the industry in the past.  See also: Andrew Yang Is Raising $1.5M for a Company That Plans to Reward People With Crypto  Andrew Yang said in 2021 that the Forward Party would be the “crypto party.” The former presidential candidate released a non-fungible token (NFT) to help launch the Forward Party, saying that digital assets and crypto were strongly aligned with the organization's goals. Yang was involved with a crypto venture as recently as last September.  Searby said, “While we don’t take official positions for or against cryptocurrency or any particular type of crypto, we support and cheer innovators.”  Yang’s political messaging has always emphasized the integration of innovative technologies that change the way people work and live. Beute’s story shows that for better or for worse that change is already happening.  Rest assured the Joel Greenbergs of the world are still out there, mixing traditional political power with the promise of innovative new technology, concocting a fraudulent brew to further enrich themselves.  “As it stands, I view cryptocurrencies with a great deal of skepticism as do most people that I know,” Beute said. “Fortunately, the Forward Party is a place where differences of opinion are observed and embraced.”  The inertia of the two-party system is built into American politics. And while parties came and went in the early republic, the modern cartel has prevailed since before the Civil War.  Forward Party members and supporters will hope there is a critical mass of people who, like Brian Beute, no longer believe that a better world can be made this way.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Michael Spencer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/18/how-a-crypto-fraud-gave-florida-its-first-forward-party-candidate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d60e518db2d64c246011d47d8b9158f70c56d057-2424x1436.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Historically, Marathon has custodied all its bitcoin with a single provider,"" Marathon said in a statement Wednesday. ""As part of its broader treasury management strategy,"" the company added, it has ""added a new, enterprise-grade custodian as its second custodian.""  In a separate filing, the miner said it would open one or more custodial asset accounts with Fidelity.  Marathon said it may expand even further and add more custodians. The company had 13,726 bitcoin as of Sept. 30 and it's producing over 1,000 more per month, so ""we believe it is an opportune time to diversify our bitcoin custody across multiple custodians,"" Marathon CFO Salman Khan said in the statement.  Custody plays a key role in crypto and other markets. Firms that don't want to store their own digital assets like BTC can entrust them with a third party. Having more than one company doing that ensures that if a single provider runs into trouble, at least all of your assets won't be lost.  Marathan's decision comes after several custodians, including Fortress Trust, have been targeted by hackers that stole some digital assets. In the case of Fortress Trust, the theft spurred the custodian to try to sell itself to blockchain tech company Ripple, but that deal fell apart.  The miner's stock was up 1.3% in post-market trading. It has risen 116% this year, while bitcoin has climbed 71%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/18/bitcoin-miner-marathon-to-custody-some-of-its-btc-with-fidelity-digital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d31629581c4d4f8d6cc95d29632609547664c3a2-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Walsh even compares the current state of the DEX to that of Ethereum. The executive also acknowledged that the DEX’s current level of success is due to the active participation and contribution of the developer community. Uniswap Becoming More Decentralized? The Executive Director responded to a thread on X where Antonio Juliano, the founder of dYxX, a layer-2 DEX on Ethereum, insinuated that Uniswap is now centralized. However, it started on a decentralized path. With centralization, Juliano added, the protocol can iterate quickly, mainly to boost revenue. On the other hand, by being more decentralized, dapps allow users to enjoy the full advantages of decentralized finance (DeFi). Decentralization of protocols launching on public ledgers, like Ethereum or Cardano, is crucial. Usually, the community will gauge how well a dapp is decentralized by looking at, among other factors, how decisions are made and which party spearheads development. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price To Hit $100: Here’s How To Become A Millionaire In the case of Ethereum, Walsh pointed out that the community has taken over from where Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder; and Consensys, a technology company developing solutions for Ethereum, left. Since then, multiple developers have been refining the network and ensuring it is secure and robust to anchor dapps. Uniswap is one of the most popular DEXes on Ethereum, looking at total value locked (TVL). DeFiLlama data shows that the exchange manages over $3 billion of assets and is primarily active on Ethereum. However, the exchange enables trustless swapping on layer-2 platforms like OP Mainnet, and public ledgers like the BNB Chain. Preparing For Hooks And KYC? Presently, Uniswap Labs leads the development of Uniswap. Nonetheless, Walsh said more developers are now building and contributing solutions. This, the Uniswap Foundation executive further observed, is especially considering the scheduled launch of Hooks in v4. There is no specific timeline for when Uniswap will deploy the latest iteration, but the release of the Cancun upgrade on Ethereum will play a role. The protocol will be more customizable with Hooks since the feature acts more like a plugin. Related Reading: Binance Traders Go Bearish On Bitcoin, But Here’s Why They Might Regret It Even so, there have been concerns that Hooks, though being developed by community developers, will be the basis for Uniswap to censor liquidity providers (LP) or traders who don’t verify by adhering to know-your-customer rules (KYC). UNI prices remain under pressure at spot rates and may break lower, registering new 2023 lows.

19026918,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555993,1697659244,Expert Trader Identifies 6 High-Potential Altcoins To Watch,"In its latest update on October 18, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has highlighted six altcoins that have caught his attention, showing potential for the remainder of 2023, Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), Dogecoin (DOGE), Woo Network (WOO), Verasity (VRA), Stellar (XLM), and Injective (INJ). Mixed Signals For Dogecoin Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests a crucial moment for the Ocean Protocol. Whether the current price deviation will result in a downside wick below the red channel placed at $0.2763 or if the price will close below it weekly. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Takes A Steep Dive: 91% Decrease In 24 Hours While a downside wick followed by a recovery could lead to a move toward the Channel Top at $0.3247, a weekly close below the Channel Bottom would necessitate keen observation for price rejection as new resistance. On the other hand, Rekt Capital notes that Dogecoin has been meandering at the bottom of its channel at $0.058890. However, recent price developments indicate that the potential bullish divergence in its 1-week chart is likely no longer valid. The lower low has shifted from support to resistance, confirmed by price action and a breakdown in the RSI’s trendline. Although a scenario of DOGE reclaiming its lower low remains possible, Rekt believes that a more definitive reaction is needed to confirm a potential fake breakdown. Injective Dominates The Altcoins Market Woo Network has experienced a relatively subdued quarter compared to the first half of 2023. Despite the uncertain macro outlook, WOO Network remains confident in its vision and mission. Notably, the network successfully negotiated the repurchase of shares and tokens from the estate of Three Arrows Capital, alleviating uncertainty for WOO Network’s community and investors. Verasity is a protocol and product layer platform for esports, video entertainment, and digital content management. Rekt Capital acknowledges the breakout from the mid-term downtrend structure in Verasity’s native token. The token has been establishing higher lows after reaching a low point on October 4, indicating a potential shift in momentum. Stellar is a blockchain-based payments network that facilitates global, efficient digital asset issuance and exchange. XLM has recently displayed sideways price action, trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Nonetheless, Rekt Capital includes Stellar in their altcoin watchlist, suggesting it is one to watch. Injective is an open and interoperable blockchain optimized for DeFi applications, utilizing the Tendermint PoS consensus mechanism. Rekt Capital highlights the significant uptrend in INJ’s native token in the past 24 hours and over the past year, with a remarkable surge of 290%. As Rekt Capital’s analysis indicates, these six altcoins – OCEAN, DOGE, WOO, Verasity VRA, XLM, and INJ – have caught the attention of the crypto analyst.

42392272,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3zad,1697658107,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Might Be Near, but Analysts Differ on Possible BTC Price Reaction","Bitcoin briefly rallied 7% to $30,000 before retracing on an erroneous news headline of the SEC approving BlackRock's spot BTC ETF application.  Price gains could be even larger when a real approval arrives, said one team of analysts, while another outfit suggested approval has been priced in.  If prices do jump on a spot ETF green light, it could be a ""sell the news"" event, suggested Enigma Securities.  Bitcoin's [BTC] violent but short-lived Monday rally on an erroneous news post about a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval offered a dress rehearsal for how the market would react when the real thing happens, analysts say.  ""Violent price action on the fake ETF news serves as a timely reminder of what will likely happen upon a decisive verdict on the spot ETF applications,"" K33 Research analysts noted.  Their report pointed out that BTC shot up 7% to $30,000 from just under $28,000 in eight minutes after the false alarm. The team also noted that bitcoin gained 14% in a week following BlackRock's application for a spot ETF in mid-June.  ""We expect a potential approval to overshadow both these market reactions,"" said K33, adding that a rejection, conversely, ""would likely send the market tumbling.""  Alex Krüger, co-founder of investment research firm Asgard Markets, noted Monday in an X post that the market reaction showed that the approval – even though it is largely expected – is not fully baked in the price.  ""Whoever thinks the ETF is already priced in has just been proven wrong,"" Krüger posted. ""Expect a +20% day move when approved.""  ""A measly pump""  Given the extremely low volatility (particularly upward volatility) of late, it's not surprising the bulls got excited on Monday, but Joe Consorti and Nik Bhatia, authors of The Bitcoin Layer newsletter, called it ""a measly pump.""  ""What we experienced was a totally run-of-the-mill intraday price increase for bitcoin, the likes of which we may see on any given Tuesday with a risk-on tone,"" they said. ""This indicates that much of the fanfare and price gains of spot ETF approval is baked into bitcoin’s price already.""  Bitcoin, they remind, remains a risk asset, and with higher interest rates likely to lead to a downturn phase in markets, they're not expecting approval to lead to a wave of capital inflows into spot ETFs.

""Its importance cannot be understated, and as the price action [on Monday] indicated, there is a lot of dry powder waiting to buy into it.""  However, a potential approval could well be a ""sell the news"" event when the real headline flashes, with BTC price shooting up first before declining for a while, Edwards noted.

19024653,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555905,1697655603,"When Will Bitcoin Price Reach $1,000,000? Pundit Lays Out A Timeline","Since the Bitcoin Price crossed $50,000 back in the 2021 bull market, there have been speculations on when the price will hit $100,000, and on the other extreme end, $1,000,000. Over time, various analysts and pundits have put forward their forecasts, but the most recent of these is from budding economist Alessandro Ottaviani who believes BTC could hit the $1 million mark in the next three years. Bitcoin Price On Its Way To $1 Million Ottaviani starts out his X (formerly Twitter) post by pointing out that the Bitcoin market cap had climbed rapidly following fake news of a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Now, recall that on Monday, media outlet Cointelegraph made a post on X saying that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF filing. Related Reading: BlackRock Reacts To False Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval News In A Positive Way Following this, the price of Bitcoin surged above $30,000 and in a matter of minutes, over $50 billion was added to the crypto’s market cap, as Ottaviani points out. Going by BTC’s reaction to this news which eventually turned out to be fake, the analyst was able to draw a parallel for what might happen when Spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved for real. Main take away of today: Bitcoin makrket Cap went up by more than $50 billion in minutes, and very likely the money flowing into Bitcoin were less than $500 million (ratio 100:1) A former Blackrock Director said that we can expect $150-200 billion flowing into Bitcoin in 3… — Alessandro Ottaviani (@AlexOttaBTC) October 16, 2023 Ottaviani points out that this $50 billion increase in market cap came from an around $500 million injection into the market, meaning the market cap rose at a ratio of 100:1. Thus, going by what BlackRock Director and CEO Larry Fink said about a Spot ETF triggering a $150 billion to $200 billion inflow into the asset, Ottaviani explains that this would put BTC’s market cap at $21 trillion. At a $21 trillion market cap, the price of each BTC would be going for $1 million. Now, about when this might happen, Ottaviani reverts to Fink’s statement. When Fink made his forecast that $150-$200 billion could flow into Bitcoin, he said that this could happen over a three-year period. So if a Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved in 2024 as Bloomberg analysts believe, then the price of Bitcoin could reach this $1 million mark in 2027-2028 if all goes as planned. “Surely on the way up there will be many people selling, but this is already directionally clear how much could be the effect of the BTC ETFs being approved,” Ottaviani said in the X post. BTC still miles away from $1,000,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Other $1 Million Predictions For BTC Ottaviani is only the most recent in a long line of market participants and crypto enthusiasts who have predicted that the price of Bitcoin would reach $1 million. Some notable personalities who believe it will reach this level include ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and finance author Robert Kiyosaki. Cathie Wood who has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin said last year that she expects the price of BTC to hit $1 million by 2030. Due to this belief, Wood’s investment firm ARK Invest has been heavily investing across the crypto space, buying hundreds of thousands of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as well as Coinbase stock. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Addresses See Unprecedented Jump, Is $30,000 Possible? Next on the list is Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan who made a bet in June 2023 that the BTC price would reach $1 million. Srinivasan pointed to “hyperbitcoinization” as the reason behind this. However, Srinivasan’s forecast was on a much shorter timeframe (90 days) and didn’t play out as predicted. Last but not least is finance author Robert Kiyosaki. Kiyosaki has been sounding the alarm of a potential collapse of the US dollar and has presented the likes of Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin as good alternatives to hedge against this potential collapse. In August, Kiyosaki said in an interview that if the economy were to collapse, Bitcoin could reach $1 million, while Gold and Silver could rise to $75,000 and $60,000, respectively.

42392258,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3yb5,1697653437,Jimmy Zhong Arrest Details Revealed in New Report,"A report from CNBC has revealed additional details surrounding Jimmy Zhong, who last year was arrested in connection with the theft of more than 50,000 bitcoins [BTC] from the Silk Road marketplace.  According to CNBC, what had been mostly a cold case was reawakened when Zhong called emergency services in Athens, GA to report that hundreds of thousands of dollars of cryptocurrency had been stolen from his home. A few twists and turns later, including some legwork from a private investigator who mostly handled process serving, cheating spouses and custody probes, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) ultimately got their man and realized one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency seizures from an individual.  The report shared that Zhong was known for hiring private jets, lavish parties and gifting his friends thousands of dollars before his arrest.  Zhong ultimately was charged with wire fraud and after pleading guilty, was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison and forfeited his bitcoin. Zhong, now 33 years old, began his sentence at the federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, on July 14, 2023.  “The government has certainly not been hurt by Jimmy’s conduct whatsoever,” Zhong’s attorney Michael Bachner told CNBC. He noted that if the government had gotten its hands on those 50,000 bitcoins at the time of Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht’s arrest, it would have sold them for about $320 per coin, or roughly $14 million. “As a result of Jimmy having them, the government has gotten a $3 billion profit,” Bachner said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/18/jimmy-zhong-arrest-details-revealed-in-new-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35f04645d0260ab7db00479fcca69c02b0802502-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

(FDIC) has left the banks it oversees unequipped to navigate the regulator's crypto expectations, according to the agency's inspector general, so the FDIC agreed to field a new strategy by January.  The Office of the Inspector General for the FDIC – an internal watchdog function within U.S. agencies – studied the banking agency's performance when it came to preparing the industry for crypto's risks and found it lacking, according to a report issued on Wednesday.  ""The FDIC’s lack of clear procedures causes uncertainty for supervised institutions in determining the appropriate actions to take,"" the report concluded, adding that the agency also hadn't concluded its effort to assess whether it could head off systemic banking dangers from crypto.  The inspector general noted that the agency told some banks to pause their crypto activities last year and this year, but then it didn't tell the banks how long they'd be paused or how it might end.  The FDIC had a momentous year, featuring a number of significant bank collapses, specifically involving major institutions that had tech or crypto ties. The agency has been suspicious of the digital assets industry and has leaned toward shielding the banking system from deep involvement with crypto – a stance felt acutely by crypto businesses struggling to find and maintain banking relationships in the U.S.  The agency agreed to inspector general recommendations that it come up with a plan and schedule for figuring out the risks cryptocurrency activity poses to lending institutions, and that it also clarify its process for the crypto reviews at individual banks.

Two critical events today, highlighted by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, paint a curious picture of BTC’s current standing. Majority Of Binance Traders Shorting BTC Ali Martinez, a respected figure in the crypto analysis world, revealed some interesting data concerning Bitcoin earlier today. According to Martinez’s X (formerly known as Twitter) post, most traders on Binance with open Bitcoin futures seem to expect a downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes The Lead As Crypto Funds See Third Straight Week Of Inflows Specifically, about 51% of these traders are shorting BTC. For clarity, shorting is essentially betting that the price of an asset will decrease. This data indicates that, at least on Binance, traders have a prevailing sentiment that Bitcoin’s price might be due for a dip.

Traders might be hedging their bets, capitalizing on short-term fluctuations, or employing a range of trading strategies that best suit their financial objectives and risk tolerance. Bitcoin Notable Price Achievement On the same day, in another tweet, Martinez shared that Bitcoin has achieved a notable milestone. The top cryptocurrency surged past the $27,900 mark, which Martinez identifies as the “short-term holder cost basis.” This means that those who have held BTC for a shorter duration and previously saw minimal profits could potentially be realizing gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000?

42392274,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3zq1,1697650089,Cracks Appear as Ethereum Staking Demand Wanes,"Rewind to earlier this year, and staking on the Ethereum blockchain was all the rage. At the heart of it all was Lido Finance, a decentralized protocol that allowed traders to both earn rewards from Ethereum staking but also to get a liquid proxy token “stETH” they could trade in the meantime. Lido quickly surged to the top rank among decentralized finance or DeFi projects. But lately, Lido is experiencing growing pains – along with suspicion and resentment. We pull it all together in Network News.  Also:  Stellar’s “Soroban” project draws closer to fruition, putting the O.G. blockchain into competition with Ethereum and other smart-contracts blockchains, and possibly some fresh momentum for the XLM token.  More job cuts hit the blockchain sector as crypto winter drags on.  Scroll’s new layer-2 network goes live, adding to “zkEVM” competition for Polygon, Matter Labs.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  PEAK LIDO? As Ethereum transitioned over the past year to a fully functional proof-of-stake blockchain, market observers chronicled the staggering rise of Lido Finance, which effectively allows investors to stake their ether (ETH) – and thus earn rewards, yield – while also getting a token, stETH, that they can trade in the meantime. For many, that combination proved more attractive than the technically cumbersome job of setting up a validator and locking up ETH into the main blockchain. The problem now is that Lido has become too popular – bumping up against the 33% threshold of total ETH staked where the project could theoretically threaten the 67% supermajority needed to finalize transactions. Now, there are signs of pushback from the crypto community – as well as growing pains for Lido in managing such a sprawling operation. Late last week, voting closed among members of the Arbitrum network community on how to allocate an incentive program of 50 million ARB tokens (worth about $40 million), and Lido was denied in its application for 4 million ARB – seen as an expression of protest. “The Ethereum immune system is waking up,” Evan Van Ness, publisher of Week in Ethereum News, posted on X. Defenders of Lido are quick to point out that the protocol has merely made the most of blockchain incentives and innovation, and that the real threat still comes from more centralized players, such as big crypto exchanges. “The fact of the matter is Lido has, and is heavily incentivized (as revealed in their growth) to act responsibly, and its presence elevates Ethereum decentralization, not contaminates,” according to a Messari report. But there are also operational issues. Lido had to explain in a post-mortem analysis last week why 20 of its Ethereum validators recently got “slashed,” or penalized: “The root cause of the slashing boiled down to executing non-optimal fallback procedures during datacenter connectivity issues.” Got that? There was also the news that Lido has decided to sunset a separate staking service on the Solana blockchain; it was just too costly, with a $700,000 investment over the 2022-2023 budget and only $220,000 of revenue. “It was deemed a necessity for the success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem,"" the project’s developers wrote in a post. Resorting to the tourniquet might be a rare sign of weakness from the single most successful project in all of DeFi.  MAWR JOB CUTS. For the third straight week, reports of job cuts have filled the blockchain news headlines, offering further evidence of the economic toll of crypto winter. CoinDesk broke the news last week that CertiK, the blockchain code auditor, had made a “strategic workforce adjustment” impacting 30-40 people, or about 15% of the company’s workforce. The recent cuts were made “in response to evolving market dynamics,” according to the team. It was a harsh comedown, since the company CertiK raised nearly $150 million of fresh capital just last year.

Ethereum Validator Backlog Clears Out, as Staking Demand Weakens  Just weeks ago, The Protocol reported how Ethereum developers were worried that the number of validators on the blockchain was growing so fast that the resulting sprawl might cause latency issues. That problem may have temporarily resolved itself, thanks to what Coinbase analysts attributed to “a plateau in investor demand for Ethereum staking.” As reported by CoinDesk’s Krisztian Sandor, the once month-long queue of validators waiting to get onto the network has now basically been cleared out. One factor is that staking rewards have dropped significantly, to near 3.5% from 5%-6% earlier this year, due to tepid network activity to generate revenue from fees and the increasing number of stakers. That looks like a pretty paltry return for crypto, especially with traditional money market funds and old-fashioned, one-year U.S. Treasury bills yielding north of 5%.  The number of validators waiting to get onto the Ethereum blockchain has nearly cleared out. (Validatorqueue.com)  Calendar  Oct. 12-13: Bitcoin Amsterdam conference.

42392262,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3yqT,1697649634,Bitcoin Holds $28K as Stocks Buckle Under Interest Rate Concerns,"The price of bitcoin [BTC] is little changed on Wednesday at $28,300 despite roughly 1% declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq as interest rates carve out fresh new post-global financial crisis highs.  The broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is down modestly, led by about 1% drops for Solana's [SOL], Polygon's [MATIC], and litecoin [LTC].  Socking the stock market indices is a new leg up in interest rates. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield is higher by nine basis points to 5.02%. Should that level hold, it would be the first close above 5% for the long bond since the summer of 2007. The 10-year Treasury note yield is up seven basis points to 4.905%, also the highest yield since that summer.  Spot bitcoin ETF appears near, but what then?  While a tweet earlier this week claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application turned out to be false, there seems to no longer be any disagreement among market participants that approval of one or more of these vehicles is coming and perhaps sooner, rather than later.  Appearing on CNBC Wednesday morning, Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO) CEO Mike Novogratz – whose firm has teamed up with Invesco for a spot bitcoin ETF application – said he believes approval is coming in 2023. ""All the indications of dealing seem to be heading in the right direction ... There's a tremendous amount of pressure to do something that is rational.""  ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood (whose company also has a spot ETF application) said the SEC is now reaching out with questions on a spot product, which she notes is a positive change in behavior from the agency.  For his part, SEC Chair Gary Gensler – whose opinion is likely the only one that matters – for now is keeping his cards close to his vest. In a Bloomberg TV appearance, Gensler acknowledged the agency's staff is looking at multiple exchange-traded products (ETPs), but little more.  The question for the bulls going forward is that if spot ETF approval is so widely known and expected, wouldn't that news be reflected in the price of bitcoin, which has nearly doubled this year, but remains about 60% below its all-time high hit a bit more than two years ago.

This time, another has predicted the token to rise to $100 and given tips on how one could make money from this occurrence. How To Make $1 Million From XRP In a post shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Crypto Analyst and XRP influencer Crypto Assets Guy stated that XRP had the potential to reach $100 in 3-5 years. As to the best way XRP holders could benefit from such a significant increase in XRP’s price, he opined that holding 10,000 XRP is enough for those holding long-term. Related Reading: Ripple Job Posting Sparks IPO Rumors, Will XRP Price Finally Cross $100? He further calculated the potential returns that these holders stood to gain if his prediction were to come through. Going by this, holders could gain as much as $1 million, assuming they were holding 10,000 XRP and each token was worth $100 in the next three to five years. Some seemed to agree with the analyst’s prediction, with one particular X user stating that XRP “should” break $100 long before then, especially due to institutional interests. On the other hand, many seemed to disagree with the prediction and stated that it was almost impossible for the token to hit $100 by then. There was also the category of people who seemed tired of such predictions as they stated that they had heard similar predictions in the past (years back), and still, there hasn’t been any notable increase in the token’s price. XRP Price Prediction Factual Or Otherwise? The future XRP price is arguably one of the trending topics in the X crypto community, as analysts and influencers have continued to make predictions on the token’s trajectory. While some have based their prediction on certain indicators and fundamentals, others seem to be making these predictions without any conviction or any basis for it. Related Reading: Crypto Research Firm Predicts 200% XRP Price Rally To $1.5 With this in mind, some members of the XRP community have gone as far as accusing these influencers of simply making these predictions for engagement farming. Interestingly, the influencer Crypto Assets Guy who had made this $100 prediction was the same person who had some days back stated that XRP wasn’t going to hit “$10000, $1000, $50 or $10 any time soon.” Although one can’t assertively state what he meant by “any time soon” in this context, it raises eyebrows as to the analyst’s recent prediction, considering that he seemed less optimistic about XRP’s future trajectory just days back.

42392277,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg400H,1697643900,Investment as a Service: Table Stakes for the Next Crypto Cycle,"Bear markets are for building. The firms that manage to survive this protracted drawdown will position themselves to take advantage of the next bull run, whenever it may come. Through this process of competitive preparation, features that were cutting-edge in the last cycle become table stakes for the next one.  It’s no longer enough for crypto exchanges to simply facilitate buying and selling cryptocurrency. Exchanges cannot remain mere asset marketplaces, especially considering the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Instead, they will construct portals to an entire financial universe.  The opportunity is enormous as Gen Z comes of age with crypto familiarity and eagerness to put their funds to work. In May, the FINRA Foundation and the CFA Institute released a survey that found 44% of Gen Z investors got their start in investing by purchasing crypto; only 32% started with stocks and 21% with mutual funds.  Furthermore, 65% of Gen Z investors use financial apps, and pay heed to their guidance: ""Of those who have received suggestions from an app, 67% said the suggestions influenced them to make a particular investment, trade or purchase.""  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  “Investment as a service” crypto platforms that take cues from the curated experiences offered by TradFi giants like Vanguard will be able to welcome the next generation to a home base for wealth development.  Sandy Kaul of Franklin Templeton recently summarized this vision:  Cash could become spread across a set of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Investments could be comprised of tokenized securities, funds and assets. Liabilities could be represented as tokenized obligations, and assets, valuables and collectibles represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with contractual documents such as the title or insurance policy embedded within the token itself.  Unfortunately, early forays into this arena have been stymied by Uncle Sam’s giant wagging finger. U.S. crypto exchanges can no longer offer debt-based yield services like the erstwhile Gemini Earn program or retail-friendly staking services like Kraken’s verboten one or Coinbase’s beleaguered equivalent.  There is, however, a compliant path forward. One that involves proactively playing nice with the Securities and Exchange Commission and relying on robust custody partnerships, including tools like separately managed accounts. Commingling customer funds in large digital asset baskets is a non-starter, as it securitizes the underlying assets. But intelligent and automated direct indexing products, employed by an internet adviser registration, have made inroads with regulators.  These direct indexing platforms are the next step to wide adoption of long-tail digital assets beyond bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ETH. I agree with the leadership of Methodic Capital Management: “Indexes allow for efficient asset allocation, risk management, product development and performance measurement. Without indexes, crypto cannot evolve into an institutional financial market.”  Advisers will play a pivotal role in simplifying Web3, managing client inventory and maximizing yield with the inevitable proliferation of on-chain protocols, products and decentralized apps. Again Methodic Capital Management is on the money when they note: “What is missing in the U.S. is regulatory support and index adoption that captures the more nuanced and differentiating aspects of crypto markets, such as proof-of-stake reward rates.”  We certainly hope U.S. regulators will help us out and make clear guidelines above and beyond a simple spot ETF, but the innovation is going to happen with or without them.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Colton Dillion,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/18/investment-as-a-service-table-stakes-for-the-next-crypto-cycle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4399fbd233322baf919495bab7b92c25d21021a6-5953x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392264,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3z0j,1697643900,"The Death of Compromise, and a Way Forward for Crypto","Two of my children were playing the other day, building a bridge with LEGO. Happy and feeling accomplished, they were just about to complete their creation when my other child ran over and kicked it down. Pleased with the destruction, he ran away, leaving both of his siblings crying.  Isn’t this the story of life? Some people build bridges. Others destroy them. And even more are just an audience, like me, who observed the situation while trying to get other things done – interfering only at the end with discipline to the destructor and aid to the builders.  This scenario has been haunting me. Engaging in linear thinking and failing to engage in compromise rarely conjures collective goals.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Within the digital asset landscape, the biggest call for action and compromise today is regulation.  In March 2022, Jerome Powell, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine emphasized the need for Congress to take “action on digital finance, including cryptocurrencies.” Powell referred to the possibility that terrorists or other malicious actors would use crypto as a reason why additional regulation was needed.  In October 2022, a federal panel responsible for monitoring financial system risks sounded a warning about crypto markets, saying that the widespread adoption of digital assets poses risks if the market continued to grow without better oversight and enforcement.  Most recently, Israeli authorities seized around 190 Binance accounts with alleged ties to terrorist groups. And there have been multiple reports of how Hamas militants behind the attack on Israel raised millions of dollars worth of crypto – bolstering the case for regulation.  One can’t help but wonder why we are at this critical point where, arguably, little has been accomplished on crypto regulation? Linear thinking with a single outcome in mind has left us unable to compromise.  But I haven't lost hope. Over the past few months, as part of a marketing study, I interviewed early adopters of digital assets from traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The No. 1 theme that kept emerging in these conversations? Bridges.  Yes, the desire to build bridges. While what’s on each side of the bridge may vary, the concept of unifying remains. Addressing policy and regulatory framework, tensions between TradFi and DeFi, streamlining vernacular and data, and building trust through unbiased and fair viewpoints were common themes, with one solution: bridges. And the path forward the early adopters acknowledged as the solution to these percolating problems? Collective thinking, coming together as a community and finding compromise.  So, how do we build bridges? First, think nonlinearly; be flexible and adaptable. Second, be open-minded. Listen to those with opposing viewpoints. Solve problems with compromise in mind. Third, be a voice …  The next time my two children are building bridges and my third goes for the destruction kick, I can act. In this scenario, and why I’m writing this article, is to remind people that the majority of us want bridges. It's time to start building.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Kim Greenberg Klemballa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/18/the-death-of-compromise-and-a-way-forward-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44bd3115e81356eca0e755b15144833abbe19d2f-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led more than a hundred lawmakers in demanding top officials share their plans for heading off crypto-financed terrorism.  The bipartisan group of lawmakers from both the Senate and the House of Representatives signed a letter dated on Tuesday to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Brian Nelson, undersecretary for terrorism and financial Intelligence at the Department of the Treasury. They cited reports that crypto funds had supported Hamas in the months before its attack on Israel, with the group directly soliciting bitcoin donations.  “Given the clear and present danger posed by the financing of these and other militant organizations, we ask the Administration to provide additional details on its plan to prevent the use of crypto for the financing of terrorism,” they requested in the letter. ""Congress and this Administration must take strong action to thoroughly address crypto illicit finance risks before it can be used to finance another tragedy.""  The letter effort was also led by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.). The signers included Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  Warren has been advocating for her legislation meant to target money laundering and sanctions abuses in crypto, which is co-sponsored by Marshall. The bill, which crypto lobbyists have argued would pose significant threats to the industry in the U.S., hasn't yet found any traction at the committee level so remains a long shot for this year.

42392275,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3zv9,1697642138,"‘Oh, Yes’: Accounting Prof Says Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX Definitely Mishandled Customers' Money","NEW YORK – To help make their case that Sam Bankman-Fried committed a historic multibillion-dollar fraud, prosecutors enlisted an accounting professor who assisted the government investigations into Enron and WorldCom two decades ago.  University of Notre Dame accounting professor Peter Easton took the stand in the ongoing trial Wednesday morning. Asked whether FTX ever spent user deposits, Easton, who was hired by the Department of Justice to trace billions of dollars of Alameda and FTX funds, replied definitively: “Oh, yes.”  User deposits were reinvested into businesses and real estate, used to make political contributions and donated to charity, the professor testified.  With the composed demeanor of someone familiar with a witness stand, Easton walked through a chart he created showing a widening gulf between FTX user deposits and the exchange’s bank balances.  Read all of CoinDesk’s SBF trial coverage here.  The chart showed user deposits falling beneath FTX’s bank balances around March 2021 – meaning user funds had lost their backing by that point, according to Easton’s analysis.  By June 2022, when FTX deposits were at their peak, the exchange only had around $2 billion on hand to back more than $11 billion in user deposits, Easton testified.  The professor next walked through charts tracking inflows and outflows of FTX customer money into a variety of business investments.  “We can conclude all of the purchase of Modulo Capital was made using customer funds,” he said, referring to a Bahamas-based financial firm owned by FTX.  Easton said his investigation also showed customer funds were behind a majority of FTX’s investment into SkyBridge Capital, a firm led by Anthony Scaramucci – Donald Trump’s famously short-lived communications director. FTX customers also funded the bulk of a $550 million FTX investment into Genesis Digital Assets, a bitcoin mining firm (which is not the same company as Genesis, the subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group), Easton testified.  An additional chart showed FTX user money flowing into a bank account for Paper Bird, Inc., an entity owned solely by Bankman-Fried. Easton said FTX users funded the “majority” of a $100 million investment Bankman-Fried made into Dave, Inc., a mobile banking platform, via Paper Bird.  Former FTX lobbyist testifies  Also Wednesday, former FTX lobbyist Eliora Katz testified, illuminating a contrast between Bankman-Fried’s public comments about the exchange’s safeguards and the secret reality that led to its demise a year ago.  Bankman-Fried’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee came up early in the Department of Justice questioning of the witness, alongside the FTX founder’s tweets about investor protection.  “We have a transparent system,” Bankman-Fried said in a clip played for the jury of his comments before Congress. Bankman-Fried, in the video, also discussed the company’s risk-monitoring system, contrasting it with the opaque Wall Street mess that fueled the 2008 financial crisis.  The truth, according to prosecutors and FTX insiders who have testified after pleading guilty, was very different: poor financial record-keeping and improper siphoning of customer money to Bankman-Fried’s nominally separate trading firm, Alameda Research. And once that started coming to light, the company fell apart in a rapid, 2008-style collapse.  Katz actually said relatively little on the stand. The prosecutor just kept showing her tweets and transcripts and asked her to read them out loud, and she often kept her answers short: “yes” or the like. She seemed to be mainly on the stand to contrast FTX’s public statements on crypto investor protection and how it actually handled customer funds, and to introduce statements about cryptocurrencies being commodities instead of securities – an important regulatory distinction in the U.S.  Some of the Department of Justice’s exhibits focused on statements by Bankman-Fried that much of the crypto market is commodities. The former CEO of FTX is charged with conspiracy to commit commodities fraud.  Katz also emphasized repeatedly that Bankman-Fried’s testimony both before the House committees occurred prior to her joining FTX. She appeared visibly uncomfortable on the stand. The witness denied putting together various materials published by FTX and said she believed that everything Bankman-Fried told the public about investor protection was true.  Judge blasts prosecutors and SBF’s lawyers  Early in the afternoon, Judge Lewis Kaplan admonished both the prosecution and defense lawyers, calling testimony from two of the day’s witnesses “a joke.”  The parties should have agreed that certain documents were real, rather than have witnesses testify to their authenticity, he said.  Katz, the former FTX lobbyist, did not need to testify about comments made in the public record and a Google employee who also took the stand did not need to fly in from Texas to testify about what JSON data, a text-based interchange format, was, Kaplan said. He argued that the lawyers could have agreed to some of the exhibits.  “This afternoon, we flew in a witness to testify about something he knew nothing about?” the judge asked about Google’s Cory Gaddis, who testified to the jury for only a few minutes. “This is a crime,” Judge Kaplan said.  Gaddis was brought in to testify that Google keeps logs of user activity and that different Gmail email addresses have different IDs.

19016196,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555889,1697641237,"This Rare Bullish Bitcoin Crossover Could Soon Form, Quant Predicts When","A rare bullish crossover between two on-chain metrics could soon be forming for Bitcoin. Here’s when this analyst believes the cross would happen. Bitcoin Realized Prices Of Two UTXO Age Bands Are Moving Towards A Cross As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a bullish crossover is expected to happen soon for BTC. The indicator of interest here is the “realized price,” which basically keeps track of the price at which the average investor in the Bitcoin market acquired their coins. The indicator calculates this value by going through the on-chain history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last transacted at. The metric assumes this price to be its buying price and so, after taking the mean of this value for all tokens on the network, the average cost basis of all coins is obtained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cap Could Rise By $1 Trillion After Spot ETFs Launch: CryptoQuant When the cryptocurrency’s price is under this metric, it means that the average holder in the sector is in a state of loss. On the other hand, the price being above the indicator implies the overall market is enjoying net profits. The realized price of the entire user base isn’t of relevance in the context of the current discussion, but two specific UTXO age bands which are 6 months to 12 months and 12 months to 18 months. What these age bands signify is that the coins (or more accurately, UTXOs) belonging to them were last moved inside their range. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price for these two UTXO age bands over the past few years: Looks like the the two metrics have been approaching each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the realized price of the UTXOs sitting dormant between 12 and 18 months ago has been heading down for a while now. The 6-month to 12 months age band had been showing a similar trajectory earlier in the year, but a while back, the metric plateaued and has since then turned itself around. The reason the average cost basis of investors belonging to this age band has reversed its trajectory is that the 6 months cutoff for the group now lies in April, which means that those who bought during the rally in the starting months of the year would now be counted under this cohort. Earlier in the year, the bear market buyers were a part of the group, so the average naturally headed down. The 12-month to 18-month-old group, on the other hand, still constitutes these bear market buyers, hence why its realized price is still decreasing. If these two metrics continue in their current trajectories, they will go through a crossover. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, such a crossover where the 6 months to 12 months band has broken above the 12 months to 18 months cohort, has historically proven to be bullish for the asset. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Weird Bitcoin Activity On Bybit & Deribit Before Flash Surge In total, there have only been four such crossovers in the cryptocurrency’s entire history, so if this crossover goes on to form, it would only be the fifth ever.

This could, in theory, give a boost to the XLM token, assuming the project gains traction.  A new entrant is coming into the already-competitive arena for smart-contract blockchains like Ethereum, and it has a familiar name.  Stellar, a nine-year-old payments-focused project that comes with its own developer community, is backed by a well-heeled foundation and boasts a standing relationship with the cash-transfer giant MoneyGram. But it was built in an era when blockchains were designed for moving value from A to B and not much more.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A “smart-contracts” project is one where strings of programming code can be stored on a blockchain, similar to a computer – allowing developers to build applications for decentralized finance (DeFi) or other uses. Ethereum, born a year after Stellar, is by far the dominant smart-contracts platform, especially with its growing associated ecosystem of so-called layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon and Optimism. But there’s a host of competing smart-contracts platforms, including Solana, Aptos, Sui, Algorand and several projects in the Cosmos ecosystem.  Now comes Stellar and “Soroban,” the blockchain’s project to add smart contracts. The Soroban integration, expected later this year, could mark one of the network’s biggest upgrades since it was created in 2014 by founders including Jed McCaleb, who had been a key player at rival Ripple but departed the prior year due to internal conflicts.  “We see decentralized finance as a big part of the future, and we want to enable that for the users of Stellar,” Tomer Weller, a vice president of product at Stellar Development Foundation who is overseeing Soroban, said in an interview.  If the Soroban upgrade leads to substantial uptake by users, ultimately resulting in an increase in activity on the Stellar network, there could theoretically be a fresh source of demand for the project’s native [XLM] tokens. The XLM price has gained 46% this year, trailing bitcoin’s [BTC] 66% rally but beating the 32% rise in Ethereum’s ether [ETH] tokens. [XRP], which is used in Ripple’s payment network, is up 48% in 2023.  Last week, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), which supports growth on the network with grants and funding awards, announced that it has inked a deal with Certora, a security platform, to support the new smart-contracts platform. Certora provides developers “with the means to verify their code” to ensure that applications are safe and reliable prior to their release.  Ethereum dominance  Stellar faces long odds unseating Ethereum, whose market value of about $190 billion is about 65 times larger than its own. Stellar’s 30 full-time developers compare with 1,901 for Ethereum, according to Electric Capital’s Developer Report. Decentralized-finance protocols built on Ethereum have combined deposits or “total value locked” of $20 billion, according to DefiLlama. The equivalent figure for Stellar is $18.5 million.  “Even for existing chains with smart contracts, it has proven difficult to attract good projects, so it would be very surprising if they manage to seriously challenge Ethereum,” said Doo Wan Nam, co-founder of StableLab.  Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst for FundStrat, said that “developers and users generally prioritize either security or speed,” and that “those who value security tend to gravitate towards Ethereum (or its layer 2s) while those focused on speed usually opt for Solana.”  Stellar’s “recent entry into the smart contract space faces stiff competition from a wide array of existing solutions,” Farrell said.  Stellar Development Foundation treasury  It’s a little-discussed reality of the blockchain industry that growth is rarely entirely organic; projects often need money to jumpstart development and seed application builders.  And the SDF would appear to have the requisite resources to put behind Stellar’s existential transformation into a smart-contracts platform. The SDF is “more than 100 people strong, working to make Stellar the global payment network standard,” according to its website.  The foundation also boasts an enviable warchest of funds that could be deployed at a time when many blockchain projects are struggling through the current malaise in digital-asset markets, known as crypto winter. According to the SDF’s website, the foundation treasury holds some 22 billion XLM tokens, worth about $2.3 billion at the current price.  Last month, the SDF hosted its own conference in Madrid, featuring a “fireside chat” between foundation CEO Denelle Dixon and the actor Idris Elba.  But Soroban may have been the true star of the conference, with more than 22 sessions devoted to the topic, based on a review of the agenda.  According to a report in July, the SDF is prioritizing its engineering on Soroban. Last year, the foundation established a $100 million “Soroban Adoption Fund” to support developer adoption.  Stellar’s deal with MoneyGram, a Dallas-based company with a presence in more than 200 countries, allows users to deposit cash with an agent and then move that on chain – an on-ramp to DeFi, as it were; no bank account is required, and there’s no need to go through a centralized crypto exchange.  “You can take your cash access through MoneyGram and move from that to a yield-bearing account on a decentralized lending protocol,” Weller said.  Where did Stellar get the name Soroban?  The name Soroban comes from the word for a Japanese abacus, described in a SDF blog post as “compact and minimalist.”  Weller says the Soroban team made conscious design choices to improve on Ethereum’s technical features and security.  Among those was the decision to use Rust as the primary programming language, along with WebAssembly, also known as WASM, as the instruction format. That’s instead of Solidity, the language used to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is the foundation for running smart contracts on the Ethereum, Avalanche, Celo and Fantom blockchains, and many other networks.  WASM is the choice for Cosmos, Polkadot, Near and other chains. Weller said that WASM has key technical advantages that make it a better choice.  Rust is the most common programming language for writing programs for the Solana blockchain.  “Stellar's decision to build in Rust places it in direct competition with Solana for developer mindshare,” FundStrat’s Farrell said.  Attacking 'state bloat'  Another push by Stellar is to cut down on “state bloat” or “ledger bloat” – the problem of blockchains getting bigger and bigger without ever deleting data that’s no longer needed.  “If you were airdropped Crypto Kitty in 2018, that’s a piece of info that’s on the ledger, and it’s quite possible that’s a piece of information that nobody cares about, and the entire world has moved on,” Weller said. “But that little bit of information is still there forever.”  Stellar allows some data to expire, arguing that it’s learned lessons from watching Ethereum’s experience with state bloat.  Weller has described the phenomenon as a “second-mover advantage,” since Ethereum would have a hard time retroactively going back and announcing that data might expire.  Soroban went live on a test network on Sept. 20, and Weller said the team is pushing to launch the main network in the next few months. If successful, the launch would represent the culmination of nearly two years of development work, since the plan to bring smart contracts to Stellar was announced in early 2022.  “We’re aiming for release by the end of the year, but we’re also being very conservative in terms of our expectations, in terms of the robustness of this,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETH | XLM,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | XLM,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/18/stellar-early-blockchain-built-for-payments-adds-smart-contracts-to-take-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2def8cbb09f342b241f0713cbfb95e994b3a5bda-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392260,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg3ylL,1697638181,Digital Euro Project Moves to 'Preparation' Phase,"The preparation phase starts November and will last for two years.  It will be used to finalize a digital euro rulebook, select providers to develop a platform and conduct further testing.  The ECB won't take a decision on whether to issue the CBDC until relevant EU legislation has been completed.  The European Central Bank (ECB) is moving its digital euro project to a preparation phase, which could pave the way for a ""potential future decision"" to issue one.  Although a decision on whether to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for retail use in the European Union was due at the end of the two-year investigation phase that is just concluding, the ECB has faced mounting criticism over its plans, including from lawmakers, targeting privacy issues and even veering into conspiracy theories.  The preparation phase – previously called the ""realization phase"" – is due to start in November. It is also set to last two years and will be used to finalize a digital euro rulebook, select providers to develop a CBDC platform and conduct further testing.  Following that, the bank's governing council ""will decide whether to move to the next stage of preparations, to pave the way for the possible future issuance and roll-out of a digital euro,"" a Wednesday announcement said.  The move to a preparation phase is not a decision to issue a digital euro, the bank said. A decision ""will only be considered by the Governing Council once the European Union’s legislative process has been completed."" The European Commission in June published legislative proposals for a digital euro, but that's only the first step of a complex process that could take years to complete.  Moving forward with the project also doesn't ""pre-empt such a decision or prejudge the outcome of the ongoing legislative process,"" outgoing ECB Executive Board Member Fabio Panetta, who heads the bank's work on the digital euro, said in a Wednesday statement.  The move is not without its critics. It may be premature, given the ECB ""has not been able to clearly communicate the added value of the digital euro,"" said Markus Ferber, member of the European Parliament’s economic affairs committee and a CBDC skeptic.

42419423,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERob,1697637718,It’s Time for a Purpose-Built Disclosure Framework for Crypto,"The crypto market participants increasingly find themselves in the cross hairs of elected officials and regulators who are concerned that investors do not understand the assets they are investing in.  Regulators and market participants can address these risks and help restore confidence in crypto assets by coming together to create a standardized disclosure framework that better inform crypto investors about opportunities and risks.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week, sponsored by Chainalysis. Rob Krugman is the chief digital officer at Broadridge.  Experienced crypto traders rely on a series of dedicated metrics to assess the viability and attractiveness of crypto assets. For example, “network performance” measures how the platform supporting an individual crypto asset works and how fast the platform processes transactions. “Tokenomics” measures things like the initial supply of a cryptocurrency, details on how that supply can change, and other variables that help determine a token’s value.  Without looking at these and other factors unique to crypto, it’s difficult or even impossible to understand and place a valuation on a crypto asset.  However, a new survey from Broadridge surveyed 2,000 crypto market participants in the United States, U.K. and Canada and found the majority use conventional financial metrics when determining what to invest in. This means trying to apply things like cash flows to assess a cryptocurrency.  Nearly half of respondents said they look at the holdings of a crypto project’s management team — like the breakdown of how many tokens go to a project’s founding team versus its treasury — when making financial decisions. But still, only about 28% of investors consider network performance and only 16% look at tokenomics.  The findings suggest that many investors don’t fully appreciate the importance of crypto-native factors critical to understanding crypto assets. The results also point to the more troubling possibility that some current investors may be making decisions based on an incomplete assessment of the risk-return profiles of particular crypto assets.  The industry can start by translating existing disclosure requirements into crypto-appropriate versions  These conclusions make it more apparent than ever that crypto markets need a disclosure framework to gives investors a better sense of what they’re buying.  Assessing crypto risks, assigning crypto values  No one would suggest that a cryptocurrency functions like a traditional security. And so, a disclosure regime for crypto likely needs to account for crypto-native metrics like network performance and tokenomics and address the key differences between traditional and crypto asset classes.  Moreover, unlike most traditional assets, cryptocurrencies often do not have identifiable or centralized parties responsible for their operations — meaning the parties typically responsible for making regulatory disclosures.  See also: Privacy Isn't Just an Edge Case for Crypto | Opinion  In light of that regulators need to be flexible in their approach towards disclosure recognizing that this asset class does not fit into existing models and take a page from what the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously did for ""asset backed securities"" or how the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) treats commodities, by creating a fit-for-purpose disclosure framework.  What exactly would be included in a fit-for-purpose disclosure framework? To answer that question, regulators and the industry can start by translating existing disclosure requirements into crypto-appropriate versions. (Identifying holes and questions that need to be answered)  Broadridge recently went through exactly that exercise, tracking how and where current disclosure rules could apply to crypto and identifying information that would likely provide investors with the best picture of a project’s risks-and-rewards. That painstaking process revealed even the most basic information, such as how to describe an asset, will differ for crypto. That means not only providing detailed breakdowns of a token, but also of the protocol or app where it resides and its supporting blockchain.  Investors will have to be informed about the consensus mechanism (i.e., proof-of-work or proof-of stake) and the related rewards for that activity (e.g., mining/validation rewards), the token’s governance mechanism and provide a description of the audit process for the relevant code.  The disclosure will have to include an explanation about the smart contract or rights conferred by the crypto token (e.g., voting, dividend, or other economic rights), information relating to the revenue generated by token and operational costs (gas fees, payments to miners, etc.), and other aspects of the underlying tokenomics in plain easy to understand language.  Transforming disclosure with crypto  As regulators create a new framework, the industry shouldn’t merely replicate traditional disclosure practices. The innovations at the heart of crypto create opportunities to transform and improve the ways in which investors and the public receive key information. For crypto assets, the party providing the disclosure could send important information directly to new channels like digital wallets, allowing investors to easily receive disclosures contemporaneous with them being provided to regulators.  See also: IRS Proposed Rule on Digital Asset Broker Reporting Could Kill Crypto | Opinion  Disclosures pushed to investors could have key high-level details displayed in a clear, concise, summarized format with links to more comprehensive information. Because these electronic communications could also contain mechanisms that allow investors to vote on key issues related to the crypto token, the new regime could actually transform disclosure from a one-way communication channel into a new venue for enhanced investor engagement.  Rolling out a universal disclosure policy custom built for crypto assets will help restore investor confidence after a volatile period and unlock the potentially transformative power of crypto.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION,Rob Krugman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/18/its-time-for-a-purpose-built-disclosure-framework-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0dc1e8b4cca5037925d0ee312f42162a65fcbb7-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This plunge, amounting to a staggering 90.57%, comes at a time when the SHIB token is facing a sharp drop in its market price. Typically, lower token prices present more extensive opportunities for token burning as it becomes more affordable to acquire additional SHIB tokens for the purpose of destroying them. However, it appears that the prevailing negative sentiment in the market is dampening the burn attempts. Related Reading: XRP On The Cusp Of Redemption? Unveiling Data-Backed Insights At the time of writing, the SHIB token is trading at $0.00000692 according to CoinGecko, marking a 1.9% decline over the past 24 hours. On a more optimistic note, the token has seen a 1.2% increase in the past seven days. It’s evident that SHIB is experiencing some turbulence in its value. SHIB 24-hour price action. Source: Coingecko Shiba Inu: Path To Revival Yet, Shiba Inu’s burning program is making waves by bucking the trend. In a surprising turn of events, the token’s burn rate surged by over 200%, leading to the elimination of 53 million SHIB tokens and a reduction in its overall supply. This ambitious initiative is part of a strategic effort to make SHIB scarcer and, hopefully, more valuable over time. Source: Shibburn The successful execution of Shiba Inu’s burning program has been cited as one of the potential catalysts for a future increase in SHIB token value. The reduction in token supply can create a sense of scarcity, which often drives demand among investors. Additionally, Shiba Inu’s innovative layer-2 blockchain solution, known as Shibarium, is another factor that could fuel a rally in SHIB’s price. The Rise Of Shibarium Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, was unveiled to the crypto world at the end of August, and it has since made significant strides. The network has achieved several remarkable milestones in the months following its launch. Shibarium’s potential impact on the future of Shiba Inu cannot be underestimated, as it opens up new horizons for this meme-inspired cryptocurrency. SHIB market cap currently at $4.06 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As Shiba Inu embarks on its journey to foster innovation and adapt to the evolving crypto landscape, the development of Shibarium stands out as a beacon of hope. The network’s rapid progress and achievements are a testament to the dedication and creativity of the Shiba Inu development team.

42419448,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERnZ,1697637634,Crypto World Hopeful as California Chases BitLicense in Absence of U.S. Feds,"Even after crypto firms' struggled with New York’s BitLicense, industry representatives see some positives in California's version of the licensing system and praise the listening skills of Governor Gavin Newsom's administration.  Industry lobbyists say they'll keep trying to make changes to California’s new law before it’s implemented in 2025.  Crypto insiders feel they've been burned before in the cauldron of New York’s BitLicense, but they suggest that California’s implementation leaves some room for hope.  With the U.S. Congress and federal regulators mostly absent from efforts to build a new system of rules for digital assets, the states have stepped in to set down some standards, but until now New York was credited with the most wide-reaching law to govern crypto. California is more than a year away from implementing its version, but the industry has noticed the state's willingness to sit down and talk with crypto experts.  ""Others states could take a cue from California’s collaboration with industry to produce law and regulation,"" said Kristopher Klaich, deputy policy director at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had vetoed a similar bill last year, signed Assembly Bill 39 last week, which he said will give the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) ""robust"" regulation and enforcement power over crypto. Newsom also signaled the state will be open to more tinkering when he said that ""ambiguity of certain terms and the scope of this bill will require further refinement"" before its target date in 18 months.  ""It’s clear much more work needs to be done to increase clarity for future licensees and narrow the statute’s scope,"" said Peter Herzog, head of state policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation. ""We’re grateful that Governor Newsom recognized this reality in his signing statement.""  ""The bill has come a long way since last session’s veto of its predecessor,"" Herzog added.  New law  The new law sets up the DFPI as the gatekeeper for digital asset activities, and licensed crypto firms would be subject to examinations, record keeping and fee disclosures to customers.  If it were a country, California by itself would easily be in the top ten global economies, far outpacing New York, according to economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But New York got out way ahead on crypto regulation. The difference – from the perspective of an industry that's highly critical of New York's final product – is that California officials including Newsom apparently listened.  ""That he vetoed a similar bill last year, and he and the bill’s authors were willing to work with industry to improve it, demonstrates that they do not want to cripple the industry in California,"" Klaich said. ""It is a reasonable regulatory regime largely on par with other states’ money transmitter licensing, and notably grants conditional licensing to firms that possess New York’s more onerous BitLicense.""  Still, companies are eyeing the details warily.  New York may have advanced the U.S. regulatory picture for crypto ""but it was largely seen by those in the industry as being overly restrictive when it comes to regulating open-source, decentralized systems,"" said Zachary Townsend, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin-based life insurer Meanwhile.  ""There’s concern that California might be going down the same path as New York, instead of taking a step forward and analyzing what worked well and what didn’t with the N.Y. BitLicense. Because of that, the California bill is being met with caution.""  Taking input  The industry will have more opportunities to weigh in before its July 1, 2025 launch.  ""To me it’s simple: The government has a duty to respond when people are being hurt, and until we license crypto companies, Californians will continue to be frequent targets of financial scams,"" said Timothy Grayson, the bill's author and the chairman of the California Assembly's Banking and Finance Committee, in a statement about his legislation.  The California governor also signed a bill last week that will establish regulations for crypto kiosks.  So why can't the U.S. government approve crypto regulations, too?  Most lawmakers, lobbyists and federal regulators – apart from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler – tend to believe that comprehensive regulation requires a new law. Congress – especially the House of Representatives – has shown some willingness to work on crypto issues. However, the partisan divide there and the Senate's resistance to picking up the baton have left action unlikely in the short term, made worse by House Republicans who fired their speaker and can't quickly replace him even as budget deadlines loom.  For now, that leaves individual regulators. The SEC has been eager to stake its claim to crypto oversight under existing securities laws. Still, most of the relevant U.S. financial regulators have agreed that new laws are in order.  Read More: California 'BitLicense' Bill Signed by Gov.

The bank exemplifies how a lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. is driving financial institutions to look elsewhere to set up their crypto operations.  With U.S. regulators still wrangling their way through a cryptocurrency turf war, some of the world’s largest banks have quietly been preparing for the digital asset economy in other, more mature, jurisdictions.  Standard Chartered, for example, has opted for Dubai, where the bank plans to start safeguarding bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) for institutional clients in the first quarter of 2024. Institutional adoption requires a host of pillars to be in place, said Waqar Chaudry, executive director of innovation at the London-headquartered lender, and that includes safety mechanisms around the regulation itself.  “So that it's not regulation which is in transit, or can suddenly change, which we have seen in some significantly large jurisdictions,” Chaudry said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The rest of the world is moving faster into crypto than the U.S. Leading jurisdictions like Switzerland and Singapore have been joined by places like Germany and the rest of the European Union, where banks are now setting up crypto custody and working with large exchanges to roll out white labeled digital asset services.  “Back in 2018, when places like Singapore and the UAE were busy consulting on crypto assets, some other regions had not even made the distinction between a security and non-security status when it came to crypto assets,” Chaudry said. “For that reason, now we see the difference in maturity in markets where countries like the UAE, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong are beginning to move faster.”  It’s a step-by-step process for Standard Chartered, starting in Dubai, but with an eye on the bank’s strong presence across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. “The good thing is DIFC [Dubai International Financial Centre] allows us to offer services all over the world, technically speaking,” Chaudry said. “So if we have jurisdictional equivalence, and our license allows us to get clients on-boarded from other parts of the world, then we will do so in the interim, until we can actually deploy a local offering into that country.”  Looking into the future, creating crypto settlement mechanisms – to some degree filling the gap left by Signature Bank’s Signet and the Silvergate Settlement Network – might be an attractive proposition from a settlement efficiency and cost management point of view.  “We have existing rails and settlement capability as well as service provision with other traditional custodians; we can service them, we can use them, they can use us,” said Chaudry. “So that network effect will take hold pretty quickly after entities like us enter the market, rather than depending on a single bank network, unlike what recently failed institutions had built for the crypto market.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/18/us-crypto-regulatory-fog-keeps-standard-chartered-rooted-in-uae-asia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21c3e4f70f4938de93f2797fbe20e9450b4f7a32-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LidoDAO Cut Ties With The Solana Network Following Community Vote The proposal was first introduced by Lido on Solana’s peer-to-peer (P2P) team on September 5, due to financial limitations. Following the introduction, the voting program began on September 29, 2023, and was concluded a week later on October 6. Related Reading: Real Reason Behind Ethereum Founder’s Massive ETH ‘Sales’ Exposed The P2P team in charge of the development of Lido on the Solana Network offered the community members two options in the voting program. These included the organization leaving the Solana Network, or providing funds to the organization to sustain its operations on the Solana Network. In the proposal by the P2P team, Lido requested that LidoDAO provide $20,000 per month to fund technical maintenance activities related to sunsetting operations on Solana over the following five months. The proposal also expressed worries about not being able to meet goals in the next year due to the challenging market conditions. “Achieving even 2% of the market share in 2023-2024 seems improbable, particularly in the current Solana market, without any marketing assistance and given Lido DAO’s committee resolution 22 to discontinue all incentives in Solana,” the team’s proposal stated. According to Yuri Mediakov, the P2P team invested a total of $700,000 in Lido on the Solana project to build and support the product in the past year but ended up making $220,000 in revenue, resulting in a net loss of $484,000. Therefore, in order to support the project for the next 12 months, the team would need around $1.5 million. However, at the end of the vote, over 65 million (92.7%) of LDO tokens (voted by token holders) were in favor of sunsetting operations on Solana Network. Meanwhile, 5.1 million (7.2%) of LDO tokens voted in favor of providing funds to the organization to continue its operation on the Solana Network. The total number of Lido (LDO) tokens concluded in the vote was 70.1 million LDO tokens. The organization highlighted in an excerpt that the decision was a necessary one to make despite how difficult it was: Whilst this decision was difficult in the face of numerous strong relationships across the Solana ecosystem, it was deemed a necessity for the continued success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem.

According to LidoDAO, the organization will cease accepting staking requests as of October 16, while users will have to unstake on Solana’s frontend by February 4, 2024. Failure to unstake before the deadline will result in unstaking through the Command Line Interface (CLI). In addition, Voluntary node operator off-boarding will commence on November 17, 2023. Nonetheless, staked Solana (stSOL) token holders are still expected to receive rewards during the sunsetting process. However, Lido’s staking services are now solely supported on Ethereum and Polygon. The P2P team has been working on Lido’s Solana project since acquiring it from Chorus One in March last year.

42419413,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEReH,1697634000,Floki Developers Propose Staking and Utility Token Plans,"Floki (FLOKI) developers plan to introduce a staking feature in return for a new utility token, chief developer “B” told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Wednesday. The staking feature and the new token will increase investor interest in the Floki ecosystem.  The main way to earn the new yet-unnamed token will be by staking FLOKI tokens, which exchanged hands at $0.000017 as of publication time. There won’t be any pre-sale or fundraising for these tokens, and most of the supply can only be earned by staking FLOKI.  “Users will be able to earn the reward token by locking up their FLOKI tokens for a period of between 3 months to 4 years,” B said in the DAO proposal shared with CoinDesk. “We envision this resulting in a significant portion of FLOKI tokens being locked up for an extended period of time, which will significantly reduce the amount of FLOKI tokens in circulation and add significant value to the FLOKI token.”  Staking refers to locking tokens on a platform in return for annualized yield rewards - which may attract investor capital.  The project had hired several new developers to ensure that other Floki-based projects weren’t affected and that the tokenomics of the new token was designed to “ensure long-term development sustainability for this project,” B added.  Floki was fashioned after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed, which spurred the development of popular tokens like dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB). Dog-themed coins were the hottest tokens in 2021 and surged nearly 10,000% during a nine-month period.  The hype, however, fizzled out as a broader crypto bear market weighed down on riskier bets, leading to tokens such as FLOKI to fall as much as 94% from their peak.  Floki developers have since worked on building fundamental protocols within the FLOKI ecosystem to shed the project’s meme coin tag towards a serious DeFi project. Earlier this year, developers released the first part of a metaverse game where players can interact with each other, conduct microtransactions and create a valuable in-game economy.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | FLOKI,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/18/floki-developers-propose-staking-and-utility-token-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users will retain control of their private keys throughout the process.  In March, ether.fi raised $5.3M in a seed round led by North Island VC with the capital used to develop and release the eETH token.  The protocol has deals in place with Balancer, Aura, unshETH, Gravita, Maverick, Pendle and LayerZero, enabling users to benefit from using eETH on the partnered platforms.  “Our goal is to help support Ethereum decentralization by making non-custodial staking easy and accessible.” said Mike Silagadze, CEO of ether.fi. “We are betting on Ethereum as the main smart contract platform that will ultimately become the value settlement layer for the world.

42419431,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERun,1697631641,"DLT Securities Rules Are Here to Stay, EU Official Says","Relaxed EU securities laws designed to encourage distributed ledger technology will likely be permanent, an official said.  Industry concerns over a hard stop to the regime may have inhibited investment in blockchain projects.  BRUSSELS, Belgium – A new European Union pilot to allow securities trades based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is here to stay, an official from the bloc’s executive arm said on Wednesday. The comment comes as the EU tries to alleviate industry fears that the project could be abandoned after just a few years.  The EU is among several global jurisdictions experimenting with the blockchain technology that underpins crypto, which according to one recent study could save financial markets $100 billion per year by freeing up collateral and automating back-office processes.  Starting in April, the EU relaxed its financial services rules allowing securities traders to interact with markets and let exchanges register tokens directly rather than using regulated intermediaries, such as brokers and depositories.  But the potentially short-term nature of the new regime may weaken the business case to invest in those innovative ideas – and Ivan Keller, an official at the European Commission, which initially proposed the rules, appears keen to assuage those fears.  The new legislation “is here to stay,” as, despite a review due to take place after three to six years, legally speaking the current, lighter rules will continue to apply by default, said Keller, who is at the commission’s Securities Market Unit. “It's very unlikely that the DLT pilot would be discontinued.”  Despite the effort put in to designing the new regime, just two official applications have been received, with “maybe five or six serious applications in the pipeline,” Keller said, adding that he would “personally like to see more.”  Applications were a mix of existing licensed multilateral trading facilities, and more innovative structures which combine previously separate trading and settlement functions, Keller said. There was an “implicit preference” for permissioned systems, given requirements to maintain centralized control, he added.  Across the English Channel, the EU’s rival, the U.K., is also hoping to promote innovation via its own five-year DLT securities trials – for which detailed secondary laws could be completed by the end of the year, the Bank of England’s Sasha Mills told CoinDesk at the same event.  Mills, who is the central bank’s executive director for financial market infrastructure, said that any limits on trading would be calibrated to ensure the experiment doesn’t blow up the financial system, adding that “some of the assets within the sandbox would have more of a systemic effect than others.”  Cecilia Skingsley, head of the innovation hub at the Bank for International Settlements, which groups the world’s central banks, said that major securities issuers such as governments had been wary of potential risks, but that wider adoption is “just a matter of time.”  “Typically sovereign issuers and a large corporates want to see how it works in different market sentiments, and make sure that once they get on that stage, nothing goes wrong, at least not for technological reasons,” said Skingsley, who addressed the conference via videolink following a terrorist attack in Brussels on Monday which targeted Swedish nationals.  “I think it would be helpful to demonstrate for legislators and media and society that this is not just hype – this is not just another crypto, but actually something useful for society in the long run.” Skingsley noted.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/18/dlt-securities-rules-are-here-to-stay-eu-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d790e2336e4bda6dd12a8a381eba6cd20977fef-3629x2041.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419430,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERtl,1697631031,First Mover Americas: GBTC Discount Continues to Narrow; Reddit’s Crypto Tokens Plummet,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices     Top Stories  The discount for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Fund (GBTC), the world’s largest bitcoin investment vehicle, narrowed further on Tuesday on optimism a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) might be on its way in the U.S. The gap between GBTC shares and the trust’s net asset value (NAV) shrank to 12%, the closest they have traded to NAV since December 2021, according to data from TradingView. GBTC has traded at a discount since February 2021 and reached a record low of nearly 50% in December last year during the prolonged crypto winter. The company said on Monday it is “operationally ready” to convert GBTC into an ETF upon the SEC’s approval.  New European Union rules that let tax authorities share data on individuals' crypto holdings were formally adopted by the bloc's finance ministers on Tuesday. The document will now be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later. The rules were proposed last year in a bid to block assets from being stashed overseas using crypto and had unanimous support from EU member states with discussions mostly taking place behind closed doors. In May, a copy of the draft bill showed the rules extend an existing law to cover a wide range of digital assets, confirmed on Tuesday to include stablecoins, non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance tokens as well as proceeds from crypto staking. The law, known as the Eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation, forces crypto companies to report information on customers' holdings that will automatically be shared between tax authorities.  Reddit is shuttering its roughly three-year-old blockchain-based Community Points program, reports TechCrunch. ""Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, the resourcing needed was unfortunately too high to justify,"" Tim Rathschmidt, Reddit's director of consumer and product communications, told TechCrunch. ""The regulatory environment has since added to that effort,"" he added. Moons (MOON), the native token of Reddit's r/CryptoCurrency community, was lower by 85% on the news on Tuesday, while Bricks (BRICK), distributed as a reward for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, was down 67%. Donut (DONUT) the token that represents the community points of the r/ethtrader subreddit was off 66%.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows performance of bitcoin (on the left) and gold since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct. 7.  Gold has surged nearly 7.5% since Oct. 7, while bitcoin has continued to trade in familiar price ranges around $28,000.  The leading cryptocurrency, widely touted as digital gold, is yet to draw safe haven demand.

What Awaits ADA Investors This Week,"Cardano (ADA) investors are currently grappling with a critical juncture as the cryptocurrency struggles to maintain its positive momentum within a triangle pattern. Priced at $0.246925 according to CoinGecko, the ADA market is currently navigating through a complex landscape of potential pitfalls and prospects. Despite a 1.3% decline in the last 24 hours and a measly 0.1% dip over the past week, the market sentiment remains cautious, with traders closely monitoring the possibility of a downturn to $0.20. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Climbs 22% – A Close Look At The Factors Behind The Surge At the heart of the current ADA price conundrum lies the intricate triangle pattern, a technical formation that often signifies a period of market indecision and potential trend reversal. Within this pattern, the coin’s price movements are constrained between a converging support trendline and a resistance trendline. The ongoing struggle to sustain a positive cycle hints at a potential bullish breakout. However, the looming threat of a significant plunge to $0.20 keeps many traders at the edge of their seats, anxiously observing the market dynamics. Benjamin Cowen’s Stark Warning Adding to the air of caution, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has sounded an alarm for ADA investors, issuing a grave warning regarding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. In a recent tweet, Cowen highlighted ADA’s declining value in terms of Bitcoin (BTC), predicting a potential drop to as low as 400 satoshis. #ADA / #BTC is breaking down, probably headed to 400 sats pic.twitter.com/ZwYZ0dxS4h — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) October 16, 2023 Cowen’s warning stems from an in-depth analysis of ADA’s price chart, which revealed a troubling trend that has sent ripples of concern across the market. According to Cowen’s analysis, Cardano experienced a critical breakthrough of a key trendline, triggering a phase of accumulation before entering a subsequent downtrend. Despite a brief consolidation phase, ADA’s gradual departure from this period led to the erosion of vital support levels. Currently valued at 890 satoshis per ADA, Cowen anticipates a staggering 50% drop from its present level, urging investors to tread cautiously in the volatile ADA market. ADA market cap currently at $8.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cardano Struggle With Resistance And Support Levels Underlying ADA’s price turmoil is the persistent battle between resistance and support levels. The crucial support at $0.24 has provided a temporary foothold for the cryptocurrency, preventing a more precipitous decline. However, multiple lower-high formations resulting from overhead bearish pressure have cast a shadow over ADA’s short-term prospects, creating a challenging environment for sustained bullish momentum. Related Reading: Polkadot Road To Recovery – Will $4 Mark The Turning Point? Despite these obstacles, ADA’s price action continues to reflect a tenacious effort to resist the downward pressure and retain a foothold within the symmetrical triangle. Yet, the looming threat of a potential downtrend breaking below the support trendline remains a tangible concern for traders and investors alike. As the crypto community awaits further developments, the fate of Cardano’s price trajectory hangs delicately in the balance, with investors bracing for potential fluctuations in the days ahead.

19008348,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555871,1697626835,Bitcoin Dominance Rises: Why Altcoin Buying May Need A Break,"In a recent trend evident on crypto charts, Bitcoin dominance is once again on the rise, prompting some traders and investors to rethink their strategies concerning altcoins. An in-depth analysis of the data, coupled with insights from prominent crypto analysts, unveils several compelling reasons to exercise caution when considering an altcoin purchase at this moment. Historical Precedence Bitcoin’s market dominance – its market cap relative to the entire cryptocurrency market – has historically been a leading indicator of market sentiment. If Bitcoin dominance is increasing, it means that sentiment toward altcoins is waning. In an analysis today, renowned analyst Rekt Capital has warned of this flashing signal, he shared the following chart and tweeted: BTC Dominance has left the “retest zone”. Now in the process of entering an uptrend continuation which could see BTC Dominance revisit the 58% mark for the first time in years. Over the past five months, the Bitcoin dominance saw a consolidation within the ‘retest zone’ after it saw a 10%+ rise since the beginning of the year. BTC dominance pulled back as part of its retest which enabled altcoins to gain some momentum for a short period of time. But, like in mid-2018, BTC is now breaking above the resistance zone, suggesting that 58% could be the next target. Notably, BTC dominance peaked above 71% during the last run in 2021. Altcoin Liquidity Concerns When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it often corresponds to reduced liquidity in the altcoin market. Reduced liquidity can lead to heightened volatility, with price swings potentially wiping out significant portions of invested capital. For investors with a risk-averse profile, such conditions might not be ideal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Thief’s Decade-Long Heist: Solving The Mystery Of The Stolen Silk Road BTC Moreover, recent interest appears to be concentrated primarily on Bitcoin. In times of capitulation and boredom, investors often seek the security and liquidity provided by Bitcoin over altcoins. A driving factor for this is that potential catalysts for the crypto market are Bitcoin-specific, like the halving and the potential approval of a spot ETF. As these events play out, Bitcoin will probably continue to outshine altcoins. More Insights From Top Crypto Analysts Joshua Lim, the former head of derivatives at Genesis Trading and former head of trading strategy at Galaxy Digital, recently weighed in on the ongoing tussle between Bitcoin and Ethereum. “ETH/BTC spot ratio is a major battleground right now,” Lim noted, adding that the rally in BTC/USD was effectively suppressing Ethereum. He highlighted a significant skew in options volume favoring Bitcoin over Ethereum, emphasizing Ethereum’s diminishing allocator interest (options volume skewed 5:1 towards BTC). Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Cap Could Rise By $1 Trillion After Spot ETFs Launch: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, Miles Deutscher, a well-regarded crypto analyst, offered a condensed perspective on the prevailing market sentiment. “We’re in the most difficult market phase… where time capitulation really starts to set in,” Deutscher remarked. He further cautioned retail participants who have been distancing themselves from the market, suggesting that this might be an inopportune moment to do so. Deutscher added, “Accept that BTC is likely to lead in the early stages of the bull run… it’s not wise to fade BTC during this period.” He recommended a “top-down approach to the market,” emphasizing a strategy that starts with the foundational assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, before exploring other altcoins. At press time, BTC traded at $28,585.

The ECB is due to decide later on Wednesday whether to press ahead with its plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which has raised significant concerns over the potential for state control.  “A high standard of privacy and data protection is instrumental in gaining citizens’ trust in this new digital currency,” the European Data Protection Board’s Deputy Chair Irene Loizidou Nicolaidou said in a statement, saying she wanted to “ensure that data protection is embedded early on in the design phase of the digital euro when used both online and offline.”  While the ECB wants to limit how much CBDC an individual can hold, to avoid assets fleeing the conventional banking system, Nicolaidou said she wants to see more decentralized storage of the information needed to enforce that.  There should also be a “privacy threshold” below which no transaction is traced for anti-money laundering purposes and greater clarity over how a fraud prevention mechanism will work, Nicolaidou said.  The EDPB is responsible for policing the bloc’s strict privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and its opinion is likely to be influential with lawmakers already concerned about privacy implications.  “Protecting the privacy of citizens as we work towards a possible digital euro remains a top priority” for the European Commission, which in June proposed laws to underpin the central bank digital currency, financial services commissioner Mairead McGuiness in a post on X in response to the privacy watchdog’s view.

19006283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555867,1697623228,Real Reason Behind Ethereum Founder’s Massive ETH ‘Sales’ Exposed,"A crypto wallet owned by the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has seen a series of transactional activities lately, piquing the interest of crypto community members at a time when Ethereum selling pressures are rising. Following this, Buterin has taken the initiative to address the concerns regarding his recent transfer of digital assets to multiple exchanges. Ethereum Co-Founder Discloses Truth Behind Multi-Transfers In a recent post on Warp Cast, a decentralized social network, Russian-Canadian computer programmer and founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin publicized the real reason behind the latest ETH transfers made via his wallet address. Related Reading: BlackRock Reacts To False Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval News In A Positive Way Buterin explained to the public that the large-scale ETH transactions that were performed using his wallet were not sold by him. He stated that over the years, he has mostly focused on donating large sums of Ethereum funds to charity organizations and other projects. He further solidified his claims saying that he had not sold ETH for personal profits since 2018. “If you see an article saying ‘Vitalik sends XXX ETH to [exchange]’, it’s not actually me selling, it’s almost always me donating to some charity or nonprofit or other projects, and the recipient selling because, well, they have to cover expenses,” Buterin stated. Buterin is well-known for his philanthropic acts toward charity organizations and medical interventions. The Ethereum co-founder made headlines in 2021, after donating $1 billion worth of SHIB tokens to a COVID-19 relief fund in India. Additionally, in February 2023, Buterin donated $150,000 to Anka Relief to fund a crypto aid project that would support Türkiye after its recent earthquake experiences. Although there have been many proofs of Buterin’s propensity to donate to multiple charities, the crypto community has remained skeptical and vigilant, relentlessly monitoring the Ethereum founder’s cryptocurrency activities, as well as these recent high-value ETH transactions. ETH price settles above $1,570 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Spokesperson Reveals $15 Million ETH Transfer From Kanro Charity According to data from PeckShield Alert, a blockchain security and auditing firm, Vitalik Buterin recently made a large-scale transaction of $15 million USDC to the Gemini Exchange.

42419415,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERgL,1697623200,(One Part of) Sam Bankman-Fried's Defense Strategy Starts Paying Off,"All three of Sam Bankman-Fried’s “inner circle” members have now testified against the FTX founder, and all three have presented similarly on the witness stand: clearly rehearsed, adamant that the FTX founder was in charge and careful not to stray too far from their well-practiced narratives. They were confident when responding to prosecutors, but were less polished when confronted by the defense.  Each of the insiders have pleaded guilty to their own charges – complicating the case for Bankman-Fried, but also for their own credibility; staying in prosecutors' good graces could help them secure a lighter sentence. Two of them, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, testified that they hoped to get zero prison time.  At the heart of prosecutors’ case against Bankman-Fried is a straightforward sequence of events: He took customers’ money even after promising not to – then lost it all. It’s a tight story, and Bankman-Fried’s defense attorneys have struggled to weave together any semblance of a narrative to dispute it.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  The hard facts of the case, combined with the guilty pleas and insider testimony (at least five former employees have testified or will testify for the prosecution before the end of the trial) have made it difficult for Bankman-Fried’s lawyers to mount a compelling case.  But the Bankman-Fried defense team, led by attorney Mark Cohen, does have a strategy: If certain core facts of the FTX saga can’t be disputed, they can at least be reframed. What if everything Bankman-Fried did was, in the words of Cohen’s opening statement, “completely reasonable?”  And while they did not state this explicitly, the cross-examinations of Singh, Wang, Caroline Ellison and Adam Yedidia – FTX insiders whose recollections were tested, and whose past statements were probed for inconsistencies — revealed another element of the defense’s strategy: If witnesses cannot be wholly discredited, the defense can at least sow doubt in their memories and their credibility.  SBF defense lawyer Cohen’s strategy  Cohen only needs to provide jurors with “reasonable doubt.” A single unconvinced – or perplexed – juror would be enough to at least hang the jury.  Cohen and his team continue to reckon with Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has made his exasperation with the defense attorneys’ questioning style clear. He rebuked Cohen twice within the first 20 minutes of Tuesday's testimony. But Bankman-Fried’s lawyers finally seemed to land a few hits with their cross-examination of Singh on Tuesday.  Cohen drew Singh into acknowledging that – despite his professed discomfort with much of what he was asked to do at FTX – he still lived in a luxury penthouse, made political donations on the company’s behalf and backdated transactions to mislead the world (and regulators) about FTX’s revenues in 2021.  At various points, Cohen walked Singh through statements he supposedly made to prosecutors in the months ahead of the trial. Singh repeatedly said he did not remember what he specifically told the Department of Justice, even after he was presented with notes from his meetings with the FBI.  As to the harder-to-dispute pieces of Singh’s testimony, Cohen picked apart some of his more lurid claims in an attempt to show the jury that they were lacking substance. In Cohen’s FTX story, Bankman-Fried’s nine-figure deals with sports stadiums and celebrity power-brokers – excessive spending of FTX user funds, according to Singh and prosecutors – constituted reasonable public relations expenditures. FTX’s lavish $30 million Bahamas penthouse wasn’t over-the-top, suggested Cohen, but a perfectly reasonable dwelling for people who genuinely believed themselves billionaires or millionaires.  And then there’s the mechanics of the alleged crimes. In Cohen’s telling, Alameda’s massive borrows from FTX made sense when Singh and others honestly believed Alameda had enough money to cover what they took. Cohen also drilled in on the much-scrutinized “special privileges” at FTX that, according to Singh, allowed Alameda to infinitely borrow and withdraw from the exchange’s users. According to Cohen, the privileges were a necessary byproduct of Alameda’s role as an FTX market-maker.  And what about the Alameda bank accounts that FTX quietly used to store user funds? In prosecutors' framing, the accounts made FTX into Alameda’s personal piggy bank and presented an obvious conflict of interest. But as Cohen reminded the jury, the bank accounts were used when FTX couldn’t open its own, and Singh concurred in cross-examination that he didn’t initially find the FTX-Alameda banking arrangement problematic (though prosecutors have said this is still fraud, logistics and intentions be damned).  The effect of these inconsistencies may have been undercut somewhat by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos, who had Singh confirm he'd never seen the notes he was presented with prior to Tuesday. Likewise, Roos confirmed that Singh forfeited the house he bought with FTX customer funds, a purchase Cohen spent a large amount of time questioning Singh about. But it’s unclear how much of an impact the rapid back-and-forth Roos had with Singh may have had on a jury after several hours of Cohen chipping away at the former FTX engineering head’s story.  We wrote a few days ago that the defense’s strategy was opaque, acknowledging that the team hadn't begun presenting its own case and that the attorneys were limited in their questioning to issues raised during direct examination.  Cohen’s questions to Singh, however, provided a clear preview into part of Bankman-Fried’s plan to prove his innocence. But even during the defense team’s strongest showing yet, Cohen still struggled to piece together a cohesive story.  Singh was far from a cooperative witness, and Cohen grew visibly frustrated when most of his set-ups fell flat. In one notable exchange, Cohen tried to tee up a kind of admission from Singh. He seemed to want the witness to say that Alameda’s giant FTX borrows felt kosher while he was at FTX – proof for the jury that the borrows weren’t obviously cynical.  “Did you have a view that Alameda could borrow, so long as borrows weren’t in excess of assets?” Cohen asked Singh, clearly hoping for some variation of a “yes” answer. Singh, however, seemed to sense a trap. He answered obliquely: there were many “scenarios” where Singh didn’t think Alameda’s borrows were “appropriate,” he told Cohen. The lawyer let out an audible “sigh,” looked down and spent the next several moments leafing through the pile of papers on his podium. While we’re finally starting to see glimmers of Bankman-Fried’s defense strategy, his lawyers still face an uphill battle.  — Nikhilesh De, Sam Kessler  Courtroom scenes  Nishad Singh’s hands were in his pockets anytime he wasn’t sitting down, whether that was when he stood by his seat watching the jury file in and out or if he was walking to the witness booth.  There was a brief interlude during Singh’s cross-examination where his monitor was blank, requiring two different court employees to resolve.  Once again, the crowd watching the trial was relatively thin on Tuesday, though it still warranted an overflow room. The audience numbers will likely stay in the 30-40 person range until Bankman-Fried himself testifies (if he does).  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  The Department of Justice laid out its expected witnesses through the rest of the week: Chanel Medrano (possibly an FTX customer), Peter Easton (a financial forensics expert), Cory Gaddis (a member of Google’s investigations team), Eliora Katz (a former FTX lobbyist), Paige Owens (possibly an FTX customer), Bob Boroujerdi (a former Third Point managing director who showed up in a court exhibit seemingly discussing an FTX investment) and Can Sun (FTX’s former general counsel).  Prosecutors did not mention Elan Dekel (FTX customer), Delaney Ornelas (former Alameda Research and/or FTX US employee) or Ramnik Arora (former FTX head of product and investor relations) on Tuesday, though they did say that due to travel issues, some witnesses will not be able to testify until next week. The trial may end for the day early on Thursday, giving both parties time to sort out some issues before the DOJ rests its case on Oct. 26.  After that, the defense team foresees calling witnesses for one and a half weeks.  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH,"Nikhilesh De, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/18/one-part-of-sbfs-defense-strategy-starts-paying-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419418,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERhN,1697618931,Bitcoin Nears $29K as Fidelity ETF Amendment Bumps Bullish Sentiment,"Bitcoin jumped to a two-month high on Wednesday after Fidelity joined the ranks of firms amending their spot bitcoin ETF filings.  The amendments could indicate open communication lines between the firms and regulators.  Bitcoin (BTC) shot to as high as $28,817 earlier today as amendments to a spot bitcoin ETF filing in the U.S. fired up bullish sentiment.  The largest cryptocurrency added 2.8% in the past 24 hours, reaching a two-month high and leading gains among major tokens. The advance extended its weekly rally to almost 7%.  Asset management giant Fidelity filed an amendment to its proposed spot bitcoin ETF, the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Tuesday, specifying how it will safeguard customers’ bitcoin in custody accounts and disclose risks related to the shaky regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies, among other factors.  Fidelity follows Ark Invest and Invesco, which also recently amended their spot bitcoin ETF filings. Invesco refiled on Oct. 11 and Ark Invest followed suit a day later. These developments are likely a sign of ongoing discussions between prospective ETF providers and the SEC – helping spark bullish sentiment among traders, market observers said.  “More proof that potential spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are in communication with SEC regarding changes/amendments required for SEC to consider approving,” James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, posted today on X (formerly Twitter). “Positive signs (in my opinion).”  Some firms expect the approval, when it occurs, to add at least $1 trillion to overall market capitalization, which is currently at $1.1 trillion, in coming months.  Speculation of a spot bitcoin ETF getting approved made the rounds earlier this week, causing bitcoin to jump almost 10% in a move BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested illustrated the “pent up” investor interest for the crypto market. Prices continued to rise even after the rumor was shown to be false.  Meanwhile, some analysts forecast bitcoin will touch $29,400 in coming days, citing increasing volumes.  “We continue to see continued elevated trading volumes. We view this as good news, given that the price is not high by historical standards,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk. “It is an influx of fresh buyers rather than an active exit from the market.”  “Buyer interest is concentrated around bitcoin.

42419433,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUERwr,1697618557,Ether Could Continue to Underperform Bitcoin as U.S. Bond Market 'Dis-Inversion' Resumes,"Ether (ETH) has underperformed bitcoin (BTC) significantly this year and the trend could continue.  That's an apparent signal from the U.S. Treasury government bond market, where the gap between yields on the 10- and three-month notes has resumed the recovery higher toward zero in a move known as dis-inversion, or steepening, in bond market parlance.  Since early this year, crypto prices have had an inverse relationship with the above-mentioned yield spread, gaining ground during inversion and losing value with dis-inversion. While bitcoin's 90-day inverse correlation with the yield spread has weakened to -0.42 from -0.8 in the first half, ether's remains strong near -0.75, according to data tracked by Coinbase.  Yield spread refers to the difference between yields of differing debt offerings, such as bonds or other fixed-income assets.  So, the recent dis-inversion of the yield spread could hurt ether more than bitcoin, more so as optimism from potential spot ETF launch could keep the latter insulated. The conclusion is also consistent with the long-prevailing crypto market narrative that considers ether analogous to rate-sensitive technology stocks while seeing bitcoin as 'digital gold.'  The spread has dis-inverted, or risen, by 29 basis points to -0.65% in the past seven days to the highest since early January, data shows. The ascent has more than reversed the brief inversion from -0.80% to -0.94% seen early this month.  The spread between 10-year and three-month yields is one of the most widely tracked sections of the yield curve. The negative spread has historically been viewed as a precursor to economic recessions, with eventual dis-inversion/steepening marking major equity market tops.  The spread fell by 130 basis points to -1.92 in the year's first five months. Most of bitcoin and ether's year-to-date gains of 72% and 32% happened in the year's first half.  The spread between the 10- and two-year notes, another widely followed bond market gauge, has also dis-inverted by nearly 70 basis points to -0.34% in three months, raising the risk of broad-based risk aversion in financial markets.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/18/ether-could-continue-to-underperform-bitcoin-as-us-bond-market-dis-inversion-resumes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9c1960f3ca4c2c0d3dd8e0ea017e46964b3898a-1195x896.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The current market situation involves a struggle with the immediate dynamic resistance level, leading to a state of uneasiness among traders. Bitcoin SV, a Bitcoin fork, is now the most profitable cryptocurrency out of the top 100 by market capitalization. Related Reading: Polkadot Road To Recovery – Will $4 Mark The Turning Point? The value of the world’s cryptocurrency market increased to $1.09 trillion at the time of writing, a 1.4% gain in a day. On Tuesday, ETH increased by about 0.1% to $1,585, while BTC was up 2.6% at $28,466.60. SEC Influence On Crypto Rally And BSV Price Spike The recent rally in cryptocurrency prices was primarily driven by optimism about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving a Bitcoin ETF. This sentiment was strengthened when the SEC chose not to appeal the Grayscale lawsuit. However, there was a spike in BSV prices due to a false report from CoinTelegraph claiming that the SEC was anticipating the iShares Bitcoin Trust, pushing Bitcoin to nearly $30,000 before it quickly dropped. At the time of writing, BSV occupies the No. 48 spot and was trading at $39.40, up 22% in the last seven days, data form crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. The RSI for BSV is 67.58, the same as it was yesterday. This RSI level is slowly approaching overbought zone, which could indicate that a little correction or consolidation in the price of BSV is imminent. BSV market cap currently at $757 million. Chart: TradingView.com Bitcoin SV is displaying positive indicators in terms of trading volume and market capitalization. Its market cap has risen by 1.22% to reach $757 million, and its 24-hour trading volume has surged by a significant 83% to $238 million. This increased trading activity suggests growing trader interest and the potential for BSV’s price to continue moving upward.

Bitcoin SV Price At Resistance Zone: Potential For An Upside Break Meanwhile, the current price of BSV is encountering a horizontal resistance zone ranging from $38.5 to $40.6. This resistance zone is also in alignment with the Fibonacci 0.5 level, at $39.75. The possibility of a successful breach of this resistance level may indicate a sustained higher trajectory for Bitcoin SV. Concurrently, there exists a proximate support region ranging from $33.85 to $36.10, which aligns with the Fibonacci 0.618 level of $35.89 and the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $34.79. In the event that the BSV price is unable to maintain its position above the designated support zone, there is a possibility of an impending negative trend.

19001463,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555843,1697614347,‘Extra Bullish’ On XRP? Crypto Analyst Pinpoints The Perfect Timing,"In a detailed chart analysis of the XRP/USD trading pair, seasoned crypto analyst Dark Defender has shed light on several significant indicators that point towards a bullish trajectory for the popular cryptocurrency. Taking to Twitter to share his insights, Dark Defender remarked, “Morning All. Hope you had a great weekend. XRP in the daily time frame is still within our price range. Above $0.52 – $0.55 is a challenge, first to break the resistance & stay above the Ichimoku Clouds.” This sentiment aligns with the depicted interaction of XRP with the Ichimoku Cloud on the chart, a renowned technical tool that offers insights on support, resistance, and momentum. Furthermore, the analyst outlined specific price brackets, stating that XRP is: “Bullish above $0.55 – $0.66, Extra Bullish between $0.66 – $1.33, and envisions a New All-Time High Above $1.966.” These delineations echo the marked areas on the chart, notably the “Bullish Area” and “Extra Bullish Area.” When To Get Extra Bullish On XRP One of the primary takeaways from the chart is the “RSI Double Tap” event. For those unfamiliar, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. An RSI reading below 30 is typically considered oversold, while an RSI above 70 is seen as overbought. The “Double Tap” indicates that XRP has been undervalued in mid-August and mid-September, but found a strong foundation. Related Reading: Elliott Wave Theory Forecasts XRP Price Of $27 By 2026: Crypto Analyst Further boosting the bullish sentiment is the declining trendline in the RSI that the XRP price recently broke out of, implying a potential shift in momentum. Remarkably, the RSI broke out of the downtrend for the first time at the end of September. However, the XRP price could not keep this momentum, and as a result, the RSI once again fell below the trend line drawn by Dark Defender. But in recent days, another breakout has occurred, which could predict bullish price movements. Moving onto the price action, the chart depicts XRP’s consistent interaction with the Ichimoku Cloud, a renowned technical tool that offers insights on support, resistance, and momentum. The fact that XRP is inching closer to entering the ‘Bullish Area’ of the Ichimoku Cloud is quite significant. This could mean that the asset is on the verge of a bullish reversal if it climbs back above $0.52. Moreover, the chart also demarcates two distinct areas labeled “Bullish Area” and “Extra Bullish Area.” The latter is situated between the $0.66 and $1.33 mark, suggesting that if XRP manages to break above the lower boundary and hold above this price point, we might witness intensified bullish momentum. The XRP price could then more than double before major resistance is expected at the $1.33 level by Dark Defender. Related Reading: Ripple Job Posting Sparks IPO Rumors, Will XRP Price Finally Cross $100? Additionally, the Fibonacci retracement levels, drawn from the peak to the trough of the price movement, emphasize the 50% level at $0.5286 as a critical resistance point. Breaking through this level might propel XRP toward the “Extra Bullish Area” as specified by the analyst. Concluding his tweet, Dark Defender aptly stated, “The clock is ticking,” indicating the expectation that the cryptocurrency could perform a strong bullish move into the “Bullish Area” between $0.55 and $0.66 at any time. In summation, while the crypto market remains unpredictable, the technical indicators for XRP, combined with Dark Defender’s analysis, suggest a promising bullish trajectory. But as always, investors should conduct thorough research and remain cautious in their investment decisions. At press time, XRP traded at $0.4888.

The crypto exchange’s trading volume fell around 17% sequentially and by about 52% year-on-year, the Berenberg report said, citing The Block. Coinbase will report its third-quarter results on Nov. 2.  “We continue to view COIN’s consumer take rate as being at risk of compression due to competition for market share within a lower volume crypto space,” the bank said.  Analyst led by Mark Palmer said that, “The primary driver of our cautious stance towards Coinbase Global is not our concern about the company’s operating performance during the next couple of quarters, but rather on the threats to its business from the various regulatory actions and litigations that it faces in the U.S., as well as others that it could face in the future as the regulatory crackdown on crypto continues.”  The note said that political headwinds could blunt the impact of the exchange’s ramped-up lobbying efforts, adding that recent headlines about Hamas’ use of crypto are likely to make the question of crypto’s legal status “even more elusive.”  Despite the ongoing crypto winter and the various regulatory challenges faced by Coinbase, its shares are trading at a valuation close to that at which they traded in late 2021, which was the height of the last crypto boom, the report added, noting that the stock has risen more than 112% this year versus a 72% gain for bitcoin (BTC) and a 29% uplift for the Nasdaq stock index.  Berenberg reiterated its hold rating on Coinbase stock and the $39 price target. Coinbase shares closed at $77.46 on Tuesday.

CryptoQuant says that if the issuers that have applied to list bitcoin ETFs put 1% of their Assets Under Management (AUM) to these ETFs, approximately $155 billion could enter the bitcoin market. This represents almost a third of bitcoin's current market capitalization. Should this scenario occur, it would hypothetically push bitcoin's price to between $50,000 and $73,000.  Historically, during previous bull markets, bitcoin's market capitalization has grown 3-5 times more than its realized capitalization. This suggests that for every $1 of fresh money entering the bitcoin market, the market capitalization could increase by $3-$5, CryptoQuant added.  Bitcoin recently momentarily jumped to $30,000 after Cointelegraph published a false report about a spot bitcoin ETF being approved. According to some observers, the frenzied bullish price action would keep bears at bay for some time.  ""Nobody will dare to short BTC now for the foreseeable future. Even if this Cointelegraph news was false, BTC can still grind higher in anticipation of the approval,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said in a Telegram broadcast.  The bullish sentiment is also evident from the continued narrowing of the GBTC discount to lowest in nearly two years.  The crypto market capitalisation first crossed the $1 trillion mark in January 2021. At press time, the total market cap stood at $1.13 trillion, with bitcoin accounting for over 50% of the tally.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/18/spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-could-add-1-trillion-to-crypto-market-cap-cryptoquant-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6dc7064754944a78fdbff72a541b9ccea974ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It could start a decent increase if there is a close above the $220 resistance. BNB price is slowly moving higher toward the $220 resistance against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $210 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $211.5 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair might gain bullish momentum if there is a daily close above $220. BNB Price Remains In A Range This past week, BNB price again retested the $200-$202 support zone. The bears made another attempt to clear the key $200 support, but they failed. A low was formed near $203 before the price started a decent increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $210 and $212 levels. The price tested the main $220 resistance. A high is formed near $219.2 and the price is now consolidating above the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $203 swing low to the $220 high.

Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $215.5 level. The next resistance sits near the $220 level. A clear move above the $220 zone could send the price further higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $235. A close above the $235 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $250 resistance. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $211 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $207 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $203 swing low to the $220 high. If there is a downside break below the $207 support, the price could drop toward the $202 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $185 level.

18987992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555812,1697590843,Bitcoin Thief’s Decade-Long Heist: Solving The Mystery Of The Stolen Silk Road BTC,"In 2012, a staggering 50,000 Bitcoin (BTC) were stolen from the infamous Silk Road, an illicit dark web marketplace. Over the years, the value of the stolen BTC skyrocketed to $3 billion, making it one of the most significant mysteries in cryptocurrency. However, nearly a decade later, a critical mistake by the thief led to a breakthrough in the case, allowing the IRS-CI (Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation) to crack the puzzle. CNBC has obtained exclusive footage that reveals how investigators meticulously connected the dots, ultimately leading to the unmasking of the perpetrator behind the Bitcoin heist. Silk Road Bitcoin Heist Unraveled The story begins in Athens, Georgia, an unsuspecting college town familiar with typical misdemeanors. On the night of March 13, 2019, 28-year-old Jimmy Zhong, a local computer expert, made an unusual 911 call to report the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin from his home. Per the report, the investigation into the theft from Zhong’s residence initially yielded no suspects. The Athens-Clarke County Police Department, inexperienced in crypto-related cases, struggled to make headway. Related Reading: Time To Cash Out? Bitcoin’s 4-Hour RSI Triggers Sell Indicator In a quest for answers, Zhong sought the assistance of local private investigator Robin Martinelli. Although not well-versed in cryptocurrencies, Martinelli was determined to crack the case. Martinelli meticulously examined Zhong’s extensive home surveillance system and stumbled upon a crucial piece of evidence—a slender figure captured in the footage from the night of the crime. Little did Zhong know that while reporting his stolen Bitcoin, a team of IRS agents worked tirelessly to solve the 2012 Silk Road hack. However, the hacker’s identity remained concealed until a tiny slip-up occurred. In September 2019, the hacker mistakenly transferred around $800 worth of BTC to a cryptocurrency exchange that adhered to established banking regulations, including “know your customer” procedures. To the investigators’ surprise, the account used for the transaction was registered in Jimmy Zhong’s name, linking him to the stolen Silk Road funds. The IRS contacted the Athens-Clarke County Police Department, seeking collaboration to build a solid case against Zhong. United by a shared objective, Lt. Jody Thompson, IRS-CI special agent Trevor McAleenan, and Shaun MaGruder, CEO of cyber intelligence company BlockTrace, formed a team. Armed with evidence, they obtained a federal search warrant for Zhong’s residence. On November 9, 2021, a large team of officers raided Zhong’s home, delivering the shocking news that he was the prime suspect. From Creator To Thief? Investigations revealed that Zhong, an early coder allegedly involved in the development of Bitcoin since its inception in 2009, had played a role in perfecting the technology. In an ironic twist, a hacker involved in the creation of Bitcoin had transformed into one of the most prominent BTC thieves in history. Zhong was charged with wire fraud, pleaded guilty, and received a sentence of one year and a day in federal prison, starting on July 14, 2023. Zhong could not retain the illicit funds despite his immense fortune in stolen BTC. The US government seized the assets, initiating a process for victims of the Silk Road hack to reclaim their lost Bitcoin. However, no claimants came forward, and the government sold the seized Bitcoin, with the proceeds likely to be shared with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department as a token of appreciation for their assistance.

In his statement to the judge, Zhong admitted that the stolen Bitcoin had made him feel important, but ultimately, his actions had only benefited the government financially. While the original crime of the Bitcoin theft from Zhong’s Athens residence remains unsolved, the arrest and conviction of Zhong have brought closure to one of the most significant cryptocurrency crimes of our time.

Another report by “Spreakaway” on X alleges that one of Fantom’s team members also lost $3.4 million. Fantom Foundation Falls Victim To Phishing Attack Fantom Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Fantom ecosystem. On the other hand, Fantom is a scalable, layer-1 blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. Like the world’s most valuable network, the platform supports the deployment of smart contracts. For clarity, Fantom’s network was not hacked; the foundation’s wallets were compromised. Related Reading: Time To Cash Out? Bitcoin’s 4-Hour RSI Triggers Sell Indicator According to CertiK, the Fantom Foundation lost $470,000 on Fantom and at least $187,000 on Ethereum. Following the attack, Etherscan data show that the scammers consolidated funds into one account, holding at least $7 million of various coins. The address has already been marked and identified as a facilitator of multiple phishing campaigns impacting crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Reports on Reddit show that Fantom Foundation fell victim to a “zero day” exploit on Chrome, a web browser, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands worth of FTM. In a screenshot of a Telegram conversation said to have been shared by a Fantom admin, the foundation acknowledged that “some” of their wallets were “drained.” They are actively tracking the movement of stolen funds. Zero Day Exploit, FTM Sinks Even Lower A zero-day exploit is a vulnerability unknown to the developer or its tech team, who might be able to fix it. Because the flaw isn’t known to the team, the threat actor can exploit it until it is patched. This is why zero-day exploits can be consequential, especially for DeFi protocols whose infrastructure relies on flawed software. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Moves $32.4 Million In SHIB, Large Sell Incoming? In the same screenshot shared on Reddit, a representative of Fantom Foundation said they didn’t update their browser to the latest version. The latest Chrome browser update, version 118.0.5993.70, was released on October 11. Following this news, FTM fell roughly 5% and is now rocking close to multi-month lows. If bears press on, the coin may drop below 2022 lows. As such, it will reverse all gains made in the first half of 2023. At this year’s peaks, FTM prices rose to as high as $0.65 in February 2023 before contracting to spot rates. The coin is trading at approximately $0.17 and under intense selling pressure.
