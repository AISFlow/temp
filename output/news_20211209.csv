42396388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2vWV,1639092600,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Falls Below $49K as Trading Volume Weakens, Altcoins See Red","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin fell as U.S. stocks sagged and the U.S. dollar strengthened.  Technician’s take: Buying activity remains weak, which reduces the chance of a significant price rise into January.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $48,123 -4.7%  Ether (ETH): $4,183 -5.3%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,667 -0.7%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,754 -0.0001%  Nasdaq: $15,517 -1.7%  Gold: $1,775 -0.4%  Market moves  Bitcoin fell toward $48,000 on Thursday, sliding nearly 5% after hovering over $50,000 for much of the previous two days.  Trading volume of the No.1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization across major centralized exchanges, however, continued to drop.  The majority of the crypto market was also in red: Ether was down by more than 5% to around $4,000. The bearish market performance occurred as U.S. stocks fell and the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, rose by 0.28%.  As CoinDesk reported, a strengthened U.S. dollar brings downside pressure on bitcoin’s prices.  “The long-term bull case remains for bitcoin, but everything in the short-term seems bearish,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in an email. “Bitcoin will need to overcome growing expectations for a stronger dollar, an extended altcoin season and short-term bearishness for risk assets as Omicron derails reopening momentum.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Drops Below $50K; Support Between $43K-$45K  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to struggle below the $50,000 resistance level.  The short-term downtrend over the past month remains in effect, which could limit further upside beyond $50,000-$60,000.  The cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past 24 hours, although support around the 200-day moving average (currently at $46,500) could stabilize the current pullback.  BTC buying activity remains weak despite several oversold signals on the charts. That reduces the chance of a significant price increase heading into January, especially given the loss of upside momentum on the weekly and monthly charts.

Mastercard launched the Start Path program in 2014 as a way to help later-stage startups scale their businesses. Now the company’s Start Path Crypto unit will be working with smart-contract builder Ava Labs, AI-focused mobile banking app Envel, peer-to-peer savings platform Kash, bitcoin banking app LVL and crypto rewards platform NiftyKey.  Ava Labs is best known for building the Avalanche blockchain, an Ethereum competitor that facilitates decentralized applications (dapps) and the creation of custom blockchains on its ecosystem. The total value locked (TVL) in Avalanche’s DeFi ecosystem is around $12.6 billion, according to DeFi Llama. TVL represents the dollar value of all tokens locked in the smart contracts of a decentralized lending project.  “Whether it’s enhancing financial freedom or a new value-added service using stablecoins, we believe our new cohorts of Start Path crypto and digital assets companies combined with Mastercard’s expertise in the space will accelerate access to new ways to pay and prioritize choice for consumers and businesses,” Jess Turner, Mastercard’s executive vice president of new digital infrastructure and fintech, said in a statement.  Competitor Visa launched a similar accelerator program called “Fast Track” in 2019 and has been adding to its list of partners, which include crypto lending platform Cred and bitcoin lightning startup LastBit.  “Mastercard is setting an example for leaders across all industries on how to embrace, rather than combat innovation,” John Wu, Ava Labs’ president told CoinDesk. “We look forward to working with projects and partners in the Start Path program to accelerate the positive impacts blockchain technology will have for individuals and institutions across the world.”  Read more: Mastercard Outlines 3-Pronged Strategy to Support the Growing Crypto Community",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/ava-labs-among-startups-chosen-for-mastercards-crypto-accelerator-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/794ee300a70b26882bfe364cfa56852e2f804d36-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initiative is the latest among crypto companies looking to meet growing demand and move the needle on cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange rather than as a store of value.  Cardholders will be allowed to open a line of credit to get cash to spend on the card, using cryptocurrency as collateral, with rates starting at 0%. Rates will vary by region.

Due to its low taxes, laid back rhythm and Suarez’s open embrace of crypto, “Magic City” was a clear winner in the exodus of tech workers from major tech centers in California and New York during the coronavirus pandemic. Several crypto firms relocated permanently.  Suarez’s open call to crypto is more than rhetoric: he took a paycheck in bitcoin and is working on ways to accept taxes and pay municipal employees in the currency. He also announced MiamiCoin, built on the Bitcoin adjacent blockchain, Stacks, which could someday pay a recurring BTC stimulus to Miami citizens.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s “Most Influential 2021″ series.  What was the biggest lesson from 2021?  I’ve learned how extensive the network of crypto stakeholders truly is and I’ve learned about cryptocurrency’s democratizing impact on the future of wealth for every American. One thing that has stood out to me, in particular, has been my realization of the lack of faith in fiat currencies that are being manipulated by people who are making decisions that impact the most vulnerable in our country.  What was your biggest success?  We’ve had many big successes this year, from having our first employee to be paid in bitcoin to being the first mayor in the U.S. to accept their paycheck in bitcoin – but I think the biggest success of all has been staking a percentage of our MiamiCoin rewards to begin the process of giving a dividend yield to our residents. This initiative will not only empower all of our residents with the knowledge and understanding of bitcoin, but also, in the process, is creating a dynamic where the government is innovating and creating wealth to distribute to its residents.  Name one big plan for crypto in Miami in 2022.  The most fundamental part of our plan for 2022 is expanding the access and ubiquity of crypto and coupling that with educational resources to prepare every Miamian for the inevitable future of our economy.  How is crypto going to change the world by 2030?  I think that crypto and Web 3 have the potential to completely revolutionize the dynamic between consumers and the creative class, particularly people like designers, builders and innovators. We’re going to see people with the resources to be the change they want to see in the world, and they’re going to have a platform unlike ever before to share that vision.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/07/most-influential-40-mayor-francis-x-suarez,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90281e5997ce710017219870dafb017368eb547f-976x976.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396385,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2vVW,1639085845,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips as China’s Evergrande Defaults, Altcoin Outperformance Could Fade","Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Thursday after Fitch Ratings labeled China’s Evergrande Group as an official defaulter. Equities also drifted lower as traders appeared to be concerned about the risk of a global slump resulting from China’s credit woes.  Bitcoin dipped below $50,000 and was down about 4% over the past 24 hours. One standout, however, was XRP, which was up about 3% over the same period.  Meanwhile, analysts are trying to make sense of the dispersion among crypto returns over the past month. For example, bitcoin’s market share relative to the overall crypto market share, or the BTC dominance ratio, fell to its lowest level since September, as shown in the chart above. The decline in BTC’s dominance ratio reflects the recent outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  “Any sustained period when the share of BTC’s market cap fell below 40% was in January-March and April-June periods in 2018,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “After that, the BTC domination has recovered with altcoins’ deeper crash, called later the crypto winter,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  The potential recovery in BTC’s relative market share could indicate a lower appetite for risk among investors.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $47,764, -6.0%  Ether (ETH): $4,134, -6.6%  S&P 500: -0.7%  Gold: $1,776, -0.4%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.492%  For now, analysts are monitoring the correlation between bitcoin and equities, which can reflect investor sentiment toward speculative assets.  “As of recent weeks, bitcoin has surfaced more like a risk asset – correlations against U.S. equities spike above 0.6 the past few days alongside the sell-off in technology stocks last Friday,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, a crypto investment firm, wrote in a report on Thursday. “However, crypto assets did not see the same rebound that U.S. equities had earlier this week,” Neo wrote.  Crypto fund inflows slow  Investors pulled $40 million from crypto investment products during the sell-off last Friday, which contributed to lower inflows totaling $184 million last week.  “Bitcoin [investment products] saw inflows totaling US$145m last week although it suffered at the end of the week with outflows of US$42m on Friday and bore the brunt of investor jitters,” James Butterfill, an investment strategist at CoinShares, wrote in a report earlier this week.  The majority of fund outflows in bitcoin and several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) occurred during the latter half of last week, suggesting that investors are sensitive to sudden price swings.  Still, investors are finding opportunities in the altcoin market. For example, Solana products saw continued inflows totaling $4.6 million for the week, seemingly unaffected by the recent price jitters, according to CoinShares. Solana’s SOL token is down about 19% over the past week, compared with a 12% drop in BTC and a 5% drop in ETH over the same period.  Altcoin roundup  Polygon acquires Ethereum scaling startup Mir for $400 million in $MATIC tokens: On Thursday, Polygon announced a $400 million acquisition of Mir, a project focusing on zero-knowledge proofs, CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman reported. The announcement was made at Polygon’s “zk day” virtual event by co-founders Mihailo Bjelic, Jaynti Kanani and Sandeep Nailwal. In August, Polygon cut a $250 million check to merge with Hermez Network, another “zero-knowledge” scaling tool, using a token swap. With the purchases, Polygon is aiming to become a multipurpose scaling product for Ethereum – a big strategy shift from being an Ethereum competitor before.  Coinbase offers access to DeFi yields with DAI and Compound: Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase says it is opening up decentralized finance (DeFi) to customers who want a slice of high yields earned from lending and borrowing crypto assets, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported. Coinbase will start with DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, which will be deposited in DeFi lending platform Compound. In October, Compound returned a variable annual percentage yield (APY) rate for supplying DAI that fluctuated between 2.83% and 5.39%, according to a Coinbase blog post.  DeFi platform Slingshot raises $15 million in a funding round led by Ribbit Capital: Slingshot, a service that allows users to trade directly from their wallets while aggregating liquidity across a range of decentralized exchanges, has raised $15 million in a funding round led by Ribbit Capital, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported . Firms like Slingshot favor a kind of on-chain “liquidity search engine” that finds the most efficient path for any trade, resulting in better prices for users, according to Clinton Bembry, the startup’s CEO. Slingshot raised $3.1 million in a seed funding round in October 2020, meaning it has now raised $18.1 million.

The acquisition is expected to close in the coming weeks.  Prague-based Avast, which has a market cap of more than $8 billion, said Evernym’s SSI technology is central to its goal of creating decentralized digital identities.  “Our vision for digital freedom is to enable people to manage and retain control over their personal data so that they can interact and transact safely, privately and with confidence. Adding Evernym’s groundbreaking, self-sovereign identity technology to our offering enables us to address this area and is a huge step forward in the realization of our decentralized, portable model,” said Avast CEO Ondrej Vlcek in the press release.  Founded in 2013, Evernym’s flagship product is the Verify platform for issuing and verifying digital credentials. Other products include Verity Flow for no-code credential exchanges, the Connect.Me mobile wallet for holding and sharing credentials and a mobile wallet software development kit (SDK) that lets apps embed the SSI wallet functionality.  Evernym had raised about $16.5 million in private funding before its acquisition, according to Crunchbase data. Its valuation in those rounds of funding was not known.  Evernym will join Avast’s growing digital identity division under the leadership of Charles Walton, who was hired by the cybersecurity company in June to lead the identity business. Walton previously helped Mastercard develop its digital identity services.  “By creating solutions for self-sovereign identity – which is instrumental to creating a layer of trust – Evernym will be a core part of Avast’s vision of empowering people to achieve their true potential online,” Walton wrote in Avast’s announcement post.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/avast-acquires-self-sovereign-identity-firm-evernym-for-undisclosed-amount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1812c5231563c64de8c19f7c6f1c955e3dd68437-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Universal Music Group (UMG) has partnered with avatar company Genies, the label announced Thursday. Previously, some of the label’s artists, including Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber, had personally tapped Genies for avatar versions of themselves. Now the label’s full roster can port their own avatars into “the evolving digital universe” – whether that be in activations in crypto-powered Decentraland metaverse or just on Twitter.  The end goal is for Genies to create its own fully-fledged marketplace where fans can buy and sell non-fungible token (NFT) merchandise that can be worn in various metaverses.  The marketplace, which is expected to be launched in the coming months, will be built on Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, home to the popular NBA Top Shot marketplace.  Flow backed Genies’ $65 million Series B in May.

While Genies currently own “99.9%” of celebrity virtual avatar market share, it expects other competitors to enter the market as the metaverse gains a more mainstream audience, a representative told CoinDesk.  Contracts between Genies and the artists are not exclusive, so celebrities could eventually partner with other avatar companies and metaverse games to wear additional sponsored products.  “Genies and UMG together are bringing the power of NFTs and crypto to culture,” Genies CEO Akash Nigam said in a press release. “UMG’s roster of talent represents some of the world’s most entrepreneurial pioneers, and by equipping these iconic artists with their own Genie avatars, we’re excited to help them realize even more potential in Web 3.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | FLOW,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/metaverse-goes-hollywood-with-universal-music-group-avatar-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83fde5c306683819537bfc35900ff9e4d6fa8fd6-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They’ve taken particular aim at Tether, the company behind the largest and most used dollar-pegged stablecoin, tether (USDT). Their name on Twitter, where they have 68,000 followers, is a reference to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has close ties to Tether. In 2018, Bitfinex papered a hole in its budget (it’s a long story) using money from Tether’s reserves. At the time, USDT was marketed as an asset that keeps one dollar in the bank for every tether it mints, meaning after Bitfinex borrowed funds that may not have been true.  Bitfinex’ed has raised significant questions about Tether’s backing, its banking partners and about cryptocurrency broadly. This year, some of his predictions were vindicated, when the New York attorney general found that Tether has at times lied about its reserves.

That had the immediate effect of cutting out about two-thirds of the machines making Bitcoin hum, but the network withstood the assault. Perhaps Chinese President Xi Jingping’s biggest influence on the crypto industry is showing how little sway a nation may have.  Xi is no ordinary CCP head. He has taken moves to distance China from the Western capitalistic enterprise, strengthen the nation’s economy and potentially install himself as a lifelong autocrat. While China has effectively banished a local crypto mining industry, the government has turned to blockchain as one prong of its digital “Belt and Road” global infrastructure endeavor.

As leader of the U.S. central bank, Powell perpetrated the largest monetary experiment in history in response to the coronavirus crisis – including expanding the supply of U.S. dollars, nearly doubling the Fed’s balance sheet and allowing the economy to “run hot” amid inflation fears. There’s an argument to be had over whether the “easy money” policy caused the run-up in asset valuations that crypto was part of this year. But one thing is for sure: More people than ever bought into the idea of bitcoin as an inflation hedge during this period of unprecedented monetary finagling.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) isn’t the only U.S. politician to look at the cryptocurrency industry with a critical eye, but she may be the most sharp tongued. “Instead of leaving our financial system at the whims of giant banks, crypto puts the system at the whims of some shadowy faceless group of super coders and miners, which doesn’t sound better to me,” she said at a U.S. Senate Banking Committee meeting in July.  The progressive lawmaker, founder of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), has raised concerns about retail investors’ ability to access crypto trading platforms as well as the industry’s environmental footprint. Warren isn’t taken by the idea that bitcoin could be a powerful tool in making the U.S. banking system more transparent, resilient and fairer – one of her supposed policy goals.

And with it, Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) 1559, 3554, 3529, 3198 and 3541, or code upgrades that aimed to improve the Ethereum network’s user experience and value proposition. Most notable was EIP 1559, a change to the network’s gas protocol, which even if it didn’t make Ethereum burn more coins than it mints, made transaction fees more predictable.  Ryan also played a major role in the 2020 launch of the Beacon chain, the first step toward Ethereum 2.0, or the ambitious plan to move Ethereum to proof-of-stake. There’s more coming down the pike.

42421022,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXB30P,1639081388,Most Influential 2021: Gary Gensler,"When Gary Gensler came to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he had the reputation of a regulator who had reformed U.S. law to address novel financial products once before.  In 2009, Gensler was given the task of wrangling the then out-of-control derivatives market after the crash in 2008 and the Great Financial Crisis. Twelve years later, he heads an agency overseeing a financial system shaped by that crisis and in the midst of a raging pandemic that has changed how retail customers interact with the system. And again Gensler is tasked with addressing a class of novel financial products.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021 series. The portrait here was created by Skygolpe and is available for auction at Known Origin. The artist is donating 20% of the sale to Children International.  The former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair also enjoyed the reputation of being well versed in cryptocurrency issues, having lectured on the subject at a small school in Massachusetts called MIT, where he called the burgeoning asset class and technology stack a “catalyst for change.”  Gensler isn’t the first or only regulator with a crypto background – former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks came from Coinbase, former Acting Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Director Michael Mosier has enjoyed a stint at Chainalysis and current LabCFTC Director Jason Somensatto came from decentralized exchange 0x.  But the excitement for Gensler, who would lead one of the most influential federal regulators from a business perspective, was palpable. He could withdraw the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, approve the U.S.’ first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and provide clarity for businesses hoping to launch and trade a crypto token compliant with federal law without having to endure the SEC’s expensive and time-consuming registration process.  That’s what the industry hoped, at least.  “Markets – and technology – are always changing. Our rules have to change along with them,” Gensler told the Senate Banking Committee during his confirmation hearing. “In my current role as a professor at MIT, I research and teach on the intersection of technology and finance. I believe financial technology can be a powerful force for good – but only if we continue to harness the core values of the SEC in service of investors, issuers and the public.”  Read More: SEC Chair Gensler: A Ban on Crypto Would Be ‘Up to Congress’  Under his watch, the SEC has approved the first bitcoin-exposed ETF – but only bitcoin futures ETFs, and not any funds exposed to the cryptocurrency directly. Bitcoin mutual funds now trade in the U.S., but the SEC has sternly opposed similar products exposed to other cryptocurrencies, like ether. And still, like 2017, and 2018, 2019 and 2020, the SEC has yet to formalize much of the guidance the agency has long promised explicitly describing how it will apply longstanding laws to the digital asset sector.  Bid on the NFT auction here.  Still, Gensler’s impact on the crypto industry cannot be understated. He’s called on Congress to take specific actions to clarify crypto regulations and discusses his views fairly frequently at various public events. Much of what he’s said resembles predecessor Jay Clayton’s views on digital assets in the U.S., though Gensler has the advantage of all the work the SEC conducted under Clayton to inform some of his public statements. Regulatory clarity – which Clayton similarly hinted at but did not provide – may still be forthcoming, though it remains an open question as to how exactly this will look.  An SEC spokesperson did not return multiple requests for an interview or statement from Gensler.  “I don’t know how it’s going to evolve but I think it’s not going to evolve well outside the tenets of public policy, and I’m speaking about investor protection, but it’s also guarding against illicit activity ... anti money laundering and sanctions and the like, tax compliance,” Gensler said at the Digital Asset Compliance & Market Integrity Summit (DACOM). “I think that institutional investors want to see more progress made.”  ‘Entire professional career’  Gensler is well prepared for his current role. He’s been a banker, Senate staffer, and a Treasury official as well his roles at MIT and the CFTC. All this to say, Gensler may be the rare regulator with firsthand experience in all aspects of the industry he oversees.  Gensler began his career in financial services at Goldman Sachs, working in mergers and acquisitions, trading and finance and other roles. He later became one of, if not the, youngest partner at Goldman in 1987. He’s served in the U.S. Treasury Department, heading up domestic finance and financial markets teams, worked on the staff of former Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) and chaired the CFTC in the wake of the Great Financial Crisis.  “I have spent my entire professional career in and around the financial markets – in the private sector, in state and federal government and now in academia. And I believe our markets are the finest in the world,” he said in his opening statement during his SEC confirmation hearing.  He’s also a family man. He raised three daughters alone after his wife died from cancer in 2006.  “Before I close, I do want to introduce and thank my three daughters, Isabelle, who’s here with me in Maryland over there, and her older sisters Anna and Lee, who are watching remotely. They are the lights of my life, and I wouldn’t be here today without their love and support,” Gensler said during his SEC hearing.  Gensler similarly introduced his children to the Senate Agriculture Committee 12 years ago, when he was nominated to run the CFTC.  It is perhaps his experience at the CFTC that provides the clearest picture of how he might approach his remaining term at the SEC. At the CFTC, Gensler was responsible for implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, which heavily reigned in some types of derivatives trading. He also led the agency as it tamped down on LIBOR manipulation, when major banks misrepresented their borrowing costs as part of a profit-boosting scheme.  Unclear guidance  Before Gensler, the SEC has offered dribs and drabs of guidance that has often been confusing or unclear. In 2019, it offered a “plain English” framework that has not been mentioned since. Former Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman famously introduced the concept of “sufficiently decentralized” as a yardstick of whether a token issuer might fall in the SEC’s purview or not. Once again, the regulator has not followed up on this in any meaningful way.  This gives Gensler some fairly easy areas to weigh in and leave a mark. And the chair has recognized this. In prepared testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Gensler said “large parts” of the crypto industry are not operating within existing regulatory frameworks, and there is insufficient consumer protection. SEC staffers are therefore looking at, in Gensler’s words:  “The offer and sale of crypto tokens, crypto trading and lending platforms, stable value coins, investment vehicles providing exposure to crypto assets or crypto derivatives [and] custody of crypto assets.”  Gensler has framed this conversation as one of investor protection, echoing much of the broader U.S. regulatory sector.  Traders using unregulated exchanges, or transacting with tokens that are less than transparent about their backing or governance, may be at risk.  “I think where we are right now, is we don’t have sufficient investor protection in this space, this $2.6 trillion asset class, this worldwide asset class,” Gensler said recently DACOM. “I think that new technologies do not become persistent if they stay outside of the public policy framework. And this is an investment asset class and needs investor protection or people will be hurt and trust will be undermined.”  Gensler has also homed in on exchanges as entities that could or should fall under the SEC’s purview, explicitly saying he believes platforms like Coinbase should register with the agency.  No crypto exchange is currently regulated at the federal level (FinCEN registration doesn’t count), a point of ire for both Gensler and the industry, though for different reasons. Gensler has spoken about the need for a federal framework that can protect consumers, while exchanges want a more streamlined regulatory registration and compliance process.  Gensler’s argument does have merit. Crypto trading platforms famously slow down or stop working altogether during moments of high market volatility. While this appears to be a result of technical issues, some industry participants believe exchanges are incentivized not to fix this – by halting trading, would-be sellers are unable to do so, which could stabilize the price. A regulatory regime mandating uptime could be one solution that would allow investors to cash out on demand.  The two approaches are different, but Gensler’s suggestions for how Congress can regulate crypto could address both of these viewpoints.  Bid on the NFT auction here.  “Absent clear investor protection obligations on these platforms, the investing public is left vulnerable. Unfortunately, this asset class has been rife with fraud, scams and abuse in certain applications,” Gensler said at the beginning of September.  A key note here is his repeated entreaties to Congress to act, rather than look to unilateral action by the agency itself.  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, echoed Gensler’s views on investor rules and praised the regulator in a statement sent to CoinDesk.  “I commend him and will continue to work with him to push policies that protect Americans’ hard-earned money and the integrity and stability of our markets. We must all work to ensure that reckless speculation in cryptocurrencies doesn’t end up hurting workers and families,” Brown said.  Regulatory clarity  Lawyers in the crypto industry say Gensler has yet to clarify their obligations.  Larry Florio, general counsel at the Syndicate DAO, called Gensler’s statements over the past year “confusing” due to a lack of practical, applicable guidance.  “The statements regarding decentralized exchanges along the lines of ‘they list hundreds of tokens, some of which must be securities’ and similar phrasing in the actual SEC releases does nothing to provide useful guidance to the majority of the space that is trying to operate within the law,” he told CoinDesk.  “It feels like playing musical chairs blindfolded. You don’t know how many chairs are left or where they are, you just hope you land on one when the music stops.”  He’s not alone in this view.  Donna Redel, an adjunct professor at Fordham University’s law school, told CoinDesk that many in the industry hoped he would propose regulations for crypto based on his experience both as a longtime participant in the financial sector, as well as his digital asset knowledge.  His speeches and interviews do not serve as regulatory proposals, she said.  Some believe Gensler’s comments may be sowing more confusion, particularly with respect to lawyers. Redel said Gensler continuously tells startups to talk to the SEC, but he’s also “intimidated everyone” in the industry.  “On the one hand it looks like he’s going after attorneys, and he’s saying what we’re supposed to do, but he’s not telling us how to position that role,” Olta Andoni, the former chief legal officer at NFT startup Nifty, told CoinDesk.  To date, Gensler seems to be following in predecessor Jay Clayton’s footsteps through his attention on enforcement actions, she said.  This is not sustainable, said Nisa Amoils, managing partner at A100x Ventures.  “The lawyers at the SEC are exhausted – and not just from Ripple,” she said.  Looking ahead  2022 is poised to be pivotal for crypto regulation in the U.S. A bipartisan infrastructure law with language opposed by the industry will take effect, several other bills addressing crypto will face the House and Senate, and the SEC will approve or reject nearly a dozen outstanding bitcoin ETF applications.  The SEC is likely to pay more attention publicly to stablecoin regulation, trading on exchanges or crypto lending – three issues Gensler has discussed in various public statements.  The most impactful regulatory proposal he’s suggested would be to regulate crypto trading exchanges as federal securities trading platforms. Now, exchanges are regulated at the state level, usually as money-services businesses. There’s no federal oversight of normal spot market activity, though the CFTC does target illicit activity such as fraud.  Gensler seemingly hinted at this in his recent comments at DACOM. He has said they think that agency is the right regulator for crypto exchanges, even when the bulk of their trading volume comes from commodities (like bitcoin or ether) rather than securities (like many other cryptocurrencies). Gensler took this further, looking to non-crypto examples such as silver and gold trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  “Right now, the public is not protected as it could be, and as I believe it ought to be,” Gensler said on Dec. 1. “And I think for those of you in the audience, you’re thinking about the longer term future of this asset class and these projects. It’s not just the asset class, it’s the projects, it’s the technology.”  What industry participants hope for, however, is applicable, “bright lines” clarity on how specifically securities law might apply to different types of tokens.  Read more: Gary Gensler Isn’t Buying Your Decentralization Theater - David Z. Morris  “I hope we’ll get clarity around criteria for determining when a token – especially a governance token – is or is not a security, and some insight into his thinking on where regulation should be,” Florio said, asking whether the area of focus should be at the wallet, protocol, interface or fiat on/off-ramp layers.  Others simply hope a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved within the next year. Amoils noted that Fidelity, a $4.9 trillion asset manager, just launched a spot bitcoin ETF in Canada.  “I am technology-neutral. I think that this technology has been and can continue to be a catalyst for change, but technologies don’t last long if they stay outside of the regulatory framework,” Gensler said in another recent speech. “I believe that the SEC, working with the CFTC and others, can stand up more robust oversight and investor protection around the field of crypto finance.”  The story of Gensler’s term at the SEC so far has been one of potential. He may propose specific guidance, explain how a spot ETF can come to market, resolve outstanding questions about issues around custody and more, and he is the right person to do this. But he’s only eight months in, and it’s not yet clear when or how he will take more concrete steps to solve these issues.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/09/most-influential-gary-gensler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af22a4bec9709b169b780c8713f81604472b488d-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This could prove to be bearish for the coin. Bitcoin Inflows Move Up As Whales Continue To Sell As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, on-chain data highlights that BTC inflows to exchanges have been going up. The &apos;all exchanges inflow&apos; is an indicator that shows the amount of Bitcoin that holders are depositing to exchanges on a given day. When the value of this metric moves up, it means more investors are sending their coins to exchanges. Holders usually deposit their BTC for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins. So, this could be a sign of dumping, and may be bearish for the price. On the other hand, when the inflows decrease in value, it implies not many investors are depositing their Bitcoin to exchanges. Such a trend may mean that holders aren&apos;t interested in selling at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the value of the BTC inflows over the past few months: Looks like the indicator&apos;s value has been trending up recently | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph highlights, BTC inflows have been on the rise lately.

CPI New Numbers Could Call For Early Taper,"The stock markets and Bitcoin&apos;s price performance might be hitting a bumpier road after the next Consumer Price Index release. During the year the Fed has been clear about an upcoming tapering, and now that new -and higher- CPI metrics are expected, the taper is likely to fasten its pace and the markets to suffer. The central bank is expected to start reducing its net asset purchase month by month by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.

42394333,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc891,1639073366,What Kickstarter Going Decentralized Means for Web 3,"Kickstarter going decentralized is the latest boon to the Web 3 narrative, the idea that cryptocurrency and other decentralized tools are reinventing the internet as we know it.  On Wednesday, the crowdfunding site announced it will embark on an ambitious technical overall of its core business. Details are scant, but the entity will spin up a separate company to build a crowdfunding platform using the Celo blockchain. Once that’s ready – there’s no timeline – Kickstarter will transfer over and even open source the tools for others to make use of the protocol.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This is a significant turn of events. Although fading from cultural memory, Kickstarter was once a key component to the “creator economy,” the financial revolution of sorts that saw individuals strike out on their own to form new business models using powerful web tools. It was the golden goose of Web 2, a series of developments to websites that brought together social media and other collaborative efforts.  As Bloomberg notes:  [Perry] Chen started Kickstarter with a pair of art-loving friends in 2009, and it was a near-instant hit with cash-strapped go-getters and eventually with celebrities and big companies looking to test consumer demand. The Peloton stationary bike started with a Kickstarter campaign ($307,332 raised), and so did the Oculus VR headset ($2.4 million). Kickstarter helped finance new records from Amanda Palmer ($1.2 million) and the pop group TLC ($430,000) and revived cult classic TV shows like Mystery Science Theater 3000 ($5.8 million) and Veronica Mars ($5.7 million).  Crowdfunding has long been a potential use case for crypto. As my colleague Will Gottsegen wrote on Monday, there is a developing trend of online groups gathering together, forming DAOs (or decentralized autonomous organizations), and buying random things online.  This was typified by ConstitutionDAO, a group that raised over $40 million to buy one of the original prints of the U.S. Constitution. All this could have happened with the tools, like Kickstarter, we have today. And perhaps Kickstarter would have saved people on ETH gas fees or made it simpler to return the funds – after the DAO failed to acquire the Constitution.  But crypto adds a radical new element in that these free software projects are designed for anyone to use, basically without restriction, and, more importantly, are uncensorable. Kickstarter as an entity will not let you donate to a North Korean startup, no matter how benign the project. With ethereum or bitcoin, it’s completely your call – so long as you’re willing to pay the fees (and comfortable evading sanctions).  See also: Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht Can Prove the Case for NFTs  It remains to be seen whether Kickstarter will retain some control over their new chain. Or if this works out for them. Others have noted that the promise of Web 3 seems like more hype than substance. There are many curious onlookers that just want to see a functioning project. (ConstitutionDAO, for one, could be seen as a positive development or a demonstration of the hype – but it definitely brought attention to the industry.)  It also remains to be seen how other legacy companies – even former “disruptors” like Kickstarter – adapt to this new internet landscape. It’s easy to mint a few NFTs, harder to reinvent your business. But if Kickstarter is a signal above the noise – then we might expect a lot more Web 3 developments down the pike.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/what-kickstarter-going-decentralized-means-for-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bfd262fbfa25eda3d0d1065101f7a8b8cbc41cd-1712x1110.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Doing that without sacrificing user control is an appetizing prospect for Burrata, a new identity startup building developer tools that on Thursday said it raised $7.75 million from payments company Stripe and crypto venture firm Variant.  The seed round also included IDEO CoLab, Slow Ventures, Baller, Stratos and a bevy of crypto personalities and anons.  ID gut check  The promise of decentralized identity is a more seamless internet with fewer clunky passwords and identity checks. Plenty of companies are trying to solve it, sniping competitors’ execs and raising serious venture cash in a race to rethink know-your-customer (KYC).  Read more: Microsoft’s Decentralized Identity Head Leaves to Join Square  Solving for the personal identifiable information (PII) equation in crypto is critical to the industry’s growth, Burrata co-founder Ian Place, a Chainalysis vet, told CoinDesk.  The industry is worth some $2 trillion now, he said. If it is to grow to 50x that, it must first nail down compliance.  That’s no easy task: small crypto projects lack the cash and headcount to navigate compliance burdens that established corporations readily weave, Place said. Decentralized ideals further complicate matters; DEXs and dapps with servers full of personal data are anathema to the Web 3 ethos.  Even so, vetting PII is table stakes whenever money’s involved online. Identity, credit scores and social network reputation metrics “will help make the Web 3 markets much more efficient” and accessible to the non-crypto crowd, said Osama Khan, who previously worked at customer data platform Segment.  Burrata’s solution is to issue “digital identity tokens” composed of those data points. Once set up, it sticks with the user’s wallet, letting them pass through KYC gates without re-verifying or forking over their data.  Khan said Burrata creates the tooling and infrastructure necessary for projects to check all their compliance boxes without standing up PII servers. They can reject problematic users while avoiding centralized record keeping. Likewise, users can “revoke” their token at any time.  “This is 100% consumer-owned data,” he said.  Wen token?  The company – a Delaware C corp. – is for now investor- and founder-owned. “But there’s a token warrant,” Khan said, leaving the door open for “progressive decentralization” down the road.  Doing a Burrata token too early could get in the way of the project’s development and economics, he said. And users won’t have to pay to access the service, so a token isn’t entirely necessary.  “Once we have some of that core tech figured out, we’re gonna definitely look into progressive decentralization,” he added.

Lummis isn’t the only senator advocating crypto, but may have been the first to disclose ownership in bitcoin since before even being elected. She introduced a bill that would require the U.S. government to treat distributed ledger technology as a developing technology stack on par with artificial intelligence or biotechnology, called for the removal or amending of language addressing crypto brokers in the infrastructure bill and launched a caucus focused on digital currencies and related issues.  Now, the lawmaker is eyeing a far larger project: convincing a bipartisan group of senators to take up crypto issues next year.  “We are working … with other members on a comprehensive bill that we will be rolling out; we anticipate that you will see it before the end of this calendar year,” Lummis told CoinDesk in an interview. “We want to put it out as one big draft file so we can start getting input and feedback from people in the industry, the regulated community as well as the regulatory community.”  Lummis is working with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), co-founder of the Financial Innovation Caucus, as well as other lawmakers on a draft of the bill, and she expect to enlist more co-sponsors next year when she introduces different parts of the bill to Congress.  It’s a project Lummis has been building up to for some time.  ‘Hodling’ in Congress  Lummis is new to the U.S. Senate, she has had a long career in Wyoming politics. She represented the state in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2009-2017, and she has served as Wyoming’s treasurer and in both Wyoming’s House and Senate.  She has also been invested in bitcoin for a while.  Lummis first bought bitcoin in 2013, when the price was at about $320, she previously told CoinDesk. At the time, she said she had “never sold” her bitcoin, the price of which came close to $70,000 earlier this year and traded at about $46,000 earlier this week.  She hasn’t changed her viewpoint on bitcoin as an asset class.  “I just buy and hold, and I still do. That is my personal choice and investment strategy with regard to bitcoin,” she said.  According to public records, Lummis holds between $100,000 and $350,000 in bitcoin, and purchased more as recently as this past summer.  The idea of bitcoin as an inflation hedge, an asset that can maintain its value independently of the dollar or the global economy, is appealing, Lummis said last year.  “Going back to my store-of-value means of investing and diversifying, I want to have a diversified asset allocation. I want some assets that produce no income to me, but I can hold as a store of value. For someone my age who has other investments that are more vulnerable to our current economy, I am delighted to have one that seems a little bit decoupled from our current economy,” she told CoinDesk at the time.  Educating Congress  The biggest crypto priority for Lummis at present is education, she said. While there is a need for legislation that provides a clear regulatory framework, the biggest issue may just be informing policymakers about the asset class and its technology.  “The challenges still exist to educate members of Congress about digital assets,” Lummis said. “But the need for some statutory frameworks is growing stronger every day because the advancements in the technology is outstripping the Congress’ ability to really understand and embrace this subject.”  Lawmakers continue to ask questions about digital assets. Last week, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee that Lummis also sits on, sent open letters to a number of stablecoin issuers, asking for details about their operations, consumer protection efforts, governance and issuance.  Earlier this year, Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member on the Banking Committee, solicited feedback from the industry about possible regulations.  Like any bitcoiner who has been down the rabbit hole, Lummis worries she is losing the ability to speak about crypto in a relatable way. When she tries to explain bitcoin to her Senate colleagues, she tends to make it too technical with terms like wallets, private keys and mining rather than just explain what bitcoin can do and how it can do it.  “I suspect that I’m getting too far into the weeds,” she said. “I probably need to retool my own thinking about how to engage with people on this subject. We didn’t need to teach people what was going on behind the scenes in credit cards, we just needed to show them you stick it in a device that you swipe or you tap and then you get a bill that itemizes your purchases and you can pay it all in one bill. That’s the simple concept behind a credit card. We need to think of ways that are just as simple to describe the use of cryptocurrencies or digital assets.”  View the NFT auction here.  The Financial Innovation Caucus, which Lummis and Sinema started in May, is part of that effort.  The caucus brings in speakers to educate lawmakers, chiefly at the staff level, Lummis said, although some senators have participated in the discussions, as well. Lummis wants to continue the talks next year.  “We’re going to start a series of dinners in January where we can just have both bipartisan [discussions], and in some cases if people want to have more partisan discussions, we can,” she said.  The educational component will also come in the form of speeches on the floor of the Senate, Lummis said, pointing to remarks she made on stablecoins in September.  The goal is to present cryptocurrency as a hedge for investors to protect against financial upheaval or as a tool for underserved communities traditionally locked out of the banking system, rather than as a tool for criminal activity.  “We still hear people talking about cryptocurrency as primarily a criminal enterprise … Nothing could be further from the truth,” she said.  Lummis has already “elevated the conversation” around digital asset regulation, said Albert Forkner, commissioner at the Wyoming Division of Banking.  “I think it’s helpful to continue the education of her colleagues on the Hill. Digital assets, bitcoin … there’s a lot moving quickly, evolving rapidly,” Forkner told CoinDesk.  Engaging Congress  While holding talks with Congress is one facet of Lummis’ long-term plans, passing bills is another thing altogether. Lummis has already had some success: Amendments she introduced to the Endless Frontier Act, a bill targeted at China’s technology developments, were included in the bill when the Senate passed it earlier this year. The House, however, never took up the measure.  Read More: Pro-Crypto Senator Lummis Discloses Bitcoin Purchase Worth Up to $100K  Lummis’ efforts, however, fell short with the infrastructure bill. Lummis joined Toomey to introduce a measure that was supported by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sinema (among others) to amend language in the bill that broadened the definition of a broker for crypto tax reporting purposes.  While the bill’s sponsors – Sinema, Portman, Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) – didn’t oppose the amendment, it was blocked by Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) after he was himself blocked from adding an unrelated military funding amendment to the bill.  Lummis has already introduced a bill to try to modify the language before the infrastructure legislation takes effect next year, and she plans to continue to try to change the provision next year. How the crypto industry engages with Congress can have an impact with that effort.  “I can’t speak highly enough of the digital asset industry. During that whole debate, they really came forward, they engaged with their U.S. senators, and they were able to help inform them, and also inform them how significant the digital asset community is,” Lummis said. “And that awareness alone has caused a lot of senators to take the time to learn and engage in this new asset class.”  Ideally, whatever laws Congress ultimately passes will enable crypto businesses to flourish, she said.  “If we get heavy-handed about regulation, we can have a dilatory effect on this industry. So finding the sweet spot between having an understandable [framework] on an innovation sandbox for the industry is going to be the key,” she said. “It’s going to be a challenge, because there still are skeptics out there. [They say] that this industry is not ready for primetime, when in fact, it’s more than ready.”  Personal views  While Lummis’ personal crypto portfolio is solely focused on bitcoin, she’s “come to appreciate” newer tools like the Lightning Network, as well as stablecoins.  By the same token, she’s now becoming more skeptical about central bank digital currencies, she said.  Still, she intends to spend more time learning about CBDCs next year and discussing the topic with other members of Congress.  Lummis also noted the potential harm that can come from scams in the sector and acknowledged the need for consumer protection.  “For the good of the industry, it’s important that there be some consumer protections to prevent the scams from turning that national asset class sour,” Lummis said. “So I think there’s great advantages if Congress acts responsibly, and is judicious about the manner in which it regulates, I think there’s some great advantages for this industry.”  Forkner, the Wyoming bank regulator, said that while his work at the state level doesn’t directly intersect with Lummis’ efforts at the federal level, simply having her as an advocate can help.  “It helps to have an advocate to reach out to federal regulators, especially with the bank regulators as you saw in her opinion piece,” he said, referring to an article Lummis wrote for the Wall Street Journal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/09/most-influential-cynthia-lummis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6301cd507fc81135eacd115a37c06ee1759673a5-4000x5300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coinbase customers’ DAI is then deposited with DeFi lending platform Compound.  At first blush, the world of DeFi is the opposite of centralized exchanges like Coinbase. Accessing DeFi protocols, however, can mean paying expensive network fees and involve a somewhat complex user experience, Coinbase said in a blog post released Thursday.  “Today we’re introducing a new way for Coinbase’s global customers to put their crypto to work and earn yield. We are making DeFi more accessible, enabling eligible customers in more than 70 countries to access the attractive yields of DeFi lending on their Dai with no fees, lockups, or set-up hassle,” the Coinbase blog says.  In October, Compound returned a variable annual percentage yield (APY) rates for supplying DAI that fluctuated between 2.83% and 5.39%, Coinbase added in the blog post.  “These higher rates reflect both the unique access to global liquidity and increased risk that can come with DeFi.

42396382,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2vTY,1639068090,Bitcoin Struggles Below $50K After Crypto CEOs Take Center Stage,"Bitcoin failed to hold above the $50,000 mark and was down 4.2% over the past 24 hours.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was looking weak on Thursday, a day after executives from six major crypto firms spoke before the U.S. Congress’ Financial Services Committee.  The hearing, which clocked in as one of the longest congressional hearings ever on crypto, lasted almost five hours. Nearly 40 lawmakers asked questions ranging from specific topics like stablecoin backing to broader areas like use cases in the crypto sector.  Bitcoin and Ethereum saw significant bids being stacked up following the hearing. However, that has since slowed down according to Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds’ chief operating officer.  Ether price  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $4,191 at press time, down 5% over the past 24 hours.  All eyes are on the ETH/BTC trading pair, according to Dibb. That’s the ratio between prices for ether and bitcoin, and it’s used to track the relative strength between the two cryptocurrencies.  The ratio rose even when the market crashed last weekend, rising by about 13% to reach a three and half-year high and register its best weekly performance since May.  Analysts pointed to several factors to explain the upward trajectory, one of them being the Ethereum blockchain’s EIP-1559 upgrade implemented in August. That change has effectively reduced the net new supply of ether from the Ethereum blockchain, and it appeared to help ETH/BTC make gains in a risk-off environment.  ETH/BTC ratio  “ETH/BTC is showing a huge amount of outperformance since the start of November,” Dibb said.  Dibb said if that trend continues, traders can expect the ETH/BTC ratio to hit 0.10 in the first quarter of 2022. The ratio is now at 0.8.  For altcoins, XRP was up 3% on the day, Terra’s LUNA by 0.19% and BNB was down 2.11%, according to data source Messari.

42420996,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXB2ir,1639067954,Building on the News: Introducing Layer 2 by CoinDesk,"The emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchains 12 years ago changed everything.  Bitcoin showed that money doesn’t have to be issued by governments. It proved that a group of individuals could act together without knowing each other. It demonstrated that the internet can be both transparent and private.  From Bitcoin came Ethereum and a host of other blockchains, along with ICOs and stablecoins. From there we saw DAOs, DeFi and NFTs and much more. In 12 years, crypto has become a $2 trillion industry with radical implications for finance, central banks, corporations, nonprofits and the way organizations are founded and run.  Layer 2′s “Crypto 2022″ series started with Policy Week in October, followed by Future of Money Week in November and Culture Week this week. GET ALL THE CONTENT HERE.  Crypto and blockchain technology are foundational innovations that open new possibilities for transferring and building wealth, and that could allow a new internet to emerge from the broken Web 2 world we’re in.  These new concepts of money and human governance raise massive, almost existential questions – questions that matter to everyone well beyond the rarefied circles of technologists and financiers.  Can the U.S. dollar remain the global reserve currency when challenged by a new, electronic store of value that’s scarcer than gold? What role will envelope-pushing China play in an increasingly digitized international financial system? How can regulation work in a world of leaderless, decentralized teams and automated business agreements? What does value mean when money can be created not just out of thin air but without the coercive power or authority of a nation-state?  Layer 2 by CoinDeskis a neutral, open forum that aims to get to the heart of how societies resolve such challenges. From deeply reported, long-form journalism to a diverse range of opinion columnists to institutional-grade research to engaging interactive content, Layer 2 will go beyond the daily headlines and trending ephemera to tell the human stories of creative (and sometimes not-so-creative) destruction.  Even though CoinDesk is a purely digital media platform, we find the language of old, analog media helps to explain what we are doing here. We think of our flagship newswire service as an up-to-the-minute, comprehensive “paper of record,” while Layer 2 by CoinDesk is a “magazine of ideas” that builds on that base and puts crypto in perspective.  A key component of Layer 2 will be Theme Weeks, collections of articles about vital topics. We debuted the concept with Policy Week in October and Future of Money Week last month.

Mining revenue in November was $6.59 million, falling 10% from $7.34 million in October. Iris mined 113 bitcoins in November, an 11% decline from 127 bitcoins in the previous month.  The company also noted that its operational performance “remained strong” during November as the miner continued to ramp up its mining power. However, the performance was slightly impacted at the end of the month due to a scheduled outage and firmware updates on some of the miners.  Iris remains on track to be one of the top miners with a goal to have hashrate of 15.2 exahash per second (EH/s) by 2023. It currently has miners with 0.7 EH/s operating, 0.8 EH/s will be shipped by the end of this month, 5.7 EH/s will be shipped in 2022 and 8 EH/s in 2023.

On Thursday, Polygon announced a $400 million acquisition of Mir, a project focusing on zero-knowledge proofs. The announcement was made at Polygon’s “zk day” virtual event by co-founders Mihailo Bjelic, Jaynti Kanani and Sandeep Nailwal.  According to a press release, Mir’s system generates recursive zero-knowledge proofs that “allow many Ethereum transactions to be verified with a single tiny proof.” This will purportedly make Mir one of the fastest and most efficient layer 2 options. Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptography technology that allows for the verification of information, such as a transaction on the blockchain, without revealing the specific details of that information.  “The industry is still in an early phase when it comes to scaling and blockchain infrastructure in general,” said Bjelic in a statement. “One of the key missing components required to build highly scalable solutions has been performant recursive proof systems; they simply haven’t existed so far. This ends today.”  The purchase was executed with 250 million MATIC tokens at a price of $1.60; since the agreement MATIC has risen to $2.18.  Layer 2s are among the fastest-growing blockchain networks per the closely-watched total value locked (TVL) metric. A layer 2 is a second blockchain built on top of the layer 1 Ethereum platform to reduce transaction costs. Arbitrum, which uses Optimistic rollup scaling technology, recently cracked the top 10 in TVL at $2.23 billion.  The buy marks a trend for the rapidly expanding Polygon. In August, Polygon cut a $250 million check to merge with Hermez Network, another zero-knowledge scaling solution, using a token swap.  The buys aim to make Polygon a multipurpose scaling solution for Ethereum – a significant strategy shift from what used to be branded as an Ethereum competitor.

The Series A fundraising round also included such investors as K5 Global, Shrug Capital, The Chainsmokers, singer Jason Derulo, Swiss entrepreneur Guillaume Pousaz and Austin Rief, a co-founder of media company Morning Brew. Electric Capital and Framework Ventures returned with follow-on investments. Slingshot raised a $3.1 million in a seed round in October 2020, meaning it has now raised $18.1 million.  Although it’s a nebulous concept, especially to those who are new to crypto, “Web 3″ will likely shift users further away from centralized exchanges, order books and matching engines.  Instead, firms like Slingshot will favor a kind of on-chain “liquidity search engine” that finds the most efficient path for any trade, resulting in better prices for users, according to Clinton Bembry, the startup’s CEO, .  Read more: DEX Aggregator Rebrands to Slingshot After Raising $3.1M From Coinbase Ventures, Others  Calling Slingshot a “Web 3 trading platform” leans on a buzzword, Bembry admits, but it’s also the best way to describe concisely what the platform does.  “What it actually means is your crypto wallet is your account – everywhere,” Bembry said in an interview. “We can’t ban the user from our platform and lock them out of their investments, so it ends up being a much more empowering experience for the user. On top of that, you get access to a lot of opportunities that don’t exist on centralized exchanges.”  User experience push  With its latest bump in funding, Slingshot aims to reach the crypto-curious who may have done some trading on a centralized exchange, Bembry said. An investor like Ribbit Capital has made a name for itself by investing in consumer fintechs such as Robinhood Markets, Coinbase and Revolut, he added, and understands how to build a mainstream brand in finance.  Of course, that will require the Web 3 user experience to become simpler and more seamless for the average person.  “We obsess over our product and user interface,” Bembry said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done on user experience, because I think a lot of the focus has been on protocols. Using some of the products in this space is still confusing, and even though I’ve been in crypto for five years, sometimes I give up myself.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/defi-trading-platform-slingshot-raises-15m-led-by-ribbit-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb4b2e3453bb7c683218094df646540c9f944ca6-4525x3011.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Novi lead Stephane Kasriel announced the move on Twitter, revealing that some number of individuals will be able to transact with the USDP (formerly Paxos Standard) stablecoin. This follows a U.S.-Guatemala remittance pilot with USDP and the Novi wallet that launched in October.  “When you add money to your Novi account, we convert it to USDP (Pax Dollar), a stable digital currency issued by Paxos Trust Company, a regulated financial institution. USDP is designed to have a stable value relative to the US dollar,” Novi said in a blog post announcing the WhatsApp integration. “So on Novi, 1 USDP is equal to 1 US dollar.”  The new pilot was announced a day after Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla told a body of lawmakers that he could not speak to Novi’s continuing pilot plans, after the announcement of the Guatemala pilot. Paxos declined to comment.  The social media giant formerly known as Facebook has faced an immense regulatory backlash for its digital currency plans, resulting in it rebranding and downscaling its original stablecoin vision from Libra to Diem. It also rebranded its digital wallet subsidiary from Calibra to Novi.  Novi chief David Marcus announced last month that he would be leaving Meta at the end of the year.

42375745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANXF,1639058400,CleanSpark Aims to Grow Bitcoin Mining Output Over 20% Through Immersion Cooling,"CleanSpark, a sustainable bitcoin mining and energy technology company, has bought 20-megawatt, immersion cooling infrastructure for its Norcross, Ga., bitcoin mining facility and is aiming to increase its mining efficiency by over 20%.  The technology will increase its mining efficiency and reduce its operational expenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday.  “We are constantly seeking ways to make our operations more sustainable and productive while achieving maximum performance,” CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford said. “Deploying an environment-friendly cooling technology that also increases the economics of our bitcoin mining operations was an obvious choice for us,” he added.  In liquid immersion cooling, which is an alternative to traditional air-cooling systems, mining machines are fully immersed in a synthetic hydrocarbon compound liquid that has no electrical conductivity and is fully biodegradable. The specialized liquid can reduce heat, power consumption and noise stemming from the computers as well as prolong the lifespan of the machines, allowing miners to maximize profit.  “This approach is in stark contrast with air-cooled data centers – the current standard in the bitcoin mining industry – which require regular cleaning or replacement of the machine or filters because the constant flow of air carries minute particulate matter such as dust and pollen,” the company said.  As more miners continue to enter the digital asset mining sector, companies are looking to use more innovative technologies, including immersion cooling, to stay ahead of the competition. Most recently, Riot Blockchain, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners, said that it plans to increase mining hashrate up to 50% by using a 200 megawatts of immersion-cooling technology at its Whinstone facility in Texas.  The use of immersion cooling at CleanSpark’s Norcross plant will occur in phases, with the first eight megawatts expected to be online in February. When fully implemented, the project will consist of 180 liquid-filled tanks, with each tank holding 33 units of the Antminer S19j Pro mining machines, the company said.

42394343,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8o3,1639057800,The Three Types of Crypto Investors,"Financial advisors are either learning about crypto and digital assets or making the decision to take their valuable time to learn. Part of this decision is a return on investment (ROI) calculation – the time and expense of learning a new asset class and ecosystem vs. the projected short-term and long-term revenue-generating ability that knowledge provides.  If you are that financial advisor, you’re wondering, “Am I going to find new clients? Am I going to increase revenue from existing clients? Am I just going to worry about not losing my current clients who might want to invest in crypto?”  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  These are certainly valid and understandable questions – why would I bother? To answer this question, we can look at some of the types of clients you might encounter, so you can determine if this fits in your practice and growth plans going into the new year.  When identifying those client types, or client memes, to use the proper crypto terminology, let’s look at the goals, needs, conversations and strategies advisors will employ in their planning relationships.  I will also preface this by stating that I don’t include those clients or prospects who are not interested in crypto. I don’t advocate advisors trying to sell clients on investing in crypto at this point. The risk is too great for someone who has yet to express any interest.  The crypto curious  The crypto-curious investor is someone who has expressed some interest in investing in crypto, but has yet to try. Their hesitation may be due to a fear of losing money or a fear of the technology. Or maybe they’ve just been waiting for you, their advisor, to learn about crypto. I can’t tell you exactly what these clients may look like in terms of age, economic demographic or risk profile.  The crypto-curious client will require some education, starting with the technology. The conversation will likely start with “I’m interested in crypto …”, or “I read this article about bitcoin …”, or “My brother/daughter/neighbor made some money in crypto.”  Your job will first be to understand why they want to look into crypto, before jumping in with all your newly minted crypto knowledge. This world can be overwhelming to the uninitiated (as you well know).  Once you have an understanding of why they want to invest, you can compare what you know of crypto to their needs and risk profile. This is where, if appropriate, you can start with your education, along with some expectation-setting.  Let’s say, for example, you have a semiannual review with a client who is pretty risk-averse, and possibly close to retirement age. She tells you her son says she should buy bitcoin as an inflation hedge. You now have a wonderful opportunity to pair your crypto knowledge with your planning chops.  There is certainly a need for those near retirement to offset inflation, and you can better explain this need based on her situation. However, you also need to discuss the volatility, and have a serious conversation about the risk.  If you both agree, you can create a plan that fits a client’s risk profile, needs and goals through adding crypto. This solution will likely involve some solution that is safe and easy to manage from the custodial platform, and easy to report.  For revenue purposes, and, therefore, ROI purposes, you may have the ability to charge a project fee just to help these clients buy some bitcoin and hold it safely. If this is for a retirement account, it might also make sense to establish a separately managed account (SMA) for these clients, which would fit under your assets under management (AUM) model.  Your education and knowledge will be extremely valuable to these clients, as well as the setting of expectations and planning.  The crypto newbie  You will encounter some clients and prospects who have already started dabbling in crypto on their own. When you make it clear that you’re learning how to make digital assets part of your practice, you’ll be surprised how many of your clients and prospects will break out their phone to show off their Coinbase or Gemini accounts.  They might have already purchased Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in an account you manage, or through their own brokerage account. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.  Fortunately for you, there are some good conversations to have here. What did you buy? Why did you buy? How have you felt about the volatility? The ability to listen and understand some of the reasoning is valuable, and what makes this now an investment rather than speculation for your client.  There may or may not be any strategy to their moves thus far, which is the perfect entry point for you to match what you know of crypto with their risk profile, and other plans, in order to create a strategy for their digital assets that fits their risk, goals, needs, etc.  For example, a client shows you their Coinbase account with a few thousand dollars’ worth of several different tokens. You now have a project fee potential, which includes documenting amounts, basis and reasoning behind each one. You can then work with your client to develop a plan to possibly create a new portfolio allocation or go to a more managed solution, which could be part of your AUM.  Again, your education and knowledge, along with your ability to create a plan rather than speculate, should be appreciated and lead to some increased revenue via project fees or AUM.  The crypto native  This is the client who has been in crypto for some time, and could be moderately or extremely wealthy – sometimes referred to as a “whale.” So much of the focus on crypto education for advisors has been on helping those clients who want to make a small allocation. The crypto native is where you can really bring on some large new clients.  I have seen these clients range from some who invested in some bitcoin early and have a sizable position relative to the rest of their wealth, to those who have heavily invested in a few tokens, venture capitalists, or those who started or were around for the beginning of a protocol which launched a token.  For a few years, these prospects have been averse to seeking an advisor, for fear that anyone in traditional finance would try to steer them away from crypto or not understand the investment at all. The reality is that these whales need help from a financial planner just as any business owner or large investor would.  Once you understand digital assets, you can help these clients in so many ways, and show more value than any other advisors they have on their team.  For these prospects – and there are more than you think – you can be the advisor who isn’t telling them to sell, but the one who helps them with all the parts of financial planning you offer to any other client. Just as you wouldn’t recommend a business owner sell their business or an early founder sell their equity to invest in more traditional assets, you won’t advise these whales to do anything similar.  You will get to ask questions and start a conversation about allocation within crypto, risk and financial life. Together, you can work on security of their digital assets, income and expenses and estate planning. You get to be the valuable quarterback of their plan, bringing in attorneys and accountants where needed to structure their investment.  While this is likely not an AUM growth play, you can create a robust project or monthly service fee plan for these clients, helping to show how their crypto assets affect their spending and lifestyle, and creating strategies to assess risk and future investments.  These are likely what clients in the future will look like, as they have assets custodied in various technologies and forms, and income streams and yield generated from different protocols and investments.  Your work to turn this from speculation or venture into a strategic part of their financial life is invaluable for this growing class of investor.  Benefits for your practice  The decision to invest time and money into learning a new asset class might seem difficult, given the view of the relatively small allocation to crypto. However, as we have discussed, with these three types of crypto clients, the potential to add revenue via project fees, hourly fees, service contracts or AUM is apparent.  By better understanding these types of investors, you can add new clients and generate additional revenue from existing clients while keeping them from walking out the door. Most importantly, you are able to provide value and advice in ways that are much stickier than simply investment management. You will be having conversations with clients that show you understand and care about their financial lives.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/the-three-types-of-crypto-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dbe61a52387cdc206b02e836bd7d22226d28f4a-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394341,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8dn,1639057800,"Addressing Clients’ Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) About Bitcoin","When it comes to fear, uncertainty and doubt, also known as “FUD”, bitcoin attracts more than its fair share. Naysayers have been casting aspersions about bitcoin for over a decade – for example, they criticize bitcoin’s price volatility.  But serious investors who do their research tend to find that the biggest fears have an extremely low probability of coming to pass. Below, I’ll review three of my clients’ most common and biggest fears about bitcoin – prohibition, obsolescence and quantum computing – and how I address each with them.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  FUD #1: Bitcoin will be eventually be prohibited  In my experience, the greatest gulf between perception and reality among bitcoin’s various risks is prohibition. The classic trope is that bitcoin is competing to be money, but governments want to issue the money. Therefore, governments will prohibit bitcoin.  But a careful examination of the facts reveals that the risk of widespread prohibition of bitcoin is nearly zero.  First, we can look to history: Prohibition in the United States and other countries has been ugly. It has caused the spread of organized crime, and ultimately has been ineffective. Just look at alcohol prohibition in the U.S. in the 1920s-30s or the War on Drugs that is going on today. Prohibition of an already widespread product that people demand doesn’t work in the long run.  Moreover, the easier it is to hide a good from the view of law enforcement, the harder it is to effectively prohibit. If you think prohibiting alcohol or drugs is difficult, imagine trying to prohibit a monetary good such as bitcoin that you can literally possess just by memorizing 12 words. And if you think people will go to great lengths to access drugs and alcohol, imagine the lengths they will go to in an effort to protect their savings from accelerating inflation.  With bitcoin mining on its way to becoming a core industry in Texas, and New York City’s new mayor, Eric Adams, announcing that he will take his first three paychecks in bitcoin, all signs point to continuing adoption in the U.S. Moreover, China’s recent prohibition of bitcoin mining and trading highlights bitcoin’s core characteristics: The world’s largest authoritarian regime seeks to contain bitcoin, while Western governments recognize it as a tool for freedom and innovation.  FUD #2: Bitcoin will lose out to competition and face obsolescence  “Bitcoin is the MySpace of digital money.”  This is another favorite reason for FUD. Bitcoin skeptics argue that bitcoin may have been the first digital hard money, but a “bitcoin-killer” either already exists among the thousands of digital assets or has yet to be invented. In my opinion, this conclusion is extremely unlikely to be correct for several reasons.  First, bitcoin is not the first digital hard money – far from it. Bitcoin predecessors like Digicash and E-gold launched and failed in the 1990s, and Bit Gold and B-money were designed and announced but not implemented. Liberty Reserve managed to transfer billions of dollars’ worth of value in the early 2000s before being taken down by law enforcement. Suffice to say that several forms of digital money gained some traction before failing, but none has come within two orders of magnitude of bitcoin’s trillion-dollar network value.  Second, despite the thousands of additional cryptocurrencies launched subsequent to bitcoin, none has approached bitcoin’s adoption level. That may be because every new feature offered by these alleged competitors makes a sacrifice in terms of decentralization or security.  Bitcoin’s design explicitly prioritizes security by not offering “Turing Complete” functionality. And it prioritizes decentralization by limiting the amount of data stored in the blockchain. Not only was this limit embedded in the original design, but the bitcoin community had a vicious fight over this characteristic. The result was bitcoin’s dramatic outperformance versus bitcoin cash, the group that forked off of the Bitcoin blockchain as a result of the conflict.  Because of the strict limitation on the size of the data structure, the total Bitcoin blockchain comfortably fits onto a standard desktop computer, which makes it easy for people to run network nodes, increasing network resilience. And if current trends continue, a standard smartphone will be able to run a node before the end of this decade. Alternative cryptocurrencies that offer greater feature functionality require larger data structures, which makes it much more difficult to run a node, resulting in weaker network decentralization.  After 13 years in the field and numerous attacks on its network, bitcoin continues to dominate digital money. No other system comes close.  How many network-effect-driven assets have reached $1 trillion in value and subsequently been replaced? Perhaps someday something will replace bitcoin, but for now, bitcoin seems unstoppable.  FUD #3: Bitcoin faces risks from quantum computing  Quantum computing has always been a risk to bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem. The digital signature algorithms – elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, or ECDSA, and Schnorr – on which bitcoin transactions depend can be broken with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.  While quantum computing is still in its infancy, some experts believe such a sufficiently powerful quantum computer (i.e., one with enough qubits to break a digital signature in the minutes between a user (1) broadcasting a transaction to the network and (2) the transaction being confirmed in the next block of transactions) could arise this decade.  Fortunately for bitcoin, there exists an enormous incentive to develop a solution. The first incentive is the trillions of dollars of bitcoin and other crypto-asset value that depends on secure digital signature algorithms. The second incentive is that the majority of internet commerce depends on these signature schemes. If they were to fail, then e-commerce as we know it would end.  Is it possible that for the first time in history the latest computational decryption technology will outclass any available encryption algorithm? Sure, but after over a century of modern encryption and decryption in which the encrypted “mouse” has evaded the decrypting “cat,” and with trillions of dollars at stake, it seems unlikely that a solution won’t be found. The world’s smartest cryptographers are working on a solution, and with trillions of dollars of value at stake, they have a huge incentive to succeed.  Conclusions  While the foregoing FUDs or risks are the most feared by clients, I put the cumulative probability of any of them significantly impairing the value or functioning of bitcoin within the next five years at less than 5%. And I put the cumulative probability of destroying bitcoin in that time frame at less than 1%.  Bitcoin is one of the most resilient and hard-to-kill systems on earth. It’s likely to take much more than the threats described here to pose any significant risk of failure. In the meantime, in my view, the signs point to bitcoin becoming the world’s preferred form of digital money.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/09/addressing-clients-fear-uncertainty-and-doubt-fud-about-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c8a2ca27f777d4a4bc5c149479cbec3ef558e37-3872x2592.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Between August 2020 to 2021, the traded value on large decentralized exchanges (DEXs), like Curve, Uniswap, and PancakeSwap grew by about 550% Major centralized exchange (CEX) Binance&apos;s spot cryptocurrency trading volumes totaled $789 billion in September, versus $454 billion (€390.7 billion) in July, while derivatives volumes jumped almost 25% to $1.7 trillion. DEXs have been gradually grabbing market share from CEXs: One of the major drivers of this trend is the perceived superiority of DEX on many fronts: DEXs replace a centralized authority with automated protocols that enable trading and direct swapping of tokens, while CEX users give up control of their assets to the exchange&apos;s servers. DEXs provide the user full control of their assets, eliminating jurisdictional constraints, and negating the need for KYC procedures. DEXs generally have lower trading fees compared to CEXs. Despite their ongoing success, DEXs are still affected by a series of significant challenges. They operate on smart contracts only, limiting their trading capabilities. Most DEXs offer limited liquidity, therefore asset prices are often priced inefficiently.

42375764,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwANq7,1639044104,Bitcoin Hashrate Approaches Full Recovery From China Crackdown,"The bitcoin hashrate, a measure of computing power on the network, has almost completely recovered to its level in May, when Chinese authorities started a crackdown on the industry.  At the time, China was the biggest bitcoin miner in the world, accounting for 71% of the global hashrate, according to the Bitcoin Mining Electricity Index compiled by the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance.  From May to June, the global hashrate roughly halved, data from mining pool BTC.com shows, as Chinese miners went dark en masse to comply with government orders. Since then, the hashrate been increasing steadily as miners set up operations overseas and North American miners deploy their mammoth operations.  In the past three days the hashrate has averaged 182.83 exahashes per second, close to the May peak of 190.55 EH/s, data from BTC.com shows.  As the hashrate increases, the difficulty of mining a bitcoin block also increases, in order to keep the time required to mine a block fairly constant.  The difficulty decreased by 1.49% on Nov. 28 after nine consecutive days of increases, said OKLink senior researcher Eddie Wang. The drop coincided with widespread domain name service attacks on Chinese mining pools, Wang said.  Wang expects the difficulty to increase this weekend by 4%. Arcane Research’s Jaran Mellerud expects a 7% increase, citing website Coinwarz.com.  But “even after that adjustment, mining is still so profitable that everyone and their grandma will want to plug in their machines as fast as possible,” Mellerud said. “It definitely looks like the hashrate will hit an all-time high before the new year, unless we get another brutal bitcoin sell-off shortly after the next difficulty adjustment.”  Read more: Multiple Mining Pools Are Facing Connectivity Issues",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | RESEARCH,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/09/bitcoin-hashrate-approaches-full-recovery-from-china-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f92615fd4194b95abcd742aa08fa223c6ed55fe5-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But – in very 2021 fashion – Pantone, the developer of the modern color matching system, is releasing the color through a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Tezos blockchain.  The collection will feature NFTs designed by artist Polygon1993, each using the color in its artwork.  Pantone says it tapped Tezos as its blockchain of choice for being a “fast, secure and energy-efficient” network, according to a Pantone press release.  “Creating a new color for the first time in the history of our Pantone Color of the Year educational color program reflects the global innovation and transformation taking place,” Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, said in the release.  Tezos made headlines Tuesday when video-game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment chose the blockchain to deploy in-game NFTs into its “Tom Clancy: Ghost Recon” title for the first time.
