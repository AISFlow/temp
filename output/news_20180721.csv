42401660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd23TH,1532165405,China's Crypto Millionaires Are Using Bitcoin to Buy Real Estate Abroad,"The chives growing in one crypto tycoon's California mansion carry a hidden message.  Guo Hongcai, a beef salesman turned early bitcoin adopter from China's Shanxi province, is one of many freshly minted millionaires funneling parts of their wealth out of the country by purchasing real estate abroad.  In April, Hongcai sold 500 bitcoin in the U.S. then used that money to buy a 100,000-square-foot mansion in Los Gatos, a 90-minute drive from San Francisco, California. His Rolls-Royce, also purchased with the fruits of bitcoin arbitrage, sits in the driveway close to a small chives garden.  ""It's very normal to sell bitcoin in the U.S. After selling bitcoin, you can just buy anything you want,"" he told CoinDesk.  Guo calls this secondary residence his ""Mansion of Chives,"" because the vegetable is also Chinese slang for crypto investors who prove vulnerable to big sell-offs.  As Chinese regulators clamp down on industry business on the mainland, crypto millionaires are turning to foreign real estate markets to diversify their holdings. Some purchase property directly with crypto, others like Hongcai use bitcoin to gain foreign currencies without going through a bank.  The founders of the U.S. crypto real estate startup Slice told CoinDesk roughly one-third of their prospective users hail from Asia, figures which include Chinese investors seeking tokenized property rights through Hong Kong securities brokers.  According to the South China Morning Post, real estate purchased in Hong Kong doesn't require the same taxes and documentation as other financial assets held abroad. Chinese investment in foreign real estate, often through Hong Kong brokers, has been rising for years. Now early bitcoin adopters are utilizing new wealth for familiar patterns.  ""The requests we have from them start at $50,000 or $100,000 up to, the latest one was $3 to $4 million for Silicon Valley,"" Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, another crypto-powered real estate marketplace, told CoinDesk.  She added:  ""We're seeing that more and more people are willing to buy properties with cryptocurrencies because it's getting easier to get their money out of the country using bitcoin, rather than establishing a bank account based in Hong Kong and getting their money out of the country using business channels.""  Crypto hubs  According to Karayaneva, the U.S. and the U.K. are the most sought-after locations for real estate, especially fintech hubs like London or California's Bay Area.  ""They were mostly interested in residential properties next to good education, like Stanford,"" she said. ""Also, they want to diversify. They want to have parts of their assets abroad in more stable countries.""  So far, around half of the traffic to Propy's website comes from China, out of 50,000 monthly views.  It's a trend that has implications far beyond China, though, especially in California, where, according to statistics gathered over a decade by ATTOM Data Solutions, nearly a quarter of all single-family homes are now purchased in all-cash transactions without a mortgage.  According to CEO Roy Dekel at SetSchedule, a California-based startup helping licensed real estate agents connect with buyers and homeowners, it's more common for Chinese bitcoin veterans to convert cryptocurrency into cash than to buy property directly with it.  ""We have noticed a drop in Chinese interest, but certain cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York remain strong,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The ultra-wealthy Chinese have used this source as a diversification of investment.""  High rollers  On the other hand, Dekel also noticed ""many blockchain enthusiasts"" are buying second homes or investment properties, leading to an uptick in sellers interested in accepting cryptocurrencies directly from international buyers.  Since platforms like Propy are compliant across jurisdictions, the reason behind this trend may go beyond tax evasion, speaking to real pain points in legitimate markets.  In January, The New York Times asserted that China's exorbitant housing market is ""like a casino."" Further, Reuters reported property development restrictions continue to tighten, such as reduced subsidies for housing developers.  ""In Beijing, only last year they saw a 40 percent rise in price,"" Karayaneva said. ""Historically, real estate investors from China are very active abroad because their own property market is going crazy.""  All things considered, Chinese buyers are hardly the only ones purchasing property with cryptocurrency. In 2017, Europeans used bitcoin to buy luxury apartments in Dubai's Aston Crypto Plaza, a project spearheaded by British Baroness Michelle Mone.  Wherever it's taking place, though, it has become increasingly clear that crypto wealth could have a real impact on global real estate patterns.

42421909,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwpLx,1532161843,Crypto Trading 101: Bull and Bear Flags (And What They Mean for Price),"When it comes to making big money in trading, the trend is your friend.  But spotting the trend when it is in the nascent stage is challenging, and running along with it right up to the top is an even bigger challenge. That's because asset prices rarely see a 90-degree rally or collapse.  More often than not, trends (bullish/bearish) will pause briefly to allow traders or investors who missed the initial move (higher or lower) to join the bandwagon. If the participation increases, the asset price extends the bull or bear run, or else a trend reversal may occur.  Continuation patterns  A trader can spot trend extensions with the help of bullish or bearish continuation patterns, which occur in a variety of easily identifiable shapes, some of the most popular of which are known as bull and bear flags.  A bull flag is appropriately spotted in an uptrend when the price is likely to continue upward, while the bear flag is conversely spotted in a downtrend when the price is likely to sink further.  (While the implication of the pattern is far more important than its name, the ""flag"" terminology derives from its visual similarity to the fabric you'd see hanging outside a government building.)  Each flag pattern consists of two main components: the pole and flag.  The ""pole"" represents a strong impulsive move (higher/lower) and is backed by a surge in trading volume and the subsequent pause or consolidation the ""flag,"" which looks like a falling or rising channel.  The flag pattern can be invaluable for a trader in that there are clear points of success and failure to profit or mitigate risk from. If resistance breaks in a bull flag, the trader can be confident price will continue upwards roughly the length of the pole (popularly known as measured height method).  If support of the bull flag is breached, the trader knows the pattern is invalid and continuation is unlikely. The exact opposite is the case for a bear flag.  Calculating the target  An asset usually mimics the pole after a bull flag breakout or bear flag breakdown.  So, the target is derived as follows:  Bull flag breakout >> Pole height added to breakout price  Bear flag breakdown >> Pole height subtracted from breakout price  Pole height = pole high minus pole low  The real world demonstrations of both flag types are depicted below.  The Bull Flag  The cryptocurrency cleared the flag resistance on Feb. 20, 2017, signaling a continuation of the rally from the $917 low of the pole and opened upside towards $1,228 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($157) added to breakout price).  Guess what, bitcoin came just $10 shy of price target on Feb. 24, 2017.  The Bear Flag  In this case, ether broke the flag support on Mar. 17, 2018 suggesting continued depreciation from the $699 pole high and set scope for $463 (target as per measured height method, i.e. pole height ($133) deduced from breakdown price).  Surprise, surprise, ether was just $12 shy of reaching the exact price target on March 18, 2018.  Conclusion  Bull flags and bear flags can be a trader's friend in strongly trending markets, but they do not always perform as advertised. In some cases, the pattern can present a trap known as a ""false breakout"" when price breaches the boundary of the flag and quickly retraces.  Waiting for a candlestick to close outside of the flag tends to add credence to the breakout, and can help the trader mitigate risk.  As a trader, you would want to avoid betting or punting on an asset price if the bull flag breakout of bear flag breakout is not backed by strong volumes. A low volume move usually ends up trapping investors on the wrong side of the market.  Further, using indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge scope for a rally following a breakout can help boost traders' success rates.

A disclosure published by the U.S. Federal Election Commission revealed that the exchange formed the ""Coinbase, Inc. Political Action Committee"" in June 2018, though it has yet to raise or donate any money. The Form 3x – a ""Report of Receipts and Disbursements For Other Than An Authorized Committee"" – means the PAC is not currently attached to any candidate running for public office.  The document listed a reporting period from June 4 to June 30.  PACs  are formed in the U.S. primarily to raise funds on behalf of candidates running for public office, usually representing specific business or ideological interests, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a financial transparency group which tracks money in politics.  Coinbase communications director Elliot Suthers confirmed that the exchange has launched a PAC, though he declined to provide further details at press time.  While this may be the first PAC formed by a crypto organization, the exchange itself has already donated more than $81,000 for political causes, CNN reported Friday. Coinbase donated $78,000 to Brian Forde, a Congressional candidate and former Office of Science and Technology Policy advisor to President Barack Obama.
