However, the community’s faith didn’t waiver, and now, it is in celebratory mode as Shibarium marks a major milestone just a day after its relaunch. Shibarium Wallets Cross 100,000 Members of the SHIB community have stormed social media to celebrate this major milestone, with many users on the X (formerly Twitter) platform posting several tweets in this regard with the hashtag “#SHIBARMYSTRONG.” Related Reading: Bloomberg Expert Analyst Explains Why A Fall To $10,000 Isn’t Bad For Bitcoin According to data from block explorer Shibariumscan, over 100,000 wallets have been created on the Shibarium network since going live. This figure signifies an increase of over 35,000 wallets created since Shibarium relaunched yesterday. Shibarium’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, announced on August 28 that the network was ready for “prime time” and that the network was going to be reopened to the public. As part of the announcement, he noted that Shibarium had accumulated over 65,000 wallets before the relaunch. Since then, new users have flocked to the network, with the total number of wallet addresses on the network standing at around 101,658 (at the time of writing). That represents more than a 50% increase in the number of users on the network since it relaunched. This figure may not surprise the SHIB community, considering that Kusama had earlier credited them for the “massive influx of transactions and users” that overwhelmed the network upon launch. Such a milestone suggests that the SHIB community remains bullish on the layer-2 network despite the difficulties it experienced upon launch. Shibarium is projected to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space as demand for the network increases. The network’s success is also expected to significantly impact the Shiba Inu token, considering that it is one of the governance tokens on the network. As such, its value should rise as trading activity on Shibarium increases. SHIB recovers above $0.000008 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com More To Come, Says Shiba Inu Lead Dev In his update on Shibarium’s restart, Kusama noted that there was more to come for the network as it continues to build. He further stated that the team would keep providing Shibarium updates on their official channels. As part of these updates, Kusama announced on their official Telegram channel that the official WBone will be launched shortly, stating that the contract verification “should be up early this week.” He also mentioned that there are plans to renounce BONE’s token contract. BONE is one of the governance tokens on the Shibarium network. With this development, the token’s developer will no longer be able to make future changes in a move that strengthens holders’ confidence.

Kusama noted that Shibarium was still “very early” and had a long way to go. However, he will continue to focus on “building decentralized systems and showcasing projects.” Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,SHIB,EXCHANGE | ICO | MINING | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/16712947.jpeg

Some traders who had bet on narrowing discount to net asset value took profits, but there could be more upside in case of a conversion, Digital Asset Research's CEO said.  Grayscale’s flagship bitcoin fund was in the epicenter of last year’s crypto implosions.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw its busiest trading session in 14 months, a frenzy triggered by a court loss for U.S. regulators that makes it more likely GBTC can be converted into an ETF that appeals to a broader collection of investors.  Nearly 20 million GBTC shares changed hands through the day, the most since the June 2022 crypto market crash, according to Yahoo data. The share price surged 18% to almost $21, the highest since bitcoin (BTC) hit $31,000 in mid-July.  The busy session followed a federal appeals court ruling that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert its flagship bitcoin-focused fund that manages over $17 billion worth of BTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). DCG, the parent company of Grayscale, also owns CoinDesk.  The company appealed the agency’s decision earlier this year, initiating a legal standoff. The conversion would allow redemptions and close the gap between the fund’s share price trading on secondary markets and the net value per share of the fund’s BTC holdings.  BTC jumped 7% to $28,000 on the news, while the discount on GBTC’s share price narrowed to as low as 17% during the day.  Read more: The GBTC Discount Is Narrowing; Here's Why It Matters  Profiting from GBTC discount to BTC price  The GBTC discount played a key role in last year’s crypto implosions. When crypto markets rallied in the past years, GBTC shares traded at a significant premium to net asset value. Notably, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital made outsized bets to harvest the premium, then spectacularly blew up when the fund’s shares turned into a discount in 2022 due to cratering crypto prices. The discount widened to as much as 45% following the collapse of FTX, data by CryptoQuant shows.  Some investors, however, have been purchasing GBTC shares over the last three to six months betting on a narrowing discount in case of a favorable court decision, Doug Schwenk, CEO of crypto data provider Digital Asset Research, explained in an emailed note.  Now, some of them are taking profits as the discount has collapsed.  “We are seeing some market participants rotate out of GBTC positions on the news,” Schwenk said. “Of course, there are buyers taking on those positions, likely in hope of a continued collapse in the premium should the conversion be approved.”  The trade could still provide a near 25% return if the discount closes on top of any BTC market gains, which “should be very attractive to arbitrageurs,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/29/grayscales-victory-ignites-a-gbtc-trading-frenzy-as-investors-bet-on-narrowing-discount-to-bitcoin-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9180848b8301d8f2a26afc9e67c96de8e329cf2-1622x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, risk-tolerant investors can take advantage of its misunderstood risk profile to build long-term positions at current prices. The price of RIOT is heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin, and with the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, RIOT could see significant returns if Bitcoin takes off. Despite the bullish call, proper risk management strategy is necessary given Bitcoin's unpredictable nature. Legendary investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management famously wrote in a 2014 memo to clients titled Dare To Be Great II that “most great investments begin in discomfort.” While he was at the time referring to his firm’s focus on distressed debt – which has proven to be a highly successful strategy over the years—his observation holds true in many different scenarios in today’s markets. One such scenario that exemplifies this market truism, in my opinion, is Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), which I cover in this article. While holding RIOT over the past few years has been a decidedly uncomfortable experience for some investors, there is immense potential for outsized returns for risk-tolerant investors who take advantage of the Bitcoin miner’s misunderstood risk profile to build long term positions at current prices. Three major issues weighing on the stock There are three key factors that make RIOT an uncomfortable investment and potentially explain why it is, in my view, in bargain territory. Firstly, RIOT is a notoriously volatile stock. The evidence to support this is overwhelming. For example, despite being up 210% YTD (August 28) it is down 50% from its 52 week high of around $20.65 reached on July 13th. The stock has a 24-month beta of 3.29, as per SA data. Beta is a concept that measures the expected move in a stock relative to movements in the overall market. A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility. RIOT’s volatility is further compounded by its high short interest of 16.84%. The risk of unrealized gains evaporating in a few trading sessions cannot be overstated when investing in volatile stocks. The second reason RIOT is a difficult stock to hold is the almost impossible task of valuing the stock, considering it makes losses and its revenues are inherently unpredictable (since they largely depend on the sale of Bitcoin mined, meaning returns are subject to Bitcoin price fluctuations). An example of this is the fact that it posted a decline in revenue in the first half of 2023 vs the first half of 2022 despite increasing the number of Bitcoins mined by 1,090 coins over this period. Its latest Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 notes that Bitcoin mining revenue for H1 reduced to $97.8 million from $104.1 million a year earlier due to lower Bitcoin values in the 2023 period, which averaged $25,132 per coin as compared to $37,177 for the 2022 period. Thirdly, RIOT is held back by the continued issuance of new shares, a practice that dilutes existing stockholders and weighs down on the share price. Between March 2022 and June 30 2023, it issued $500 million in new shares, its 10-Q states. Equity financing remains the most viable means to fund operations and investments as the business is loss making, having racked up operating losses of $277 million for the trailing twelve months. The table below shows how the number of RIOT’s outstanding shares has increased since 2020. sharesoutstandinghistory.com While these factors are sufficient to put off risk averse investors, those with more tolerance for risk could do well to overlook them and instead focus on the main factor that drives RIOT’s share price – the price of Bitcoin. Focus on what matters: Bitcoin’s price outlook It’s no exaggeration to state that the fate of Bitcoin mining stocks relies disproportionately on the prevailing price of Bitcoin. This is not only the case for RIOT, but also true for other large peers such as Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) — in the interest of full disclosure, I am long MARA and view it to be the top pick among Bitcoin miners (though this piece is about RIOT). The chart below covering the past 3 years shows this strong correlation between the price return of Bitcoin and the return of miners MARA and RIOT. Seeking Alpha Interestingly, RIOT and MARA have been better investments in terms of returns than holding actual Bitcoins. This dynamic has played out yet again YTD, with both RIOT and MARA delivering a 210% return vs Bitcoin’s 52% return. Given the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and RIOT’s stock return, the increasingly bullish Bitcoin price outlook is a strong reason to build a position in RIOT before Bitcoin takes off. Several important developments are taking place on both the demand and supply side of Bitcoin that could potentially lead to a historic bull run in the flagship cryptocurrency. On the supply side, we are approaching an event that experts call “halving” . It is scheduled to take place from May 2024. Halving usually reduces the reward for mining Bitcoin by half. This reduced supply tends to push the price of Bitcoin higher, which is a positive for players like RIOT. On the demand side, there is unprecedented institutional demand for Bitcoin. News of BlackRock ( BLK ) and other leading asset managers recently filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC have dominated financial headlines for weeks, and Grayscale's legal victory vs. the SEC has fueled optimism that a Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved. There's a change in attitudes toward Bitcoin by many of the world’s largest asset managers. In prior years, these institutions were notably skeptical of Bitcoin. Today, BLK's CEO Larry Fink says that crypto is digital gold and calls Bitcoin ""an international asset,"" as per a recent Fox Business interview. Commenting on BlackRock's interest in the sector, the CFA Institute blog recently published an article stating : “BlackRock’s interest in a Bitcoin ETF is not an outlier. Crypto’s integration into conventional finance and portfolio allocation will only gather speed in the months and years ahead.” The article also linked the imminent halving to a possible bull run, noting that: “As Bitcoin’s supply growth is cut in half in May 2024, a more exuberant phase of the crypto adoption cycle will likely commence again.” The demand-supply dynamics of Bitcoin point to the possibility of a new bull market, which is constructive for RIOT. The fact that the miner increased the number of Bitcoins produced and held in Q2 is also positive sign (if momentum is maintained) in view of the likely increase in the price of Bitcoin going forward. RIOT Q2 earnings presentation Dilution is a lesser evil in view of available financing options With the price of Bitcoin projected to soar amid improving demand and supply dynamics, RIOT investors who take advantage of the current share price will likely benefit from superior stock returns. The big concern that remains, however, is dilution. Even after issuing $500 million worth of shares between March 2022 and June 30 2023, it is likely that RIOT will continue issuing more shares in order to fund new investments ahead of the halving event in May 2024. The next few quarters could therefore see further expansion in the share count. Because halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, miners need to invest in new hardware to increase their hash rate and mine more Bitcoins. Measured in Exahashes per second (EH/s), the hash rate refers to the computational power used by miners. It represents the efficiency and performance of a mining machine, so a higher hash rate potentially results in more Bitcoin production. As at Q2, RIOT had a hash rate capacity of 10.7 EH/s. It aims to increase this to 12.5 EH/s in the second half of 2023. Moreover, it aims to invest in new mining machines to increase this even further to 20.1 EH/s in the second half of 2024. The new mining machines are expected to be received and deployed by mid-2024 in time for the halving. This endeavor is expected to cost $162.9 million and the agreement with the vendor was entered into this June, according to statements in the company's latest 10-Q. These investments are mainly being funded by the issuance of new shares. While two wrongs don't make a right, the key thing to note is that most miners are also issuing new shares to fund growth, which in a way offsets the impact to investors since it's an industry-wide phenomena. Take a look at MARA’s outstanding share history below as an example. MARA's share count through the years (sharesoutstandinghistory.com) The alternative to issuing new shares is taking on debt or selling most of the Bitcoin produced instead of holding it. Both are not feasible options. Relying on debt in a competitive, unpredictable and evolving business like Bitcoin mining can easily lead to financial trouble. This was the case in 2022 when many companies in the crypto space that had overleveraged in the 2021 crypto bull market ended up going bankrupt when the market tanked the following year. ""Riot chose to refrain from engaging in debt-financing activities during this period and, as a result, has not been subject to the significant debt-service shortfalls some of our competitors are experiencing,"" RIOT stated in its Management's Discussion and Analysis section of its latest 10-Q Selling most of the Bitcoin produced is also not smart given the outlook for Bitcoin, with banks like Standard Chartered saying the flagship cryptocurrency could rise to $120,000 per coin by end of 2024 . It is also important to look at the issuance of new shares from the point of view of existing shareholders. If key shareholders such as institutions are increasing their ownership amid stock dilution, it can be a bullish sign as it means they want to keep their stake undiluted and are looking at the longer-term picture. This is the case with RIOT, with institutional investors having increased shareholding by 15.72% in the past 1 year to 71.64 million shares, as per Refinitiv data on the Interactive Brokers online trading platform. Institutions own around 38.66% of the company, with Vanguard leading with 17.9 million shares, followed by BlackRock’s 10.75 million shares and State Street’s 4.96 million shares. Institutions have increased their control over RIOT (Interactive Brokers) Risk management is key While I am bullish on RIOT, I think it's appropriate to reiterate that the risks are elevated due to the aforementioned issues such as volatility, difficulties valuing the stock, and dilution. The price of Bitcoin, which remains the main driver for the stock price, is also highly unpredictable. I would be shocked but not surprised if Bitcoin failed to live up to the current hype and instead traded sideways or lower for an extended period. This can lead to a decline in the price of RIOT, which has in the past year traded at lows of $3-4 per share, more than 70% lower than current prices. It goes without saying that investing in RIOT without a proper risk management strategy suited to your trading style and abilities can be a costly misadventure. The risks notwithstanding, I view RIOT as an uncomfortable investment worth getting into before Bitcoin really takes off. If the price of Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs in the next 12 months, RIOT could easily become a multi-bagger for investors who buy at current levels given the stock's history of outperforming Bitcoin’s price return.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631856-riot-platforms-an-uncomfortable-investment-worth-the-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17316629.jpeg

However, risk-tolerant investors can take advantage of its misunderstood risk profile to build long-term positions at current prices. The price of RIOT is heavily influenced by the price of Bitcoin, and with the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, RIOT could see significant returns if Bitcoin takes off. Despite the bullish call, proper risk management strategy is necessary given Bitcoin's unpredictable nature. Legendary investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management famously wrote in a 2014 memo to clients titled Dare To Be Great II that “most great investments begin in discomfort.” While he was at the time referring to his firm’s focus on distressed debt – which has proven to be a highly successful strategy over the years—his observation holds true in many different scenarios in today’s markets. One such scenario that exemplifies this market truism, in my opinion, is Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), which I cover in this article. While holding RIOT over the past few years has been a decidedly uncomfortable experience for some investors, there is immense potential for outsized returns for risk-tolerant investors who take advantage of the Bitcoin miner’s misunderstood risk profile to build long term positions at current prices. Three major issues weighing on the stock There are three key factors that make RIOT an uncomfortable investment and potentially explain why it is, in my view, in bargain territory. Firstly, RIOT is a notoriously volatile stock. The evidence to support this is overwhelming. For example, despite being up 210% YTD (August 28) it is down 50% from its 52 week high of around $20.65 reached on July 13th. The stock has a 24-month beta of 3.29, as per SA data. Beta is a concept that measures the expected move in a stock relative to movements in the overall market. A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility. RIOT’s volatility is further compounded by its high short interest of 16.84%. The risk of unrealized gains evaporating in a few trading sessions cannot be overstated when investing in volatile stocks. The second reason RIOT is a difficult stock to hold is the almost impossible task of valuing the stock, considering it makes losses and its revenues are inherently unpredictable (since they largely depend on the sale of Bitcoin mined, meaning returns are subject to Bitcoin price fluctuations). An example of this is the fact that it posted a decline in revenue in the first half of 2023 vs the first half of 2022 despite increasing the number of Bitcoins mined by 1,090 coins over this period. Its latest Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 notes that Bitcoin mining revenue for H1 reduced to $97.8 million from $104.1 million a year earlier due to lower Bitcoin values in the 2023 period, which averaged $25,132 per coin as compared to $37,177 for the 2022 period. Thirdly, RIOT is held back by the continued issuance of new shares, a practice that dilutes existing stockholders and weighs down on the share price. Between March 2022 and June 30 2023, it issued $500 million in new shares, its 10-Q states. Equity financing remains the most viable means to fund operations and investments as the business is loss making, having racked up operating losses of $277 million for the trailing twelve months. The table below shows how the number of RIOT’s outstanding shares has increased since 2020. sharesoutstandinghistory.com While these factors are sufficient to put off risk averse investors, those with more tolerance for risk could do well to overlook them and instead focus on the main factor that drives RIOT’s share price – the price of Bitcoin. Focus on what matters: Bitcoin’s price outlook It’s no exaggeration to state that the fate of Bitcoin mining stocks relies disproportionately on the prevailing price of Bitcoin. This is not only the case for RIOT, but also true for other large peers such as Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) — in the interest of full disclosure, I am long MARA and view it to be the top pick among Bitcoin miners (though this piece is about RIOT). The chart below covering the past 3 years shows this strong correlation between the price return of Bitcoin and the return of miners MARA and RIOT. Seeking Alpha Interestingly, RIOT and MARA have been better investments in terms of returns than holding actual Bitcoins. This dynamic has played out yet again YTD, with both RIOT and MARA delivering a 210% return vs Bitcoin’s 52% return. Given the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and RIOT’s stock return, the increasingly bullish Bitcoin price outlook is a strong reason to build a position in RIOT before Bitcoin takes off. Several important developments are taking place on both the demand and supply side of Bitcoin that could potentially lead to a historic bull run in the flagship cryptocurrency. On the supply side, we are approaching an event that experts call “halving” . It is scheduled to take place from May 2024. Halving usually reduces the reward for mining Bitcoin by half. This reduced supply tends to push the price of Bitcoin higher, which is a positive for players like RIOT. On the demand side, there is unprecedented institutional demand for Bitcoin. News of BlackRock ( BLK ) and other leading asset managers recently filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC have dominated financial headlines for weeks, and Grayscale's legal victory vs. the SEC has fueled optimism that a Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved. There's a change in attitudes toward Bitcoin by many of the world’s largest asset managers. In prior years, these institutions were notably skeptical of Bitcoin. Today, BLK's CEO Larry Fink says that crypto is digital gold and calls Bitcoin ""an international asset,"" as per a recent Fox Business interview. Commenting on BlackRock's interest in the sector, the CFA Institute blog recently published an article stating : “BlackRock’s interest in a Bitcoin ETF is not an outlier.

However, new data points to a potential breakout out of the current range and into previously unexplored territory in 2023. Related Reading: Bloomberg Expert Analyst Explains Why A Fall To $10,000 Isn’t Bad For Bitcoin As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $25,950 with sideways movement across the board. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization display similar price action as the sector enters another period of low volatility. Bitcoin On The Verge Of Making A Decision? The co-founder of crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Yann Allemann, recently shared data that could hint at a potential rebound. Via social media X, Allemann pointed at Bitcoin’s Relative Index Strength (RSI), a metric used to measure when an asset has entered overbought or oversold territory. BTC’s recent downside price action pushed the RSI to a historical oversold level, 28. The chart below shows that almost every August with a negative RSI and a BTC monthly return north of 10% leads to a sideways September but to a green October. If the price of Bitcoin moves in tandem with its history, this decline in performance and RSI could hint at massive gains for the cryptocurrency in the coming two months. The Glassnode co-founder stated the following: Past trends suggest that such movements often indicate the potential for upward price shifts. This implies that as sellers grapple with further drops, the stage might be set for a reversal in the near future. Also, the chart shows that Bitcoin rarely sees two Octobers in the red following a bear market as the one experienced in 2022. This fact adds to the bullish thesis for Bitcoin as 2023 enters its final months, and new narratives increase their influence over the price action. On the other hand, Allemann pointed at the increasing Open Interest (OI) for Bitcoin as prices trend sideways. The analyst believes that most OI comes from traders opening long positions. Related Reading: Crypto Currents: Can Whale Investors Bring PEPE Back In Action? As the OI rises, BTC will likely see another aggressive move.

42419705,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTQr,1693345696,"SEC’s Grayscale Court Rout Puts Agency in Will-They, Won’t-They Role Starring Gensler","A slap-down from federal courts means the Securities and Exchange Commission must now rethink bitcoin spot ETFs, though its old objections won’t work and the clock is ticking.  Crypto industry insiders argue the most logical course of action is just giving in.  The crypto industry’s campaign to set up exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has now pushed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against a wall with Grayscale Investments’ consequential court win, but it’s still up to the agency to decide whether to retreat or keep fighting.  “It’s back in the SEC's court,” said Dan Berkovitz, who was general counsel at the agency until early this year. If SEC officials wanted to deny Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF again, “they’d have to really think of some other reasons that they haven’t articulated yet. That would be a hurdle for them.”  The U.S. securities regulator, led by Chair Gary Gensler, now faces several options: appeal the decision; grant Grayscale’s application to list its bitcoin spot ETF; let it be automatically approved by doing nothing; or start up a new, second effort to reject the application based on fresh objections. Much of the industry celebrated Tuesday, assuming this is the beginning of the end of this particular SEC roadblock for crypto, and bitcoin’s 6.5% price climb offered evidence of that optimism. But Gensler has been famously skeptical of crypto and the dangers he says it poses to investors.  “‘Arbitrary and capricious’ are not words that Gary Gensler should want to hear from federal courts, but that’s what this unanimous panel of judges called his agency’s judgment,” said Pat Daugherty, a former SEC lawyer who now represents crypto clients with Foley & Lardner. “The SEC failed to explain why it could approve ETFs based on bitcoin futures but not an ETF based on bitcoin. Since like cases must be treated alike in America, the SEC lost.”  At stake is an investment product that could bring new investors to crypto but that the SEC has said is still too hazardous.  So far, the securities regulator said after the ruling that it’s “reviewing” the court action and will make a decision on its next steps. With the original rejection of Grayscale’s application now vacated by the court, it remains unclear when the clock starts counting down again to an SEC deadline, but observers are assuming the agency will soon make that timeline clear.  “After losing this case, the smart play for the SEC will be to approve Grayscale’s application speedily,” said Daugherty, who also teaches crypto and ETF innovation courses at Cornell Law School. “Will Chair Gensler back off and shift course? Perhaps a few Democrats on Capitol Hill will persuade him.”  One former Republican SEC commissioner told CoinDesk – on the condition he not be named – that he wouldn't be surprised if the agency works to come up with another rejection.  “One theory is that the SEC will just pick a different reason to deny Grayscale's proposal and force more long and costly litigation,” Jake Chervinsky, chief policy officer for the Blockchain Association – a crypto lobbying group – said in a series of tweets on the decision. “But another theory is that the SEC will take the DC Circuit's decision as a (semi-)graceful exit from their anti-ETF position. I'm in this camp. It's the right move.”  Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.  As with most federal agencies, the SEC has a long history of court defeats, including a tough loss on its 2010 ""proxy access"" rule and a couple of the specialized disclosure rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. It kept fighting for much of a decade after defeats on a rule that says resource-extraction businesses, such as oil companies, must disclose their payments to foreign governments, but that effort was actually required by law. This time the court's repudiation is different, targeting a position born inside the agency that the SEC ought to reject a specific financial project that would be automatically approved if the agency instead chose to sit on its hands.  Court battles aren't getting any easier for the agency, Berkovitz said.  ""The deference that the agency might have gotten in prior years is just not nearly as easily granted anymore,"" he said. And the more the SEC loses, the harder it gets, he added.  Two of the judges in the decision – Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Senior Circuit Judge Harry Edwards – were Democratic appointees, from the same party as Gensler, so their view can’t be characterized as a conservative backlash against the administration.  “I’ve never before seen a financial regulator’s denial of an application get slapped down by a bipartisan judicial panel of a moderate, a conservative, and a progressive like just happened in Grayscale,” said Justin Slaughter, who has worked at the SEC and is now the policy director at Paradigm. “The SEC has restored bipartisanship in DC.”  Whether or not Grayscale wins in the end, the ruling may lift the other ETF efforts.  “While it doesn’t guarantee that the SEC will approve Grayscale’s bitcoin ETF, it is likely they will approve all of the ETF applications with what they deem as sufficient information sharing agreements, specifically from Blackrock and Fidelity,” predicted Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, who called the ruling a “huge win” for crypto.  Weak surveillance of trading information marked a chief complaint of the SEC regarding these ETF efforts as it rejected one after another. Weisberger suggested the SEC could now decide to approve the projects with good surveillance plans and call it a win for consumer protection.  Coinbase (COIN), the crypto exchange that would provide much of the required surveillance, noted Tuesday that “the courts are giving us regulatory clarity where the SEC has refused,” according to a statement from Paul Grewal, the publicly-traded company’s chief legal officer. “While we still believe comprehensive federal crypto legislation is the best way forward, decisions like this are an important step toward the clarity the industry needs.”  Gensler’s SEC still has supporters, however, who encourage the agency to resist.  “The decision does not change the fact that the Bitcoin market is subject to fraud and manipulation or that an ETF would be a serious threat to investors, which is why the SEC did and should deny Grayscale,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that often seeks to counter financial industry lobbying. “The SEC should consider rescinding the prior unwarranted Bitcoin futures ETF approvals.”  Helene Braun contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/29/secs-grayscale-court-rout-puts-agency-in-will-they-wont-they-role-starring-gensler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24e134ea59da8ae56f50a271262dd1a74cae1103-4235x2382.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419710,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTX3,1693339648,An Open Letter to President Biden Regarding Bitcoin Mining,"As the CEO of CleanSpark, a publicly-traded bitcoin mining company with a background in the green energy sector, I write to bring your attention to a technology that is catalyzing the development of our nation's energy grid into one that is more renewable-powered, efficient and interconnected.  Zach Bradford is the CEO of CleanSpark.  Bitcoin mining, the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are added to Bitcoin’s public ledger, has been regrettably politicized. Often the conversations about bitcoin mining ignore the perspective of those closest to it, like residents of a town with a bitcoin mine. It is essential to look at the facts as they are and recognize that the very nature of bitcoin mining can be turned into an opportunity to revolutionize America’s energy landscape.  Last week, nearly 110 million Americans were under extreme heat advisories, suggesting that a heat wave might be imminent. The 2021 heat wave is estimated to have resulted in billions of dollars in damages and several hundred deaths. This recurring loss to life and economy can be significantly reduced through energy grids that are more efficient, reliable and constantly load-balanced.  The aging infrastructure of our nation’s energy is dotted with recent instances of blackouts that have occurred because of natural calamities or demand peaks led by extreme temperatures. We need to build more generating capacity and upgrade existing infrastructure to realize a future where 100% of the power demand in the United States is met through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources.  Thanks to bitcoin mining, the same entrepreneurial spirit that built our great nation is working to revolutionize our energy infrastructure while making it greener in the process. Entrepreneurs and inventors are drawn to the energy industry because of bitcoin mining, which creates lucrative opportunities for energy ventures.  See also: Bitcoin Mining Has a Superpower  In the last three years, the number of bitcoin mining companies traded on Nasdaq has more than tripled to 20. An increasing number of these companies mine using predominantly renewable sources of energy because that kind of energy is sustainable not only for the environment but also for business.  Bitcoin mining encourages new renewable energy projects by making otherwise unprofitable projects profitable, and can enable renewables to generate a higher percentage of grid power with no change in the cost of electricity.  In addition to promoting renewable energy, bitcoin mining can also help improve the efficiency and interconnectivity of the nation’s energy grid. Bitcoin mining’s unique power consumption characteristics make it the perfect complement to underutilized or stranded sources of power throughout our nation.  As bitcoin mining clusters are often established in remote areas where renewable energy potential is high but infrastructure is lacking, the development of mining facilities requires improved interconnection. As a result, this fosters the creation of new transmission lines and infrastructure, benefiting the local energy grids and making our nation’s energy infrastructure more resilient.  In order to maximize the benefits of incorporating bitcoin mining into the energy grid, the development of more advanced smart grid technology becomes imperative. Integrating mining operations with smart grids can lead to more efficient energy usage, reduced transmission losses and better load management.  Bitcoin mining operations provide crucial flexibility to the energy grid by acting as ""demand response"" units. During periods of high renewable energy generation, such as sunny days with abundant solar power or windy days with ample wind energy, excess electricity can be directed to mining facilities. By doing so, we effectively utilize surplus renewable energy that would otherwise go to waste.  Moreover, during periods of peak demands, miners have been known to curtail or shut down their mining operations to supply critical energy to the grid. They are able to do this in minutes. If the mining facility is also generating its own power, this redirection of power to the grid can save approximately 14 hours that a power plant may otherwise (in the absence of bitcoin mining) need to reach maximum generation capacity from start up.  Not only does this load balancing help prevent energy grid instability and reduce curtailment of renewables, it also helps drive the price down for other consumers of the grid’s energy.  As bitcoin mining continues to evolve rapidly, the industry is investing heavily in research and innovation to find more energy-efficient methods and hardware. This drive for efficiency improvement has spilled over into other industries and sectors, fostering a culture of energy-consciousness and technological advancements in various industries.  See also: The Honest Truth About Bitcoin Mining  Mr. President, leveraging the potential of bitcoin mining to accelerate the transition to a renewable-powered, efficient, and interconnected energy grid presents a remarkable opportunity for our nation's energy future. By providing incentives that encourage miners to use renewable energy sources and invest in sustainable practices, we can create a win-win situation for both the environment and the economy.  I urge your administration to consider supporting initiatives that promote the integration of bitcoin mining with our national energy grid's development. This forward-thinking approach can lead to lasting benefits for our environment, economy, and national security. As the leader of our great nation, your support in this matter would undoubtedly be a momentous step towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.  Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. I stand ready to provide any additional information or insights you may require as we work together to create a more abundant energy future for all Americans.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Zach Bradford,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/29/an-open-letter-to-president-biden-regarding-bitcoin-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94a9a89421ec13087839347a7ccaa2d54054ef13-3872x2178.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

16708860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549327,1693339248,Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Keep The Faith: 40% Supply Remains Untouched For Over 3 Years,"A recent report from Bitfinex has shed light on a trend in the Bitcoin market. The report shows despite the unpredictability of the crypto market; long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be playing the patience game, signaling a buoyant outlook on the digital currency. This resilience and sense of optimism come to the fore as Bitfinex’s Alpha report reveals roughly 40% of Bitcoin’s total supply has remained untouched for over three years, marking an all-time high. Related Reading: JPMorgan Shares Prediction On Bitcoin’s Next Move: What You Need To Know Bitcoin Dormant Supply Hits Record Highs The latest Bitfinex report illuminates that about 40% of Bitcoin’s supply has not witnessed any movement for more than three years. Based on the Coin Days Destroyed metric, the findings further highlight that this portion of the BTC has remained inactive on-chain. Analysts at Bitfinex, in a note, deduced that this pattern highlights a prevailing mood of confidence, hinting at possible stability in the face of usual market fluctuations. The analysts noted: This behavior insinuates a broader sentiment of optimism and potential resilience against market volatilities. It is worth noting that such a trend can be interpreted as a clear indication that long-term Bitcoin enthusiasts are maintaining a bullish perspective. Contrasting Metrics: Narrower Timeframes Hint At Bearish Sentiments While the three-year metric paints a promising picture of enduring confidence, the picture is slightly different when the lens narrows to a one-year timeframe. Within this shorter period, the inactive supply metric points towards a bearish sentiment, hinting at potential price drops. Bitfinex’s report stated: “Our analysis indicated that movements on this timeframe preceded the price drop.” A case in point is the sudden major Bitcoin fall on August 17, which led to the loss of roughly over $1 billion in liquidations. This crash plunged BTC’s value momentarily to the $25,000 zone. The analysis by Bitfinex suggests that this crash can be attributed, in part, to the “newer” long-term holders. According to the report, these individuals, who secured their positions during the bear market, are now experiencing a sense of “unease without succumbing to panic.” Related Reading: BREAKING: Grayscale Triumph: SEC Crushed, GBTC Rockets Towards ETF, Bitcoin Targets $28,000 Meanwhile, following the conclusion of the legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto asset manager Greyscale, in which the latter emerged victorious, Bitcoin experienced a notable surge. BTC is trading above $27,000 when writing and marking a 5.2% increase in the past 24 hours. This news is especially significant considering BTC was hovering just below $26,000 and moving sideways before the announcement.

Exchanges Have Been Seeing Net Bitcoin Outflows Recently An analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained that investors have been withdrawing their coins from exchanges recently. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange netflow,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin currently moving into or out of the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The metric’s value is calculated as the outflows subtracted from the inflows. When this indicator’s value is positive, the inflows are more significant than the outflows right now; hence, a net number of coins is moving into these platforms. As one of the main reasons holders may want to deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have bearish consequences for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, negative values suggest the holders are making net withdrawals currently. This kind of trend, when sustained, may be a sign that accumulation is going on in the market, which can naturally have bullish effects on the price in the long term. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange netflow over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been red in recent days | Source: CryptoQaunt As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange’s netflow had been positive during the crash earlier in the month, implying that net deposits had occurred. These inflows would have been from the investors taking part in the selloff and from those panic selling just after the selloff had occurred. This indicator tracks the combined data for both spot and derivative platforms, so a chunk of these inflows is bound to be coming from those looking to speculate on the futures market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming? This Metric Could Suggest So It wasn’t long, however, before the netflow turned negative, and the metric has since maintained in this region. This would suggest that the holders have continuously taken their coins off these central entities during the last few days. As analyst James V. Straten has pointed out on X, many of these outflows have come from the Bybit platform alone. Looks like the metric's value has plunged recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The total balance on the exchange has plunged as a massive $300 million outflow has occurred.

42419699,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTJd,1693334615,The Real Reasons the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF Decision Matters,"The U.S. is one step closer to having a spot market bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the holy grail of white glove crypto financial products. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals delivered a crushing interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s logic for denying an ETF, finding the agency acted “capriciously” and “arbitrarily.”  That’s what crypto folk have been saying for years!  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In particular, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sided with Grayscale Investments (disclosure: CoinDesk’s sister company) in its pursuit to transition the massive Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. More precisely: The judges granted Grayscale’s petition for review, meaning the SEC will have to review Grayscale’s previously rejected ETF application and maybe come up with better reasons for denying it again.  Crypto is salivating not only over the court’s pro-ETF ruling, but anti-SEC comments. The top U.S. securities regulator fell “short of the standard,” made “unexplained” calls and “failed to adequately explain” its argument. In particular, the SEC didn’t make a good enough case for approving some bitcoin-related exchange-traded products (namely futures-based products), and not others.  See also: Bitcoin Jumps 5% on Grayscale Ruling, While Crypto-Related Stocks Soar More Than 10%  Further, the SEC seemed unwilling to listen to the facts, like that spot and futures bitcoin markets are 99% correlated and so the concerns it has raised to reject 100% of spot market ETF filings don’t make sense. What this means for the existing round of ETF applications is unknown, which mostly filed in a rush after BlackRock unexpectedly threw its hat in the ring.  For many the idea the SEC’s crypto policies are divorced from reality will be obvious. The agency has for years been unwilling to consider the merits of blockchain as it exists, and what decentralization means for standing U.S. laws. (Not that skepticism over crypto’s claims of decentralization isn’t warranted at this point.) But here is a clear-as-day ruling showing bias.  And so what happened today is important for two big reasons. First, ETFs are important because it increases the number of people who can invest in crypto by providing a more traditional and regulated pathway. There’s potentially billions of dollars of capital sitting on the sidelines that would trade bitcoin if it could be traded through familiar stock exchanges.  And second, like the Ripple decision in July, the U.S. Court of Appeals has shown that the SEC is not the ultimate arbiter of crypto. The agency does not necessarily or automatically get the final word; the U.S. court system and better yet Congress can also offer legal interpretations. This is significant because of the boom and bluster coming out of SEC Chair Gary Gensler since he took office, and his willingness to say all of crypto – except bitcoin – is under the agency's remit.  In reality, there are major overhanging questions as to whether the SEC has proper jurisdiction over digital assets. This is one of the main points of contention discussed in the much-watched Lummis-Gillibrand “Responsible Financial Innovation” bill moving through Congress, which emphasizes crypto’s “commodity-like” attributes and so would raise up the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a regulator.  See also: Grayscale Urges Equal Treatment for All Spot Bitcoin ETFs  Bloomberg editor Tracy Alloway once infamously called bitcoin the ideal “post-modern” asset, meaning what it is depends on your point of view. Crypto allows people to map their desires onto the assets. And so crypto is cash-like, commodity money that resembles corporate equity; it’s a meme and movement and also a tool; it’s the interface for the next generation of the internet and backbone to ultramodern financial architecture; it’s for libertarians, progressives and the apolitical — crypto is a bundle of contradictions.  Nowhere is that more clear than with ETFs, which have turned an asset meant to foment a revolution into Wall Street’s latest fascination.

""While I have decided to suspend my campaign for President, my commitment to making this a better nation for every American remains,"" Suarez said in a tweet on Tuesday.  Suarez, who was critical of the Biden administration's handling of crypto, said previously that his campaign will be accepting bitcoin as a donation, which he called ""a process of developing technologies that will create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation."" He also said he would ban a central bank digital currency (CBDC), citing privacy concerns.  The former presidential candidate has experimented with the crypto technology in multiple areas, including accepting his salary in bitcoin. He also rolled out MiamiCoin (MIA) in 2021 with the hope to someday use the token to pay a recurring bitcoin stimulus to Miami citizens, similar to a dividend paid to company shareholders. However, the project struggled to gain traction and trading was eventually suspended on at least one of the crypto exchanges due to low liquidity.  Suarez, a Republican, announced his candidacy for president in June, entering a crowded race for the GOP nomination that includes front-runners former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.  Despite stepping out from the presidential race, Suarez said he will continue to help other Republican candidates to put forward a nominee.  ""I look forward to keeping in touch with the other Republican presidential candidates and doing what I can to make sure our party puts forward a strong nominee who can inspire and unify the country, renew Americans’ trust in our institutions and in each other, and win,"" he concluded.

This ruling could allow everyday investors to invest in ETFs that track the spot price of Bitcoin and unlock billions of dollars of trapped value in GBTC. BlackRock and Fidelity have also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs, bringing price competition to the market. Grayscale Investments LLC got a green light from a federal court to launch the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US, a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry’s quest to tap billions of dollars from everyday investors. - Bloomberg News, on today's GBTC ruling . After a lengthy court battle, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale Investments' suit to vacate the SEC's denial of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) becoming an ETF. You can read the full ruling here . It's late August and much of the world is on vacation, but this is a huge ruling. This likely means that investors like you and me will shortly be able to invest in ETFs that track the spot price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), just as we can with other assets like gold and silver. It also means that the billions of dollars of trapped value hidden inside Grayscale's discount to net asset value could soon be unlocked. BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity have also filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which will bring much-needed price competition to the market. As of my writing this, Bitcoin is up roughly 7% on the day with the news, while GBTC is up about 17%. Data by YCharts I have friends who lost tens of thousands of dollars to high-profile crypto scammers and theft, and had there been an ETF, they would still have their money! I was among the people who filed public comments on GBTC, and I believe that a low-cost, regulated ETF framework for investing in BTC is a godsend. The ruling is a huge step forward for the crypto world to move on from its Wild West beginnings and towards being an asset class on par with gold and silver as a store of value. I own some GBTC and the trade was a multi-year headache, so it's good to see this soon coming to a favorable conclusion. What Was Grayscale Bitcoin's Suit About? Grayscale Investments is a crypto investment company based near New York City. They're best known for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is a closed-end fund that allows investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. To be fair, Grayscale isn't exactly a charity– their Bitcoin fund charges hefty fees (2% annually) and traded at a substantial premium to its net asset value for much of its history. During the early crypto boom, GBTC traded at premiums approaching double its net asset value, which the company exploited by issuing new shares at NAV to private investors with lockups . Data by YCharts Because GBTC charged a lot of fees compared to simply owning Bitcoin, the hype premium eventually turned to a discount to net asset value, which got progressively worse with time. That's when I started to become interested in the fund as an arbitrage opportunity. Every $100 of Bitcoin in the fund traded at 80 cents on the dollar (it got as bad as almost 50 cents on the dollar at one point). If 2021 was the year of calling in anything and winning, 2022 was the year of every deal getting caught in some kind of court battle. Grayscale attempted to convert the fund into an ETF, which would effectively erase the dead money from the discount. In June 2022, the SEC denied Grayscale , citing worries about market manipulation, which Grayscale then appealed. This Grayscale trade has been around for over 2 years on the idea that at some point, what's happening now would happen! Grayscale tried buying back some GBTC, but it didn't move the needle. Many conspiracy-minded investors ( and activists ) felt that Grayscale was taking them for a ride to pocket fees. The activists in particular mounted increasing pressure on the company to fix the discount. In the end, Grayscale ended up winning its court battle with the SEC, so the discount will be reduced to zero. What Does This Mean Going Forward? Neither the SEC nor Grayscale's legal team are offering concrete comments yet. However, the 3-0 ruling from the appellate court invalidating the legal arguments against GBTC means that spot Bitcoin ETFs seem inevitable. This is not only for Grayscale but also for BlackRock and Fidelity, who likely had an indication that Grayscale would prevail before they filed spot Bitcoin ETF applications in July. Grayscale still trades at a roughly 10-15% discount to NAV as of my writing this, so investors willing to wait for the filing to work its way through are likely to be compensated quite well. Bloomberg analysts are reporting that there's now a 45-day period where both sides can review the ruling. Grayscale's GBTC will not automatically convert to an ETF because of the court ruling, but it sets in motion a 45-60-day process to get the ETF approved or request an en banc ruling from the appeals court. Bottom Line While I hope I'm not jinxing it, the court clearing the narrow technicality that was holding GBTC back overwhelmingly implies to me that Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ETF conversion is going to get approved. This should be followed shortly after by Fidelity and BlackRock. This will create a safer framework for investors and advisors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without substantial risk of fraud or theft, and massively broaden the market for Bitcoin.

Related Reading: BREAKING: Grayscale Triumph: SEC Crushed, GBTC Rockets Towards ETF The news is significant because not only does it increase the chance Grayscale can move ahead with an ETF, but it also improves the likelihood of other ETFs like BlackRock getting the green light.

Bitcoin price rockets 7% higher in a day | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Price Could Benefit From A New Stock Market High It isn’t just crypto getting a major boost today. US stock indexes are also soaring today. The S&P 500 is up over 1.2%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq over 1.88%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 0.63%. The latest bounce in stocks puts traditional markets within striking distance of a new all-time high.

Robinhood’s no-fee crypto business depends on market-making firms to keep its billions of dollars in volume trading smoothly. But Jump has been reportedly backing away from the U.S. market amid heightened regulatory scrutiny.  On-chain data suggests Jump and Robinhood split ways in early July.  Robinhood declined to comment. Jump could not be immediately reached for comment.  Intel from the source adds to little-noticed public evidence their relationship had changed. Robinhood’s financial reports haven’t mentioned Tai Mo Shan Ltd. – the Jump affiliate that handled Robinhood’s order flow – since the fourth quarter of 2022.  Instead, the publicly traded broker is working with competing market-making firms including B2C2, which now handles the lion’s share of Robinhood’s crypto flow, according to public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Why Robinhood and Jump are no longer working together isn’t clear. Jump has for years been one of the largest market makers in traditional finance, a dominant presence on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other markets owned by CME Group. The U.S. government’s 2023 crypto crackdown has made it harder for TradFi players to remain as visible in crypto.  Jump was the original firm supporting Robinhood’s crypto ambitions and anchored market making for its lucrative service heading into the 2021 bull market peak.

""If you're looking for a short-term move in bitcoin, it's probably going to be if we start to see rates start to go back down or inflation going back up, and therefore real rates going down,"" Dorman said.  Bitcoin, he argues, ""really just tracked real rates"" for much of the past year and a half, highlighting that this correlation becomes particularly important when real rates start to rise.  Dorman pointed out that for most of the year – which has been otherwise dull for digital asset investors – bitcoin has acted as a “call option on future problems with confidence in your local governments and banks.”  “During periods like in March, when there was a big loss of confidence in regional banks in the US, that was a real boon to Bitcoin's price,"" he said.

Coinbase experienced a 14% upswing while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust saw an impressive 18% rise. The sanctioning of a Bitcoin ETF introduces a regulated avenue for substantial institutional capital inflows into the Bitcoin space. Executive Summary : Grayscale Investments’ recent court ruling in favor of launching the first-ever Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Beyond the immediate market reaction, this event points towards a maturing regulatory environment and sets a potential precedent for the broader adoption of crypto-focused financial products. Regulatory Inconsistencies : Upon news of the court’s decision, we observed a noticeable surge in market sentiment. Notably, Coinbase (COIN) experienced a 14% upswing while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw an impressive 18% rise. The event underscores the interconnectedness of the crypto landscape and the cascading impact of significant regulatory changes. A significant backdrop to this case is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) seemingly incongruent approach to crypto products. Their prior approval of two Bitcoin futures ETPs versus their denial of Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETP posed questions that the appellate court felt compelled to address . Institutional Implications : The sanctioning of a Bitcoin ETF introduces a regulated avenue for substantial institutional capital inflows into the Bitcoin space. Previously reticent entities such as pension funds and mutual funds now possess a potentially less volatile and regulatory-friendly mechanism to access crypto exposure. For crypto exchanges, the ETF ruling is not merely an affirmation of Grayscale’s proposition but an endorsement of the broader crypto ecosystem. Platforms like Coinbase could benefit from heightened trading volumes and a surge in new user registrations. Additionally, for $GBTC, this might present a unique opportunity to narrow the persistent discount to its net asset value ((NAV)). Grayscale’s triumph could very well be the clarion call for other financial giants to initiate their Bitcoin ETF offerings, ushering in an era of competitive products tailored for diverse investor needs. The ruling underscores the urgency for transparent and standardized regulatory guidelines in the crypto realm. While the U.S. market is pivotal, its regulatory decisions often ripple across global jurisdictions. An open acceptance of crypto ETFs in the U.S. might expedite similar initiatives in other major markets. Closing Thoughts : Grayscale’s legal victory is emblematic of the evolving intersections of finance, technology, and regulation.

16704494,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549253,1693328411,Ethereum In Bleak Situation? Sharks & Whales Continue 4-Month Long Selloff,"On-chain data shows the Ethereum sharks and whales have continued to sell for four months now, a sign that the asset may not recover soon. Ethereum May Not Be In The Best Situation Right Now In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked into how the various metrics related to Ethereum look like at the moment to get hints about the asset’s future outcome. First, the analytics firm has discussed the asset’s “transaction volume,” that is the daily total number of tokens that are being transferred on the network. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator: The value of the metric seems to have been low in recent days | Source: Santiment As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum transaction volume has gone down recently and has hit some low levels, suggesting that the network isn’t observing much usage currently. “Though not necessarily a red flag for any asset, this is indicative of the crowd simply showing disinterest during a time when many traders really can’t decide whether the $1,650 price level is overvalued or undervalued,” explains Santiment. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year The firm further notes that the $1,500 level has had quite a bit of psychological support around it, so if the cryptocurrency declines toward this level, the volume might bounce back. While the volume can provide hints about the interest among the general investors, it may not necessarily reflect the sentiment of the largest of holders. So, the second indicator Santiment checked is the total amount of holdings belonging to investors carrying between 10 and 10,000 ETH in their wallets. Looks like the value of the indicator has been heading downhill since a while now | Source: Santiment The investors with address balances in this range are the sharks and whales, entities that can carry some influence because of their large holdings. From the chart, it’s apparent that these cohorts as a whole have been continuously selling since around four months ago when ETH hit its top above $2,100. Prior to this, these large investors had been accumulating, but it would appear that these investors gave in to the allure of profit-taking once ETH rose to high enough levels. The selloff has slowed down a bit recently, but these holders are still continuing to shed a net portion of their holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming? This Metric Could Suggest So “This continued tailslide in supply held by sharks and whales is something we need to monitor,” says the analytics firm. “Prices can still rise as they take profit, and their holdings are far from a perfect correlation. But in terms of a signal for an immediate return to $2K and above, it certainly isn’t being perpetuated by whales.” Finally, Santiment has looked into the “development activity” of the asset, to see how much work the developers have been putting into the project’s public GitHub repository. The trend in the development activity | Source: Santiment Generally, this metric can be one of the things to look out for to see if a project has long-term potential or not. As the Ethereum developers haven’t stopped working hard recently, it’s safe to assume that they are still committed to the asset. So, at least this is one of the indicators not bleak for ETH right now.

42419698,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTIb,1693327878,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Complaints About Discovery Are 'Misleading,' DOJ Says","Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried wants the court to bar ""millions"" of pages of documents from being used as evidence this late in the case, but prosecutors are countering that he's long had access to them.  The Department of Justice is also alleging that Bankman-Fried has potentially mislabeled documents to keep them from being used.  Federal prosecutors have challenged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s allegations that prosecutors dumped “millions” of pages worth of potential evidence on the former CEO’s defense team just two months ahead of his criminal trial, a Tuesday court filing shows.  The letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan comes after Bankman-Fried requested on Friday that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York bar a large stack of documents from being admitted as evidence at his October trial. In the letter, prosecutors allege that the millions of pages of discovery flagged by Bankman-Fried have been accessible to the former executive through his Google accounts for months.  Bankman-Fried “cannot plausibly claim to be prejudiced by the Government’s production of these materials, as he had months prior to being detained to mine them for materials relevant to his defense,” prosecutors said in the filing.  Still, Bankman-Fried on Friday (and again on Monday) pleaded for Judge Kaplan to bar the federal government from introducing evidence produced after July 1, 2023, arguing he wouldn’t have enough time to review all the materials before trial. He also argued that his confinement to a high-security prison in Brooklyn, NY, would limit his access to the most recent swath of documents prosecutors have shored up.  Sam Bankman-Fried is currently in pre-trial detention at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, where he landed after losing his bail earlier this month. Judge Kaplan revoked Bankman-Fried’s bail after ruling the former executive’s alleged leaking of the private writings of Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison to the New York Times and efforts to contact his co-conspirators constituted witness tampering and a “threat to the community.”  Prosecutors used Bankman-Fried’s leaking of documents from his Google Drive account to argue that he still had access to the account – where the discovery materials came from – until very recently.  “He identified documents from his Google accounts that he believed would discredit one of the Government’s cooperating witnesses and provided them to a widely read publication,” the DOJ said in its filing.  Withholding evidence  In the filing, prosecutors also alleged Bankman-Fried took actions to thwart the government’s attempts to gain access to evidence. Bankman-Fried may have mislabeled certain documents as “privileged” to “improperly shield relevant evidence from the Government.” Specifically, they suggest the FTX founder may have asserted privilege over communications involving his lawyer parents even though he never technically employed them as legal counsel.  “[T]he defendant’s parents received millions of dollars in property paid for by the company, and the defendant’s father was present with the defendant in the final days of the company, while it was collapsing,” the DOJ said in its letter. “There is thus strong reason to believe that documents shared with the defendant’s parents in particular contain evidence relevant to the charged offenses.”  Bankman-Fried faces seven charges, including several counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to securities and commodities fraud.

Grayscale's Ethereum Trust may be a better investment as it trades at a wider NAV discount and is perhaps ultimately subject to similar legal and strategic trends. Both funds are subject to swings in underlying crypto asset values which introduce additional risk. The legal outcome may be delayed by an appeals process and paperwork associated with ETF implementation. Summary The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) today received a favorable legal ruling likely allowing conversion to an ETF. Of course the SEC may appeal and the mechanics of ETF conversion will take some time, but still the discount to NAV for GBTC (after narrowing today) may narrow further over the coming days and months. The market appears too pessimistic on the chance and timeline of ETF conversion now the legal ruling is in place, which removes the bulk of the risk. NAV Discounts Grayscale has a number of crypto funds that trade a discounts to Net Asset Value or NAV. This isn't unusual, as high fees and lack of ability to redeem at par make NAV discounts in investment funds quite common. Sometimes premiums exist too, and that's also the case for some of Grayscale's funds, especially for crypto assets that are less broadly adopted. Importantly, ETFs don't have material discounts or premiums to NAV. That's because if they do, market markets can issue or redeem ETF shares and exchange them for the underlying assets to remove any material difference between the share price and NAV. Hence Grayscale's desire to convert GBTC is important for investors. If it does it, then the current discount to NAV will very likely collapse to zero, or very near zero. That creates potential upside ; even after the ruling, the discount is 13%. That appears too wide. Context Grayscale runs a large fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, that holds $22 billion of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and charges a 2% fee. Grayscale has ambitions to remain a key player in the crypto space. If you've recently been to a U.S. airport, you may have seen its ads. Apparently, part of Grayscale's strategic plan is to convert its trust into an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) to help cement its leadership position in the Bitcoin space. However, the SEC blocked Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF application, while allowing futures Bitcoin ETFs to launch. Grayscale argued that approach is inconsistent. Though regulators have relatively free reign, they are generally supposed to be consistent in their approach. The Legal Verdict The ruling was pretty damning for the SEC's case. The court specifically called the actions of the SEC ""arbitrary and capricious"" and noted that there was a 99.9% correlation between Bitcoin futures where the SEC has approved Exchange Traded Products, and spot Bitcoin, where the SEC has not approved Exchange Traded Products. The risk of course is that the SEC appeals, pushing out the timeline, but the legal verdict appears to offer the SEC scant grounds to build an appeals case. The one option they do have is to pull Bitcoin futures based ETFs, but that would be a little absurd and hurt their credibility given they already approved these products without incident. Running The Numbers With a favorable legal ruling in place, the question is, what hurdles remain to any ETF launch and the timeline? Certainly, even without any appeals process, an ETF launch may take time. An appeals process could add a year or more to the process. In the case of the Ripple (XRP-USD) verdict, it took the SEC around 3-4 weeks to decide to appeal. However, the ruling on GBTC does appear less ambiguous, even though it is perhaps embarrassing for the SEC to be rebuked by the courts in relatively strong legal terms. Here's the current discount at 12%. Asset value Current price Discount to NAV GBTC $23.41 $20.62 12% With the 10-year yield at 4%, and a 2% fee on GBTC currently, that implies a net 6% return if the GBTC conversion were to take a year. So we're now closer to merger arb type returns with this investment, rather than more speculative returns previously. Considering ETHE As the market understandably prices in optimism on GBTC after the ruling, I think the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) might be more attractive. ETHE is Grayscale's Ethereum fund, similar in many respects, but with a different underlying crypto asset. The legal case is not directly about Ethereum, but if Grayscale gains permission to convert GBTC to an ETF, then it seems logical that ETHE may follow the trend of ETF conversion. Also, the recent Ripple decision may support Grayscale in that regard, because although the SEC may have some success in claiming that some smaller crypto assets are too risky for the public, they are on increasingly shaky legal ground when they make that statement about Bitcoin and now implicitly Ethereum, given the read-across from the Ripple ruling. This matters because ETHE is at a wider spread to NAV than GBTC, but ultimately they may both be subject to the same legal verdict and process. I would, of course, expect ETHE to trade at a slightly wider NAV discount than GBTC, as ETHE is less certain to convert, and maybe the SEC will decide to block it. However, the discount on ETHE is materially wider than GBTC, despite perhaps broadly similar dynamics in play. Fund Current NAV Discount GTBC 12% ETHE 25% Risks This article considers only NAV discounts when the swings in the underlying value of crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum will also drive investment returns. Crypto assets have no fundamental value so could theoretically fall to zero. The legal appeals process or ETF registration process could push out the timeline for a favorable actual outcome reducing returns. Grayscale may elect not to convert their funds to ETFs. These crypto funds generally carry high fees of around 2% a year or so based off NAV, so this can erode any potential return while you wait. Conclusion There may be some remaining upside on GBTC after the legal ruling as the SEC might be hard-pushed to find grounds to appeal. We should know the SEC's decision on that within a month if the Ripple process is any guide. However, at current trading levels, swings in the price of Bitcoin itself will perhaps drive the investment more so than the NAV discount. This suggests there may be some upside remaining in GBTC even though the NAV discount has compressed. However, the more attractive investment could be ETHE because the fund may see a similar ultimate outcome to GBTC, but with a materially wider NAV discount today. Bear in mind that if you invest in these funds, the swings in the prices of the underlying crypto assets, and the relatively high fees, may impact your returns as much, or more, than any changes in NAV discounts/premiums.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4631780-legal-win-presents-further-upside-for-grayscale-bitcoin-trust?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/17249781.jpeg

Hosting A Grand Celebratory Bash Ripple, a leading global payments network, declared openly on Monday, August 28, its intentions to throw a dedicatory party to honor its win over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple’s win against the US SEC is not only a positive result for the cryptocurrency, but a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry in regards to regulatory clarity and transparency. Related Reading: JP Morgan Explains Why Bitcoin Price May Not Fall Further It’s understandable the relief the Ripple community feels after going through many hurdles that came with the SEC lawsuit, not just in monetary losses, but in its reputation and position as a cryptocurrency with as much potential as Bitcoin. Ripple has disclosed some information about the celebratory party on X (formerly known as Twitter). The cryptocurrency firm stated that the party will be hosted in New York City on Friday, September 29, emphasizing to the general public to “save the date” and look forward to a great celebration. “We’re hosting a community celebration on September 29 in New York City! Stay tuned for more details to come later this week,” Ripple tweeted. The CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse also took to X, enthusiastically informing the public of the date of the party and how he looks forward to properly commemorating the cryptocurrency’s victory against the US SEC. “As promised – it’s time for that proper victory party,” Garlinghouse said. “The last few years have been quite the journey and I look forward to sharing a celebratory toast on Sept 29 in NYC!” Token maintains above $0.51 as Ripple celebrates | Source: XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com The Spin-Off From Ripple And SEC Lawsuit Ripple and the US SEC have been embroiled in a lawsuit for years. The SEC first filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, alleging that the cryptocurrency firm was selling unregistered securities in its native token, XRP. Instead of accepting the SEC’s demands and paying the liabilities, Ripple responded to the allegations by engaging in a legal battle that has been ongoing for about three years. During those years, Ripple has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in its effort to defend against the SEC’s allegations. Its native cryptocurrency was delisted from several exchanges including Bitstamp. The token also suffered from massive liquidations in the XRP futures contract. It was only this year that things started turning around for the cryptocurrency after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple and declared that programmatic XRP sales should not be labeled a security. Related Reading: Binance Will Halt These 39 Liquidity Mining Pools This Week XRP sales jumped following Ripple’s partial win against the SEC. The cryptocurrency firm also inked a new partnership with Mastercard and is poised to be listed on Gemini. Even though the SEC is not too happy with Ripple’s win over the case and has submitted an interlocutory appeal against the cryptocurrency firm, XRP’s price remains somewhat stable. The crypto firm has also remained strong and enjoyed the support of notable cryptocurrency enthusiasts including Pantera CEO, Dan Morehead who labeled Ripple’s victory as a “positive black swan.” Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | ICO | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-party-sec/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/16702991.jpeg

The price has since pulled to just above $27,900.  GBTC is higher by 17%, narrowing its discount to net asset value (NAV) from 25% to 17% as traders place bets that the ruling could pave the way for an ETF conversion that would entirely eliminate the discount.  The legal victory potentially opens the door for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Advocates have long argued that allowing this type of product would enable a greater swath of the general public to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the trouble of buying the crypto directly or deal with potential issues like their custody providers collapsing.

42419715,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTbB,1693323195,The Many Layers of the SEC’s First NFT Enforcement Action,"I cannot recall something that was labeled as a non-fungible token (NFT) being treated as a security by U.S. regulators previously. According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this case is the first.  With that in mind, it’s important to revisit first principles on selling crypto-critters in the United States. One thing which I see a lot of, all the time, is when developers start out with something that is unregulated and gradually mission-creep their way into something regulated.  Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner of Brown Rudnick's Digital Commerce Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies.  Given how powerful cryptocurrency tech is, these mistakes are shockingly easy to make. This is because cryptocurrency, particularly the smart contract variety like Ethereum, is capable of “captur[ing] unlimited richness in flows of actions and events; computer scientists might prefer to recognise this as a state machine with money,"" as computer scientist Ian Grigg writes.  A state machine with money, of course, is capable of performing virtually any function normally performed by the financial technology stack because it automates and secures the “money” portion of it programmatically in a manner which in TradFi needs to be secured by a human authenticator.  Grigg’s essay ""Financial Cryptography in 7 Layers"" – which predates crypto-as-we-know-it by nine years and Ethereum-style smart contracts by 15 years – neatly disaggregates the wet-code concepts which are factored by a human authenticator which most crypto developers, frequently unknowingly, attempt to program into their smart contract applications, compressed into a single layer as they try to implement a particular specification.  7 layers  “Legal,” of course, pervades all of these layers. Or to paraphrase Jean-Jacques Rousseau “most crypto projects are born free, yet everywhere they are in chains.”  Designing a basic protocol application and the act of hashing a proof-of-work genesis block is not, generally speaking, a regulated activity anywhere in the world. It is the stuff protocol engineers do afterwards such as creating incentives to use the chain and bring in new users (items five through seven on the above framework).  Last week, for example, we saw the Tornado Cash indictment come down. There were howls of dissent from much of the crypto community over this due to the perception that the U.S. government was seeking to censor code and suppress open-source developers.  Without prejudice to the constitutional presumption of innocence to which all criminal defendants are rightly entitled, having read the indictment, it seems there was a lot of post-instantiation development of the Tornado Cash platform the devs in hindsight might have preferred to avoid.  Just as an unstoppable blockchain app ignores the law, the unstoppable law ignores the blockchain  Leaving protocols published on GitHub without choosing to then embark on associated altcoin launches or management of the protocol as a going concern might be a recipe for protocol failure and obsolescence. It’s also a way to hew much more closely to the First Amendment and cases like Bernstein v. United States, which challenged restrictions on the export of cryptography.  Similarly, one thing I see often enough, and increasingly in the wake of Gary Gensler crackdown on more “traditional” financial products, is the recharacterization of certain crypto-asset securities as “non-fungible tokens” or NFTs.  Impact Theory, the L.A.-based entertainment company that drew the SEC's ire, basically issued “NFTs” in three tranches. As the SEC summarized in its case filing:  Further, the SEC writes: ""In advance of the offering, Impact Theory publicly stated that it would deliver 'tremendous value' to KeyNFT purchasers. Impact Theory also stated that it would use the offering proceeds for 'development,' 'bringing on more team,' and 'creating more projects.'"" The company sold NFTs, condensed those proceeds into a single wallet and used the funding to pay vendors and service providers, the SEC added.  It bears reminding that the Howey Test, the gauge the SEC uses to determine whether something is an investment contract that can be regulated as a security, “embodies a flexible, rather than static, principle.” The test is designed to look towards the substance of the transaction or sale or offering and not how it is labeled when determining whether something is or isn’t a security.  See also: Preston Byrne – Ripple Labs Ruling Throws U.S. Crypto-Token Regulation Into Disarray  The NFT space, which is relatively new, is no different. If a non-fungible token is sold in exchange for an investment of money in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profit arising from the efforts of a promoter or a third party, it is just as liable to be a security as a fungible token sold in the same manner and with the same expectations.  Mind you, Impact Theory seems, at least from the settlement, to have been very far on the wrong side of the line, a dissent from SEC Hester Commissioners Pierce and Mark T. Uyeda notwithstanding. As users on the project's Discord wrote, “It’s like investing 10k with a 300k upside, for a small risk,” and “Everyone here is an early adopter! Buying a founders [sic] key is Like [sic] investing in Disney, Call of Duty and YouTube all at once.” Another said investing in the Impact Theory team is like ""handing $20 to Mark Zuckerberg in his dorm room.”  In other words if the sellers were selling a literal rock attached to those promises, to say nothing of an NFT, I could make out the case that they were selling securities. But there is no reason why this same regulatory mistake is also one that could be fairly easily, and entirely honestly, committed by inexperienced founders or otherwise legitimate projects who are stacking on additional functionality to please their users.  See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Just as an unstoppable blockchain app ignores the law, the unstoppable law ignores the blockchain. Labels and choice of data structures are part of the regulatory puzzle but are not dispositive. Substance is.  Infinitely expressive “state machines with money” (i.e. blockchains) tempt developers to build things that people will want to buy, and make it trivially easy to do so. But writing the code for the machine is one thing which happens fairly low down on the conceptual seven-layer stack; operating the machine as a going concern is quite another and lives at the top of the stack, where the laws are most active too.  Understanding that different regulatory regimes apply to different layers is a basic prerequisite to providing good legal advice in this area. Just as a token labelled a “utility token” has been assessed as problematic by U.S. regulators, so too can a token labelled a “non-fungible token,” even if the data structure utilized by that token does in fact make it non-fungible. Proceed accordingly.  This article is excerpted from Preston Byrne's website.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

The U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of Grayscale, overturning the SEC’s lawsuit and potentially bringing the company one step closer to achieving Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) status. Bitcoin Surges As Grayscale’s Legal Victory Boosts Market Sentiment The recent ruling by the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals has dealt a significant blow to the SEC’s efforts to impede Grayscale’s progress in establishing a Bitcoin spot ETF. Related Reading: MATIC Risks Heavy Decline If It Falls Below This Price Level, Analyst Says While this decision does not automatically convert Grayscale’s flagship product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), into a Spot ETF, it undoubtedly marks a crucial milestone toward achieving that goal. James Seyffart, Bloomberg’s renowned ETF expert, emphasizes that this legal triumph for Grayscale brings the company closer to attaining ETF status for Bitcoin. The court’s decision to vacate the SEC’s denial of GBTC’s conversion into an ETF opens doors for further discussions and advancements in the cryptocurrency market. As a result, Bitcoin has experienced a notable surge of over 4%, currently trading at $27,300, slightly above its 200-day Moving Average (MA). Initially, there were concerns that the MA could hinder Bitcoin’s recovery from recent setbacks. However, in light of the recent developments regarding Grayscale’s legal victory, BTC effortlessly surpassed the $27,000 mark and briefly reached $27,500. To sustain its recovery, Bitcoin must maintain the $27,000 level and avoid falling below the moving average once again. Establishing the MA as a new support level would safeguard against short-term price declines. Furthermore, it would position the cryptocurrency favorably for another attempt to overcome the resistance at $28,000, should it fail to breach this barrier in its initial efforts.

Related Reading: MATIC Social Sentiment Slides To Negative Territory – What’s The Impact On Price? Over the last seven days, MATIC has recorded both negative and positive movements, often finding support at the $0.53-$0.54 price zone. Interestingly, Martinez predicts that if the Polygon native token lost this support level, it would likely fall as low as $0.40, representing a potential 27% decline from MATIC’s current price. The analyst further emphasizes the importance of this support level, stating it is “guarded” by 3,770 wallet addresses that collectively own 70.19 million MATIC tokens. Looking at MATIC’s daily chart, investors may have real cause to pay attention to Martinez’s prediction as the token’s price movement forms a descending channel. Based on this pattern, MATIC could likely record little gains in the coming days, but its long-term outlook indicates the continuation of its current bearish trend. However, investors are reminded that all price predictions are speculative with no guarantees. MATIC trading at $0.554 on the daily chart | Source: MATICUSD chart on Tradingview.com MATIC Daily Active Address On the Rise On a more positive note for MATIC, the Polygon network has experienced a significant rise in its daily active addresses over the last few days based on data from market intelligence firm Santiment. Following a steady decline in mid-August that saw this metric fall to around 182,000 on August 20, there has been a notable recovery, with the daily active address count reaching about 264,000 on Monday, August 28. This indicates an increased interest in Polygon despite MATIC’s little price movement in the last week. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) At June Lows Again – Prospects For Bullish Recovery? In other news, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Naiwal has posted an update on Polygon 2.0 detailing the benefits of MATIC’s proposed upgrade, the POL token. According to data from CoinMarketCap, MATIC is currently trading at $0.55 with a 0.05% loss in the last day. However, the token’s daily trading volume is on the green side, rising by 0.52% to be valued at $248.56 million. With a market cap of $5.16 billion, MATIC is ranked as the 14th largest cryptocurrency.

42419704,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTOn,1693320595,SEC's Secret Binance Court Filing Has Observers Bracing for Bad News,"A new secret court filing related to Binance, the crypto exchange that already faces U.S. accusations of wrongdoing, has some wondering whether more bad news is about to hit the industry giant.  On Monday, in the court docket for its case against Binance, the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a sealed motion, which lets it file sensitive or confidential information without revealing the contents publicly.  The motion included more than 35 exhibits, a declaration from Jennifer Farer (an SEC trial attorney) and a proposed order.  A spokesperson for Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk.  Filing court documents under seal is a “rare move,” John Reed Stark, a former SEC official who now runs a consulting firm, posted on X (formerly Twitter). “After all, it’s in the public interest to know and understand the SEC’s use of U.S. tax dollars and the U.S. SEC wants its messages heard loud and clear to deter future securities violations.”  Stark offered two theories about what the SEC is doing: It’s trying to avoid interfering with a criminal investigation at the U.S. Department of Justice, or the SEC is worried about putting a witness or company at risk.  The SEC in June sued Binance on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering unregistered securities to the general public in the form of its BNB token and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.  “Under any circumstance, that this SEC seal-seeking filing is unusual, odd and uncommon cannot be overstated,” Stark wrote. “In my almost 20 years in the SEC Enforcement Division, including 11 years as Chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, our team worked on and led a broad range of SEC investigations which involved parallel U.S. DOJ investigations and lots of litigation – and I can’t recall ever seeking to file a motion or any other court document under seal.”",NEGATIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/29/secs-secret-binance-court-filing-has-observers-bracing-for-bad-news,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67e163329fcc7b48726860056b4d91455eced26e-5559x3127.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419700,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTLh,1693319145,"SEC Must Review Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Bid After Previous Rejection, Appeals Court Rules","The U.S. may be about to get its first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, after a federal court ruled that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must review its rejection of Grayscale Investments' attempt to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.  The legal victory potentially opens the door for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Advocates have long argued that allowing this type of product would enable a greater swath of the general public to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the trouble of buying it directly or deal with potential issues like their custody providers collapsing. The SEC has disapproved every such ETF application it's reviewed to date, though a new swath of applicants are now hoping for success.  Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, writing the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion, said that federal agencies are required to ""treat like cases alike.""  ""The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved the trading of two bitcoin futures funds on national exchanges but denied approval of Grayscale’s bitcoin fund. Petitioning for review of the Commission’s denial order, Grayscale maintains its proposed bitcoin exchange-traded product is materially similar to the bitcoin futures exchange-traded products and should have been approved to trade on NYSE Arca. We agree,"" she said.  The SEC did not explain why it was treating these products differently, making the Grayscale denial ""arbitrary and capricious,"" she added.  Bitcoin's price spiked after the ruling was unveiled.  The ruling seemed to specify that the issue wasn't the SEC's rejection of the application so much the agency's failure to properly explain itself.  ""Grayscale has demonstrated its proposed bitcoin ETP is materially similar, across relevant regulatory factors, to the approved bitcoin futures ETPs,"" the ruling said. ""First, the underlying assets – bitcoin and bitcoin futures – are closely correlated. And second, the surveillance sharing agreements with the CME are identical and should have the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin and bitcoin futures.""  Grayscale shared enough arguments that its proposed ETF was similar to the recently-approved Teucrium and Valkyrie bitcoin futures products, which warrants ""the same regulatory treatment,"" the order said.  The order did not direct the SEC to immediately approve Grayscale's bid to convert its ETF application, but rather to review the application again.  ""The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale’s proposed bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition for review and vacate the Commission’s order,"" the ruling said.  A Grayscale spokeswoman called the move ""a monumental step forward for American investors,"" adding that the legal team was reviewing the opinion and would ""be pursuing next steps with the SEC.""  In a social media post, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein echoed the statement.  Long journey  Grayscale Investments, the manager behind world’s largest cryptocurrency fund, first applied for its GBTC closed-end fund to be converted into an exchange traded fund in October 2021. The SEC rejected the application, stating in its decision that the application failed to answer the SEC's questions about preventing market manipulation, as well as other concerns.  Grayscale then filed an appeal against the SEC barely an hour after the regulatory agency rejected its application. In the filing, Grayscale asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC's order. Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.  The court decision comes after a flurry of large institutions filed applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, with asset manager BlackRock filing its application in June. BlackRock’s filing generated a large amount of optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF might be approved. Others like Fidelity, the large mutual-fund manager, have also applied for bitcoin ETFs. Seven bitcoin futures ETFs have been trading since 2021.  The Grayscale product has traded at a discount to the underlying asset since February 2021. The discount deepend to a record 50% in December after the SEC reiterated its reasons for denying Grayscale’s application to convert the trust into an ETF. However, following large names filing for bitcoin spot ETFs, GBTC saw its discount narrow to levels of around 25%, the smallest discount since early 2022.  Market analysts have long said that the conversion from a closed-end fund to an ETF will likely eliminate the discount of GBTC entirely, due to the nature of ETFs which generally trade close to their fair value.  The structure of the fund will largely stay the same, bar a few things. The shares will now be registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. Prior to the conversion, GBTC shares were offered through a private placement process — meaning they were initially only available to accredited investors and subject to a six month holding period.  Another alteration to the structure is the shares will be uplisted from over-the-counter markets to the NYSE Arca. The new structure will also allow for redemptions, which were not previously allowed.  Grayscale previously stated that it would lower its fees if GBTC got converted to an ETF. The fund charged a 2% annual fee.  A spokesperson for the SEC told CoinDesk it was ""reviewing the court’s decision to determine next steps.""

42419711,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTY5,1693318496,Will Crypto Ever Be Rid of Influencers Like BitBoy?,"Did anyone else know that Ben Armstrong was not BitBoy? On Monday, news broke that Armstrong, host of one of the industry’s most successful cryptocurrency trading shows, BitBoy Crypto, has been unceremoniously dumped. And in the divorce, it appears that Arrmstrong will lose the moniker and brand he created.  Boy, this is a bit like finding out that there never was a Pee-wee Herman, just a middle aged man who became known for the playhouse he hung around a lot — only a lot less endearing. ​​BitBoy, I mean, Armstrong, was one of the most influential trading gurus in the game, and likely the most loathed.  Many are now asking who will replace BitBoy, if that's even possible, and why it took so long for someone with so much baggage to be booted. When coming across Armstrong on social media, many saw crypto's enfants terribles — a clear representation of how hype can pollute markets and tech.  No stranger to controversy, it appears the Battle over BitBoy is only beginning. Armstong, apparently locked out of the official BitBoy profile on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter suggested something was awry with his firing when posting from an account linked to his personal token $BEN. He’s gone from manning an account with 1 million followers to posting under an apparently unaffiliated altcoin with a ticker that shares his name.  “This is Ben,” Ben wrote. “Just confirming what is going around. It’s true. There has been a mutiny at BitBoy Crypto & Hit Network.” The chairs have turned on Pee-wee? I mean Herman. I mean…Paul? It certainly seems. Other cryptorati and known BitBoy associates seemed to endorse the statement and offer condolences, including Wendy O, a crypto educator on YouTube and co-host of daily CoinDesk TV talk show “The Hash.”  Only Armstrong’s response, which promised to tell of a “mutiny” and backstabbing, seems like yet another extremely misjudged media stunt by the day trading crypto influencer who made a habit out of turning huge swaths of the industry against him. From his ill fated libel suit of YouTuber Atozy to accusations of plagiarism and intellectual property theft, BitBoy seems to have mastered the art of negative attention.  Fellow YouTuber Wendy seemed to back the idea the putsch to remove Armstrong isn’t a settled story in her initial reaction video — titled as it were “⛔INSANE drama BITBOY leaves crypto? Bitcoin WARNING.” Oh, the intrigue. And given that gossip is up when markets are down on Crypto Twitter (it’s a type of speculation, innit), I’m sure there will be a dozen different versions of the story in time.  More than one person, for instance, raised the specter of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is not too far-fetched that Armstrong may have violated one of those laws the SEC seems focused on like always “disclosing when you’re a paid promoter” that got Kim Kardashian.  There’s no over/under bet running on a possible securities violation lawsuit on Polymarket yet, though there are certainly a number of projects that BitBoy has promoted or advertised or that set off alarm bells.  See also: Social Media & Crypto Influencers Who Got It Wrong | Opinion  For instance, in early 2022, crypto sleuth ZachXBT compiled a list of dozens of altcoins BitBoy mentioned in videos. Instead of trading up 100x, as Armstong hinted would happen, these coins almost without exception ran into the dirt well before the bottom fell out of the entire crypto market. Curiously, many of Armstrong’s uploads about these flash-in-the-pan, get in while the getting is good coins have been deleted from YouTube.  Worse, at least in my mind, is that this wasn’t even a game restricted to the bull market where it seemed like everyone and their mother had a token to sell you. A few months ago Armstrong began promoting the aforementioned $BEN token, a real old-fashioned, ICO-like token that wants to fix crypto literacy somehow. It’s down 40% at time of writing, proof enough its value prop is an affinity with Armstrong (not a vague plan to publish even more introductory blockchain content).  Armstrong is not listed as an executive, advisor or “community ambassador” on the project website that shares his name — though the $BEN Coin Collective YouTube page redirects to BitBoy’s old channel. Curiously, too, part of BenCoin’s proposed solution to fix crypto media is stamping out what many believe is Armstrong’s bread and butter: Paid Promotions.  For its part, Ben’s former employer Hit Network said the rift was caused by Ben’s relapse into substance abuse, and his termination was a way to “reconcile the emotional, physical and financial damage he has done to the employees…and the Bitboy Crypto community.” This is not the first time BitBoy’s sobriety has been questioned, and if true is as sad as it is helpful in explaining some of his past behavior.  I wish him luck getting healthier.  And thus we arrive at the point of departure for the essay: There is almost nothing the world could learn about Armstrong or his old operation that would lower his estimation among much of the crypto industry. He is all that is cringe about crypto incarnate. He is a true believer in blockchain who undercuts the good it could do by allegedly running a “pay-to-play” operation.  Plus he appears to be a megalomaniac. Armstrong has been filmed screaming at people at conferences, is known to foster long grievances and cannot handle the slightest whiff of criticism. He claims to represent The Everyman against monied interests in crypto, and for a while got it into his head that he not only had something to do with bringing down FTX, but did it single-handedly by criticizing Sam Bankman-Fried.  For onlookers (and armchair psychologists like me), this last point is the type of psychic transference only possible by a person who willingly leads his fans into the lion’s den. It’s all the more psychologically rich in that despite his protestations, there’s documented evidence of him shilling FTT. (Though, to be fair, BitBoy did have a response to detractors: “Saying you like a coin is not promotion, that’s like saying Bitcoin pays me to promote it you low iq troglodyte.”)  This is behavior the kids nowadays call gaslighting. I’m not sure if there’s a term that also encompasses or explains why Armstrong thought it was a good idea to wage an alleged vendetta campaign against the lawyer suing him in a class action or skip court to go on a BitBoy-branded cruise. It takes a special type of person to have a personally branded cruise.  And yet! Despite the fact that the most dubious of “dubious investments” he’s lent his credibility have tanked, the guy clearly has his supporters. I don’t think this means anyone has actually made money listening to Armstrong, it often seems by the time BitBoy is letting you in the know of some “1,000x” altcoin by mentioning it on his old program, the money that flows in will soon become exit liquidity.  But this is exactly the point of the larger wave of digital transformation that crypto is caught up in. Now that anyone can “control their own distribution” by posting online, the floodgates have been thrown open as to what fame and infamy means. This is the 1,000 True Fans theory in action. And in a nutshell: Anyone can eke out a living or even riches doing just about anything online, so long as you have a few dedicated backers willing to buy your stuff or pay you attention to advertise against.  It makes no difference whether you or I like or respect BitBoy, because he’s a roving star on the internet. The only real question is assuming he’s lost the IP over BitBoy, which I don’t think is a settled matter, whether he could replicate his prior success. There’s nothing inherent in a name that denotes success (for instance, CoinDesk built a reputation as a trusted news and events business with a name like Coin…Desk — with the camelCase, please).  See also: BitBoy Lost His Lawsuit the Instant He Filed It | Opinion  This is part of the reason BitBoy seems determined to mount a comeback, evening taunting his former colleagues by saying “Until they can clone me, I have nothing to worry about.” In the end I’m no closer to understanding who or what BitBoy is: a name, the man behind the name, a persona that could be passed down.  Blockchain, of course, helps to fill the gaps of the current digital age by offering actual ownership of social media profiles and the like, which are otherwise controlled by faceless corporations and all too familiar tech billionaires. Anyone, anywhere can use Bitcoin or Ethereum because their creators determined that no one should be able to definitively determine who is “good” or “bad” or what is in or what is off limits — let the market decide.

According to data from Nansen, 90% of the stablecoin’s total supply still remains with its issuer Paxos’ wallet. Paypal’s PYUSD Adoption Setback The payment giant Paypal’s recently launched stablecoin PYUSD continues to struggle with adoption and has failed to gain traction since its official launch on August 7, 2023. Despite PayPal having over 350 million users worldwide, on-chain data from Nansen has shown that only a small percentage of its user base is currently using and holding the PYUSD in self-custody wallets. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Proves Positive As Shiba Inu-Based BONE Celebrates New Milestone “On the surface there’s a lack of demand from crypto users for PYUSD when other alternatives exist,” said Nansen in a report. However, it is believed that lack of enthusiasm might involve the stablecoin’s lack of utility and not being able to earn interest on the stablecoin, as highlighted by an X (formerly Twitter) user in a post on August 26, 2023. 🚨Problem: Nobody wants to mint $pyUSD because there’s not much to do with it and it doesn’t pay any interest. 💡Solution: – $pyUSD – $crvUSD pool – $CRV gauge approval from Curve DAO@PayPal 🤝 @CurveFinance $PYPL #DeFi https://t.co/jVr7sN36KH pic.twitter.com/NUdsKmfY8F — DefiMoon 🦇🔊 (@DefiMoon) August 26, 2023 The stablecoin’s holdings on crypto exchange wallets are also low, accounting for just about 7% of the stablecoin’s total supply. This percentage takes into account the balances on centralized exchanges such as Kraken, Crypto.com, and Gate.io. Despite the high expectations in the crypto industry following the release of the stablecoin that it would actually promote wider adoption and introduce cryptocurrencies to the masses for the first time, the stablecoin has failed to live up to expectations and smart money investors seem perfectly comfortable to circumvent the stablecoin. The largest holder of the stablecoin holds less than $10,000 worth of PYUSD after the holder sold about 3 meme coins to purchase the stablecoin. Excluding contracts or exchanges, not more than 10 holders have a balance surpassing $1,000. According to Coinmarketcap, PYUSD has a total supply of 43 million PYUSD tokens and pools in decentralized exchanges like Uniswap’s PYUSD/USDC and PYUSD/wETH accounts to only 50,000 PYUSD tokens respectively. The PYUSD tokens have been criticized for being overly centralized, as the majority of its total supply turns out to be stored on centralized exchanges, resulting in difficulty in growing its circulation. Despite such a high total supply, the collective total number of the stablecoin’s holders according to Etherscan is merely 324 at the time of this writing. PayPal's stablecoin maintains dollar peg | Source: PYUSD/USD on Tradingview.com Expectations On Ethereum For The Stablecoin According to JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, following the first week of Paypal’s stablecoin launch, Ethereum enjoyed no benefit from PYUSD when looking at things such as increased network activity, increased Total Value Locked (TVL), and enhancing Ethereum’s network utility as a stablecoin/DeFi platform.

42419713,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTZ7,1693317600,Polygon Releases 'Chain Development Kit' for ZK-Powered Networks on Ethereum,"Ethereum scaling firm Polygon released a toolkit for developers to help them build blockchains fueled by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.  The Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source codebase that developers can use to create their own customizable layer 2 chains using Polygon’s ZK technology. These chains will be connected to each other through a ZK-powered bridge, so every chain would be interoperable, Polygon said in a press release. Together, they will form what Polygon is calling the “Value Layer.”  The announcement comes as other layer 2s, like Matter Labs’ zkSync and Starkware’s Starknet, are coming out with their own ZK-powered toolkits for developers to build their own chains. Matter Labs’ ZK Stack is already live, while Starknet’s package will be released to the market soon.  Polygon turned heads in 2021 with its main proof-of-stake network, seen by many developers and crypto-market analysts as one of the most promising ways of scaling Ethereum. But blockchain developers have since moved to promote a more closely connected type of layer-2 network known as ""rollups."" Polygon has adapted to the trend, launching its own rollup while also explicitly embracing zero-knowledge cryptography as a core element of its technology roadmap.  Polygon also has a toolkit for developers to create customizable chains that are application-specific, called “Supernets.”  But the scaling team is betting that CDK will be the next evolution, given that it uses ZK proofs, and that “all existing Supernets can upgrade current architecture to leverage the industry-leading ZK technology of Polygon,” the company said.  “The goal is simple: build the Value Layer of the Internet, a core protocol that makes creating, sending and receiving value of any kind as seamless and functional as sending or receiving information over the Internet,” Polygon said in a press release.

16698585,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549269,1693314001,"DYDX Is Up By 11% In A Week, But Investors Must Watch Out For This Event","DYDX, the native token of a decentralized exchange (DEX) with the same name, has been on a good run in the past few days. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency’s price jumped by 10.7% in the past week, reflecting a positive performance after an unfavorable start to August. However, there has been rising concern that this spurt of bullish momentum may be short-lived. And the upcoming token unlock event is the primary source of this skepticism. dYdX To Unlock $13.8 Million Worth Of Token In Single Event Token unlock events are not a strange phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, as many blockchain networks and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have a portion of their token supply locked – to be released periodically. DYDX is one of those tokens with a locked supply and its next token unlock event is happening on Tuesday, August 29. In the latest iteration, the decentralized exchange will unlock $13.82 million worth of its native token to be distributed to its community treasury and rewards for liquidity providers and traders, according to data from Token Unlocks. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Put Up A Fight, But Can They Clear This Major Hurdle? The token tracking dashboard shows that the DEX will release 6.52 million DYDX tokens, which accounts for 3.76% of the token’s current circulating supply. Breaking this figure down, 2.49 million tokens – equivalent to $5.279 million at the current market price – will be allocated to the community treasury, which funds contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining, and so on. Meanwhile, the remaining 4.03 DYDX tokens will be distributed between trading rewards (2.88 million tokens worth roughly $6.11 million) and liquidity provider rewards (1.15 million tokens worth an estimated $2.44 million). This is the second time the DEX will be carrying out an unlock event in August 2023. On August 1, 2023, dYdX executed an identical unlock event, distributing the same amount of tokens to the community treasury, liquidity providers, and traders. Upon completion of this forthcoming event, over 25% of the total token supply will be unlocked, while less than 75% of the supply will still be locked. Could This Event Hamper DYDX’s Rise? Given that a considerable chunk of the 6.52 million DYDX tokens will be going to liquidity providers and traders, the chances are that a substantial portion of the tokens will be offloaded in the open market. As such, the DYDX price could suffer due to increased selling pressure. The signs are not particularly positive from a historical perspective, either. Price action data reveals that the price of DYDX struggled after the identical unlock event on August 1. Related Reading: MATIC Social Sentiment Slides To Negative Territory – What’s The Impact On Price? The token lost nearly 10% of its value in a few days, reaching $1.91 by August 4. Although the token has witnessed an impressive turnaround, investors could see DYDX fall below the $2 level again if history were to repeat itself. As of this writing, the DYDX token changes hands for $2.12, reflecting a 1.7% price dip in the last 24 hours. CoinGecko data shows that there has been a 36.2% decline in the token’s daily trading volume, signaling a recent fall in market activity.

42419714,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTa9,1693312529,First Mover Americas: Is Bitcoin Close to Breaking Out of Its Current Range?,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen back below $26,000, losing 0.73% on the day, reflecting generally bearish sentiment among crypto traders and a lack of bullish catalysts to rally markets. BTC fell as low as $25,886 on Monday after rallying briefly last week to $26,200, but has since dropped back close to where it started last week. Institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital said in a note that bitcoin is getting closer to a breakout from the current range due to how tight the contraction has gotten in recent sessions. “Whenever ranges get too tight, it’s often a warning sign for a surge in volatility,” the exchange said in a note. Etoro analyst Simon Peters said softness in the market is also being seen in other asset classes, such as equities. He said in a morning note that this comes as investors “pay close attention to the discussions at Jackson Hole …The indication from Wyoming is that central bankers are intent on keeping rates at higher levels to prevent a resurgence in inflation – which is not being taken well by risk assets across the board.”  Digital Currency Group (DCG) has reached an in-principle deal with Genesis creditors to resolve the claims brought up in Genesis' bankruptcy, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The plan could result in the recoveries of 70%-90% in USD equivalent for unsecured creditors and 65%-90% recovery on an in-kind basis depending on the denomination of the digital asset. All the estimated recoveries are subject to market pricing and definitive documentation. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  All of FTX founder’s Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed witnesses should be disqualified from testifying because their disclosure filings are insufficient, their experience may be misleading or their planned testimony may not be relevant, prosecutors said in a late Monday filing. Bankman-Fried’s team, for its part, wants to exclude a financial analysis expert proposed by the Department of Justice because his proposed testimony may not be allowed under the rules. The filings, part of the so-called Daubert motions due Monday, laid out the two teams’ views on why their opponents should not be able to call certain witnesses to the stand when Bankman-Fried goes on trial for fraud and conspiracy charges in a little over a month. The DOJ moved to discount all seven of the expert witnesses proposed by Bankman-Fried’s team, saying that some of the disclosures they filed did not detail their opinions, while others “are inappropriate subjects for expert testimony” or possibly confusing for a potential jury.Trending Posts",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/29/first-mover-americas-is-bitcoin-close-to-breaking-out-of-its-current-range,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88fbc252892f4664b7a1af7dce8c40c8a6cc8706-1125x656.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419709,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTUz,1693312184,Dogecoin's 10% Decline This Year Led By Bearish European Hours,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 10% this year, with most of the bearish pressure on the leading meme crypto coming during European hours, according to data tracked by Velo Data app.  DOGE's cumulative year-to-date returns during European and U.S. trading hours were -44.44% and -25%, respectively. Meanwhile, the cumulative return during the Asia-Pacific day stood at a positive 25.6%.  In other words, sellers have been dominant during the European hours, represented by 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Brussels time, and U.S. hours, identified by 08:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. New York time. Meanwhile, buyers have had the upper hand during the Asian hours, identified as 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Seoul time.  Self-proclaimed dogecoin killer shiba inu's (SHIB) session-wise returns paint a similar picture. Meanwhile, bitcoin has consistently rallied during the American hours.  Velo decided on these equal-length time windows after considering local volume profiles and stock exchange hours. Some overlap exists between the sessions.  Memecoins have been around for a while and traded heavily on South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, which explains DOGE and SHIB's positive performance during the Asian hours. During DOGE's 10% surge in late July, most of trading volume came from Upbit – known for speculation in crypto-Korean won trading pairs.  Per Matrixport, South Korea dominates the market for smaller tokens due to a lack of social mobility opportunities, sky-high property prices and a competitive labor market.  Besides, the dour performance of DOGE and SHIB during U.S. and European hours is consistent with the murky regulatory outlook for alternative cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in its lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance, filed in June, referred to several altcoins as securities. DOGE and SHIB were not mentioned, but stricter regulations for altcoins could impact memecoins.",NEGATIVE,DOGE | SHIB,ALTCOIN | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/29/dogecoins-10-decline-this-year-led-by-bearish-european-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, despite the increasing interest, these tokens are grappling with a persistently bearish sentiment, as their price performance remains lackluster. In an interesting turn of events, a significant number of investors are beginning to cast their gaze upon PEPE. Lookonchain’s latest report reveals a notable occurrence – a user invested 27 ETH, equivalent to $45,000, to secure a staggering 50 billion of the frog-themed token. More astonishingly, this same investor managed to acquire a jaw-dropping 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens for a mere 0.125 ETH, roughly valued at $251. This strategic move was followed by the sale of 3.95 trillion PEPE tokens, resulting in an impressive haul of 2,505 ETH, equivalent to $4.7 million. Related Reading: MATIC Social Sentiment Slides To Negative Territory – What’s The Impact On Price? Surge In PEPE Interest Amid Mixed Sentiment Despite the glaring positivity in terms of investor activity, the overall sentiment surrounding PEPE tokens remains less than stellar. Lookonchain’s data cited in a price report indicates that social mentions related to the meme coin witnessed a solid 151.3% surge. Likewise, social engagements related to the coin also experienced a substantial uptick of 106.9% during the same period. This surge in interest could potentially pave the way for a more dynamic price movement for PEPE tokens in the future. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Bearish Pattern Puts Heavy Load On SHIB Advance However, the buoyancy in social media activity was not mirrored in sentiment. Santiment, a prominent on-chain analytics firm, utilized a weighted sentiment indicator to gauge the general outlook of PEPE across various social media platforms. This indicator painted a predominantly negative picture of the meme coin’s sentiment landscape, casting a shadow over the excitement surrounding the token. PEPEUSDT trading at $0.0000054 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Price Volatility On The Horizon Santiment’s analysis also spotlighted a pivotal moment in PEPE’s journey – the transfer of a substantial 16 trillion Pepe tokens by the developers for sale on exchanges. This move thrusts Pepecoin into the spotlight as the top trending crypto topic. However, Santiment’s cautionary note echoes concerns about heightened price volatility that may lie ahead for PEPE tokens, further complicating their price trajectory. Meanwhile, PEPE is trading at a current price of $0.000000839460, with a 3.6% decline in the last 24 hours and a significant seven-day slump of 21.0%, as reported by CoinGecko. 🐸 If you are riding the wave of #memecoins during these uncertain market conditions, #Pepecoin has quickly become the top trending #crypto topic this weekend.

Paul Chan Po-Mo, Financial Secretary for Hong Kong, recently laid out his vision for the future of digital technology in Asia in an official government blog with the title: “Entertainment Goes Beyond Boundaries with Web3”. According to Chan, the global online entertainment market, which stood at USD 184.2 billion in 2021, is projected to skyrocket to USD 653.4 billion by 2027, marking an impressive 21% annual growth. The Cyberport digital community He remarked on the recent Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum, organised by Cyberport, saying that it was a testament to Hong Kong's commitment to this digital evolution. The event, which attracted over 3,500 attendees both online and in-person, served as a platform for experts from over 30 countries to discuss the future of digital entertainment in the Web3 era. The forum also doubled as a highlight of the ""Happy Hong Kong"" campaign, offering a blend of Augmented Reality games, tech workshops, and local delicacies. Cyberport, a digital community in Hong Kong, currently houses over 170 companies specialising in the metaverse, game development, e-sports, and more. Many of these firms are making significant strides in leveraging Web3 and other cutting-edge technologies. Noteworthy achievements include a fitness app that allows users to work out alongside Marvel characters and a metaverse game that has amassed a significant following in Japan. Web3 offers so much more But Web3's potential isn't limited to entertainment. Its foundational technology, blockchain, promises transparency, security, and cost-efficiency. This tech is poised to revolutionise sectors from finance to supply chain management. The recently inaugurated Web3 Living Lab showcases local companies' innovative applications of Web3 in diverse life and business scenarios. From using blockchain to monitor livestock health for financing to introducing programmable tokens for efficient payments, Hong Kong's startups are at the forefront of innovation. The Hong Kong Government isn't far behind. Earlier this year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pioneered the issuance of tokenised green bonds, a global first. This move streamlined the bond issuance process, slashing the lead time from five business days to just one. A Web3 ecosystem To further bolster Web3 development, Chan stated that he had allocated $50 million to Cyberport. The fund aims to nurture a thriving Web3 ecosystem, drawing in businesses, talent, and fostering educational initiatives. Presently, Cyberport is home to over 180 Web3-centric companies, with a significant portion hailing from Mainland China and abroad. The Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development, which Chan chairs, recently held its inaugural meeting. This group, comprising industry leaders and professionals, is dedicated to guiding Hong Kong's Web3 journey, ensuring its sustainable and orderly growth.

16695680,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549256,1693306807,"Bloomberg Expert Analyst Explains Why A Fall To $10,000 Isn’t Bad For Bitcoin","Since the price of Bitcoin fell below $30,000, numerous forecasts have been made on the currency’s potential future price outlook of the asset. As the biggest cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin has amassed price headlines, some of which are optimistic while others are pessimistic. However, a question that lingers is whether another crash is really the end of the world for Bitcoin. In such an event, Mike McGlone, a senior analyst at Bloomberg, believes that even a decrease in price to $10,000 would not be bad for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Still Outperforming The Stock Market A fall in Bitcoin to $10,000 would definitely lead to a chain of events in other cryptocurrencies, as most of the general market sentiment relies on Bitcoin. While many short-term holders and some long-term holders may panic sell, the long-term outlook is still bullish. Related Reading: JP Morgan Explains Why Bitcoin Price May Not Fall Further Market analyst Mike McGlone puts the Bitcoin performance in comparison with the stock market, and the Amazon stock in particular. He points out that even with a 50% drop in its current price, BTC would still be outperforming Amazon stock. Amazon has had one of the best growth in terms of stock price in 20 years. Over the past 20 years, Amazon shares have generated a total return of over 7,000%. However, this is small when compared to how much BTC has grown since its launch in 2009 since the asset is up 26,000x since it first traded for $1 in 2011. “Bitcoin compares with 130% for Amazon on a similar measure, but that took about 25 years. Heading back towards $10,000 would still maintain Bitcoin’s unprecedented performance,” he said. ‘It Went Up, So Will Keep Going Up’ Risks in Bitcoin – The lessons of high-performing, widely hyped assets show price reversion may be the greater risk once the masses jump on board. #Bitcoin at about $26,000 on Aug. 28 is slightly below the end of 2020, similar to… pic.twitter.com/3UdAbpLNLe — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) August 28, 2023 Bitcoin is known for wild price swings since digital currencies are emerging assets, and volatility comes with the territory. With a current market cap of $506 billion, BTC has a 48.3% dominance in the crypto market. BTC price fails to reclaim $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com What’s Next For BTC? Bitcoin is currently trading at $26,000 after the cryptocurrency climbed over $30,000 earlier this year but fears have pushed the price back down to its current level. At its current levels, however, BTC is up more than 30.75% from the same period last year, showing a better price sentiment than in 2022. While BTC could definitely fall further below $26,000, a fall toward $10,000 is highly unlikely as many things would have to go wrong for BTC to reach $10,000. BTC is also gaining more mainstream traction from institutions, especially with current spot Bitcoin ETF filings. As a result, there is a greater possibility of Bitcoin’s price increasing than decreasing in the coming months. Related Reading: Another Bitcoin Metric Is About To Reach A New All-Time High Despite The Bear Market This is not the first time $10,000 price predictions have come in regarding BTC. Late last year, Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital predicted Bitcoin might drop to $10,000 in the short term. On the other hand, there have been some optimistic forecasts made recently. Tom Fundstrat, one of the co-founders of Fundstrat, believes the price of BTC could reach $150,000 or maybe even further by the end of next year.

Tokenization of real-world assets such as government bonds could grow to a $5 trillion market, experts say.  Tradeteq, a U.K-based private debt and real-world asset marketplace, on Tuesday rolled out a tokenized U.S. Treasury offering on the layer 1 blockchain XDC Network, the firm said.  The U.S. Treasury Yield (USTY) tokens represent blockchain-based versions of shares in a U.S. Treasury bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), and are accessible for professional investors on Tradeteq’s Yieldteq platform. Tokenization service provider Securitize onboards buyers, tracks share ownership and manages dividend payouts.  The new offering comes as tokenization has become one of the hottest trends in the battered-down digital asset industry. A Bank of America report said that the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) – creating blockchain-based tokens of traditional financial assets such as government bonds or private equity – could transform the financial infrastructure, while Bernstein forecasted it could grow a 5 trillion market in the next five years.  Demand for tokenized Treasuries has grown nearly sixfold to $622 million this year, according to rwa.xyz. Crypto firms and investment funds seek these products to enjoy higher government bond rates, while yields in crypto lending have plunged amid massive deleveraging during the bear market.  XDC joins a fierce competition between blockchains to be the premier venue for tokenized assets. Stellar and Ethereum are the leading markets for tokenized Treasuries, but other networks are also making headway with RWA adoption. JPMorgan executed trades with tokenized versions of the Japanese yen and the Singapore dollar using the Polygon (MATIC) network, while Securitize issued equity tokens of a real estate investment trust on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain.",POSITIVE,MATIC | XDC,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION | XDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/29/tokenized-us-treasuries-arrive-to-xdc-network-as-digital-bond-market-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The identity of this enigmatic Bitcoin behemoth has finally been unveiled. Wallet identified The wallet in question, which surprisingly climbed the ranks to become the third-largest Bitcoin holder globally in merely over three months, has been identified as belonging to Robinhood: Jump Trading Custody, according to insights from blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence. The journey of this wallet began on March 8, as per data from BitInfoCharts. In the subsequent three months and two weeks, the wallet amassed an impressive 118,000 BTC, which, at current market rates, is valued at approximately $3.08 billion. Conjecture The swift and substantial accumulation of Bitcoin by this single address led to a flurry of theories and conjectures. While some believed it to be a crypto exchange shuffling its funds, others on Crypto Twitter had a more audacious theory. It was speculated that the global investment management corporation, BlackRock, might be the entity behind this massive accumulation. This theory, albeit lacking concrete evidence, gained traction when enthusiasts pointed out the timeline of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF filing, which coincided with the wallet's major transactions. However, with the revelation from Arkham Intelligence, the fog of mystery seems to have lifted. The top two spots for the largest Bitcoin wallets globally are held by Binance and Bitfinex, known for their Bitcoin cold wallets. Following Robinhood's wallet in the third position is another Binance cold wallet. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These long-term holders are also seemingly holding onto their spot positions, refraining from outright trading or using their bitcoin as collateral, analysts from crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a weekly note shared with CoinDesk.  Data cited by Bitfinex states that long-term holders continue to accumulate bitcoin, with 40% unmoved in more than three years, or an all-time high for that metric.  “Looking closely at long-term holder net position changes reveals a consistent accumulation trend since March 2023,” the analysts said. “This behavior indicates optimism and potential resilience against market volatility.”  However, while holders with very high holding timeframes of three years or more continue to accumulate Bitcoin, the one-year inactive supply metric suggests a more bearish sentiment.  “While holders who weathered both the bull market peak and bear market remain steadfast, ""newer"" long-term holders who acquired their positions during the bear market show more unease,” the analysts said. These holders are said to have exited their positions during a price drop from the $29,000 range low in July.  The note comes as crypto markets are enduring some of their longest low-volatility periods in recent years in the absence of favorable catalysts, a sustainable crypto ecosystem and a general lack of interest among retail investors for tokens.

42419712,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTW1,1693303200,Yearn Finance Voters to Wintermute: Drop Dead,"Wintermute Trading is asking Yearn Finance for a 12-month loan of YFI tokens as it hunts for extra yield.  But voters are rejecting the market maker’s advances, calling the deal unfavorable.  Wintermute Trading, one of the biggest market makers in crypto, has hit some governance roadblocks as it hunts for yield across decentralized finance (DeFi) – an ecosystem it helps prop up.  The proprietary trading firm, which supports the DeFi industry by supplying liquidity, is trying and failing to convince supporters of Yearn Finance to loan it 350 YFI tokens – worth over $2 million – in exchange for Wintermute supporting markets for Yearn’s yCRV token. Yearn voters are roundly rejecting the advances as extremely unfair.  The complex situation highlights how Wintermute has grown ever more bold in the ways it seeks to extract value from crypto projects. Gaevoy called the proposal a creative ""win-win"" deal for Wintermute and Yearn on X, formerly Twitter. But on Discord, where Yearn community members lurk, he ran into strong opposition on what many framed as a one-sided offer.  Securing YFI tokens from Yearn can help Wintermute earn more yield in its token dealmaking. It’s trying to get those tokens by leveraging its own stash of CRV tokens at minimal cost to itself and, in the view of Yearn believers, with minimal upside for Yearn.  ""The whole idea of the deal is antithetical to yearn’s ethos: decentralization to its core,"" said the influential Yearn voter and community member who goes by the pseudonym 0x7d54. ""Then a potential agreement with an off chain player to loan out its governance token? That would throw some of that out the window.""  Trust me, bro  Wintermute first envisioned paying Yearn 0.10% interest on a 12-month loan from its treasury. Instead of pledging crypto collateral – table stakes for most DeFi loans – Gaevoy offered his monster firm’s credibility. Wintermute is among the most active names in DeFi lending, trading and governance; just this month, it helped bail out Curve Finance.  The YFI loan “would be rather stupid for us not to return,” he wrote in forum posts. But Yearn’s voters questioned the logic of trusting self-declared “reputable” companies after blowups of FTX, Alameda, Celsius and other failed whales. As a concession, Wintermute agreed to post CRV tokens as collateral in a wallet partially controlled by them and by Yearn.  Wintermute is newly flush with CRV tokens. Earlier this month, it acquired 25 million CRV at highly favorable rates during the industry-wide bailout of Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov. It was a move that helped Curve – and with it, possibly much of DeFi, including Yearn – avoid the domino effects of a potentially catastrophic lending blowout.  Yearn is among a handful of DeFi protocols that vie for deposits of CRV tokens by offering big interest rates to those who lock their assets up in its vault, yCRV. If Wintermute were truly interested in giving Yearn a good deal, it might offer to mint new yCRV tokens, one voter told CoinDesk. Doing so could pay long-term dividends for the DAO.  But Wintermute has only promised to help Yearn’s yCRV markets by providing liquidity to keep its “exit ramp” investors on solid footing. That’s important, one voter told CoinDesk, but nowhere near as advantageous to Yearn as creating a new yCRV.  Indeed, Gaevoy told Yearn voters in the project Discord that Wintermute has no interest in minting yCRV. It’s already locked 6 million CRV tokens with competitor Convex Finance. Gaevoy told them his firm is prepared to do more business with Convex if Yearn doesn’t come around.  Gaevoy and another Wintermute official did not respond to a request for comment.  Optics  At press time, the vote, dubbed YIP-74, was slouching toward failure, with 94% of votes against. It closes on Aug. 30.  Wintermute's shellacking appears to have emboldened DWF Labs, another market making firm. Late last week DWF pitched Yearn more favorable terms (1% interest payments every four weeks, as opposed to 0.1% at the end of 12 months – but no collateral) for the same 350 YFI. That proposal hasn't yet gone to vote.  For Yearn and Wintermute both sides are taking optics into consideration. At one point, Gaevoy told the Discord that he shows up in sometimes spicy governance chats – at one point, a user called Wintermute a handout-taking “vulture” – to get a “temp check at how we are perceived.”  The influential Yearn voter who goes by the pseudonym 0x7d54 was just as perceptive, pointing out in the Discord that there are benefits to be had from a big name like Wintermute participating in Yearn’s markets.  “This benefit would be completely obliterated, though, by negative sentiment if Yearn accepts an unbalanced agreement – which in my view is still the case with the modified proposal (even if it is one step better than the original).”  CORRECTION (Aug. 29, 10:40 UTC): Corrects spelling of Gaevoy throughout.

16694158,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/sec-charges-la-based-impact-theory-over-unregistered-securities,1693303200,SEC Charges LA-Based Impact Theory Over Unregistered Securities,"The US SEC charged Impact Theory with the “unregistered offering of crypto asset securities.” The LA-based entertainment company has paid a $6 million settlement following the charges. On Monday, the SEC announced charging the LA-based Impact Theory with an unregistered securities offering. The agency claims Impact’s 2021 NFT launch falls under an unregistered securities offering. SEC: Impact Theory’s NFT Launch Is an Investment Contract In a press release, the SEC claimed the company conducted “an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs).” According to the SEC, Impact Theory raised approximately $30 million from hundreds of investors through its 2021 offering. The securities agency claims that from October to December 2021, Impact offered and sold three tiers of NFTs, known as Founder’s Key, which the company called “Legendary,” “Heroic,” and “Relentless.” The press release explains Impact Theory “encouraged potential investors to view the purchase of a Founder’s Key as an investment into the business, stating that investors would profit from their purchases if Impact Theory were successful in its efforts.” The company allegedly stated that it was “trying to build the next Disney,” and if successful, would deliver “tremendous value” to Founder’s Key purchasers. The SEC’s order, therefore, found that Impact’s NFT sales to investors were investment contracts and, thus, securities. The securities agency established that Impact Theory violated federal securities laws by offering and selling these NFTs to the public without the necessary registration. Antonia Apps, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office, said: “Absent a valid exemption, offerings of securities, in whatever form, must be registered.” Adding, “Without registration, investors of all types are deprived of the protections afforded them by the robust disclosures and other safeguards long provided by our securities laws.” Impact Theory Settles with the SEC Impact Theory agreed to a cease-and-desist order in a settlement agreement, finding it violated the Securities Act of 1913. Without admitting or denying the agency’s findings, Impact Theory also agreed to pay $6.1 million in “disgorgement, prejudgement interest, and a civil penalty.” The company further agreed to destroy all Founder’s Keys in its possession or control, publish a notice of the SEC’s order on its website and all social media channels, and eliminate royalties that it might receive from future secondary market sales involving the NFTs. The SEC’s order also established a “Fair Fund” to return funds investors paid to buy the Founder’s Keys. The order against Impact Theory is the first NFT enforcement action the SEC has brought. In a statement, SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda disagreed with the SEC’s claims. They said: “We dissented in part because we disagreed with the application of the Howey analysis. Regardless of what one thinks of the Howey analysis, this matter raises larger questions with which the Commission should grapple before bringing additional NFT cases.” The Commissioners added: “We understand why the Commission was concerned about this NFT sale. Even though we believe strongly that adults should be able to spend their money as they choose, we share our colleagues’ worry about the type of hype that entices people to spend almost $30 million for NFTs seemingly without having a clear idea about how they will use, enjoy, or profit from them. This legitimate concern, however, is not a sufficient basis to pull the matter into our jurisdiction. The handful of company and purchaser statements cited by the order are not the kinds of promises that form an investment contract. We do not routinely bring enforcement actions against people that sell watches, paintings, or collectibles along with vague promises to build the brand and thus increase the resale value of those tangible items.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16693742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549245,1693302247,Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Bearish Pattern Puts Heavy Load On SHIB Advance,"The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a downward trend over the past several days. This corrective phase, marked by declining trading volumes, is shedding light on a potential weakening in bearish momentum. Interestingly, this price action aligns with the emergence of a triangle pattern, a technical phenomenon that often holds significant implications for market trends. In technical analysis, a triangle pattern refers to a chart pattern formed when the price moves within converging trendlines, creating a triangular shape. This pattern indicates a period of consolidation and indecision in the market, as buyers and sellers reach an equilibrium. Typically, this pattern is associated with a temporary pause in the prevailing trend, and it often precedes a significant breakout or breakdown. Shiba Inu Bearish Pennant Formation According to a recent price analysis, this triangular sideways movement for SHIB comes on the heels of a substantial price drop, raising suspicions of a bearish pennant pattern taking shape.

A bearish pennant is characterized by a brief consolidation period following a sharp decline in price. During this time, the bearish momentum takes a breather, potentially prolonging the correction trendline. SHIB price action in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko A closer examination of the daily chart reveals a notable rejection from the lower trendline of the pattern. This rejection hints at the possibility of a bullish upswing within the confines of the pattern, suggesting that the SHIB price might be gearing up for a potential reversal. As of the latest data, the current SHIB price stands at $0.00000814 according to CoinGecko, indicating a 2.1% rally over the past 24 hours. In the span of seven days, SHIB has managed to accrue gains of 3.4%. These numbers, against the backdrop of recent market turbulence, hint at a certain level of resilience within the SHIB token. Implications Of Significant Token Movements Ali Martinez, a respected crypto trading chart analyst, has drawn attention to a startling development that could impact SHIB’s trajectory. In a post on X, Martinez noted an extraordinary movement: approximately 2 trillion SHIB tokens were rapidly withdrawn from established crypto exchange wallets within the preceding week. This revelation has set off ripples of speculation and discourse within the digital asset community. #ShibaInu | A staggering 2 trillion $SHIB tokens have been pulled from known #crypto exchange wallets just this past week. pic.twitter.com/MiWMNUp7jY — Ali (@ali_charts) August 27, 2023 The swift movement of such a significant number of tokens raises questions about the potential implications for SHIB’s position within the broader crypto market.

(NASDAQ: RIOT) - 10,749,369 shares (6.14%), valued at $199.08 million Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) - 10,938,032 shares (6.44%), valued at $190 million Cipher Mining Inc (NASDAQ: CIFR) - 2,200,654 shares (0.88%), valued at $8.36 million Terawulf Inc (NASDAQ: WULF) - 4,831,312 shares (2.28%), valued at $14.10 million BlackRock Buying The Dip? The Bitcoin mining industry is currently going through a difficult moment, with the industry’s poor performance quite noticeable. As mining difficulty continues to increase, the reduction in expected profits has also called the profitability of the practice into question. The increased cost of mining activity has resulted in a majority of Bitcoin miners operating underwater for over a year. However, large companies such as BlackRock that have access to significant funds have the unique opportunity of aiding these smaller miners, as the increase in its position in these companies indicates. The total value of Blackrock’s investment in these four firms is around $411 million. This is equivalent to a meager 0.35% of the total assets held by the firm in 2022. The report also noted that BlackRock’s increased shareholding makes BlackRock Funds Advisors an important member of the Bitcoin Mining Council. The Bitcoin Mining Council is a collective lobbying group for Bitcoin mining in the United States. BlackRock’s ETF Application BlackRock had announced in June that it had filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund. In a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund’s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would hold custody of the fund’s fiat currency. The asset manager had already announced the launch of a Europe-focused exchange-traded fund in September 2022. BlackRock had to refile its Spot Bitcoin ETF after the Securities and Exchange Commission had stated that the filings were inadequate. In the updated filing, Nasdaq named Coinbase as the surveillance partner, addressing the SEC’s main objection with BlackRock’s filing.

42419701,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFTKf,1693297040,"Long Bitcoin With Tight Stop Loss in Place, Matrixport Says","Crypto traders can take long positions in bitcoin with a tight stop loss below $25,800, Matrixport's Markus Thielen said.  According to Thielen, Treasury yields are likely to drop, pushing risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, higher.  Crypto services provider Matrixport, which has more than $3 billion in assets under management, has turned cautiously bullish on bitcoin (BTC) after the largest cryptocurrency by market value's August slide, preferring to buy the recent price dip with a tight stop loss.  Bitcoin fell over 10% on Aug. 15, testing the former resistance-turned-support level at $25,000. Since then, prices have been trading around $26,000, with many traders anticipating continued losses in the coming weeks.  Matrixport's head of research and strategy, Markus Thielen, suggests otherwise.  ""With tight stop losses, we would be long bitcoin, expecting lower treasury yields and a rally in U.S. tech stocks,"" Thielen said in Tuesday's market update. ""We expected a 10% correction by the end of the summer, which we have gotten, and with the appropriate risk management approach, traders can try to be long again.""  According to Thielen, traders should closely monitor bitcoin's price for a potential drop below $25,800, as that would trigger the stop loss on the long position. As of writing, bitcoin was changing hands at $26,000, down about 11% this month.  A stop loss is a buy or sell order placed in advance to limit losses stemming from prices moving against the trade.  Treasury yields drop  The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note has dropped 18 basis points to 4.18% in the past seven days, offering a bear breather to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  That's because investors seek returns from high-risk alternatives like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies when yields drop. Conversely, when yields rise they feel encouraged to rotate money out of risky investments and into fixed-income securities. Yields surged early this month to the highest levels since 2009.  According to Thielen, yields could continue to weaken as the U.S. inflation rate cools.  ""The U.S. macro backdrop continues to be highly favorable to risk assets, as we pointed out in December 2022. Inflation will continue to fall and the Fed appears to be on hold for the time being, that’s what Fed Chair Powell implied last week, in our view,"" Thielen said.  ""The Fed’s fastest rate hike cycle in 50 years will likely set up a multiyear deflationary boom and we expect new all-time U.S. stock market highs by the end of this year,"" he added.  Market makers may power BTC higher  Market makers create order book liquidity and are always on the opposite side of investors. They make money from the bid-ask spread, maintaining a market-neutral portfolio by constantly buying and selling the underlying asset.  According to Thielen, market makers will likely buy bitcoin to maintain a direction-neutral book should bitcoin start rallying. That, in turn, could accelerate price gains.  ""Derivatives data shows a huge call ‘wall’ between 30k to 35k, and once a tiny rally gets going, the option gamma could cause a violent rally back to 30k as market makers will have to buy bitcoin to hedge themselves. Not a short squeeze, but it does not take much to get a rally going,"" Thielen said.

However, this uptick was juxtaposed against lingering weaknesses in the bullish sentiment, prompting questions about the potential for further downside. In the last five days, MATIC embarked on a trajectory marked by a relatively narrow price range, predominantly oscillating between $0.537 and $0.56. This phase of consolidation led to a visible reduction in market volatility, consequentially resulting in a discernible drop in the open interest metric throughout the week. This deceleration in market activity not only hinted at speculators’ ambivalence towards predicting the token’s next trajectory but also suggested that traders might need to exercise caution and patience as the market seeks clearer signals. Related Reading: OnlyFans Parent Company Buys $20 Million Worth of Ethereum – A Boost To ETH Price? Analyzing MATIC’s Current Climate Beneath the surface of these price fluctuations and speculative hesitations, a series of interesting developments unfolded. The sentiment prevailing in social discussions around MATIC’s price exhibited a noteworthy shift towards negativity. Insights gleaned from Santiment data revealed a gradual decline in MATIC’s Weighted Sentiment that commenced around August 25, ultimately settling at a current value of -0.37 as of today. Source: Santiment Additionally, subtle indicators hinted at underlying accumulation dynamics taking shape. The average coin age exhibited an upward trajectory, indicative of the gradual accumulation of MATIC tokens across the network. Coinciding with this trend, the volume of supply held on exchanges witnessed a decline over the past week, once again underscoring the narrative of token withdrawal and strategic accumulation. MATIC Current Valuation And Outlook Despite the drop in the token’s social sentiment rating, MATIC still registered a 1.5% surge over the past 24 hours, and trading at $0.559, according to crypto market tracker CoinGecko.

The firm had earlier claimed that Armstrong had inflicted considerable emotional, physical, and financial damage on people in the space and on Hit employees. While the allegations include serious and personal allegations against Armstrong, the influencer has not spoken out or confirmed them himself. However, the BenCoin account on X responded to the news in a post that it claimed was written by Armstrong. However, it is still being determined as of now if Armstrong, indeed, was the one who wrote the message. “This is Ben. TJ Shedd & Justin Williams have attempted a coup at my company. Just confirming what is going around. It’s true. There has been a mutiny at BitBoy Crypto & Hit Network. But it won’t work. They have no leverage. Until they can clone me, I have nothing to worry about.” Possible Reasons? The announcement by BitBoy Crypto did not elaborate or point to any specific incidents that could have contributed to the end of its business relationship with Armstrong. However, the YouTuber and crypto influencer was involved in a class-action lawsuit after investors claimed that he and other influencers promoted the now-bankrupt FTX exchange without revealing compensation from the exchange. Court filings also suggested that Armstrong issued several threats against lawyers who were representing the plaintiffs. He had also openly mocked a federal judge’s authority by failing to appear in court as ordered. The case was stayed on the 16th of June. Armstrong also insulted several high-profile figures using his platforms, with over 1 million subscribers on X and YouTube. These figures included Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, and Gary Gensler, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. He had also filed a defamation suit against YouTuber Erling Mengshoel Jr, also called “Atozy.” However, he later dropped the case after Atozy managed to raise around $200,000 for his defense. Social Media Users React Many users on YouTube and X reacted in support of Armstrong following the announcement on X. They also expressed some concerns about the future of the BitBoy Crypto brand, given Armstrong was its most popular and recognizable face. One user on X stated, “I remember when I first got into crypto... I was still trading on Coinbase, I listened to bitboy tell me what coins to buy, and my charts were so full of indicators I could hardly see the candlesticks. It’s crazy how fast things can change in three days.” Many users on the YouTube livestream were unhappy with Armstrong’s removal, with many demanding the host’s return. However, the mood on Reddit was in stark contrast with that on the YouTube live stream, with many users cheering the news. It is also unclear if any of Armstrong’s previous legal problems led to the company parting ways with him. Authorities have been targeting crypto influencers globally for promoting fraudulent projects following the collapse of FTX. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16689707,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549222,1693292728,Bitcoin Bull Market 2025: 3 Reasons Why It Won’t Be Like 2017 And 2021,"In a recent tweet, Luke Mikic, a renowned podcaster and YouTuber, highlighted the distinct differences between the upcoming 2025 Bitcoin bull market and its predecessors in 2017 and 2021. Drawing from his insights and the data available, here’s a deep dive into the three reasons that set the 2025 bull market apart: 1. The Hash Rate Race: Nation States Enter the Fray “The Bitcoin hash rate is going absolutely parabolic, smashing through 400TH/s & another ATH!” Mikic exclaimed. Indeed, the Bitcoin network hash rate recently achieved a record-breaking 414 EH/s, marking an 80% surge over the last 12 months. This growth is particularly astonishing given the energy challenges in Texas and the escalating global electricity costs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Uptrend Remains Unbroken, Here’s Why Mikic points out, “This is the 1st bear market where the hash rate is hitting new ATHs… Is this time different?” The answer seems to be a resounding yes. Nation states are now publicly (and maybe privately) mining Bitcoin. El Salvador and Bhutan were the pioneers, and recently, Oman joined the league. Oman’s strategic move to mine Bitcoin aims to diversify its economy from oil dependence and bolster renewable energy initiatives, including flare gas mitigation. Remarkably, it is yet unknown if not more countries are already mining BTC in stealth mode without official announcement. 2. Supply Suffocation Historically, bear markets have seen an influx of Bitcoin on exchanges. However, the current scenario paints a different picture. Mikic notes, “In every prior Bitcoin bear market we’ve seen an increase in the number of coins on exchanges. 2015 – Increase of 800K coins, 2018- Increase of 900K coins, 2022- DECREASE of 1 million since March 2020.” According to data from Santiment, a mere 5.8% of Bitcoin is now on exchanges, the lowest since December 17, 2017. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Exchange Depositing Transactions (SMA 7-day) plummeted to a 5-year low, reaching 30,798 BTC per day, a figure reminiscent of December 11, 2016. On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr.’s takeaway? “People do not want to sell BTC. The supply deficit will continue to stimulate growth.” 3. The Great Wall Street Accumulation The BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF application stands as a watershed moment in Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream adoption. Mikic emphasizes, “The Blackrock Bitcoin ETF application will be remembered as a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s future mainstream adoption. TRILLIONS of capital has now been given the green light to invest in Bitcoin.” Related Reading: A Crash Like Amazon’s? This Scenario Could Push Bitcoin Back To $10,000 As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock’s entry could bestow unparalleled legitimacy upon the Bitcoin market. BlackRock will probably advertise Bitcoin and its new product in a big way, bringing new retail and institutional investors into BTC. Looking at the current price stagnation in Bitcoin, it should be noted that there are no new inflows at the moment, as evidenced by the decreasing amount of stablecoins in the ecosystem. In the midst of the longest of all bear markets, there is simply no reason for retailers to get back in at the moment. However, an event like the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF can change this abruptly and be the trigger for a Bitcoin bull run (even before halving). In conclusion, the 2025 Bitcoin bull market is poised to be unlike any other. With nation states joining the mining race, a palpable supply shock, and Wall Street giants like BlackRock showing interest, Mikic’s final words resonate strongly: “Takeaway: NOBODY is bullish enough.” At press time, BTC traded at $26,058.

These 1.15 billion tokens will be worth approximately $57.5 million as of writing, as HBAR is currently trading at $0.05 according data from CoinMarketCap. Data also indicates that roughly 23.9% of the tokens will be allocated for ecosystem and open source development, 22.3% for purchase agreements, 14.8% on network governance and operations, and 7.7% for initial development costs and licensing. Despite initial challenges towards the end of the Q1 2023 due to an exploit in the Hedera mainnet, HBAR has seen a surge over the past two months. This is due to the recent integration of Hedera’s instant payment platform Dropp into the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FedNow platform as a service provider. FedNow introduced Dropp as an alternative to credit card payments, offering merchants the ability to accept small-value digital purchases without the burden of costly transaction fees. Dropp supports micropayments using HBAR, as well as the U.S. dollar and Circle's USDC, providing a pay-by-bank option for these transactions. Hedera has prided itself as the only public ledger to use the hashgraph consensus, making it a decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake, EVM-compatible public ledger, using a leaderless consensus algorithm. This confers the network with the highest level of security and performance theoretically possible. Recerntly, it has also integrated ChatGPT for a more streamlined asset management and monitoring. It has also seen its userbase jump almost 300% from 3,500 to 13,500 by Q2 2023, year to-date, signalling . While the current metrics for the HBAR token warrant a cautious optimism, the potentialities latent in its integration of AI and the blockchain remain areas for speculation and enthusiasm.

Some former users are getting hit by a new phishing attack on their FTX-registered emails a week after Kroll, the claims agent in the bankruptcy proceedings, was impacted by a SIM swapping attack. The attack leaked personal information of customers, such as account balances, phone numbers and home addresses.  Customer data of other bankrupt crypto firms Genesis and lender BlockFi were also leaked in that attack. Crypto account passwords and other sensitive data weren’t affected, but customers were warned to be on the lookout for scammers impersonating parties in the bankruptcy.  Whoever got their hands on this goldmine of information lost no time in crafting hopeful emails that purport to return the lost capital to holders – as long as they first connect a crypto wallet to the account.  “You have been identified as an eligible client to begin withdrawing digital assets from your FTX account,” an email sent to several FTX creditors, viewed by CoinDesk, read. “Withdrawals will be dispatched in USDC matched to the balance of digital assets held in your wallet at the time of platform pause.”  “You can now withdraw to an external ERC20 wallet by clicking the withdraw now button,” the phishing mail states.  Connecting a wallet to such a phishing mail is likely to drain one’s token holdings, as it may request private key data to conduct the transfer.  SIM swapping happens when scammers contact your mobile phone's carrier and trick them into activating a SIM card that the fraudsters have. The scammers then target phone numbers and use a victim’s information to steal passwords, financial data, cryptocurrencies and other valuable items.  Meanwhile, on Saturday, FTX said it had taken a “precautionary measure of temporarily freezing affected user accounts within the customer claims portal.” The claims portal is an official platform where creditors can submit details about their accounts.",NEGATIVE,USDC,EXCHANGE | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/29/ftx-customers-hit-by-withdrawal-phishing-mails-after-sim-swap-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69dc7118a63c87d7f9003722950dad34d0f92445-3890x2188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The plan could result in the recoveries of 70%-90% in USD equivalent for unsecured creditors and 65%-90% recovery on an in-kind basis depending on the denomination of the digital asset. All the estimated recoveries are subject to market pricing and definitive documentation.  The lending arm of Genesis halted withdrawals in November of last year in the wake of FTX's collapse, and filed for bankruptcy protection at the start of 2023. Last month, DCG said in a letter to shareholders it was close to reaching an in-principle agreement to resolve the claims.  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  ""The agreement in principle will be documented and submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for final approval in connection with confirmation of a chapter 11 plan. We look forward to executing on this important milestone and for Genesis to begin its distributions to creditors,"" DCG said in a statement.  To satisfy DCG's existing liabilities of approximately $630 million in unsecured loans due in May 2023 and $1.1 billion under an unsecured promissory note due in 2032, a new partial repayment agreement was agreed on. The repayment would be done in two tranches – approximately $328.8 million with a two-year maturity and $830 million with a 7-year maturity.  DCG would also pay $275 million in four installments after the date of the partial repayment agreement on account of the May 2023 maturities.  Genesis Global Holdco, LLC and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in January 2023.

The purchase, which amounts to 6,088 ETH bought at a price of $1,655 each, translates to an investment exceeding $10 million at the time of purchase. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain first highlighted this large transaction, drawing attention to the fund's continued interest in the crypto market. 1inch Investment Fund wallet spent $10M to buy 6,088 $ETH at $1,655 6 hrs ago.The wallet bought a total of 17K $ETH($26.8M) at an average price of $1,569 on Jan 13, Feb 9 and Mar 14.Then sold 11K $ETH($21M) at $1,906 on July 5, making ~$3.7M.https://t.co/QhEm3M9Mm7 pic.twitter.com/JUxzA8hFom — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 28, 2023 The investment comes on the heels of a profitable period for the 1inch-affiliated wallet. Earlier this year, the wallet had made sizable investments in ETH, buying around 17,000 ETH at an average price of $1,569 across three different instances—January 13, February 9, and March 14. The cumulative spend for these earlier investments was approximately $26.8 million. In July, the fund took advantage of favorable market conditions and sold off 11,000 ETH when the cryptocurrency's price peaked at $1,906. This sale resulted in a revenue of roughly $21 million, thereby fetching a profit of around $3.7 million from its Ether holdings alone. According to blockchain data, this calculated approach to buying low and selling high has paid off well for the fund. The acquisition and sale pattern indicates a strategic investment approach that appears to rely on dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and taking profits when market conditions are optimal. It also showcases the fund's risk diversification tactics, as the wallet reportedly holds a broad range of digital assets currently valued at around $80 million. Such portfolio diversification is often seen as a prudent strategy in the volatile cryptocurrency markets. The fund's recent actions raise pertinent questions about its future investment orientation and whether it will continue to realize profits through similarly strategic engagements in the cryptlo markets. This acquisition is not merely a one-off purchase but also offers broader insights into market behavior and sentiment. Given that Ethereum is one of the main blockchains and cryptocurrencies that often influences and reflects market dynamics, such large-scale buying activity suggests a level of confidence in the digital asset’s future performance.

42392652,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9hzP,1693288565,All of Sam Bankman-Fried's Proposed Expert Witnesses Should Be Barred From Testifying: DOJ,"All of FTX founder’s Sam Bankman-Fried’s proposed witnesses should be disqualified from testifying because their disclosure filings are insufficient, their experience may be misleading or their planned testimony may not be relevant, prosecutors said in a late Monday filing.  Bankman-Fried’s team, for their part, wants to exclude a financial analysis expert proposed by the Department of Justice because his proposed testimony may not be allowed under the rules. The filings, part of the so-called Daubert motions due Monday, laid out the two teams’ views on why their opposition should not be able to call certain witnesses to the stand when Bankman-Fried goes on trial for fraud and conspiracy charges in a little over a month.  The DOJ moved to discount all seven of the expert witnesses proposed by Bankman-Fried’s team, saying that some of the disclosures they filed did not detail their opinions, while others “are inappropriate subjects for expert testimony” or possibly confusing for a potential jury.  The witnesses are Lawrence Akka, a British barrister; Thomas Bishop and Joseph Pimbley, who are with different consulting firms; Brian Kim, a data analytics and forensics expert; Bradley Smith, a law professor at Capital University Law School and Andrew Di Wu, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan.  Akka's testimony should be barred as his proposed opinion would speak to the definition of a ""trust"" under law, the DOJ said, which is the judge's role. Furthermore, his definition seemed limited to a single example, it added.  Neither Kim nor Bishop's disclosures share details about what they would actually testify about beyond general topics, which isn't allowed, the filing went on to add.  Smith's testimony isn't needed because the DOJ is not bringing a campaign finance-specific charge, which the professor would have spoken about, the prosecutors' filing said. Smith should also be barred because, like Akka, his proposed testimony would try to explain the law to the jury.  Pimbley’s proposed testimony as an expert who can speak to FTX’s code is “unnecessary,” the DOJ said.  “At trial, the Government will call at least two witnesses – Gary Wang and Nishad Singh – who were involved in writing FTX’s code. They are lay witnesses who are competent to testify about the code, and relevant and admissible questions the defendant has about the code may be put to these witnesses during cross-examination,” the DOJ filing said. “There is no need for a separate ‘expert’ witness to testify on such matters, especially in light of the fact that such testimony would duplicate the testimony of fact witnesses.”  Another proposed witness, Peter Vinella, is being presented as a financial services industry expert but does not appear to have “sufficient experience or expertise” in the crypto industry, the filing said. Wu would similarly testify about blockchains and the cryptocurrency industry in general, but this “testimony is not relevant to the contested issues at trial,” the DOJ said.  Some of Wu’s planned testimony – for example, detailing common practices around lending in crypto – is “improper,” the filing added.  Some of the witnesses disclosed their fees for providing testimony, as compensation for time and services. Per hour, Akka is billing 800 British pounds ($1,010), Bishop $400, Kim $650, Pimbley $720, Smith $1,200 and Wu $650. Vinella's disclosure said his fees were not contingent on the outcome of the case, but did not specify what those fees were.  Peter Easton, an accountancy professor at the University of Notre Dame, is a proposed witness for the prosecution who should be barred from testifying because he did not provide a basis for his testimony and his planned opinions may not be permissible, the defense team said in its own filing.  ""Many of Professor Easton’s 'opinions' simply narrate the Government’s allegations with no apparent expert analysis to purportedly assist the jury,"" the filing said.  The filing pointed to proposed testimony addressing FTX's internal accounting and deposit system, how FTX funds were allegedly commingled with Alameda funds, and other details tied to the movement of FTX and its customers' money.  ""The Government should be required to prove its factual narrative by presenting admissible documentary evidence and testimony from percipient witnesses, not by substituting in an expert witness with no first-hand knowledge of the facts at issue and no proffered expert analyses to aid the jury’s understanding,"" the filing said.  Easton is tied to The Brattle Group, a consulting firm, which is charging $1,175 per hour for his testimony.  The two teams of lawyers will meet virtually on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. New York time to discuss the defense team’s motions to have Bankman-Fried allowed out of jail more frequently to prepare his defense, to bar the prosecution from using discovery material shared after July 1, and to discuss Bankman-Fried's planned “advice-of-counsel” defense.

Starting Wednesday, Binance Options will list the T+3 BNB/USDT options every day at 08:00 UTC. New listings won't happen on days longer duration contracts expire, the exchange said in the official blog.  T+3 refers to the obligation to settle securities trades by the third day following the trade date. In other words, users can trade the T+3 daily options two days before the expiry day. The options, therefore, will have an initial lifetime of three trading days at the time of introduction.  The new product will offer greater flexibility to traders and expand the exchange's existing product suite that includes longer duration BNB options and the T+2 daily BNB options.  The T+3 daily options will have similar specifications as other BNB options, with each call and put contract representing 1 BNB and expiring very day at 08:00 UTC. The contracts can be exercised only on expiry and will be settled in USDT.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option offers the right to sell.  The launch of T+3 daily options comes amid heightened volatility in BNB.

16687634,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/smart-contract-automation-platform-clockwork-announces-closure,1693287099,Smart Contract Automation Platform Clockwork Announces Closure,"Solana-based smart contract automation protocol, Clockwork, is set to shut down by the end of October due to what its founder, Nick Garfield, describes as a ""limited commercial upside."" The decision underscores a growing trend of closures within the Solana ecosystem. Clockwork's impending closure is not an isolated event within the Solana ecosystem. Earlier this year, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Friktion and Everlend Finance also closed their doors. Notably, Cardinal, another Solana-based nonfungible token (NFT) protocol, also announced its wind-down in late June, citing economic conditions despite having raised $4.4 million around a year earlier. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) dated Aug. 27, Garfield stated that active development on Clockwork will cease and that the protocol's nodes on both the devnet and mainnet will be deactivated as of Oct. 31. The move comes as the Clockwork team weighs the ""simple opportunity cost"" of continuing the protocol against the lure of other potentially more lucrative opportunities. Hi all, bittersweet news today. The team and I behind @clockwork_xyz have decided to step away from active development of the protocol. 1/ — Nick (@time_composer) August 27, 2023 Clockwork was designed to facilitate scheduled transactions on the Solana network and to automate the running of applications through smart contracts triggered by specific events. Despite its pending shutdown, Garfield confirmed that Clockwork’s code will remain open-source and freely available. He encouraged interested developers to ""fork and ship"" the protoccol should they wish to continue its development. Funding and investor concerns also weigh on the matter. According to Crunchbase, Clockwork secured $4 million in seed funding last August in a round co-led by Multicoin Capital and Asymmetric, with additional participation from Solana Ventures. Responding to queries about the return of the seed funding to investors, Garfield stated that a ""meaningful portion"" of the funds still exists, but no decision has been made yet on its future allocation.

16681828,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549202,1693274442,"A Crash Like Amazon’s? This Scenario Could Push Bitcoin Back To $10,000","Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, has experienced a significant decline since mid-August, resulting in a stagnant price within a newly formed range. This decline has occurred amidst what many believe is an extended bear market in cryptocurrency, causing concerns about the future of Bitcoin’s bull cycles. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Senior Macro Strategist, Mike McGlone, has drawn attention to the current similarities between BTC’s trajectory and the infamous crash of Amazon in the 2000s during the “Dot Com Bubble.” McGlone’s analysis emphasizes the importance of learning from history and highlights the potential risks if retail investors flood the market, causing Bitcoin to become overbought. Related Reading: Traders’ Patience Fades: Bitcoin Price Stuck At $26,000, But Can It Hold? Bitcoin Resemblance To Amazon’s Crash Bitcoin’s remarkable growth potential is exemplified by its journey from trading at $1 in 2011 to its current value, representing a surge of 26,000 times. In comparison, Amazon, a prominent tech giant, achieved a 130-fold increase over a similar period, but it took approximately 25 years. To further illustrate the parallels between Amazon and Bitcoin, during the dot-com boom in the 90s and early 2000s, Amazon capitalized on customer growth and adept capital fundraising to expand its product offerings. Starting as an online bookstore, it rapidly evolved into a vast online retailer, connecting customers with a diverse range of products. Amazon’s valuation soared during this period, reaching over 50 times its Initial Public Offering (IPO) value in December 1999. However, the exuberance in the market was short-lived. The “Dot-Com Bubble” bursting led to a sharp decline in the Nasdaq Composite, heavily influenced by technology companies, from its peak in March 2000. As the “Dot-Com” crash unfolded, numerous companies struggled to sustain their business models or secure sufficient funding, resulting in their closure. Even prominent start-ups like Pets.com and Kozmo, in which Amazon had invested, succumbed to the downturn. As a result, Amazon’s stock experienced a significant decline, losing more than 90 percent of its value over two years. The lessons learned from Amazon’s rise and subsequent crash serve as a cautionary tale for Bitcoin. McGlone warns that the entry of retail investors into the market increases the risk of overbuying and market saturation. When an asset becomes excessively hyped, prices can detach from their underlying value, setting the stage for a potential correction. Retail investors, driven by Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), may overlook fundamentals and blindly chase price momentum, further exacerbating the risk of a downturn. Furthermore, the expert noted that Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with equity prices raises concerns. The current high correlation between Bitcoin and equities indicates a growing interdependence between the cryptocurrency and traditional markets.

This amplified correlation could magnify the impact on Bitcoin’s price in a market downturn. Despite Bitcoin’s current value of $26,000, McGlone warns of the possibility of a drop to $10,000, which could have significant consequences. It could trigger a shift in market sentiment and result in significant losses for latecomers who entered the market during this year’s peak. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $26,000, reflecting a marginal decrease of 0.3% over the past 24 hours and the seven-day time frame.

16678592,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549193,1693267236,"Bitcoin Miner Revenue Rapidly Falling, What Happens Next?","Bitcoin miners are churning less in revenue, looking at trackers on August 28. According to Hashrate Index data, a platform that tracks the correlation between hash rate and revenue accrued by miners over time, income generated from Bitcoin mining operations is at near record lows. Bitcoin Miner Revenue Declining At $0.059 per Tera Hash (TH) daily, the trend doesn’t look exciting for Bitcoin miners as it is cents away from $0.056, a level recorded in late November 2022. At the depth of last year’s crypto winter when prices fell, cracking below $16,000, hash price, which measures the potential revenue expected from deploying 1 Tera Hash of hash rate to the Bitcoin network per day, crumbled to the lowest point in three years. While BTC supporters are optimistic, expecting prices to recover in the second half of 2023, miners must contend with lower revenue. How this impacts their operations is yet to be seen because miners depend on income generated from deploying hash rate to cater for operational expenses and sometimes pay shareholders. On May 8, the hash price rose to $0.095, the highest level in 2023, but has since contracted, dropping by over 40%. As the hash price falls, it could mean miners are having a hard time competing. The trend, as it is visible, comes when the hash rate has been rising to record levels as more miners power up their mining rigs. Related Reading: Binance Will Halt These 39 Liquidity Mining Pools This Week Throughout 2023, the total Bitcoin hash rate, a metric measuring the computing power channeled to the network, rose from 269 EH/s in early January 2023 to 465 EH/s in early July 2023. The hash rate has since dropped around 329 EH/s, a level that’s still higher than 2022 highs. More Rigs, Higher Hash Rate With a rising hash rate, the Bitcoin network automatically adjusted the mining difficulty to the highest level last week. Trackers show the network’s difficulty is now at 55.62 T, following a 6% increment. For the better part of the year, difficulty levels have been rising amid an increase in hash rate. As prices recovered in January and the hash rate rose, the network increased difficulty levels by 10%, the highest spike this year.
