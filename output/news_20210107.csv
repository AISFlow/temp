42405656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmtU,1610058420,"Ripple 'Tried' to Settle With SEC Ahead of XRP Suit, CEO Says","Ripple tried to settle charges of conducting unregistered securities transactions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before the federal regulator sued it in December, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said Wednesday.      In a Twitter thread, Garlinghouse addressed what he described as five “key questions” about the SEC’s suit against Ripple, though he warned that he was limited in what he could say as the case is ongoing.      “Can’t get into specifics, but know we tried – and will continue to try [with] the new administration – to resolve this,” Garlinghouse said about why Ripple didn’t settle with the SEC.      The SEC alleged that Ripple, Garlinghouse and former CEO and current Chairman Chris Larsen has sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP in unregistered securities sales since 2013, in an “ongoing” violation of the law. The federal regulator claims these raises were used to fund its operations.      The charges came fresh off the SEC’s victories against Telegram and Kik, two messaging platforms the regulator alleged violated securities laws due to their initial coin offerings, or token presales, ahead of launching the gram and kin tokens, respectively. (Telegram killed the gram project before it went live.)      Similarities can be drawn to Block.one, a company that did successfully settle charges with the SEC in 2019.      Block.one, the firm behind the EOS project, paid a fine in a settlement that gave the current form of the EOS token the regulatory green light to continue trading.      Garlinghouse, along with Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty, said the San Francisco-based firm’s response to the SEC lawsuit is on its way. Ripple has publicly decried the SEC charges and has an initial hearing scheduled for later next month.      Speaking to other parts of the SEC’s complaint, Garlinghouse said Ripple “provided some customers, especially first movers, [with] incentives to use [its On-Demand Liquidity product],” which he said was lawful.      He did not answer one of his own posted questions about whether Ripple paid exchanges to list XRP, only saying “Ripple has no control over where XRP is listed.”      Several exchanges delisted or halted trading of XRP after the lawsuit was revealed.      Kraken, one of the few major U.S. platforms that still lists XRP, said it ""is reviewing the matter.""

42405659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmxQ,1610056577,"Bitcoin Goes Institutional, Ethereum Spreads Its Wings: CoinDesk Q4 2020 Review","If the 2020 Q1 was the quarter of market turmoil, Q2 the bitcoin halving and Q3 the explosion of stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, Q4 was the quarter of institutional FOMO for bitcoin and of Ethereum launching the first phase of its ambitious migration to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.      The latest CoinDesk Quarterly Review looks at the data and timelines behind these two strong narratives, and what they mean for asset prices.    Bitcoin goes institutional    While the 2017 bitcoin rally was largely driven by retail frenzy, the 2020 rally was driven mainly by institutions. The accelerating rhythm of large institutional investors publicly talking about and investing in bitcoin as a portfolio asset has not only lent validation to bitcoin’s role in portfolios, it has also attracted the attention of other investors. This self-reinforcing loop is likely to continue into 2021, especially given the mounting uncertainty around currencies and inflation.      Bitcoin’s strong rally in the last few days of December crowned an already strong year and produced an annual performance of 300%, way ahead of most macro assets, although behind ETH’s spectacular 470%.      One metric that hints at growing institutional involvement is the number of addresses that hold large balances. The number of addresses with over 1000 BTC, known as ""whales,"" is over 30% higher than at the end of 2017, the height of the last crypto bull run, indicating the growing presence of deeper pockets in the market.      Another indicator that institutional involvement in the bitcoin markets is growing is the volumes on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), an institution-focused derivatives exchange that offers bitcoin futures and options. The CME’s bitcoin futures open interest in U.S. dollars grew almost 300% over the quarter to become the largest in the industry (as of Dec. 30), having started the quarter in fifth position.    Ethereum spreads its wings    The Ethereum ecosystem saw strong progress in market infrastructure growth in the fourth quarter, and the long-awaited launch on Dec. 1 of Ethereum 2.0 was a major step on the way to migrating the ecosystem to a proof-of-stake blockchain.      Now that launch is successfully out of the way and Ethereum 2.0 developers are focusing their efforts on the task of onboarding several tens of thousands more validators onto the network. The goal is to have a minimum number of 262,144 validators securing Eth 2.0 before advancing to the next phase of development, phase 1. As of Wednesday, Jan. 6, 20% of this number have been onboarded.      Historically, peaks in the number of active accounts on Ethereum have coincided with market tops, but the latest price surge that tipped ETH past $1,100 for the first time since January 2018 was not mirrored by a surge in the number of active accounts. The number of active accounts has been trending upwards but is still roughly 33% lower than its peak of 714,225 reached back in 2018, when ETH price was nearing $1,400. This indicates the latest ETH price bull run may be fueled more by market speculation and less by a growth in real user activity and adoption.      Not all Ethereum transactions involve transfers of ETH. They could involve transfers of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are crypto assets created for unique applications and use cases on top of Ethereum. What’s more, not all Ethereum transactions are initiated by users. Some are initiated automatically by a smart contract, which is the code dictating the functionality behind all decentralized applications (dapps). This year, the total amount of ETH transferred by smart contracts as opposed to users doubled from its previous all-time high reached in 2016. This is a bullish indicator of Ethereum’s growing use case as a dapp platform rather than as a network for transfers of value.

42405661,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmyP,1610054666,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Reaches $40.3K While DeFi Value Locked Inflates to Over $22B,"Large trading volumes in the bitcoin spot market are helping push prices upward to a fresh record high. Ethereum-based DeFi value locked is also setting records, with rising crypto values playing a part.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $39,143 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 8.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,382-$40,324 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin continues to make incredible gains Thursday, an upward trajectory that helped the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hit a record $40,324. Prices north of the new, big figure were short-lived, however. A sell-off quickly saw nearly $3,000 shaved off the price in a matter of 30 minutes, though it has since rebounded to $39,143 as of press time.      “Bitcoin’s move upwards is fueled by institutions and institutional analysis pointing to price targets called for by firms including $146,000 by JPMorgan and $400,000 by Guggenheim,” said Guy Hirsch, managing director for U.S. at multi-asset brokerage eToro.      “There is likely to be some profit-taking, causing intermediate dips in price, but all signs point to a continued move higher in the short to medium term,” he added.      Read More: Bitcoin Tops $40K for First Time, Doubling in Less Than a Month      “It’s been a wild first week of the year for bitcoin, already up and down 15%-20% moves a few times during this period,” said Cindy Leow, investment manager at multi-strategy trading firm 256 Capital.      “This move is a hybrid of 2013 and 2017 post-halving price action, where 2013 saw a practically vertical move built up over many months while the late 2016 rally saw many more regular corrections that panned out over months,” Leow added. “The overall market sentiment seems to be a mix between disbelief and euphoria, which leads us to think that the retail peak is not in yet and there may still be room to go for this trend to develop.”      “We remain cautiously bullish, noting that funding rates across most crypto-assets are now persistently high, as are futures premiums and call volume,” Leow concluded.      Read More: CME Now Biggest Bitcoin Futures Exchange as Institutional Interest Rises      Funding premiums on major derivatives venues remain high, signaling traders are willing to pay quite a bit for leveraged positions.      “From here I have an initial target of $50,000 in mind and would love to say that we hit it in three to six months, but I think the power behind the market just now means we have a chance of hitting it in a few weeks,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote Bank.      If spot bitcoin volumes can continue on a tear, Thomas’ prediction might not be out of the question. Daily volumes on the eight exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 have been over $5 billion for six days in a row including Thursday’s $6.6 billion tally as of press time.      “After $50,000, I think there will be some very realistic institutional sellers who have to take profits as they will likely have doubled their money at that point,” Thomas said. “It would be prudent to do so and a crash to sub-$20,000, which is not out of the question, could result in difficult discussions with their bosses.“      Nevertheless, 2021 is off to a good start for the cryptocurrency market. “It is early January and bitcoin has broken through $40,000,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant.    Value of crypto locked in DeFi is up while investors withdraw    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $1,245 and climbing 3.8% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The total value locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, crossed the $22 billion mark for the first time Thursday. Crypto investors “lock” assets in DeFi smart contracts to gain a “yield” or percentage return in exchange for providing the liquidity.      However, the amount of ether locked in DeFi is dipping, to below 6.8 million ETH as of press time.      In addition, the amount of bitcoinlocked has fallen precipitously, down to 30,456, representing a 53% drop from the all-time high of 64,993 BTC locked in October.      Where investors are moving all this crypto to from the DeFi sphere is anyone’s guess, but some degree of profit-taking is likely happening in what has been a red-hot market.      “The charts serve as a good leading indicator of price movement,” said Misha Alefirenko, founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula. “This means people are redeeming back their BTC and ETH and that looks very bearish.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Thursday, but mostly green.

42405645,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmhg,1610053157,"Bull Run Democracy, Revisited","The maddest and most poetic experiment of the 2017 bull run was seeding Venezuela with cryptocurrency, expecting it would topple the government.      At the time, the Venezuelan state was teetering, squeezed by embargoes, falling oil prices, hyperinflation and hunger. The hope was that a massive airdrop would cause an alternative economy based on bitcoin (or dash) to spring to life, similar to attempts during World War II to debase enemy money by flooding countries with counterfeit currency.    James McGirk is a writer and researcher for the Smart Contract Research Forum. For more of McGirk’s work, check out his Substack at OurCyperpunkNow.Substack.com.    Without the power to control its own currency, the Maduro regime would be edged out of power. If the scheme worked, the thinking went, other authoritarian regimes could be toppled until the entire world was living in an economically self-determined society: a libertarian rapture.      Alas, after three years, an abortive guerilla campaign led by a lone American Green Beret and a failed international effort to prop up an opposition leader, life on the ground in Venezuela hasn’t changed much.      This is not to say that bitcoin hasn’t made a difference in the lives of many Venezuelans. Rather, it has underscored what the limitations are of any currency.      In February 2019, economist Carlos Hernández wrote an op-ed for the New York Times describing “How bitcoin has saved my family’s life.” For Hernández, bitcoin was a vital hedge against runaway inflation. To use it, he looked for someone willing to trade Venezuelan bolivars for a sliver of bitcoin on peer-to-peer trading sites like Localbitcoins.com.      See also: Venezuela’s Bitcoin Story Puts It in a Category of One      Bitcoin was like a bar of gold buried in the yard. It was a store of value, but value alone wasn’t enough to prise off the government’s absolute control over banks, the food supply or telecommunications. If it wanted to, Hernández notes, the Venezuelan government could begin monitoring crypto transactions and crack down hard.      Hernández describes how bitcoin helped his brother to escape from Venezuela. His brother earned crypto doing freelance graphic design work online, and used a memorized key to keep his funds safe as he made his way through the most desperate parts of Venezuela and over the border into Colombia. What bitcoin couldn’t do was find him a job once he arrived. He eventually returned to his family.      The most ambitious and sensible of the Save Venezuela projects was Jonathan Wheeler and Morgan Crena’s Pale Blue Foundation, which planned to airdrop billions worth of bitcoin on Venezuela in 2018. But rather than trying to spring the cryptocurrency on the country (or literally airdrop paper wallets like one dubious effort) they worked with organizations like LocalBitcoins to target their goodwill.    Rather than uprooting and replacing existing aid agencies and charitable networks, they’re plugging in and facilitating their existing work.    The project faltered, and seems to have pivoted to creating software to make it easier for people like Carlos Hernández to use cryptocurrency or communicate without being detected. (Pale Blue didn’t return my messages before publication.)      There are still exciting utopian blockchain projects in the works. The TAJI Project hopes to forge a Pan-African renaissance by building a series of private cities interconnected by an open blockchain network to foster liberal economics. Citizens would have the ability to issue tokens to fund any of their creative or entrepreneurial desires.      But TAJI is relying on more than just blockchain magic to sparkle to life. There’s real real estate. They’ve partnered with a Zambian chief who has provided a 200,000 acre land concession, and their outside advisors include Vitalik Buterin. Other charitable blockchain organizations have also moved beyond the idea of airdropping and donations.      See also: Jonathan Beller: How We Short Capitalism – And Finance the Revolution      GrassRootsEconomics.org, for example, is working on ""community inclusion currencies."" These token systems could replace a local currency in an emergency by keeping local economies moving and creating a smartphone-based distribution hub for international organizations, allowing charities to keep track of funds.      It’s a much more sensible approach because, rather than uprooting and replacing existing aid agencies and charitable networks, they’re plugging in and facilitating their existing work.      Bitcoin is on the rise again, trampling all-time highs and altcoins seem to be coiling up for another leap, but this bull run seems more subdued.

42405657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmuT,1610051092,‘Bitcoin Rich List’ Rebounds to Hit All-Time High,"The number of addresses holding over 1,000 bitcoin (worth of approximately $37.5 million at the current price) is now at 2,334, a new all-time high, after the number dropped at the end of December by 3.7% to 2,221. This is an indication “whales” (large bitcoin holders) have been bullishly accumulating more bitcoin and driving the price higher.      The 2,334 addresses each holding more than 1,000 bitcoin represents a gain of more than 30% compared with the end of 2017, the height of the previous crypto bull market, according to on-chain data site Glassnode. The metric has been on the rise since mid-October 2020, but suffered a temporary 4% drop between Dec. 18 and Dec. 26.      “The dip and renewed increase at the end of December shows relatively little interest in profit taking on the part of these large holders, even though almost all holdings are currently in profit,” according to CoinDesk Research’s quarterly review report published on Jan. 7.      Data from BitInfoCharts also shows there are 6,633 addresses holding bitcoin worth more than $10,000,000 and, according to crypto exchange Kraken’s market recap and outlook report for December 2020, bitcoin addresses with more than 100 bitcoin accumulated an additional 47,500 bitcoin (currently worth $1.8 billion) throughout December because of the price rally.      The so-called “Bitcoin Rich List” reflects rising institutional involvement in the bitcoin market since the beginning of 2020. Another sign of that is the fast-growing volumes and open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), an institution-focused derivatives exchange.      At the press time, bitcoin’s price was trading at $38,290, down only moments after breaking the $40,000 landmark for the first time ever. Only the day before, it crossed the $36,000 mark for the first time. The total value of the whole crypto market also surpassed the $1 trillion landmark on Wednesday.

This self-reinforcing loop is likely to continue into 2021, especially given the mounting uncertainty around currencies and inflation.”      Bitcoin’s market capitalization currently stands at ninth on asset tracking website Assetdash’s asset list, only lower than that of electric vehicle maker Tesla.

42405648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmlc,1610050953,'Decentralized Court' Aragon Hit With Flurry of Resignations,"Twelve staffers involved in the Aragon Network announced their resignations Thursday because of its apparent lack of financial transparency.      In a letter posted on GitHub and shared in the group’s Discord channel, AA governance lead John Light said he was leaving. “I no longer recognize the place that I used to love to work,” he wrote. “I believe it no longer reflects my values, nor the values of the Aragon Manifesto.” Light was with the AA for three years, according to his blog.      Aragon Network is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) seeking to build digital courtrooms that “make it possible for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to do business without a legal nexus,” according to Messari. The project is backed by the Association and Aragon One, a business venture funded by the Association.      While Light declined to comment to CoinDesk, he implored in his letter for the AA to “to publish all meeting minutes and financials for public review” going forward.      Light’s resignation was then followed by 11 other public resignations of staffers of Aragon One, the for-profit firm leading the protocol's development. Almost every resignation post in the project's Discord channel was linked to Light’s letter. CoinDesk has reached out to several former Aragon developers for comment.    Aragon Association financials    The mass exodus of Aragon developers was preceded by some 52,000 in ether (ETH) from the project’s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) moving onto various exchanges on Dec. 15 and Dec. 22.      At least some of that ETH – worth $63.9 million at press time – was moved into various other cryptocurrencies and tokens, particularly the dollar-pegged tether (USDT) stablecoin. It's unclear if the mass transfer of funds was a catalyst for the resignations. Light declined to comment.      The AA retains ownership over the group’s ICO funds, according to the Aragon Manifesto, which was the fourth-largest ICO at the time of its completion.      Aragon Association co-founder Luis Cuende said the ETH was moved for “portfolio diversification” when asked by community members in Discord.      ""While I am saddened to see these resignations, some divergence in the approach to building Aragon, or any project for that matter, is inevitable,"" said Aragon Association Executive Director Joe Charlesworth. ""The Aragon Association was proud to have funded the valuable work of third-party groups such as Aragon One. Ultimately, however, Aragon is bigger than any one individual, and it is bigger than any one group.""      In a statement on Discord, Aragon One CEO Jorge Izquierdo said: ""For now I just want to say that I feel the deepest respect for all the Aragon One team members that have decided to leave upholding the Aragon Manifesto to the direst consquences. You guys are Aragon and your loss is irreplaceable.""      UPDATE (Jan. 7, 20:49 UTC): This article has been updated with quotes from Charlesworth and Izquierdo.

Making MKR MKR, an Ethereum-based governance token, surged to its highest price level in two years on Wednesday.

Analysts point to a resurgence of activity in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, as well as a supply surge of the MakerDAO-tied stablecoin dai, as the cause.    At stake    New top Amid political mayhem in Washington, D.C., where supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump stormed and briefly occupied the Capitol building during the congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday, crypto markets continued to rise.      The total market capitalization for crypto assets has passed $1 trillion in dollar-denominated value, according to CoinGecko’s index of 6,124 assets. This high water mark comes amid an ongoing market rally, which is showing little signs of abating.      This time last year, the total value of all crypto assets stood at $200 billion, according to Coin Metrics data. And in 2017, during the last prolonged crypto bull run, the market’s total capitalization hovered around $760 billion before collapsing.      “[A]ll I can think about is how sustainable it all feels,” Messari founder Ryan Selkis wrote in a newsletter yesterday, preceding the milestone metric. Selkis cited the increasing use and exposure of stablecoins, the imminent improvements to Ethereum’s blockchain and the strengthening foundation for a crypto-based Web 3.0 as particular reasons for the sustainability of this rally.      Oh, and “BTC is at the beginning of its institutional supercycle,” he wrote. Indeed, bitcoin is soaring, having set a new high above $39,000 today after several days of remaining in the green. Bitcoin’s $726.5 billion market cap accounts for just under three-quarters of the entire crypto market cap.      In fact, “bitcoin is more valuable than all but seven publicly traded companies, sitting between Tesla at $758.8 billion and Tencent at $723.0 billion,” CoinDesk news editor Kevin Reynolds wrote. The crypto’s next closest rival, Ethereum, is valued at $140 billion, according to the CoinDesk 20.      In 2020, bitcoin became an attractive investment for hedge funds, corporations and high-net worth investors seeking to hedge their bets against forecasted inflation. A spout of coronavirus relief and a loosening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has many analysts concerned about a coming devaluation of the U.S. dollar.      To be sure, inflation has failed to meet the Fed’s target of 2%. Though bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, still represent an intriguing investment in a world beset by uncertainty. Cryptographic assurances and public ledgers have value for certain types of monies or assets.      “The $1 trillion mark cements cryptocurrency as a investable asset class that no longer sits on the fringes of Traditional Finance as a toy for retail investors,” Jack Purdy, a Messari analyst told CoinDesk's Zack Voell. “It demonstrates that this asset class is large enough to absorb large orders like we’ve seen recently with the slew of institutions entering over the last few months.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/07/blockchain-bites-sustainability-and-uncertainty-as-crypto-crosses-1t-benchmark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be15dfee42fa6033db2451f41c1b7a574a965df1-2048x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405652,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmoZ,1610035440,Institutional Custody Will Challenge Retail-Oriented Crypto,"The institutions are coming. The herd is arriving. Institutional participation in the digital asset market is imminent.      As this happens, it’s worth considering how the entry of highly regulated financial companies will change the marketplace infrastructure for crypto, which, until now, has been largely oriented to retail investors. Institutions will have different and higher requirements across the transaction chain, notably in the custody of digital assets.    Phil Mochan is the co-founder and head of Strategy & Corporate Development at Koine, an international digital assets custody and settlement platform.    Digital assets are bearer assets, raising implications for trading and safeguarding, and surfacing considerations for institutional asset managers looking to allocate capital to a digital asset fund.    Bearer assets    With a bearer asset, ownership is determined by possession alone. If I hold a $10 note, it’s mine. If I hold a $300 million bearer bond, it’s mine. In the same way, if I hold a private key to a bitcoin wallet that holds 10 BTC, then it’s mine (probably).      We say ""probably"" because most bearer instruments are difficult to copy. Various counterfeiting measures have been built into them such as serial numbers, holographic images, stamps, ultraviolet threads etc. A private key for a bitcoin wallet, on the other hand, is simply a string of 32 alpha-numeric characters that can be copied with a pencil, an iPhone camera or a good memory. A $10 note would have to be stolen to be usable, whereas a bitcoin private key can simply be copied.      Private keys are therefore the most vulnerable form of bearer asset, and once they have been exposed to a human, it is impossible to prove unique ownership. They may have been copied and there will be no record of the copy having been made.    One very large crypto fund revealed to me that it holds the private key across three bits of paper, held by three individuals.    The safeguarding of these private keys thus becomes a critical issue for digital assets. The original design for a blockchain record of assets is based around a wallet model. The use of the word wallet indicates the security issue. In practical terms, why would you want to store more value in a digital wallet when you would feel comfortable in a physical wallet? Owners may feel that they have cryptographic security, but do they have physical security?      There are numerous examples of people who have been robbed of their digital assets under physical threat. It may be a shock to learn that one very large crypto fund revealed to me that it holds the private key across three bits of paper, held by three individuals. I advised them that for their personal safety never to reveal their methodology again to another person. To illustrate how unsafe, it is perhaps sufficient to say that crypto exchanges in aggregate lose the entire contents of their hot wallets roughly every six months.      Various technical solutions have emerged with the objective of making the wallet more secure, including MPC technology. But while reducing the risks (supposedly), these fundamentally don’t address the nature of the risk. Robbing $1 billion from a bank remains a high-cost, high-risk exercise. Robbing a bitcoin owner with $1 billion held in a personal wallet is significantly easier and with much lower risk.    Industry implications    The first implication for safeguarding is that the wallet model is inadequate for high value (>$1,000). Its design and architecture leave it too vulnerable, and no technological improvements, however innovative, will ever resolve this challenge. “Better” is never going to be “sufficient.”      One alternative model is the account structure where a trusted third party takes control of the assets and separates the authorization processes from the private key management. This is how a bank works and it requires trust, regulation and governance, most of which are anathema to the progenitors of the cryptocurrency world.      See also: Crypto Custody - Unique Challenges and Opportunities      The second problem arising from the bearer nature of digital assets is proving unique ownership. The only solution is to ensure (and prove) that no humans ever come into contact with a private key. Given that cold stores (the most common form of long-term storage for digital assets) require humans to move assets across the air gap (with the commensurate risk of collusion and poor scalability) it would seem such solutions are unacceptable.      A third issue relates to regulatory rules around bearer instruments (which vary by country). In the U.S., any fund of more than $150 million in size is obliged to ""dematerialize"" bearer assets and record them on a register of ownership maintained by a custodian. This is why nearly all traded bearer assets are dematerialized onto electronic registers normally held by regulated depositories whose records are legally deemed the ""truth.""      Given these rules and existing models, it is therefore likely that all digital assets would be similarly dematerialized, in this case onto a digital ledger (not for operational reasons likely to be a blockchain) with ownership rights attached, in order to fulfill existing regulations.    Just the beginning    The institutionalization of the digital asset trading environment is just beginning. The next couple of years will determine whether we have an efficient unitary solution such as for the bond markets, or a more fragmented approach such as exists with the FX markets.    There will be a shift from crypto evangelism to capital market pragmatism.    DBS, Standard Chartered and Northern Trust have already launched in-house custody solutions, with the larger banks still considering their options. Should a group of four or five coalesce around a core infrastructure in 2021, the market is likely to develop more rapidly, and the high-frequency trading funds will drive volumes by many multiples.      For the existing mainly retail exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase, catering to institutions will require a considerable transformation. The changes might rapidly overwhelm some of them because their technologies are mostly unsuited to the behaviors of high-frequency traders.      As the ratio of spot to derivatives is low, the cash-settled derivatives exchanges appear to have the most to gain if they can become institutionally compliant, accessible and cost-effective.      There will be a shift from crypto evangelism to capital market pragmatism, and the anticipated mass adoption of blockchains will become more grounded in operational reality. Capital markets infrastructure will lead that realignment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Phil Mochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/01/07/institutional-custody-will-challenge-retail-oriented-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a71c81fdc9c598ab29736210b12e03c41e1e5646-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmwR,1610029723,First Mover: $1 Trillion of Cryptocurrencies Shows Booming 'Asset Class',"Bitcoin (BTC) rose for a third straight day, pushing early Thursday to a new all-time high price above $38,000 and setting bullish traders' sights on $40,000.      ""Momentum has been building over time, and it's anyone's guess where or when we might eventually top out,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told clients in a newsletter.      The gains came after a day of turmoil in Washington, D.C., during which supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building and disrupted a congressional vote to formalize challenger Joe Biden's victory in last November's presidential election. The shocking images prompted world leaders from the U.K., European Union and Canada to condemn what they characterized as an unacceptable attack on democracy. U.S. lawmakers later reconvened and certified the election result early Thursday.      The upshot, according to Bloomberg News, is that global investors are now focusing on the likelihood that a Biden White House, backed by a legislature controlled by his Democratic Party in both chambers, could more easily pass new U.S. stimulus measures. Bitcoin prices quadrupled in 2020 as a growing number of big Wall Street investors said the cryptocurrency could serve as a hedge against the potential negative impact on the dollar's value from trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus.      In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose on Thursday and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. Gold weakened 0.1% to $1,916 an ounce.    Market moves    Earlier this week, First Mover flagged the possibility that the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined could surpass $1 trillion within a few months.      Turns out it only took a few days. The total market value of bitcoin and all the other digital tokens and stablecoins pushed into the trillion-dollar zone late Wednesday for the first time. As reported by CoinDesk's Zack Voell, the industry had topped out at $760 billion during the last big bull run in late 2017.      The milestone could prove another catalyst for big Wall Street funds to look more seriously at cryptocurrencies for a potential portfolio allocation. It's getting harder and harder to argue, as the big bank and brokerage firm Goldman Sachs did last May, that cryptocurrencies are ""not an asset class."" The sums are getting too big to ignore.      “Is it frothy? A little bit in the short term,” Qiao Wang, co-founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) accelerator firm DeFi Alliance, told Voell. But is it ridiculous? “Nope.”      One of the biggest stories in finance during the last decade was the rapid (and concerning) growth in so-called leveraged loans, which are big loans that are arranged by Wall Street firms on behalf of junk-grade or even unrated companies and then typically apportioned to other banks, sold off to investors or even transformed into new triple-A rated bonds via the alchemy of structured finance.      Headlines abounded when the outstanding amount of U.S. leveraged loans grew to about $500 billion in late 2010 and then doubled to $1 trillion by early 2018.      Cryptocurrencies have now traversed that chasm in just a few months.      “The $1 trillion mark cements cryptocurrency as an investable asset class that no longer sits on the fringes of traditional finance as a toy for retail investors,” Jack Purdy, of the crypto-market analysis firm Messari, told Voell. “It demonstrates that this asset class is large enough to absorb large orders like we’ve seen recently with the slew of institutions entering over the last few months.”      Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and the largest by far, represents about 70% of the industry's total market capitalization. So the push toward the $1 trillion milestone came largely on the heels of bitcoin's rally over the past year.      Bitcoin now has a market capitalization of about $700 billion, up from about $130 billion at the start of 2020. According to the website fiatmarketcap.com, bitcoin's outstanding value would rank it as the 16th biggest global currency, just ahead of the Mexican peso and one rung below the Russian ruble.      And if bitcoin were a publicly traded company, it would rank as the world's eighth-largest, according to another website, AssetDash, well behind Apple's $2.1 trillion valuation, Amazon's $1.6 trillion and Facebook's $751 billion valuation, but far in excess of the big U.S. financial institutions like Visa ($468 billion), JPMorgan Chase ($401 billion) and Citigroup ($135 billion).      If the recent trend is any indication, bitcoin could keep climbing these ranks.    Bitcoin watch    Options traders are signaling a looming change in digital-asset markets – from a focus on bitcoin to relatively undervalued ether (ETH) and alternative cryptocurrencies.      The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether and bitcoin – a measure of the expected relative price volatility between the two – has risen to a record high of 46%. That surpasses the previous peak of 45% seen on Feb. 21, 2020, according to data provider Skew. The three- and six-month spreads have risen to an 11-month high of 32% and 23%, respectively.      The widening of the IV spreads indicates that the market expects ether and other alternative coins to chart bigger percentage moves than bitcoin in the near term.      “Traders are expecting increased volatility for ether relative to bitcoin,” Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. “This is consistent with decreasing correlation and a pick-up in interest across alternative cryptocurrencies.”      Some may argue that implied volatility reflects investor expectations of price turbulence and may not turn out to be reflected in the charts going forward. However, historical data show that implied volatility spreads are reliable indicators of upcoming shifts in the market. For example, the ether-bitcoin IV spread nosedived in the second half of September 2020, portending a big shift toward bitcoin. And the largest cryptocurrency delivered, outperforming most other cryptocurrencies by a significant margin in the final quarter of last year, with a 168% rally.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Expected Rise in Ether-Bitcoin Volatility Points to Altcoin Season Ahead    What's hot    CME becomes biggest bitcoin futures exchange as institutional interest rises (CoinDesk)      Maker governance token MKR surges 44% in 24 hours to highest in two years, as issuance of stablecoin dai (DAI) surges along with DeFi's rapid growth (CoinDesk)      Crypto brokerage Voyager to suspend trading in XRP tokens after SEC suit against Ripple Labs (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin investment makes sense in current economic climate, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh tells CNBC (CoinDesk)      Kraken users are staking more than $1B in crypto, including ether (ETH), tezos (XTZ) and polkadot (DOT) (CoinDesk)      Eric Vorhees's ShapeShift plans phase-out of centralized trading activity, will route orders through DeFi applications, which ""frees users from having to provide personal, private information"" (CoinDesk)      Iranian authorities close 1,620 illegal cryptocurrency mining farms, Financial Tribune says (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. economy seen getting boost with Democrats' Georgia sweep, possibly another $1T stimulus (Bloomberg)      Danish 20-year home mortgages now carry a fixed interest rate of 0% (Bloomberg)      Italian government could take on $17B of lender UniCredit bad loans to facilitate takoever of state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi (Reuters)      U.S. private payrolls post first decline in eight months as coronavirus cases skyrocket (Reuters)    Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Zack Voell, Omkar Godbole, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/07/first-mover-1-trillion-of-cryptocurrencies-shows-booming-asset-class,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/13791e8e246efae74880545871ecc30773edbf86-1250x938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency was trading near $0.35 soon before press time, representing a nearly 50% gain on a 24-hour basis.      As a result, XRP's market capitalization has increased to $13.88 billion, moving it above litecoin as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether, and litecoin are also trading higher. Bitcoin rose to fresh record highs above $38,000 early today.      However, despite XRP's bounce, prices are still down 57% from highs above $0.55 observed before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the San Francisco-based developer of the Ripple payment protocol and exchange network, for raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.      Announced on Dec. 22, the lawsuit brought an avalanche of exchange delistings and panic selling, causing prices to drop to $0.20 by the end of December.      It remains to be seen if the latest recovery has legs or turns out to be a ""dead-cat bounce"" – a temporary recovery of asset prices from a notable decline or a bear market followed by a continuation of the downtrend.      According to analysts, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) recent decision to allow U.S. banks to use public blockchains and dollar-backed stablecoins as a settlement infrastructure in the financial system is favorable for XRP and payments-focused Stellar blockchain's XLM token.

42405655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedmsV,1610028008,Oasis Protocol Adds Shyft Network in Bid to Attract Institutions to DeFi,"The Oasis Protocol, a public blockchain with an eye on creating a more private and scalable version of decentralized finance (DeFi), has partnered with the compliance-focused Shyft Network.      Announced Thursday, the partnership will deliver anti-money laundering (AML) strictures by leveraging elements of Shyft’s identity system and whitelisting of items/IP addresses, while also protecting users’ commercial and transactional data. There’s also a line to be walked on making DeFi compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the companies said.      Oasis Labs, creator of Oasis Protocol, raised some $45 million in a private token pre-sale in 2018, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Binance, Pantera and others.      The Oasis mainnet, which went live in November, is a layer one blockchain that sets out to do the same sort of things as Ethereum, albeit in a way that is potentially more scalable. It also allows developers to run smart contracts that keep data private while allowing for machine-learning computation to run on that private data, according to Oasis Product Lead Luca Cosentino.      Privacy for Oasis means being able to decide what part of your application stays private and what part of your application stays public, he added.      For now, Oasis is about building bridges to the second-largest blockchain, as well as Ethereum-based DeFi apps including Uniswap, Chainlink, Balancer and Meter. Looking ahead, Cosentino sees the potential to unlock a much less limited DeFi universe, which is currently hobbled by high fees, behaviors of self-motivated traders and lack of a reputation system, he said.      “Ethereum is presenting a few problems to the DeFi space in general and on the transparency side of things,” Cosentino said in an interview. “Despite being transparent, it doesn’t offer any information to the other side of the transaction. If I’m an institution and want to participate in DeFi I really can’t because I don’t know who I’m working with on the other side.”    Institutions welcome    The problem, said Suzanne Ennis, senior VP of global partnerships at Shyft Network, is that large liquidity providers are blocked from interacting with the DeFi space because of regulatory constraints and lack of clarity on AML-compliant procedures.      “Regulators, having seen no directionality from the DeFi ecosystem, are forced to comprehend the space with the lens of (potentially obsolete/irrelevant) loosely-matching, past environments that regulations were applied to,” Ennis said via email.      Shyft is known for its work helping crypto exchanges identify one another and exchange data in a way that complies with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “Travel Rule” for virtual assets.    See also: Shyft Debuts ‘Decentralized Version of SWIFT’ for FATF ‘Travel Rule’    In this case, Shyft is shining a light on DeFi counterparties via an identity and reputation system. To some degree it can be likened to credit scoring, said Consentino, but handled in a more decentralized and user-controlled way.      “The partnership with Shyft is important because it creates a digital identity, proving that who you are, who you say you are and that your reputation is attached to your identity in a very complete way,” Cosentino said.      Shyft’s solution does not entail any fundamental changes to the DeFi sector, but rather will augment the industry making it more secure for big players, said Shyft’s Ennis.      As such, DeFi participants will be required to provide proof of their identity that will be used to whitelist their addresses, she added. Whitelisted addresses will be able to interact with both the DeFi providers and mainstream institutions freely as they bear a higher level of trust.      “The tool will enable both decentralized and centralized entities to continue … providing liquidity without fear of falling victim to bad actors,” Ennis said.",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | BNB | ROSE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/07/oasis-protocol-adds-shyft-network-in-bid-to-attract-institutions-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54105c7cfd43f1de58eb77dfe929aef34020a3b1-1500x779.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of bitcoin set a new-all time high of $40,123.30, up 13.45% over the last 24 hours. Yesterday, bitcoin passed $36,000 and $37,000 for the first time before rocketing today past $38,000, $39,000 and now $40,000.  It continues a wild start to 2021 and follows a landmark year in which the cryptocurrency rose more than 300%, with an almost 50% gain in December alone. On Nov. 30, bitcoin breached a nearly three-year-old high of $19,793. By the close of Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency had risen about $10,000.  Seven days into 2021, bitcoin is on pace to put December's performance to shame. It's now up 36%, or about $11,000.  Bitcoin's price is now more than twice that previously mentioned all-time high of $19,783 reached during 2017's bull market run.  The prevailing narrative of this record-setting run is a growing view that bitcoin represents a form of ""digital gold,"" a view that has brought a flood of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($182 million in December); insurance giant MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim Investments (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  The latest records, however, may have more to do with the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday by President Donald Trump's supporters believing the election was rigged and upset by the certification process that was underway than with any inflation hedge.  Global macro uncertainty has the potential to devalue fiat currencies, which in turn could potentially increase the attractiveness of bitcoin. A disputed election followed by protestors breaking into the Capitol with at least one person being shot and killed would seem to fall under the category of ""uncertainty.""  In addition, with the Democrats now in control of both the House and the Senate in the U.S. the chance of increased government spending is viewed as going up. Increased spending is considered a possible source of inflation, against which bitcoin is viewed as a hedge.  With a market value now of $746 billion, bitcoin is more valuable than all but seven publicly traded companies, sitting between Tesla at $758.8 billion and Tencent at $723.0 billion.  The market's supply of dollar-pegged stablecoins is keeping pace with bitcoin's meteoric rise. Since New Year's Eve, the supply of tether has growth by over 10%, reaching 22.7 billion USDT at last check. Total supply of the runner-up stablecoin, Circle's USDC, has also grown by double-digit percentages so far in January, currently sitting at 4.4 billion USDC, according to Glassnode.

With an open interest of $2.1 billion, the CME accounted for 19.09% of the global tally of $11 billion on Wednesday – the highest among major exchanges tracked by Skew, a crypto derivatives research firm.  OKEx was the second-biggest exchange with an open interest of $1.97 billion, while Binance, the word's biggest crypto spot exchange by trading volume, ranked third with $1.82 billion.  Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  Looking back a year, the size of the futures market was quite small. Global open interest stood at $3 billion on Jan. 7, 2020, of which the CME contributed just 7% or $224 million.  The CME has steadily climbed ranks over the past 12 months and more so over the past three months alongside bitcoin's meteoric price rally from $10,000 to record highs above $37,000.  The exchange is considered synonymous with institutional trading, as it prefers to trade futures of any product via an established and regulated exchange like the CME.

42405639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedkcn,1610016439,Expected Rise in Ether-Bitcoin Volatility Points to Altcoin Season Ahead: Analyst,"The options market is signaling an impending change in the market focus – from bitcoin to relatively undervalued ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies.      The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether and bitcoin – a measure of the expected relative price volatility between the two – has risen to a record high of 46%. That surpasses the previous peak of 45% seen on Feb. 21, 2020, according to data provider Skew. The three- and six-month spreads have risen to an 11-month high of 32% and 23%, respectively.      The widening of the IV spreads indicates the market expects ether and other alternative coins to chart bigger percentage moves than bitcoin in the near term.      ""Traders are expecting increased volatility for ether relative to bitcoin,"" Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. ""This is consistent with decreasing correlation and a pick-up in interest across alternative cryptocurrencies.""      Implied volatility is the market's expectation of how risky or volatile an asset would be over a specific period and is driven by net buying pressure for options and historical price volatility. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, and many other so called altcoins are based on Ethereum's blockchain technology. As such, alternative cryptocurrencies tend to trade in line with ether.      The one-month spread has seen a five-fold increase since Dec. 30, alongside a weakening positive correlation between ether and bitcoin.      The three-month realized correlation has declined from 67% to 56% in the past five days to hit the lowest level since March 2018, according to data source Skew. The trend looks set to continue, as suggested by the widening of the IV spreads.      While rising volatility spread implies scope for relatively bigger percentage moves in altcoins, it does not tell us anything about the direction of the moves.      That said, alternative cryptocurrencies are now looking cheap compared to bitcoin and the market is extremely bullish. So alts could soon be charting bigger percentage gains than the crypto market leader bitcoin, as predicted by analysts earlier this week.      Despite having rallied from $700 to $1,200 this month, ether is still nearly 20% short of its record high of $1,432.88 reached in January 2018. Similarly, litecoin, stellar, chainlink and other prominent coins have yet to set new lifetime highs. At its current price of over $37,000, bitcoin is up over 60% from the previous lifetime high of $19,783 registered three years ago.      Some may argue that implied volatility reflects investors' expectations of price turbulence and may not turn out to be reflected in the charts going forward. However, historical data shows implied volatility spreads are reliable indicators of upcoming shifts in the market. For example, the ether-bitcoin IV spread nosedived in the second half of September 2020, warning of a big move in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency outperformed most other cryptos by a significant margin in the final quarter of last year with a 168% rally.
