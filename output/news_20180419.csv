Formerly known as Ethereum Capital, the investment fund's shares went live on the NEO Exchange in Toronto Thursday. The company plans to invest the funds it raises both into startups developing projects in the space as well make direct purchases of ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – as previously reported.  Co-CIO Ben Roberts told CoinDesk that the company raised $45 million Canadian (out of a planned $50 million), which will be mostly be converted into ether over the next four weeks. Ultimately, some 90 percent of the raised funds will be converted into the cryptocurrency, though Roberts declined to say how much the company had already converted  ""I think it's going to take the market some time to really understand the value proposition here,"" he said, explaining:  ""The utility of that is two-fold, yes it gives people exposure in the marketplace and more importantly creating that pool of assets gives us space in the community and the ethereum platform. As we kind of scale that out we can have an opportunity to become something like ConsenSys, which is a large organized stakeholder in ethereum which can then use its platform to create value.""  Setting up the investment fund took more than a year from concept to launch, but the process itself was straightforward, he said, explaining that ""the first step was talking to the Ontario Securities Commission and getting their blessing, then talking to banks and getting them comfortable and setting up a custody solution to house the asset safely.""  Over the next year or two, the company plans to look at different projects it can support while ""simultaneously creating enterprise value,"" he said.  ""Ethereum is a project that began in Canada, [but] it’s really being developed in most major cities in the world and this is a way to bring it back to Toronto and really bridge the gap between the technical community and the finance community,"" Roberts added.

""I just want to plug the benefits of trust minimization and decentralization,"" he said while participating in a panel on smart contracts. ""The traditional banking model is 'we trust us, why don't you trust us?'"" he continued, arguing that customers might not trust banks.  ""They might even hate you,"" he added.  Szabo's remarks would have been pointed in any setting, but he was speaking to an audience made up mostly of financial services professionals. He took the stage shortly after Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters and R3 CEO David Rutter, who promoted their respective permissioned platforms as well-suited to the financial services sector.  Szabo's fellow panelists were not as critical of enterprise blockchains. Shaul Kfir, Digital Asset's chief technology officer, said that he used to think ""bitcoin is great, ethereum is great, those people in financial services probably don't know what they're doing.""  He continued:  ""I'm much more humble today. They know what they're doing.""  Helen Altshuler, Google Cloud's engineering program lead, argued in favor of ""hybrid systems"" that combine attributes of open and closed platforms.  Not another DAO  In addition to the open-closed debate, much of the conversation focused on the reliability of smart contracts. The DAO hack in 2016, which Chain CEO Adam Ludwin mentioned (and Masters and Rutter brought up during the earlier panel), has created the perception that smart contracts are not yet suited to large, high-volume markets.  Yet Kfir argued that the U.S. Treasury repo market – where ""$100 million is a small trade"" – is a use case that ""lends itself very nicely"" to smart contracts.  In order to tackle such use cases, the panelists agreed that smart contract developers would coalesce around a few tried and tested templates. Ludwin described this eventual standardization, saying, ""yup, that's been used a million times in repo, we know it works."" He continued:  ""Obviously we're in that Cambrian explosion now, but over time I think it will be standardized.""  Szabo argued that a change in perspective would be needed to achieve this reliability. ""Web programming is an extremely bad model to bring to this,"" he said. ""When you program a pacemaker and you install it in your heart, you want it to be bug-free.""  ""I don't think any missile defense system was ever built in JavaScript,"" Kfir noted.

42428883,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedXh,1524164419,Walmart Wants to Store Payment Data On a Blockchain,"Newly published patent filings from retail giant Walmart hint at a plan to store payments data using blockchain tech.  The two applications – published on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) – both reference using a blockchain-powered platform to secure the payment data, ensuring that private information can't be access by unauthorized parties. The same Walmart team drafted both applications, which were initially submitted on October 13 of last year.  While neither filing explicitly references using a permissioned blockchain (which allows only certain parties to operate nodes), the system as described would effectively operate as such. Both applications specify that customers must be able to see their payment histories – but that third-parties need to be restricted from this degree of access.  The first patent filing, which describes a vendor payment system, proposes creating a network that's able to automatically conduct transactions on a customer's behalf. The payments would be received by one or more vendors – depending on what services are provided and who provided these services – according to the document.  The application continues:  ""In one aspect, provided is a vendor payment sharing system, [which would] automatically process payment for a total amount due for the products and services related to obtaining and delivering the products; automatically dividing the payment between parties that provided services related to obtaining and delivering the products; and encrypt the payment and the division of the payment with a blockchain.""  The second application focuses on digital shopping systems and describes using a blockchain to encrypt payment information in a similar fashion.  As the filing notes, one part of ""the vendor payment sharing system also includes an authentication system for valuable digitized items ... In an exemplary embodiment, the authentication system utilizes one or more aspects of conventional [blockchain systems].""  The twin applications are the latest intellectual property play from Walmart. As CoinDesk previously reported, the company is seeking a patent for a ""smart package"" that would use blockchain as a way to encode information.  Beyond that, Walmart is also pursuing applications of blockchain for supply chain purposes, particularly for tracking shipments of food.

42428903,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedzh,1524161121,Blythe Masters: Business Blockchain Won't Be 'Winner-Takes-All',"Speaking to an audience in New York City on Thursday, Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters and R3 founder and CEO David Rutter worked to cast their projects not as applications but as entire ecosystems for developers to build apps of their own.  Rutter and Masters took the stage during the first session of the Synchronize 2018 event. For Masters and Digital Asset, the fireside chat was an opportunity to showcase a new developer program built around the startup's smart contract scripting language, DAML (which stands for Digital Asset Modeling Language).  ""The reality,"" Masters said, ""is that not all smart contracts are created equal, and some are not entirely smart."" She added that ""simply building guardrails"" is a powerful tool to prevent catastrophes arising from poorly coded smart contracts.  Masters was alluding to the hack and subsequent collapse of The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that fell apart in 2016 following a debilitating code exploit.  Indeed, both chief executives spoke about the need for outside input – and development – for their respective platforms.  Rutter said that ""we aspire to be the internet for finance and if you want to do that you’re not going to do it with 175 people and $120 million,"" and Masters, on the question of interoperability, said ""we need cooperation"" in order to connect the different types of technology platforms being created.  ""I don't think it’s going to be a winner-takes-all outcome,"" she went on to say.  In addition to security and reliability, the discussion focused on confidentiality.  ""When you're talking about markets where trillions of dollars are traded every day,"" Rutter said, confidentiality is incredibly important. R3's Corda platform and Digital Asset, he continued, ""are going to create innovation in financial services for the first time in our lives.""  For both platforms, however, the most important thing is cultivating a community of developers to build on top of the base-level ledger.  ""We don't think the proprietary vertical stack is the way to go,"" said Rutter, adding that firms that pursue that outcome ""will pay the price.""

Development of the so-called “Allianz token” is being helped along by blockchain startup Adjoint, which created a proprietary blockchain for the project, CoinDesk has learned. Adjoint declined to comment on the project.  But Oliver Volk, a blockchain expert at Allianz's reinsurance unit and representative to the B3i insurance blockchain consortium, confirmed that the token was in the works.  “Yes, we are thinking about a kind of Allianz token whereby money coming in will be converted to a token,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  “But it’s a very big animal and we don’t know what kind of regulatory constraints there are.”  Volk said an Allianz token would be “very helpful to get rid of FX constraints and other stuff we have to optimize, especially if you talk to certain currencies which we do not accept at our headquarters and have to be reconverted.”  He said it would make sense to rely less on the banking system, as this would result in numerous savings on commissions and could be used by Allianz all over the world (the Fortune 500 company has operations in 100 countries).  The internal digital token is a project of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (ACGS), the business-to-business part of the insurer. It grew out of an Allianz captive insurance blockchain project to disburse payments using Citigroup’s CitiConnect API.  Alan Cabello, the innovation program manager for central and eastern Europe at Allianz AGCS, said the token idea cropped up from his previous prototype built for captives and retrocessions, the practice of one reinsurance company providing services to another.  “It’s essentially about the legal way of moving money from one side of the world to the other,"" Cabello said. ""Because of regulation and governance, etc., you need to move it from one entity to the next to the next – and that takes time.""  And that goes beyond the two or three days for a bank transfer to go through, he said. “It takes time to get every entity to book it, bind it; everybody at their own desk; it takes a lot of effort.""  The problem is widespread, Cabello added. “Every single major industry and every major company has issues getting money from one side of the world to the other.”  According to Volk, the corporate team at Allianz counted the emails one entity fielded regarding the transfer of a certain amount of money and it came to over 2,000.  Clients regularly ask where their money is, which is another reason Allianz thought of an internal token, Cabello said. “It’s what we have been playing with for the past few months.”  Cabello stressed that the token, while running on a blockchain, was nothing to do with cryptocurrency.  “It’s pegged to the dollar,” he said.

42428897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedvh,1524150339,Major Investors Met with SEC to Discuss Crypto Exemption,"Major crypto industry investors Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures reportedly held a private meeting with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials to discuss the exemption of blockchain-based tokens from the agency's oversight.  The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firms and their special counsel met with senior officials from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance and the offices of some commissioners on March 28, the Wall Street Journal reported today.  The companies apparently argued that regulation could suppress blockchain innovation, and posited that cryptographic tokens do not constitute investments (and therefore securities). Instead, they argued, tokens are a means of accessing blockchain-based services and networks, or in other words are so-called ""utility tokens,"" the report said.  The firms would not, however, object to SEC intervention in cases of fraud.  According to sources cited in the article, however, SEC officials are doubtful that the agency would provide such a broad exemption.  They speculated that the SEC would be more amenable to granting a limited exemption if companies agree to place a cap on individual investor participation in initial coin offerings (ICOs) and prohibited the resale of tokens at a higher price to third parties.  Lawyers from Cooley, Perkins Coie and McDermott Will & Emery also attended the meeting, as did an unidentified lobbyist from the National Venture Capital Association, the report added.  Notably, SEC chairman Jay Clayton raised doubts about the utility token classification earlier this month during a speech at Princeton University, reiterating his previous statement that almost all token sales offer securities.  ""If I have a laundry token for washing my clothes, that's not a security,"" he said at the time. ""But if I have a set of 10 laundry tokens and the laundromats are to be developed and those are offered to me as something I can use for the future and I'm buying them because I can sell them to next year's incoming class, that's a security.""

42428890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLednh,1524146438,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Pledges 2018 Blockchain Standards Release,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) intends to release a set of common blockchain standards for businesses in 2018, one of the consortium's leading members said Thursday.  Onstage at Blockchain Expo in London, Jeremy Millar, a founding board member of the 450-member group, which boasts Accenture, JP Morgan and UBS among its ranks, provided the update as part of a talk that sought to give an overview of the general progress made by the consortium since it was first founded in 2017.  In his talk, Millar began by stressing to the audience the importance of setting common standards when it comes to technology adoption.  Millar told the crowd:  “We need interfaces to plug into. Now this might sound boring. It might not be top of mind for developers looking to launch a white paper and promote their ICO on Telegram.”  Millar went on to cite the addition of former WiMAX Forum president Ron Resnick as EEA executive director as a hire that would bolster the consortium, which now has 15 employees looking at architecture and technical specifications.  Elsewhere, he said the group has seen progress on setting standards and specs relating to ""oracles,"" or smart contracts meant to feed external data into blockchain systems.  Overall, it was a timely appearance, as EEA rival R3 has recently sought to call out the group for a supposed lack of delivery on promises, with the startup even calling the state of the EEA code ""moribund."" (Like the EEA, R3 is also a consortium and technology provider seeking to bring blockchain applications to global enterprises.)  Faisal Khan, of EEA member firm ConsenSys, would later pen a sarcastic Medium post that sought to highlight the benefits of its approach, which it has long argued is more aligned with the open-source developer movement that has sprung up around ethereum, the world's second largest public blockchain by total value.  In this way, Millar added that it's likely some EEA features will be taken back into the code for the public ethereum blockchain in the form of ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs).  “Next phase will be a testnet. And once we start seeing code coming out, we need certification,” said Millar.  Still, he sought to galvanize support for the effort, concluding:  “Let’s do this together as a community because we will all benefit from it. I urge you to take part in our network – it’s very affordable to join.”  Jeremy Millar image via the author for CoinDesk  Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed Faisal Khan's blog post to the EEA.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/19/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-pledges-2018-blockchain-standards-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/268df8fb61d548dc387354527c6bc2e6926fd555-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428900,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLee5h,1524142824,$6.3 Billion: 2018 ICO Funding Has Passed 2017's Total,"Initial coin offerings (ICOs) raised more money in the first three months of 2018 than the whole of 2017, according to data collected by CoinDesk.  At $6.3 billion, ICO funding in the first quarter is now 118 percent of the total for 2017, a figure that might go a long way toward undermining a common perception that the controversial fundraising method will soon be extinct.  Still, the data perhaps tells a more nuanced story of growth.  For instance, both the size of the average funding round and the rate of project funding are higher than ever. The first quarter saw 59 percent as many ICOs as in all of 2017 receive capital.  There's also the question of how to count Telegram's record-breaking $1.7 billion token sale, as this image from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker illustrates:  Even excluding Telegram, however, ICOs in the first quarter raised $4.6 billion, or 85 percent of the 2017 total.  Most of these sales netted less than $100 million, showing that a number of projects are still eager to sell tokens, despite the regulatory risk.  The news follows the SEC's ruling that at least some ICOs were securities offerings, which must be registered with the agency, which was effectively issued when in it halted Munchee's ICO in December. While the regulator had previously published an opinion that the DAO's token was a security, it had yet to shut down a sale.  Still, the first quarter saw the SEC's view of ICOs arguably harden. The agency's chairman, Jay Clayton, told a Senate hearing in February, ""every ICO I've seen is a security."" Earlier in April, the regulator charged the founders of Centra, an ICO that enjoyed promotion from celebrity boxer Floyd Mayweather, with fraud.  Even so, investors' appetite for token sales appears to be intact, and entrepreneurs appear willing to bear the risks and go on selling tokens.  Graphs and data by Peter Ryan.

42428896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedth,1524139249,The Craigslist of Crypto Is Making Millions Where Bitcoin Is Needed Most,"$27 million.  That's how much revenue LocalBitcoins is now generating annually off a business that started back in 2011, all with an investment of just a few thousand dollars. One of the longest-running and most controversial bitcoin companies, the decidedly low-fi website now has roughly 20 employees worldwide and 4 million registered accounts.  And reflecting the global tide, 40 percent of those users have signed up in the last six months.  All that is according to Nikolaus Kangas, the CEO of the company, who started the venture with his brother Jeremias at a time when there weren't many options outside meeting up face-to-face to trade bitcoin. But the online portal continues to thrive even as the landscape of polished VC-backed exchanges (and even bleeding-edge decentralized alternatives) matures.  Sure, the peer-to-peer marketplace accounts for only a sliver of worldwide bitcoin trading – last week, it handled $62 million in trades, according to Coin.Dance estimates. This may be less than a top-20 exchange does in a day, but the service is gaining traction in markets that are generally overlooked by mainstream providers.  “We are the most global platform out there,” Kangas said. “Our goal is to improve the global trade possibilities, to serve people who have limited access to financial services.”  And, it turns out, even though LocalBitcoins tends to be more expensive (since sellers set their own prices), the company is much needed.  Indeed, Coin.Dance shows that Venezuelan transactions spiked to a new all-time high this month, as did usage in Tanzania and Peru – all countries that are struggling to recoverhttps://www.bnamericas.com/en/intelligence-series/banking/banking-in-peru-recovery-underway-but-politics-raise-doubts/ from banking industry slumps. During the peak week of April 14, LocalBitcoins' trading volume in these three nations combined was worth roughly $55 million – more than six times the value of U.S. trading on LocalBitcoins in the same week.  And when the Bank of Montreal restricted customers from making cryptocurrency purchases, LocalBitcoins activity in Canada spiked.  It's these instances that make LocalBitcoins so valuable, even in an environment where growing awareness of institutional traders and their high-value swaps (average transactions on LocalBitcoins are just $450) are stealing the limelight.  And that's paid off. The peer-to-peer exchange, which charges a 1 percent transaction fee, took in more than €22 million (roughly $27.2 million) of revenues in 2017, more than triple the amount from 2016, according to Kangas.  Despite the market dip since December, when bitcoin's price peaked at $19,783, he said trading volume has continued to grow.  Nikolaus told CoinDesk:  ""If you compare us to those big altcoin exchanges that were making $100 million per day or something like that last fall, we are kind of a small player. But I think we are solving a basic problem of how to buy or sell bitcoin for fiat currency.""  Not always easy  And that basic problem was even more apparent in 2011 when the brothers first started in on the idea.  Nikolaus, a Finnish programmer, was fascinated by bitcoin – a new stateless currency meant to take power away from the banks, and maybe even governments. But every website he went to that provided services for Finnish buyers was awful in that it was hard to use. The Kangas brothers wanted to change that.  So having saved up a year's worth of living expenses and with a few thousand dollars to spend on server fees, the brothers launched LocalBitcoins.  Yet, the journey for LocalBitcoins hasn't always been easy.  The company has tested several products over the years, including a merchant billing service in 2014, but none of those gained traction like its bread and butter - P2P exchange.  On top of that, LocalBitcoins was the platform in the middle of more than half a dozen criminal cases associated with LocalBitcoins traders. For instance, last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sentenced a father-son duo of LocalBitcoins users, Michael and Randall Lord, to several years in prison for operating an unlicensed money transmission business.  And Reddit is full of testimonies about scammers and hackers exploiting inexperienced LocalBitcoins' users.  Nikolaus said the team is very concerned about criminal activity on the site and cooperates with authorities to investigate any crimes that use the platform.  Yet, just like Craigslist horror stories haven't stopped people from using the internet marketplace, instances like these connected to LocalBitcoins haven't slowed the platform's usage. In fact, the $27.2 million in revenue LocalBitcoins took in last year was more than triple its profits from 2016.  Even with bitcoin's recent price dip (after December highs close to $20,000 a coin), Nikolaus said trading volume continues to grow.  Compliance for a non-bank  That said, Nikolaus remains steadfast in his interest in staying on the right side of the law.  “We want to follow all the current regulations and laws, but right now it is quite unclear,"" he said.  What is clear, though, is that at least in the U.S. the company has to report certain transactions as suspicious. This includes transactions over $10,000 and any transactions set up obviously to circumvent that limit.  Everything else – complying with local regulations – is up to the buyer and seller.  In this way, LocalBitcoins has set itself up to be only a technology provider and not a complicit party to any unlawful actions users of its technology might participate in. This outsourcing of compliance responsibility is one of the reasons the company has been able to stay afloat, even in the face of competition from well-funded startups.  Because LocalBitcoins generally facilitates trades of smaller amounts, they rarely attract scrutiny.  For instance, when the Investor Protection Bureau of the New York Attorney General's Office sent an inquiry letter this month to more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini – exchanges that function more like banks – P2P platforms like LocalBitcoins were notably absent from the dragnet.  It seems it helps to be local.  For example, Iranian blockchain researcher Ziya Sadr in Tehran routinely uses LocalBitcoins to sell cryptocurrency. Since sanctions keep Iranian banking customers from accessing foreign markets, he told CoinDesk, Iranian traders use LocalBitcoins to find local sellers who accept wire transfers from Iranian banks.  As mentioned before, it's these kinds of markets, which are cut off from the rest of the world, that need P2P crypto exchanges like LocalBitcoins.  Roman Snitko, CTO of a new P2P exchange called Hodl Hodl, noticed a similar trend on his platform. Russians, who lack centralized exchange options, were some of the first users to flock to Hodl Hodl.  Speaking to this need, then, Snitko told CoinDesk:  “In countries without centralized exchanges, I think P2P trading will play a significant role.”  LocalBitcoins image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/19/the-craigslist-of-crypto-is-making-millions-where-bitcoin-is-needed-most,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cedf05646764a7c494b58b5dcf4ed98d890fead-1500x788.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428898,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLee1h,1524135915,"$8,300: Bitcoin Seeks Direction at Key Price Hurdle","Bitcoin (BTC) remains in bullish territory today, but a major break above the long-term descending trendline has been elusive.  That failure on the part of the bulls means the cryptocurrency needs a major move above $8,300 soon to lessen the risks of another sell-off. The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.  However, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.  Daily chart  As the chart above shows, BTC is trading in a tight range ($8,032–$8,285) this morning, but is holding well above the ascending (bull-biased) 10-day moving average (MA), currently at $7,824.  The price action witnessed in the last few days also indicates the cryptocurrency has found acceptance above the $8,000 mark, with repeated rebounds from sub-$8,000 levels highlighting a strong dip mentality in the market. So, it is safe to say, the bias remains bullish.  That said, a convincing break above the long-term falling trendline must happen soon to keep the bulls in the game.  It is worth noting that BTC failed to clear that key hurdle on April 17 and another rejection could prove costly for the bulls, the four-hour chart below indicates.  4-hour chart  On the chart above, BTC looks to be creating a head-and-shoulders reversal pattern with neckline support at $7,830.  Failure to take out the trendline hurdle in the coming hours would shift the odds in favor of a drop below $7,830 – a move that would confirm a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal and signal that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 has ended.  A bear reversal would open the doors to $7,510 (former resistance turned support) and even $7,200 (target as per the measured height method).  Such a pullback would likely be short-lived, however, as the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs) are trending northwards, indicating a bullish setup, and BTC looks more likely to cross the trendline resistance in a convincing manner soon.  View  A high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).  Repeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510–$7,200.

During its shareholder conference call on Thursday, the world's largest independent semiconductor maker said it generated 248 billion Taiwan new dollars (US$8.5 billion) in sales revenue for Q1 – a year-on-year increase of 6.1 percent. Furthermore, the company saw NT$89 billion (US$3 billion) in net income, reflecting a 2.5 percent growth year-on-year.  Notably, the revenue in March alone accounted for 41 percent of the Q1 performance – NT$103 billion (US$3.5 billion) – making it the largest single monthly sales income for the firm, based on a financial statement filed on April 10.  ""These results were mainly driven by strong demand from high performance computing such as cryptocurrency mining,"" explained C. C. Wei, president and co-chief executive officer of TSMC, though he did not disclose the percentage accounted for by mining chip orders.  Adding to that, Mark Liu, also president and co-CEO, said:  ""We see very strong demand in the first quarter from cryptocurrencies. During the second quarter, while we do see some weakness in the 28mm chip, the [demand for] the rest of the technology is still very strong on cryptocurrency.""  The sales figures follow a similar pattern to that seen last year, when the firm reported revenues of $8.32 billion and $9.2 billion in the third and fourth quarter, respectively – strong figures that the chip maker also attributed to a growing demand for cryptocurrency mining chips.

42428891,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedlh,1524124839,"Ideas Abound for Business Blockchains, But Who's Going to Pay?","After a seemingly unending period of blockchain R&D, major enterprises are eager to edge their technology toward production.  At least that was the sentiment at Blockchain Expo Global on Tuesday, where attendees at the Olympia London venue assembled to hear from experts in supply chain tracking, energy, logistics, freight and more – all of whom have been working to apply distributed ledgers to incumbent business problems.  Citing an unprecedented convergence of technologies, speakers often sought to sound the bell about a coming revolution in efficiency that could be unlocked should enterprises find novel ways of deploying the tech.  Indeed, Vincent Doumeizel, vice president food and sustainability at the non-profit Lloyd's Register Foundation, went so far as to call blockchain a missing piece that would ""completely revolutionize"" the food industry.  However, he admitted there's been plenty of talk and not much action.  He told attendees:  ""Blockchain in the food industry is a bit like teenage sex. Everybody is talking about it, not many are doing it, and those that are are doing it badly.""  But while there are creative ways to merge IoT, blockchain and other innovations that might someday revolutionize the food supply chain, Doumeizel said progress is likely to be stymied by high costs, ones he argued might ultimately land with the consumer.  Others appeared less sure about how to handle the economics of business blockchains.  Mark Deansmith, CIO at animal nutrition company AB Agri Ltd, for instance, said his company has a visibility into the diet of 20 percent of the chickens on the planet, but a key missing component is a link between its physical products and a system that can track them.  Mixing near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) markers and blockchains could do the job, he said, though he questioned how exactly such a system would justify its roll-out.  ""We have done a pilot with this technology. In terms of traceability of supply chains, blockchain fits with NIRF, IoT alongside audits. This is not beyond us,"" he said. ""But the question is, who is going to pay for it?""  Creative costs  Elsewhere, this question of cost was broached as one that could perhaps be solved more creatively.  Richard Stockley, head of blockchain for IBM in the UK and Ireland, said that where some participants are going to gain more from being on a shared ledger, some sort of governance can be applied.  ""There may be a need to subsidize points in the network where data is worth more to certain parties. It's all about how we collaborate,"" he said.  Talking on a panel about blockchain in logistics and transport, John Kingston, executive editor at the trade publication FreightWaves, said many consortium efforts come up against the ""free rider problem.""  In such cases, there are a few players who shoulder the costs building the network, while others simply join it and reap the benefits without incurring anything. Notably, one solution might be for businesses to embrace open blockchains with some form of token, he said, adding:  ""These things cost money. Customers could pay some minuscule fraction in the forms of a token for being on the network.""  Still, Lloyd's Register Foundation's Doumeizel argued that consumers might be willing to shoulder some costs, as organic branding has shown people are willing to pay a little more for their food.  ""Millennnials in particular want to know where their food was sourced and would be willing to pay for the assurance it was sustainable,"" he said.  R&D fatigue  However, other speakers pointed to an ongoing fatigue affecting the enterprise blockchain space.  AB Agri's Deansmith said firms are also hamstrung by what he called the ""Betamax worry,"" a reference to an early type of videotape format that lost out to VHS.  ""The tech is moving so fast how can you tell what it will be like in five years time. Should we wait a year before investing?"" he asked.  That wasn't to say others don't think a change is on its way. Julian Gray, the technology director for BP's digital innovation organization, cited estimates that there have been some 37,000 blockchain trials to date.  ""That's enough, I think. We know it works. To get investment behind this, we need to see production,"" he said, adding that BP intends to help pave the way.  In a talk that embraced some of the more experimental concepts in blockchain, Gray sought to position BP as a company ready to do what it can to move the industry forward.  He told attendees:  ""We are in production now and we expect to have something out by the end of the year.""

According to data published by the Korean Customs Service (KCS) on Wednesday, cryptocurrency mining chips have been added to the current list of items that must meet certain legal requirement for importation, such as safety and sanitation certifications.  The new measure arrives after the border control agency noted the increasing amount of cryptocurrency miners imported into South Korea, according to a report from local media outlet Kyunghyang yesterday.  For example, in November and December 2017 alone, the KCS noted imports of 454 mining chips at an estimated value of 1.3 billion Korean won ($1.2 million), the report said.  Due to their significant electricity consumption and associated heating byproduct, the use of miners raises concerns at the agency over whether they bring a high possibility of fire incidents.  As a result, the report said the agency will look at the safety issues around imported cryptocurrency miners based on the existing radio legislation, as well as the safety requirements for electronic goods put out by the National Radio Research Agency – a government body that sets standards for related regulations.  The increased technical scrutiny comes at a time when public and private sectors in South Korea have moved to halt allegedly illegal mining activities, especially in public spaces due to concerns over high electricity consumption and fire risk.  As reported by CoinDesk, earlier this month Korean police busted 14 people from 13 companies who had allegedly used cheap electricity provided at industrial factories to mine cryptocurrencies.  And, in August of last year, an electronics retail marketplace in Seoul also banned its stores from mining cryptocurrencies inside the building due to fire concerns.

42428882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLedZh,1524110458,New Ethereum Tech Calls on Slavic Gods for Security,"The Slavic god of lightning, Perun, is entering the ethereum ecosystem (in spirit at least).  Inspired by bitcoin's lightning network, a group of researchers led by University of Warsaw associate professor Stefan Dziembowski and Technical University of Darmstadt professor Sebastian Faust have unveiled a new white paper entitled ""Foundations of State Channel Networks,"" which outlines a protocol designed to help ethereum scale to support higher volumes of more complex smart contracts.  But while a number of ethereum projects are building solutions for this problem, Perun's approach to its protocol is unique - namely in its focus on security, as it provides formal security definitions and security proofs for its protocol.  Essentially, Perun works like other ""state channels"" that aim to move transactions off of the blockchain. However, the difference here is that parties involved can register the current state of the contract at any time on the blockchain, enabling smart contracts to rewind channels to the last state at which parties agreed on terms.  ""In case when two (possibly malicious) parties send conflicting states to the channel contract, the logic of the contract will select the latest state on which both users have agreed on,"" the paper reads.  An incremental innovation perhaps, but Dziembowski, a co-author of the paper, argues can't be undersold given the nature of value transfers.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We are convinced that in the context of cryptocurrencies, a sound security analysis is of particular importance because security flaws have a direct monetary value and hence, unlike in many other settings, are guaranteed to be exploited.""  It turns out, this is such a highly sought-after goal that the researchers are already partnering with tech giant Bosch to put together a prototype. Not only that, but the project has been lauded by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  In fact, Buterin was actually the first to praise the idea, positing that the security proofs the team had implemented were a step in the right direction for the ecosystem overall, and should be studied, if not adopted, by scaling projects of all kinds.  ""I definitely do think that we need some kind of general-purpose machinery for formally verifying properties of layer-two systems in general,"" Buterin said.  Journey to state  Stepping back, though, the team's path to Perun was a bit meandering.  Dziembowski told CoinDesk he and the team originally wanted to build a ""fair"" file-sharing app on top of ethereum but were tripped up by critical issues soon into the process of developing that app.  ""While working on this project we noticed that a fundamental bottleneck to make our application work was high costs from on-chain transactions and the relatively slow time of processing smart contracts running on the blockchain,"" Dziembowski said.  This is exactly what other developers have experienced, most famously when the digital cat collectables app CryptoKitties emerged as a user favorite, causing these slow transaction times and high fees. A handful of scaling solutions have been put forth to the ethereum community since then, but the team at Perun actually found their inspiration from a different network altogether.  It was bitcoin's lightning network, another ""layer-two solution"" for the bitcoin blockchain, that piqued their interest. That's when the team, which also includes researchers Kristina Hostakova and Lisa Eckey, got to work on a technology that would function on ethereum's more ambitious platform.  Luckily others had already started building on that idea through a technology known as ""state channels"" – whereby lightning is extended to ethereum's complex smart contracts. As such, Perun's paper merely continues this research by formulating a specification that outlines a bunch of requirements that any actual state channel implementation needs to secure itself against ""powerful adversaries.""  Toward reality?  That said, the Perun team and even Buterin understand that there's still a long way to go.  Dziembowski said that his team's prototype isn't ready for live use yet, but is ""mainly for research purposes"" now. And Buterin said he's worried about the future ""risk of error"" as the theory is put into practice with real smart contract code.  Speaking to those risks, Dziembowski named The DAO, an ethereum-based organization that was supposed to rely only on code but ended up defunct after users were hacked for more than $50 million of ether, as an example of what, and how much, can go wrong.  Still, many are excited about the effort.  Buterin even said he has plans to come up with a similar security framework for Plasma, a highly-anticipated scaling project he co-authored last year and which startups like OmiseGo are now putting into practice.  Speaking about Perun's work, Buterin continued:  ""I personally am satisfied that it’s fundamentally possible to achieve all of the things that you claim in the way that you’re doing it.""  The research team responded to him saying that they're working on a simple implementation.

The partners said they will test content delivery using Brave's blockchain-based platform for digital advertising, on which Dow Jones Media group subsidiaries Barron's and MarketWatch will also become ""verified publishers."" The partnership will also furnish selected Brave users – of which there are approximately 2 million – with access to Barron's and MarketWatch premium content, according to a press release.  ""Our new model reconnects users and publishers without compromising privacy,"" Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, said in the statement. ""We look forward to our users enjoying Barron's and MarketWatch premium newsletters.""  Launched in 2015, Brave's browser blocks ads and activity trackers, while also allowing users to contribute microdonations in BAT to their preferred publishers. It concluded its $35 million ICO last spring.  The company also revealed last year that it planned to integrate the aforementioned blockchain-based digital advertising platform, which measures user attention and rewards publishers proportionately. Brave has not yet launched the platform.  Daniel Bernard, senior vice president of Barron's commented in the statement:  ""As global digital publishers, we believe it is important to continually explore new and emerging technologies that can be used to build quality customer experiences.""  Brave's partnership with Dow Jones Media Group marks a significant departure from its early reception by media companies. In 2016, 17 members of the Newspaper Association of America sent a cease-and-desist letter to the company, arguing that its browser was illegal.
