42399302,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqwL,1473367043,Bitcoin Price Flirts With $630 as Traders Bet Long,"The price of bitcoin surged more than 2% on Thursday, 8th September, nearing $630 as speculators caused the digital currency to extend gains produced earlier this week.  The digital currency’s climb did not coincide with any major news catalysts, and while trading volume picked up to the last few sessions, it was still generally low.  Considering these tepid market dynamics, a short squeeze likely fueled bitcoin’s more than 2% gain, Petar Zivkovski, director of operations at leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk. At press time, the digital currency had reached a high of $628.75 at 12:30 UTC, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  This climb took place after a six-day period when long exposure, as measured by total position size, averaged 87%, Whaleclub data reveals. The increase built upon gains created earlier in the week, including bitcoin’s rise above $600 on Sunday, 4th September, the third consecutive session where long exposure exceeded 80%.  The $600 figure represented a key psychological barrier, as the digital currency had been trading below this level for more than a month after a Bitfinex security breach on 2nd August resulted in the exchange losing 120,000 BTC.  At the time, markets responded to this event by sending the digital currency nearly 20% lower.  Speculators dominate  Zivkovski is not the only market observer who has pointed to the key role that speculators play in bitcoin trading.  Cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, for example, said that the digital currency’s market has a ratio of speculators to users that is ""large"" and ""unhealthy"".  ""Most traders just buy in hopes of selling at a profit,"" he told CoinDesk. ""If bitcoin ever succeeds in growing its user base, I expect we'll see fewer of these gap-py jumps and drops.""  Should the digital currency enjoy the rising adoption that Eliosoff hopes for, bitcoin could easily enjoy further price gains.  While this scenario may take some time to play out, bitcoin’s continued gains above and beyond $600 could portend further appreciation in the short-term, said Zivkovski.  ""The price rise from $600 has held quite steadily, without pullbacks, and has made newer highs since,” he told CoinDesk. “This is a bullish sign and may indicate the beginning of a new flow of money coming in to place buy orders.”  Zivkovski emphasized that current market dynamics could easily fuel further gains in the near future.  However, Zivkovski also noted that bitcoin prices currently face significant resistance. To surpass $640, the digital currency will need “a good amount of firepower,"" he said.  Alternatively, bitcoin prices might fall back, potentially dropping down to the low $600s, he noted.

42399285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqgb,1473359138,Bank of England to Accelerate Blockchain Work,"The UK's newly opened FinTech accelerator is seeking additional ways to explore blockchain tech.  Speaking during an eventhttp://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/p2pfisy-2016/ in London this week, the chief cashier of the Bank of England, Victoria Cleland, discussed the central bank's efforts involving financial technology, including the founding of a startup accelerator focused on financial applications.  It's here that the Bank of England is seeking to study concepts such as distributed ledger-based digital currency, but the organization is already looking to move beyond its currently disclosed projects.  Cleland said:  ""[Distributed ledger technology] is still in its infancy, and there are numerous questions that need exploring. The Bank has already undertaken a proof-of-concept using this technology and we are looking for new opportunities through our FinTech accelerator.""  The subject, detailed in an ultimately cancelled speech by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, has since been taken up in the British legislature (though no direct legislative effort has been sought to date).  Earlier this month, a committee of the UK House of Lords heard from a number of panelists on the technology as part of its fact-finding effort into the technology.

42399288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqfc,1473355982,"Quick Blockchain Adoption a 'Myth', Says Russian Central Banker","A high-ranking official at Russia’s central bank believes blockchain technology needs more time to mature.  At a banking conference today, financial news source Bankir.ru reports Bank of Russia Deputy Chairman Olga Skorobogatova addressed the growing enthusiasm and interest in blockchain domestically amid a broader talk on innovation.  There, Skorobogatova argued blockchain solutions won’t arrive today, but will likely take three to four years to move forward as the technology becomes better understood.  A rough translation of the statements reads:  ""The myth of blockchain, that everything is ready and you can reduce costs and give up the bank, it turned out to be a myth.""  Skorobogatova’s estimates are in line with statements from some of the more experienced Russian firms working with the technology. For example, payments firm Qiwi, which is seeking to establish a blockchain consortium in Russia, estimates it won’t be ready to use the technology in its systems until 2021.  Elsewhere, Skorobogatova addressed the growing interest in FinTech and other areas of innovation in banking including biometrics, cloud and AI.

42399292,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqlW,1473350498,Santander: Bitcoin Threatens Credit Card Issuers,"A securities affiliate of Spanish banking group Banco Santander is predicting bitcoin will have a significant impact on the legacy finance ecosystem should it see wider adoption.  The report, published earlier this week, stems from a meeting involving Santander researchers, Santander Investment Securities, Brazilian bitcoin brokerage Mercado Bitcoin and local investors. While short, the publication offers a take on the risks (or opportunities) card issuers, acquirers, exchanges and banks would face in a future should the use of digital currency become more mainstream.  Perhaps most at risk, according to the report, are the card issuers and acquirers.  Researchers Henrique Navarro and Bruno Mendonca noted:  ""Simply put, we believe a future with bitcoin transactions with their low (or no) costs and fees puts at risk the entire business model of credit and debit card companies. Acquirers such as Cielo (through net MDRs and POS revenue) and issuer banks (through interchange fees) potentially could suffer the most, in our view.”  Specifically, the report identifies long transaction times, operational costs and associated fees and taxes as factors that would put issuers and acquirers at a disadvantage.  ""The risk increases as more and more merchants and suppliers accept bitcoins,"" the report adds.  Impact on card brands, banks  The report examines the potential impact on banks, offering a broad overview of recent work by major financial institutions to test and experiment with various blockchain applications.  Notably highlighted is the recent blockchain settlement system created by UBS, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and Santander.  The report's authors state:  ""We believe the blockchain concept has the potential to redefine money transactions in the banking world, taking advantage of the power of decentralized computer networks to eliminate difficult, time-consuming and costly trading among banks. IT, transaction costs, the banks’ huge back-offices, capital requirements – all of those could change in a material way, in our view.""  Major card brands, too, stand to reap the advantages of the technology, according to the report.  Companies like Visa and MasterCard, among others, ""could benefit"" from using blockchain to lower transaction, IT and back-office costs, the authors write.  The report also highlights a recent initiative launched by Visa to test interbank payments, indicating that such systems could threaten the supremacy of the global interbank payments network SWIFT.  ""In our view, it is definitely a challenge to SWIFT (banks' interbank payment system),"" the report states.

42399293,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqmV,1473342688,"If You Understand Google Docs, You Can Understand Blockchain","The more people understand the blockchain, the more we will see a proliferation of useful cases for it.  Just like any technology, those who invent it have not necessarily thought of all of its applications, which is why I believe that the best use cases are yet to come from a growing number of entrepreneurs and subject-matter experts that have deep expertise in a particular field or domain.  But, the first step is to have a fundamental understanding of how blockchain technology is different from what we are currently doing today.  Almost everything in life is about taking evolutionary steps.  Even the brightest startups need to understand the behavioral switching psychology of their users (eg Facebook understood the concept of sharing), while large enterprises need to prepare for the ambitious management challenges they'll need to navigate to get blockchain projects moving.  The 'new database'  The idea that the blockchain is another kind of database is a popular analogy that has been used a lot (I wrote about this subject almost two years ago). In reality, the blockchain doesn't disrupt databases, but it disrupts how databases get synchronized between each other.  Imagine two entities (eg banks) that need to update their own user account balances when there is a request to transfer money from one customer to another. They need to spend a tremendous (and costly) amount of time and effort for coordination, synchronization, messaging and checking to ensure that each transaction happens exactly as it should.  Typically, the money being transferred is held by the originator until it can be confirmed that it was received by the recipient.  With the blockchain, a single ledger of transaction entries that both parties have access to can simplify the coordination and validation efforts because there is always a single version of records, not two disparate databases.  Let's take that analogy further into the shared documents domain, and think about what happens when we share a document where two or more users need to make changes to it.  Google Docs  The traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient, and ask them to make revisions to it.  The problem with that scenario is that you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes, because you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it.  That's how databases work today. Two owners can't update the same record at once. That's how banks maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again).  With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is a shared document. The distributed part comes into play when sharing involves a number of people.  Imagine the number of legal documents that should be used that way.  Instead of passing them to each other and losing track of versions, why can’t all business documents become shared instead of transferred back and forth? So many types of legal contracts would be ideal for that kind of workflow.  You don’t need a blockchain to share documents, but the shared documents analogy is a powerful one.

42399294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiqpS,1473337905,Italy Wants to Tax Speculative Bitcoin Use,"New documents suggest Italy's top tax office is treating bitcoin as a form of currency.  Agenzia della Entrate  , Italy's top tax authority, released new information this month about its treatment of digital currencies, a publication that comes months after an EU court ruling regarding how value-added tax (VAT) would apply to transactions executed using the technology.  According to the Agenzia della Entrate, purchases and sales made with bitcoin remain exempt from VAT – a decision that mirrors a decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) last October. However, Italian tax officials, the documents show, are applying income tax to speculative uses of bitcoin, or events in which money is made during a sale or purchase.  The agency published the ruling in response to a request by a business in Italy, the name of which wasn't disclosed. Those buying bitcoins outside of the scope of speculative activity, it indicates, aren't required to pay income tax.  In doing so, the Agenzia Entrate appears to be treating bitcoin as a form of currency, a move that is the latest turn regarding bitcoin taxation worldwide.  While the ruling largely brings Italy in line with the decision set by the ECJ, it further highlights the disparity between Europe and countries like the US, which taxes bitcoin as a form of property.  Imperfect ruling?  At least one analyst reported there are issues with how the Agenzia della Entrate crafted its ruling, however.  Italy-based CPA and tax advisor Stefano Capaccioli, who has written about the issue on his blog, said that the ruling creates a new layer of uncertainty for businesses working with the digital currency.  Specifically, while the agency is looking to tax bitcoin as a form of currency, Italian law itself doesn't recognize it as such. Further, he said that accounting standards in place today in Italy are also in conflict with the Agenzia Entrate’s position on bitcoin.  ""It could generate more problems than solutions,"" he told CoinDesk.
