42399197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibX0,1469824516,Rise of Replay Attacks Intensifies Ethereum Divide,"The unintended consequences of the ethereum hard fork continued to mount this week as new problems became apparent due to the ongoing popularity of two competing networks.  A week ago, there was one ethereum, a decentralized computing platform that’s drawn outside attention for applying the cryptocurrency concept to develop new Internet applications. But due to a schism in how people think the platform should work, there are now two ethereum networks (ethereum and ethereum classic), both of which use an almost identical history.  The thinking was one blockchain 'winner' would quickly emerge and that the other would eventually fall to the wayside. However, both have continued to exist despite these predictions.  At issue is that, by having two separate networks with two separate blockchains, anyone who held funds in the first iteration (ethereum) is now the owner of funds on the second (ethereum classic). Complicating matters is that, for users, both their ETH funds on ethereum and ETC funds on ethereum classic have the same address and private keys.  The present conditions have set the stage for ""replay attacks"".  In computer science terms, this simply means a network action that is repeated that isn’t supposed to be. In digital currency terms, when someone broadcasts a transaction using one of the networks, there is a risk that that transaction gets included in both blockchains.  This means users who try to buy ETH today won’t be affected, but anyone who had funds in any contract prior to the fork was essentially duplicated on the other fork.  Ethereum developer Zsolt Felföldi, who works on the platform’s Go implementation, explained that this shouldn’t happen if both networks were taking proper precautions.  ""Separating these two networks was never really planned,"" he said.  Given the attention paid to ethereum by major banks and financial professionals, the incident has caught the interest of even those outside the open-source blockchain community. To these observers, the situation appears to be a crossroads of indecision.  IBM blockchain leader of the Latin American division Martin Hagelstrom told CoinDesk:  ""The problem is that changing these rules imply making a new hard fork. So ethereum is saying [ethereum classic] should do it. And the classic guys are saying that [ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] should have considered it on their hard fork, so they should do it.""  Neither ethereum nor ethereum classic seemed to prepare for the attacks, but the resulting gap in communications means that neither side is really pursuing action.  ""They are acting like kids if you ask me,"" Hagelstrom added.  'Attack' semantics  Users on both the ETC and ETH networks are vulnerable to the “attack,” though there is even disagreement about whether this is an accurate way to describe what’s going on.  For one, it's unclear whether users could fall into one category or the other, unless they opted out of one network for ideological reasons and chose to sell their ETH or ETC.  Felföldi described it as a necessary inconvenience:  ""I wouldn’t say the replay problem is quite an ‘attack’ because this is just something that happens always. No one does this maliciously, I think. This is just some inconvenience. The network wasn’t designed for this situation.""  The biggest risk may be that users ""lose"" funds by intending to execute a contract with ETH, and by virtue of the address and private key similarities, end up sending ETC as well.  Should this account not be accessible to the user, this could mean additional value is lost in a manner that wasn’t intended.  Exchange impact  At present, it appears that exchanges have been most affected by the vulnerability.  For example, at one time, traders seemed to be using Coinbase’s exchange as a vehicle to get ""free"" ETC. The steps required to do game the exchange are public, and people appear to be using them. Whether this particular attack vector might have been resolved is unclear, but signs on social media suggest that users have been able to withdraw both currencies today.  Coinbase was unavailable for comment at press time.  In a blog post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claims that the exchange anticipated the replay attacks, but didn’t expect ethereum classic to be so popular. He claims that they then ""began work to nullify the replay attacks.""  Earlier this week, Coinbase announced that it doesn't plan to support ethereum classic, whether on its wallet service or its new exchange GDAX.  It’s unclear whether this is ongoing, and if it is, who's paying for it, because it might not even be the exchange.  Coinbase doesn’t appear to be guarding against it, although it’s hard to tell. Coinbase’s Charlie Lee said via Slack that the Ethereum Foundation advised the payment processor not to guard against the replay attacks.  Coinbase, however, isn't the only exchange impacted.  In a message posted to the exchange’s website this week, BTC-e staff indicated that its ETC holdings had been drained when users transferred their funds to Poloniex, and went as far as declaring that “ethereum classic in the current circumstances is a scam”.  China-based exchange Yunbi said in blog post earlier this week that it had lost 40,000 ETC due to the replay vulnerability. The exchange said that it would effectively eat the losses and pay out ETC balances corresponding to user ETH balances.  Future fix unclear  So how do ethereum users and exchanges guard against it?  One way to get around the risk is to run a transaction through an open-source ""splitter contract"", effectively moving ETC to a new account. But this is pretty burdensome as it’s dependent on each exchange or each individual to do for every account that they have.  Poloniex automatically generates new addresses for users so that they can avoid unintentionally sending their ETH or ETC in the mirrored process. Kraken did the same, claiming that if users don’t ""split"" their ETH and ETC, they can still deposit ETH at the exchange and receive ETH and ETC in their account.  It’s possible to stop this across the network wholesale, rather than trusting exchanges to pull through. If either network incorporated the fix by hard forking their network to update the transaction formats, they could resolve this problem, but neither has expressed plans to do so.  On the other hand, Felföldi mentioned that ethereum does eventually want to update the network to resolve the problem by incorporating the necessary change to the transaction formats in Metropolis, the next version of ethereum, which is due in fall 2016.  The worry is that changing it earlier than that would require yet another hard fork, or moving to a new blockchain, but people are afraid it will be one fork too many.  ""We just did one fork. We don’t want to do any more rash updates because it’s dangerous,"" he said. ""It will probably be here for quite some time.""  Classic project manager Arvicco said that, in his view, the responsibility for resolving the relay vulnerability falls on those who executed the split in the first place.  ""The facts are clear, ethereum classic is still keeping a consensus of original legacy network, while those following forked ethereum left this consensus,"" he told CoinDesk, going on to argue:  ""For the ones forking off (leaving consensus), it stands to reason that they are liable to institute a clean split, and not expect to push the burden to the ones still in consensus.""  Others see the situation persisting because of these entrenched positions.  Peter Vessenes, security expert and Bitcoin Foundation founder, said:  ""Creating chaos is clearly a goal for some participants.""

42399203,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibbv,1469813426,Zcash Delays Untraceable Cryptocurrency for Additional Audits,"The launch of the genesis block for a new cryptocurrency designed to make real the anonymity once thought to be offered by bitcoin has been delayed once again.  Zooko Wilcox, early cypherpunk and founder of anonymous cryptocurrency startup Zcash, told CoinDesk yesterday that his startup will likely be pushing back the mining of its blockchain in order to give multiple third-party auditors the time to perform in-depth code analyses.  In the aftermath of the the fallout surrounding the collapse of The DAO, a short-lived, much-hyped application on the ethereum blockchain, the value of such precautions are more apparent than ever.  And Wilcox should know. His security firm, Least Authority, was commissionedhttps://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_incentive_analysis_for_ethereum.html to perform an audit of ethereum's code.  While it is widely agreed that the collapse of The DAO was not the result of a problem with ethereum itself, Wilcox wants to take further precautions now that he's preparing to launch a competing cryptocurrency.  Speaking with CoinDesk at American Banker’s Blockchain + Digital Currencies conference yesterday, Wilcox said:  ""I feel bad that we didn’t do a better job of making DAO disaster-like problems harder for people to encounter.""  As part of his own firm's security Wilcox hired two firms to perform an audit of the code designed to enable anonymity for the sender and receiver of a transaction, and hide the amount. Those audits are taking longer than expected.  Earlier this year, Zcash launched its alpha product built from the Zerocash protocol created by Wilcox and others. Then, last week, the startup launched an alpha update to the product with guidelines to side channel attacks and other security concerns.  Zcash has raised $1m venture capital from institutional investors including Pantera Capital, Digital Currency Group and Fenbushi Capital. Individual investors Naval Ravikant and Roger Ver also backed the company.  Cautious rollout  Though Wilcox describes his team of 16 employees, including seven computer scientists, as ""super-world-class"", he said it’s important for cryptocurrency developers to constantly be working with outsiders in order to help avoid problems like The DAO.  To that end, Zcash has hired two separate firms to perform an audit, according to Wilcox. After the firms' analysis is complete, he said Zcash will publish their name and all their findings, something LeastAuthority did during the audit of ethereum's code.  ""The full report of what they each discover when they examine Zcash will also be published in its entirety,"" he said.  To give the auditors more time, earlier this week, the 1.0 release of Zcash was pushed back from 5th September to 26th September, and Wilcox said he expects further delays.  Over the coming weeks, he said that date will likely be pushed back even further.  He concluded:  ""The thing that you are intimate with and that you build yourself, whenever you look at it, you will remember what you intended for it to be. And security flaws are often the separation between what you intended and what you actually got.""  Emphasis on collaboration  But, this emphasis on collaborative testing goes deeper than just an audit.  Yesterday, Zcash engineer Sean Bowe published the results of his work with several other employees at the Ethereum Foundation/IC3 bootcamp held at Cornell University.  According to the post, three Zcash employees worked with Casey Detrio of the Ethereum Foundation and others to build their zkSNARKs cryptographic tool for protecting identity into ethereum.  ""Specifically, we added a snarkverify precompile (like an opcode) to a fork of Parity which uses libsnark to verify generic proofs,"" according to the post.  In conclusion Bowe wrote:  ""We love contributing to both bitcoin and ethereum, and look forward to more collaboration with the broader cryptocurrency community.""

42399187,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZwc,1469809555,French Minister to Speak at 'Parliamentary Blockchain Forum' in Paris,"A blockchain tech conference to be held this October will feature representatives from the French government and legislature.  The Parliamentary Blockchain Forum will be held on 4th October at the Maison de la chimie, a conference site located near the French National Assembly, the lower house of the country’s legislature. French Minister for Digital Affairs Axelle Lemaire will give closing remarks, an appearance confirmed by the French Finance Ministry when reached.  French MPs Laure de la Raudière and Jean Launay are said to be giving remarks during the early morning session, according to the event's schedule. Other features will include roundtables on the technology as well as a startup presentation, though the site is currently light on details as to who will be presenting or leading these discussions.  Sponsors of the event, the site details, include ENEDIS, a French public utility firm, and MAIF, a major mutual insurance firm in France.  Organizers for the event did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42399174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZmm,1469804645,Philips Healthcare's Blockchain Lead is Leaving Next Month,"The founder and head of Philips Blockchain Lab is leaving the healthcare giant effective 1st August for new opportunities in the blockchain sector.  Arno Laeven, who led a 12-person internal team which investigated how blockchain tech could be applied to healthcare, said he will be departing for ""new adventures"" in the industry, but declined additional comment. Laeven was formerly global IT innovation lead, before founding the Philips Blockchain Lab in January.  Laeven will be succeeded by Patrick van Beers, senior director of digital platform solutions at Philips Research.  The announcement comes as blockchain leads at major banks are continuing to depart for entrepreneurial opportunities. Barclays blockchain lead Simon Taylor, for example, revealed he would be leaving the UK bank for a new venture fund, 11:FS, in June.  Soon after, blockchain leads at JPMorgan, State Street and BNP Paribas were found to be exiting their positions for new roles in the startup space.  Philips has been early among major healthcare firms in investigating blockchain’s potential, first announcing it would explore applications in October, before formally launching an Amsterdam-based R&D lab for the technology in March.

42399173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZln,1469798090,"US Senators Seek Blockchain Guidance From CFPB, Federal Reserve","Twenty-two US senators have sent a letter to senior government officials and the Federal Reserve requesting information about the regulation and oversight of virtual currencies and blockchain tech.  In the letter dated 21st July, the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs wrote that it is seeking to ""better understand the way US regulators oversee FinTech and their relationships with federally regulated financial institutions"".  The letter was addressed to Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chair Martin Gruenberg, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency chief Thomas Curry, and National Credit Union Administration chair Rick Metsger.  The letter casts a broad net on the subject of FinTech, though it makes specific reference to blockchain technology.  It states:  ""Please describe: What your agency has done to study and understand the various types of FinTech companies involved in marketplace lending, alternative payments, consumer lending, blockchain and distributed ledger, virtual currencies…""  The letter further sought details about regulatory cooperation among international bodies on the topic of FinTech, as well as clarification on consumer protection policy.  ""These companies are changing financial services, and it is vital that the regulators and Congress understand all the impacts and take actions as appropriate,"" it urged.  Though notable for its broader take on both digital currencies and potential non-financial blockchain applications, the letter isn’t the first of its kind to emerge from Congress.  In mid-2013, the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security sent a letter to the Department of Defense seeking clarification on its then-current policies on digital currencies.  Individual senators have inked letters pursuing information – or action – on the technology as well. 2014 saw several senators contact the US government to seek information on the subject, and in the case of Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an outright ban on bitcoin.
