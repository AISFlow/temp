42397264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4XS,1380046704,Why bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be,"Anonymity and the internet has had a long intertwined history. It used to be that being able to operate without anyone knowing who you are was one of the key doctrines of the internet.  Today, with technologies like IP-based geolocation, it is harder to casually remain unknown. This is especially true if someone puts forth the effort to find out who you are. Yet at the same time, users can shield themselves with the likes of Tor, which can mask a person’s identity using redirection with relays.  It is with this premise that we segue into the topic of bitcoins and anonymity. While many have proclaimed that bitcoin is not anonymous, illicit marketplaces like the Silk Road seem to thrive, unobstructed. That’s because those who are selling goods on the Silk Road are actually able to use bitcoin to their advantage, going above and beyond the basics of a transaction to further obscure who they are at the behest of law enforcement.  Bitcoin eliminates the need for third-party trust  One basic aspect of bitcoin is that it circumvents the need for third party trust by using the public ledger know as the block chain.  In traditional banking scenarios, parties rely on banks to operate as the third party. The bitcoin network doesn’t rely on third parties, which means the a casual user’s spending can be tracked with a bit of work.  In fact, researchers have been able to prove this theory by following addresses and their spending on the block chain. It takes work, but it can be done.  How private bitcoin can be is best exemplified by email communication: while it is possible to encrypt email using such technologies as PGP, sending emails via something like Gmail isn't quite as private.  The contents of web-based email are being scanned and monitored. Google, for example, is currently fighting in court to continue their ""automated processing"" of emails.  Email is not anonymous. But it can be if you put some work into it.  CoinJoin  One example of how bitcoin users can hide their spending habits is through something called CoinJoin.  Developers Amir Taaki and Pablo Martin have taken a concept that was originally developed by Gregory Maxwell and created a simple to use system that does not require additional extensions that other solutions such as Zerocoin require.  Users can download the software and join a “session”, a sort of conversation thread whereby a group of users come together and mix bitcoin inputs together. It brings to the table the idea of “trustless mixing”, which completely turns the idea of trust on its head. This is because even with regular bitcoin mixing, you still have to rely on a third party.  When I asked him about CoinJoin, Taaki himself takes the banking establishment to task, bringing us back to that problematic aspect of another party being involved in transactions.  “We have one scenario where the standard (banking) is bloated with tons of features”, he says. “It's difficult and costly, requiring huge investments of time, energy and manpower to implement. Development is centralized, and diversity is costly.”  It’s clear that Taaki’s intent with CoinJoin isn’t just based on wanting anonymity, but on mistrust in the banking system's attitude towards digital currencies. “The monopoly starts steering the ship by introducing their own extensions for the benefit of bitcoin corporations, and not the users, businesses or black market.”  Undermining legitimacy  Bitcoin users that engage in illegal activity using consumer services such as Bitstamp or Coinbase face serious problems if they think that they can avoid law enforcement.  These companies are focused on remaining compliant with the law in order to do business, and as such they use personally identifiable verification processes that can reveal who they are under the auspices of a court order.  What’s interesting to note about this is that the companies mentioned above are doing their best to promote the positives of bitcoin as a legitimate currency.  Yet these firms are consistently being undermined in the marketplace by entities such as Black Market Reloaded that utilizes mixing or other obfuscation methods.  Andy Zinsser, who is working on his own bitcoin startup called Arbiter for mobile betting transactions, doesn’t seem perturbed about illegal purchases being made with bitcoins.  “The Silk Road is excellent evidence of bitcoin's ability to move money better than any other medium,” says Zinsser. “Other industries should learn from Silk Road. Businesses that operate outside the constraints of regulation and status quo are always the first to adopt innovative technology. This has been true for porn in the video industry. This is true for contraband in the bitcoin community.”  Putting it all together  While it is possible to track bitcoin users, it’s not easy. Despite reports of researchers being able to follow the digital money trail, law enforcement appears to be woefully behind in terms of tracking bitcoin. So far, the Drug Enforcement Agency has seized bitcoins in a South Carolina drug-related case, but there have been no reports yet of seizures related to bitcoin-based digital black markets.  Taaki, the CoinJoin developer, is even more definitive on this subject. “Think of all the people buying drugs on the Silk Road”, he says. “None of these academic journals has managed to unmask anyone. We can also make it more anonymous over time by deploying better tools for the people.”  Indeed, it might make more sense for a researcher to try and uncover someone purchasing black market goods without any prior information on that person.  There are legal ramifications to doing something like this, which may be why this hasn’t been done publicly yet. In the end, even if it is possible to trace transactions to illegal activities, there will be those out there with libertarian and privacy motivations to continue developing anonymizing solutions for digital currencies.  How do you feel about bitcoin and anonymity? Do you think that being able to use bitcoins to acquire illegal products and services is a problem, or a path forward?",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/24/why-bitcoin-is-as-anonymous-as-you-want-it-to-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c90540e612f8243202427a1b05af7579fbd584cb-1000x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397259,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4SX,1380034272,Bitcoin exchange BTC China temporarily halts trading fees,"BTC China has become the world's first major bitcoin exchange to scrap its trading commission fees, albeit temporarily.  The company, which launched in June 2011, was charging 0.3% for all trades made on the site before taking the decision to run a promotion eliminating this fee.  ""We already deliver an outstanding consumer experience, and with this promotion, we will now also offer superb value. The future is bright, for bitcoin in China,"" said Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China.  He explained the promotion will continue to run over the Chinese National Day holiday, but could not confirm its end date.  The halting of trading commission fees follows the company's decision to scrap deposit fees in July, which Lee said was to encourage further bitcoin adoption in China.  ""We think China can become a healthy market for bitcoin, so we want to take this opportunity to cement our position as the top exchange in China, and one of the top globally,"" he added.

He puts his own company's success down to its long-term focus.  ""From the beginning, we have put emphasis on security, high performance, and ease-of-use,"" he explained, adding:    ""In China, we remain the leading exchange because of the market depth and huge liquidity in our market.      This all stems from our large customer base, the biggest in China. We have their trust, and we provide them with great customer service.""    Lee said that, regardless of the fact the site only allows users to buy and sell in the native Chinese currency, it has been climbing the worldwide bitcoin exchange rankings. Currently, BTC China is ranked at number three in terms of the highest volume of bitcoin transactions processed, overtaking BTC-e.  Bitcoin regulation in China  Compared to other governments, China's has been very quiet on the subject of bitcoin, but Lee believes this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  ""The Chinese government has much bigger responsibilities and many more important things to attend to. As with all new technologies and developments in China, I think the government is taking a prudent approach; they are waiting a bit, and watching to see how it develops,"" he added.  Lee believes it is only a matter of time before bitcoin is regulated not only in China, but across the world and said his company is looking forward to working with the Chinese government to devise local regulation.  Bitcoin popularity  Lee thinks bitcoin has the opportunity to really take off in China and said the country already has a ""healthy appetite"" for it. ""With a strong history and culture in savings, the Chinese people intuitively understand the fundamental properties of a limited-supply digital asset.""  He added:  ""For the first time in human history, bitcoin has allowed people to save and defer purchasing power, in a digital form. The Chinese people love this concept! It explains bitcoin's fast adoption in China this year – 2013 has been a breakout year for bitcoin, and even more so in China.""  So far this year, according to data on SourceForge, China is only second to the US in terms of the volume of downloads of the original bitcoin client (Bitcoin-Qt). Some 248,105 downloads of Bitcoin-Qt have taken place in China, compared with 485,186 in the US and 103,548 in the UK.  Lee said bitcoins are being used differently in China than they are in the West. In his opinion, the western world seems to be putting a focus on bitcoin as a payment system, so merchant acceptance is used as a key metric for how bitcoin is succeeding.  In China, however, the digital currency's popularity is somewhat harder to measure as bitcoin is seen as more of an asset class and an investment vehicle that allows people to protect their money from inflation.  ""That partially explains why trading of bitcoin has gone up in China over the past six months. We expect to see volumes to pick up over the coming months and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day bitcoin trading volume in [Chinese currency] RMB overtakes the volume traded in US dollars,"" Lee said.  He even thinks this could happen within the next year or so, resulting in the price per bitcoin being listed primarily in RMB on bitcoin charting and price sites (and perhaps even CoinDesk's own BPI).  Do you think this is likely to happen?

42397253,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Ob,1380018376,Bitcoin payment processor GoCoin to ride Singapore's wave,"As Singapore's growth continues to challenge the world's other financial services hubs, it's also attracting bitcoin entrepreneurs who see it as fertile ground for a more disruptive kind of innovation.  Singapore's unique position  as a fully independent city-state in the middle of Asia has served it well over the past few decades.  Both policy decisions and geopolitical fortune have seen it achieve one of Asia's highest standards of living, a high concentration of millionaires, and $450 billion in offshore assets under management (half of which are from China).  Expats have long flocked to Singapore from Commonwealth countries, but new and wealthy communities have begun to arrive from places like Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States.  They're here for the money and tropical lifestyle, fleeing dormant economies and more forbidding regulatory environments back home - and have brought Singapore's foreign resident population to 2 million of its total 5.5 million.  Add to that a thriving IT industry covering hardware production, education and Asia's most active network of startup incubators, and bitcoin enthusiasts are taking note.  Steve Beauregard is the Founder & CEO of GoCoin, a startup bitcoin payment processor founded in April 2013 with a private beta launching after the end of summer.  The Californian arrived in Singapore just a few weeks ago and plans to settle for good once he can relocate his family.  Though local customers are not the company's primary target for now, GoCoin will be based in Singapore with plans to draw from the growing pool of local IT talent and be central to large regional populations of underbanked people.  ""Unlike California, the Singapore government is very efficient and pro-business. They have many startup incubation schemes which are perfect for early-stage companies looking for a leg up,"" said Beauregard.  ""It's a strategic initiative to not only launch where our competition isn't but to domicile in a progressive country, where innovations like bitcoin are encouraged and not stymied by legal subpoenas from both state and federal levels struggling to understand what is evolving.""  GoCoin plans to innovate in the bitcoin payment processing sector by opening its API and allowing eCommerce developers to fully integrate with it. In the spirit of open systems and the trust economy, GoCoin will keep ""no special powers"" and further provide a built-in reputation management system.  ""With bitcoin payments being final, we see the merchant rating system as critical to providing a fair gateway platform,"" Beauregard said.  The Singaporean bitcoin meetup he co-hosted last week was impressive in the number of attendees and, while it didn't have the ""big guns"" of the bitcoin ecosystem found at his Los Angeles gathering, he found the group had a passion and technological depth equivalent to those across the Pacific.  As a US citizen, Beauregard has been taken aback by international finance's newfound reluctance to deal with Americans. That reluctance has included both bitcoin exchanges and regular Asian banks.  ""I've now sent seven different ID documents to Mt. Gox and they still will not verify my account,"" he said. ""And the banks here in Singapore were quite open telling me to my face, 'We don't open accounts for American citizens.'""  There's no guarantee that Singapore's own regulators will be any kinder to bitcoin in the long run. Indeed, just this week the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned bitcoin traders to ""be wary"" of the currency due to an inability to identify individuals behind transactions.  That warning sounds tame compared to other countries' pronouncements questioning bitcoin's very legality, however, and MAS has not yet announced any plans to regulate bitcoin.  In fact they have taken a more positive stance than their statement suggests, treating bitcoin like any closed virtual currency.  There is also the question of whether a jurisdiction so heavily associated with traditional financial services will embrace such a new form of currency or asset without any backlash.  Big government and big finance aside, the number of small traders accepting bitcoin in Singapore is growing thanks to its active IT sector.  GoCoin has signed up ""about a dozen"" merchants internationally for its initial private beta, mostly companies well familiar with bitcoin like mining hardware vendors, and also other hardware, software and gadget vendors.  ""They were some of the easiest software sales I've ever made, and I've been in this industry for 20 years,"" Beauregard said. ""We said 'minimal fees, no chargebacks,' and it was like 'where do I sign?'""  Convincing other industries to jump on board may be as challenging as bringing the traditional financial sector into the bitcoin world.  ""It'll be a long grind I know, but I'd love to go after telcos, for that time in the future when you're all carrying bitcoin around on a mobile phone.""
