42402667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbydb,1551986102,Fidelity Crypto Chief Says Hard Fork May Delay Firm's Support for Ethereum,"Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS) will take its time about adding support for ethereum, the executive in charge of the new platform said.  The digital asset trading and custody branch of Fidelity Investments, which went live this quarter, has developed an internal framework for evaluating any cryptocurrencies that may be added in the future, according to FDAS president Tom Jessop.  While Jessop has previously said FDAS might look to add ether and other cryptocurrencies, he told CoinDesk Thursday that the process to do so may not be cut-and-dried.  “We’re currently supporting bitcoin, we have designs to support other coins over the balance of the year center to various criteria including our [in-house selection framework], where we obviously look … at client demand and other things,” he said.  This framework looks at how decentralized a coin is, what the client demand looks like and whether there are any “peculiarities about the protocol” which would make it difficult to launch or continue to support a given cryptocurrency on FDAS’ platform.  And, so far at least, client demand has correlated tightly with market capitalization, Jessop said.  “We will probably go in market cap order, that’s where the demand is but it doesn’t mean that we will list every coin,” he said. “There may be reasons why we [won’t list] a coin that have nothing to do with quite frankly client [demand].”  As one example, Jessop pointed to ethereum, currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He explained:  “We’d love to have support [for] ether but you know you have a hard fork coming up and some upgrades, so I think we’re trying to see how those things work out before we make a decision to put them on the platform.”  The recent Constantinople hard fork implemented a number of upgrades to ethereum, including lowering the ether block reward, as well as a few other technical changes; another one called Istanbul is tentatively expected in October.  Part of the challenge is in ensuring that FDAS can protect investors, Jessop said. He cited another cryptocurrency, ethereum classic, as an example of a project that would require an in-depth risk assessment due to the 51 percent attack the protocol suffered earlier this year.  Jessop did not provide any sort of timeline for when new assets might be added to the platform.  Goals for 2019  Looking ahead, Jessop said FDAS plans to scale its business over the rest of 2019, and wants to cover 90 percent of its market in the U.S. by the end of the year.  This scaling will include both securing regulatory approvals, such as money service business licences, as well as continuing to work out any possible bugs in the platform at present.  ""Despite crypto winter, the market is still pretty robust and so we're excited about that,"" he said, adding:  ""The [goal for the] rest of the year is scale the business in terms of adding new clients [and] expanding the scope for offering trading execution services ... we can we say we’re live [but] it's also a function honestly of where we have jurisdictional authority to operate.""  While Jessop declined to say which states FDAS currently has licenses in – or even how many – he said it is ""a reasonable number,"" and the firm is continuing to work on acquiring licenses through the rest of the year.  ""We're still in the process of collecting licenses to do business in multiple jurisdictions,"" he said, but ""we're very encouraged [by] the progress we've made so far.""  Moreover, he added, ""we continue to pursue status as a qualified custodian and … that’s still in sight for this year and it's really been a priority we have.""  While FDAS is looking to secure state-level licenses, Jessop did note that the company is prioritizing the states which have larger market shares, rather than focusing on every state at once.  Client interest  Fidelity has seen ""a significant amount of demand"" since its announcement in October, Jessop told CoinDesk, with a wide variety of firms expressing interest: everyone from dedicated crypto funds to hedge funds, family offices, intermediaries and even individuals looking to launch their own private fund products based on crypto have reached out.  FDAS has also received interest from exchanges hoping to offer clients custody through Fidelity, Jessop said.  ""I know in terms of [assets under management] ... it's anywhere from like low single-digit millions up to tens if not hundreds of millions,"" he said of the potential business from this channel.  The company surveyed various types of funds as well, finding that interest in crypto investment has remained ""consistent"" across the different types. Jessop explained:  ""We've still seen consistent interest from institutions, I think largely because institutions have been doing their homework and returned to understand the space, and quite frankly wouldn't make a decision to invest at any price until they really understood their own personal [investment] theses.""  Included in Fidelity's survey were some number of pension funds, and while some have asked questions about allocating capital, Jessop said he does not see any others actually committing funds to the asset class (apart from a previously announced investment by a Virginia county retirement fund in a Morgan Creek vehicle).

42402669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyfZ,1551984949,MakerDAO Token Holders Approve Fee Increase for Ethereum Stablecoin,"UPDATE: MakerDAO token holders have now voted to increase the DAI Stability Fee to 3.5 percent.    ––––––––    After a four-day vote open to all token holders, users of MakerDAO's dollar-pegged, ethereum stablecoin DAI have voted to increase the costs associated with its primary service – programmatic lending.  Finalized Thursday, the first round of voting will put in motion another vote to raise the “DAI Stability Fee"" that would increase this cost to users to 3.5 percent, up from 1.5 percent today, pending what appear to be administrative measures.  Notably, token holders voted overwhelmingly to support the fee increase, promoted by project leaders as a way to fix what has been described as a liquidity issue stemming from an influx of new borrowers using the protocol. Launched in 2017, MakerDAO allows users to effectively take out loans in its own stablecoin (DAI) with the blockchain acting as both a lender and counterparty to the deal.  With a market capitalization of over $600 million, the MKR token is one of the top 20 ranking cryptocurrencies with a total of 1 million tokens circulating in supply, according to CoinMarketCap.  In total, over 42,000 MKR tokens (or 4 percent of that supply) were cast in favor of this fee hike, in comparison to just 9 MKR tokens against. Unlike DAI tokens, MKR tokens are strictly held by users for the purposes of casting votes and paying fees – such as the DAI Stability Fee – to help collateralize the broader stablecoin system overseen by the MakerDAO Foundation. Only about 4 percent of tokens appear to have been allocated in the vote.  ""There seemed to be a tremendous support for that decision. Within 24 hours, we saw over 40,000 MKR in support...We saw 9 MKR staked in opposition,"" Richard Brown, head of community development at the MakerDAO Foundation, said. ""With any kind of voting system – similar to stakeholder votes – signaling disagreement even in the face of overwhelming opposition is important.""  The move comes on the heels of a similar vote just last month to increase fees, and today's vote marks the third time in total that the protocol's users have so far elected to increase costs.  The key factors behind this decision as stated in the proposal description include the fact that DAI's exchange price has persistently hovered below one $1 and “high inventory levels among market makers and prop desks.”  Calling the DAI stablecoin ""the biggest step in the right direction since the dollar was moved off the Gold Standard,"" founder of ConnextNetwork, Arjun Bhuptani, told CoinDesk that despite the fee raises his bullish views on the cryptocurrency were unwavering.  ""The goal of something like DAI is to not have to put your trust in the system,"" said Bhuptani. ""Obviously, it will be some time before the economics of it are validated, before people understand how this stuff works ... [But] this is what people should hope for – this level of transparency in where their currency comes from.""  As for steps forward now that initial polling has concluded, MKR token holders will now move into a period of ""executive voting."" During this period, users stake their MKR tokens in support of the proposed fee change again. Only this time as soon as the amount of staked MKR exceeds the number originally staked in support of the fee hike – that is 42,556.94 MKR – the change can then be automatically executed by any user in its distributed network.  As highlighted by Brown during a community call today:  ""The voting mechanism needs continuous approval... Anybody can actually execute that change in the system once we've tipped the balance into the new state.""  What's ahead  Once this round of executive voting ends, Cyrus Younessi, risk management lead at the MakerDAO Foundation, a non-profit supporting its development, explained the hope is for a quick impact in stabilizing DAI's dollar peg.  At the same time, he warned that those working on the MakerDAO Risk Management Team “are preparing for the fact that might not happen,” highlighting two other “remaining scenarios.”  Speaking on the community call, Younessi posited: ""One, [we] we see a small but noticeable change, some upward pressure, but not all the way. The suggestion would [then] be to keep the cadence going … Schedule another 2 percent [fee increase].""  The other is the possibility there could be no impact on the DAI to dollar peg, Younessi continued. In which case, he suggested there could be “more forceful options"" used, such as a potential 3 or 4 percent DAI Stability Fee increase.  In any case, in either of these last two scenarios, Younessi said there would be the need for new governance polling similar to how today’s was carried out and concluded.  “The next governance poll could include multiple options to better gauge a more variety of different opinions,” suggested Younessi during today’s call.

42402662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyWi,1551978005,Ex-Bitmain Bitcoin Cash Staffers Form Startup to Lend and Trade Crypto,"Former employees of cryptocurrency mining and manufacturing giant Bitmain who focused on bitcoin cash development are planning a new startup that will offer crypto financing-related services, CoinDesk has learned.  According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, the former employees include those from the mining giant’s Copernicus project that was impacted by a company-wide layoff last year.  The sources said the former Bitmain team members are planning to launch a new firm that will provide services such as cryptocurrency custody, over-the-counter (OTC) trading and crypto lending.  One of the sources said it’s known in the industry that there have been two camps inside Bitmain – one aligned with co-founder Jihan Wu that focuses on blockchain and bitcoin cash development and the other with co-founder Micree Zhan that designs crypto mining chips.  And the team forming the new startup mostly comes from Wu’s old crew, the source added, including those from Copernicus, a project Bitmain rolled out in 2018 to boost development for bitcoin cash and the wormhole protocol. The project has had no technical updates on Github since December of last year amid the company-wide layoffs.  It is unclear how many former Bitmain employees will be involved in the new venture at this stage. A second source told CoinDesk it may also have the name of Yuesheng Ge, a major shareholder of Bitmain, on the new firm’s incorporation paper, but not Wu's name. And the first source indicated it’s known that Ge has long been aligned with Wu in Bitmain’s operations.  A Chinese media outlet previously reported that former Bitmain employees are launching a new startup called Matrix but did not provide details about what the firm aims to do. The report also said Wu may take charge of the project in the future while Ge will serve as the new company’s CEO in the meantime.  A spokesperson for Bitmain said “no comment” when contacted by CoinDesk regarding the former staff’s plan and potential involvement of the company’s two major shareholders, Ge and Wu. However, the spokesperson said Wu will not be leaving Bitmain.  IPO pending  According to the initial public offering prospectus (IPO) Bitmain filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) on Sept. 26, 2018, Ge owns about four percent of the firm’s total shares and was listed as an executive director of the board and principal of investment.  In November, a business registration change indicated Ge and Wu had both left the board of Beijing Bitmain Technology, a subsidiary of BitMain Technology Holding Limited, the entity that’s applying for the IPO.  Another source familiar with Bitmain’s IPO process told CoinDesk that when the firm updated its financials with the HKEX in recent months, Ge remained as an executive director and there was no change to the positions of Wu and Zhan as the company’s co-CEOs.  But this source added that if Bitmain’s holding company disclosed any substantial change to its management, its IPO would almost certainly fail since the HKEX has a clear requirement for a listing applicant to maintain management continuity during its track record.  If Bitmain does not graduate to a listing hearing by March 26, six months from the initial filing, its IPO application will lapse. This has already happened for two of its mining rivals, Canaan Creative and Ebang, although the latter has filed a new application.  The HKEX is said to be reluctant to approve IPOs for these firms due to questions about the sustainability of the mining business.

42402663,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyXh,1551974417,73% of UK Consumers Say They Don’t Know What Cryptocurrency Is,"Seventy-three percent of U.K. consumers don't know what a cryptocurrency is or are unable to define it, according to a new survey from the country's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Announced  Thursday, the research indicates that those who are most aware of cryptocurrencies are likely to be men aged between 20 and 44.  The survey, which polled 2,132 British consumers in association with London-based market research firm Kantar TNS, further found that only 3 percent of those surveyed had ever bought cryptocurrencies.  Of those who had purchased, half of them spent under £200 ($263) from their “disposable income.” Bitcoin appears to be the most popular cryptocurrency, with over 50 percent purchasing the cryptocurrency, while 34 percent bought ether (ETH).  The FCA has also carried out “qualitative” research and interviews of UK consumers in association with London-based research agency Revealing Reality. They found that many consumers may not fully understand what they are purchasing, with several wanted to buy a “whole” coin, without realizing cryptocurrencies can also be bought in fractions.  “Despite this lack of understanding, the cryptoasset owners interviewed were often looking for ways to ‘get rich quick’, citing friends, acquaintances and social media influencers as key motivations for buying cryptoassets,” the FCA said.  Regarding risk to investors, the watchdog said the survey findings suggest that “currently the overall scale of harm may not be as high as previously thought.”  The FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, said:  “The results suggest that although cryptoassets may not be well understood by many consumers, the vast majority don’t buy or use them currently. Whilst the research suggests some harm to individual cryptoasset users, it does not suggest a large impact on wider society.  Even so, these are ""complex, volatile products,"" he added, and investors ""should be prepared to lose all of their money.”  Back in December 2017, FCA CEO Andrew Bailey similarly said that buying bitcoin poses similar risks to gambling and, since it is neither backed by central authorities nor regulated, the cryptocurrency is not a safe investment.  The watchdog has also warned several times on cryptocurrency derivatives products and unregistered crypto brokerage firms.  In today's announcement, the FCA added that it will consult on banning the sale of certain cryptocurrency derivatives to retail investors later this year – a ban the authority has been considering since last November.  The FCA further said that it is working with the U.K. government and the Bank of England, as part of the country's Cryptoassets Taskforce effort to form regulatory guidelines for the cryptocurrency space.

Matt Mason spent the last four years as the studio head of 1-800-N0TH1NG, described on his LinkedIn page as an ""innovation lab"" in Los Angeles funded by Sony Pictures. He left that job last month to take the newly created position at Kraken.  ""Building out the marketing function at Kraken is a critical next step for us as we continue to grow our business and expand our product offering. Matt is a marketing veteran, ready to push us into hyper-speed,"" the San Francisco-based exchange said in a blog post Thursday.  Before 1-800-N0TH1NG, whose main product was a mobile app game based on user-generated video, Mason spent almost four years at the file-sharing software firm BitTorrent, most recently as chief content officer. He is also an author of ""The Pirate’s Dilemma"" on how youth culture has changed capitalism and society.  According to Kraken, Mason began his career as a ""pirate radio and club DJ in London"" and worked at companies like Warner Music, Saatchi & Saatchi and Mediacom.  Answering CoinDesk's question about his decision to move into the crypto industry, Mason said: ""I've been interested and involved in distributed technology for much of my career, and there isn't a better brand in the crypto space than Kraken. I'm incredibly grateful I get to work with this amazing group of people.""  Kraken has made some other significant addition to its executive team over the last year.  Last April, Steve Hunt, former technology chief at Jump Trading and Goldman Sachs, joined Kraken as a vice president of engineering, followed by Nelson Minier, an ex-Credit Suisse trader who became a head of over-the-counter (OTC) sales and trading, and Mary Beth Buchanan from the law firm Bryan Cave, as a general counsel.  Bob Zagotta, former managing director at CME Group and senior strategist at the insurance broker Gallagher, joined Kraken in June as a head of business operations and strategy.

The crypto trading platform will also offer three CopyPortfolios at launch, it said, without disclosing further details.  Users can “collaborate with other crypto traders when making buying and selling decisions,” said Yoni Assia, co-founder and CEO of eToro. They can also ""adjust their trading strategies by watching and learning from others on the platform.""  The firm said any eligible customer who has an ""established"" track record ""may be copied and compensated for their performance, subject to risk analysis and supplemental evaluation.""  eToro has also launched a multi-signature crypto wallet in the U.S. that supports six cryptocurrencies at launch – bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP and Stellar (XLM) – with more to be added in the near future.

42402668,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbycc,1551967205,City of Denver to Pilot Blockchain Voting App in Coming Elections,"A U.S. city plans to utilize a blockchain system to store and track votes in its upcoming municipal elections in May.  Denver, Colorado, announced Thursday that it would implement a pilot program to allow overseas voters, active-duty military personnel and their eligible dependents to vote using a blockchain-based smartphone app in collaboration with Tusk Philanthropies and Voatz.  Voatz's technology has previously been used in West Virginia, where active-duty military personnel used the software during the state's primary and general elections in 2018.  Since its launch, the Overstock-backed startup has conducted more than 30 successful pilots, with more than 15,000 votes cast in its largest election to date.  In a statement, Jocelyn Bucaro, deputy director of elections at the Denver Office of Clerk and Recorder said the Denver Elections Division is known for making voting an easier and more transparent process for individuals through technology.  ""Participating in this pilot program fits perfectly into our mission,"" she said, adding:  ""We believe this technology has the potential to make voting easier and more secure not only for our active duty military and overseas citizens, but also for voters with disabilities, who could potentially vote independently and privately using their phones’ assistive technology.""  To participate, eligible voters must file an absentee ballot request and complete an authentication process through the Voatz mobile app. If approved, they will be able to submit their ballot between March 23 and May 7, Denver's election day.  Using the app means voters can avoid having to print and scan the paperwork they would need should they file normal absentee ballots. Further, voters will be able to confirm whether their ballot was recorded, a feature traditional absentee ballots typically lack.  The National Cybersecurity Center (NCC), which is also participating in the pilot, is ""excited to partner with the City/County of Denver, Voatz and Tusk Philanthropies,"" said NCC CEO Vance Brown.  ""This public/private partnership showcases how promoting innovative technologies, such as blockchain-based mobile voting, protects against cyber-attacks that negatively impact our world,"" he said. ""The application of blockchain in our election system provides for secure, auditable, transparent and accurate counting of ballots and the increased integrity of our election system.""  The U.S. might see more regular use of this technology should it prove to be effective, he added.

42402694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbylT,1551958220,Three Price Resistance Levels to Beat for Bitcoin's Bulls,"View  Bitcoin's bull revival, as signaled by the weekly chart indicators, is still in the nascent stage and will likely become more entrenched if and when prices clear the resistance levels at $4,190, $4,236 and $4,388.  A high volume break above the three resistance levels could be followed by a rally to highs above $5,000.  Bitcoin could challenge resistance at $4,190 in the next few days, as a strong bounce from the ascending 5-week moving average (MA) seen earlier this week has restored the short-term bullish view signaled by a bullish candlestick pattern created on Feb. 27.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  Bitcoin still needs to beat several key resistance levels to confirm a longer-term bull reversal.  The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,840 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $4,190 last week. At that level, BTC was up 34 percent from the lows near $3,100 seen in December.  With the recovery rally, a number of longer-term bitcoin price indicators like the moving average convergence divergence and the money flow index are flashing early signs of bull revival.  The trend change, however, would gain credence if and when prices establish the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high.  BTC has carved out a higher low near $3,300 in the last two months and a higher high would be confirmed above $4,236 – a bearish lower high created on Dec. 24.  So, the focus is on $4,236 and two more resistance levels – $4,190 and $4,388 – which, if breached, will generate strong bullish cues.  Let us now explore all three levels in detail.  Resistance 1: $4,190  BTC created an inverted bullish hammer candle with a high of $4,190 during the week ended Feb. 24.  That candlestick pattern occurs when the bulls test bears' resolve to keep prices lower and is widely considered an early warning of potential bullish reversal if it appears after a prolonged sell-off, as is the case with BTC.  A bullish trend change, however, would be confirmed once prices cross $4,190.  Resistance 2: $4,236  As noted earlier, a longer-term bull revival would be confirmed if prices violate the bearish lower high of $4,236 created on the Christmas day.  It is worth noting that a break above $4,236 would also confirm an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, which essentially represents a successful transition from the bearish lower high-lower low pattern to the bullish higher low-higher high pattern.  The breakout would open the doors to $5,100 (target as per the measured move method).  Resistance 3: $4,388  The cryptocurrency is still trapped in a bearish channel. The upper edge of the falling channel is currently located at $4,388. Notably, the downward sloping 50-candle MA is also located there.  A 3-day close above $4,388 would confirm twin bullish cues: a falling channel breakout implying a long-term bullish reversal and an upside break of the bearish moving average resistance. That would further raise the odds of a rally towards $5,000.  It is worth noting the probability of BTC breaching the second resistance would rise once the first resistance is scaled.  Will BTC rise to $4,190?  Bitcoin's strong bounce from the 100-week moving average witnessed earlier this week restored the short-term bullish view put forward by the ""long-tailed"" doji candle created on Feb. 27.  Further, the 5- and 10-week MAs have produced a bullish crossover for the first time since August 2018. So, a re-test of January high of $4,190 could be on the cards.  That bullish case, however, would weaken if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402661,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyUk,1551956404,ConsenSys Targets Crypto Privacy and Adoption With New Investments,"The venture capital arm of ethereum development studio ConsenSys is continuing to invest in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space with the backing of two early-stage startups.  ConsenSys Ventures announced Thursday that it invested $1.15 million investment in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography startup Ligero, while Philippines-based cryptocurrency exchange PDAX received an undisclosed sum.  Kavita Gupta, founder of ConsenSys Ventures, told CoinDesk that the PDAX funding was a “one time payment of significant amount.”  Gupta said in the announcement:  “We continue to see privacy and the accessibility of exchanges to be two of the major pain-points for broader adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology. Both of these companies are taking unique approaches to solving these problems.”  PDAX is regulated by both the central bank of the Philippines and the country’s securities regulator, and is expected to launch its platform in Q2 of this year, according to ConsenSys Ventures.  The Philippines sees a high volume of remittance inflow and “a steadily increasing percentage is being coursed through cryptocurrencies,” it added.  “Not only do we hope to enable lower cost and facilitate faster processing for remittance and other P2P [peer-to-peer] payments, but we are also seeking to address long-standing inefficiencies in the Philippine financial markets,” said PDAX co-founder and chief strategy officer Yang Yang Zhang.  Ligero, on the other hand, aims to launch a platform that will “enable private smart contracts, decentralized exchanges, and private machine learning on and off blockchains.” The firm is building a “scalable” protocol for secure multi-party computation and ZKP.  “A ZKP guarantees privacy for only one participant; if you want to collaborate on sensitive data among many actors, you need multiparty computation,” said Ligero co-founder and CTO Muthu Venkitasubramaniam.

42402659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbySm,1551952861,Blockchain Firm SETL Seeks Buyer After Filing for Insolvency,"Update (12:10 UTC, March 7): This article has been updated with statements from a SETL press release received after publication.  ---  London-based blockchain infrastructure company SETL has filed for insolvency and is looking for ""a larger financial services firm"" to take on some of its holdings.  The news – revealed in a notice of insolvency filed today with the U.K. authorities – comes as something of a shock given that, last October, the startup company was granted a license by France’s securities regulator to operate a central securities depository (CSD) system using blockchain tech.  The firm, which was co-founded by City of London trading veteran Peter Randall back in 2015, said in a statement:  “Having made an early investment in the development of ID2S [a benchmark test to meet CSD regulations], SETL Development Ltd recognises that as an early stage technology firm it is not sufficiently placed to contribute the capital required. As such it is now now seeking to place its ID2S holding with a larger financial services firm, one better placed to provide the capital required to support the growth trajectory.""  SETL added that because of the ""structural complexity and the need for a neutral party to represent the interests of all the current creditors and stakeholders"", the firm's board has appointed Quantuma LLP as an independent administrator.  Around the time SETL was granted a CSD license, former Goldman banker Philippe Morel was appointed CEO. Back in 2015, the firm hired former executive director of the Bank of England Sir David Walker as its chairman.  Sir David said in the statement: “Separating the software development business from the investments portfolio is a highly complex process, requiring expert, experienced and neutral management of the interests of all the creditors and stakeholders. The directors are all fully engaged and aligned in this approach.”  According to Crunchbase, SETL has raised a total of $39 million in funding over three rounds. Its latest investment was raised in February 2018 via a corporate round in which banks including Citi and Credit Agricole became shareholders in the company, as well as tech firm Computershare.  Randall was previously founder and CEO of equities venue Chi-X Europe, which was later sold to Cboe Global Markets. He launched SETL back in 2015 with a focus on making wholesale payments faster and more efficient using distributed ledger technology.

Republican senator Jack Tate, along with representatives Jeni James Arndt (Democratic) and Marc Catlin (Republican), filed senate bill 184 on Tuesday, proposing that the Colorado Water Institute should be granted authority to study how blockchain technology can help improve its operations.

The study would be carried out only after the institute has received enough money, and would be allowed to solicit and accept donations from private or public institutions for the purpose. The findings should later be reported to the general assembly, the lawmakers said.

While the reasons that most cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to bitcoin are not definitive, studies have shown this dependency on bitcoin’s trend has only grown stronger with time. Yet, BNB is proving different.  BNB, currently ranked eighth as per CoinMarketCap, in fact, is the only cryptocurrency out of the top 10 to post a yearly gain against the dollar. The next closest performer, Tron's TRX token, is printing a -44 percent annual loss.  Top 10 Cryptocurrencies (one year percent change)  However, this connection began to weaken for BNB/USD as 2019 began, a fact made evident by BNB/USD's performance line (orange) above, which has been deviating significantly from the other big name cryptocurrencies, effectively making it the most bullish notable outlier of the group.  BNB/USD vs. BTC/USD Performances  Indeed, BNB now seems to be charting a course of its own as it continues to significantly outperform bitcoin.  BNB/USD's year-to-date performance dwarfs that of bitcoin's, boasting a 141.7 percent increase compared to BTC's less than 4 percent increase.  BNB is outperforming on more immediate time scales as well, including the last 7- and 30-day periods in which the cryptocurrency is printing 41.47 and 99.17 percent growth respectively, compared to BTC's just 1.62 and 12.65 percent increases during the same time periods, according to data from Messari.  It's worth noting that bitcoin's recent recovery may have revived investor interest in the cryptocurrency market, boosting demand for BNB.  Given the highly correlated and immature nature of the cryptocurrency market, it’s unlikely for BNB to chart its own distinctive trend for an extended period of time, but only time will tell when BNB ceases to be an outlier.

42402660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbyVj,1551923956,Swiss Stock Exchange SIX Will Tokenize Equity on R3's Corda Blockchain,"SIX Group, the Swiss stock exchange operator, has picked R3’s Corda Enterprise platform as the underlying blockchain for the digital asset trading, settlement, and custody service it is building.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, SIX chose Corda Enterprise after spending a good deal of time kicking the tires of various distributed ledger technology (DLT) stacks, for several reasons: firstly, because the technology was designed for a highly regulated space, but also because of the flourishing open-source Corda ecosystem.  Sven Roth, the chief digital officer at SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), said the fact that Corda spans other areas beyond capital markets such as insurance and stretches to things like identity also was a factor. He told CoinDesk,  “This was very important to us because when we assessed different vendors, some of them were very focused on niche offerings and limited in their scope to very specific areas, such as post-trade for instance, and we didn't want to be limited to just that area of expertise. We assessed a lot of vendors and technology stacks – all the ones you can imagine.”  As stated back in July of last year, the goal for SDX is creating a regulated exchange platform for digital assets, starting with stocks and then exploring other tradable instruments and even growing to encompass tokenized versions of more esoteric physical assets such as fine art.  Roth said the platform, which will be launching in the second half of 2019, will begin with classical bankable assets such as equities, bonds, funds and structured products “that are directly issued on our DLT.”  “A selection of those [asset classes] will be available at launch. Then we have others living at the [central securities depository] of SIX today that then will be tokenized. We said we first want to have products that are only available on our DLT because then you don't have issues with split liquidity, with transfers between the two CSDs and so on.”  Another area of focus for SIX is the handling of so-called security token offerings (STOs). Indeed, in an interview with Reuters last month SIX chairman Romeo Lacher said the exchange plans to eat its own dog food, so to speak, by looking to raise some money itself via an STO.  A SIX representative said this was something being considered but added no further detail on those plans. Roth confirmed that a regulated boilerplate for STOs, in general, was a central plank of the project.  “As you can imagine we need some product to define the future, what we would call security token offering or initial digital offering – so what today is an IPO.”  He added that a balance has to be achieved to provide “a reasonable MVP [minimum viable product], but not go overboard on what will be available at launch.”  Getting real  The selection of Corda Enterprise, the paid-for version of the platform as opposed to the open source Corda, is a significant win for R3, coming on the heels of last week's news that blockchain builder MonetaGo had switched its underlying architecture from Hyperledger Fabric to Corda.  Speaking of the SIX deal, Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3 said,  “The first thing that's important is the fact that a mainstream influential financial market infrastructure player has decided to launch an exchange for digital assets and do it on blockchain technology.”  Cooper went on to say the deal is a validation for Corda's built-for-business approach, adding, “For these platforms to work for highly complex and heavily regulated markets and participants, you can't take a traditional old style public version of blockchain and try to retrofit it to handle enterprise needs around privacy and scalability.”  The first commercial licensing of Corda Enterprise was last year with Dutch bank ING, but this is the first sale to a financial market infrastructure (FMI) provider, noted Cooper.  (Another in the offing could come out of a recent proof of concept with SWIFT, integrating the Corda Settler application, an open source payments engine built by R3.)  Neither will it be the first time Corda has been used to tokenize equities. This was done by European collateral lending platform HQLAx which is now working closely with Deutsche Borse.  Cooper pointed out that many R3 members and investors are also SIX stock exchange trading members and ready to leverage the combined technologies.  That list includes ABN AMRO, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, CS Affiliates, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Natixis, RBC, SocGen and UBS.  Summing up, Cooper framed R3 landing SIX as a vindication for enterprise DLT in general – though he couldn't resist taking an implicit jab at competitors, concluding:  “You hear rumblings in the industry – is this real?
