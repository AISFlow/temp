42379791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KfA5,1502823693,S&P 500 or Cryptocurrency: Just How Big Is Bitcoin's Price Explosion?,"While bitcoin is down several hundred dollars since hitting its all-time high of $4,483.55 earlier today, the cryptocurrency is still on an absolute tear this year.  Bitcoin's ascent viewed over a longer time horizon is impressive. On a year-over-year basis, its value has risen about 600 percent. In the last 100 days, it's seen 150 percent gains. Six months ago, bitcoin was trading just above the $1,000 mark – so even with the recent drop, its price has more than quadrupled in the last six months.  Gains at those levels sound massive – but just how big are they? Compared to investments in other asset classes, how well is bitcoin faring? And, as this afternoon's price declines allude to, are the downside risks understood?  One way to try to flesh out answers is to compare stock market returns with the returns on bitcoin.  Against the S&P 500  A fair place to begin measuring traditional stock market returns is the S&P 500 Index, which professional investors typically use as a benchmark to track their investments.  As a baseline way of thinking about the rise in the price of bitcoin consider this: Over the last 90 years, the average annual rate of return on the S&P 500 index has been just 9.8 percent.  If we compare bitcoin's performance this year to the average return of the S&P 500, it's immediately clear bitcoin's moonshot rise has outperformed this benchmark by a stratospheric 6,000 percent.  For a slightly different proxy of price movement, let's take a look at how long it took the S&P 500 to double in value to its current level. At press time, the S&P 500 Index is trading around 2,466. Cutting that number in half, we get 1,233.  The last time the S&P 500 traded below that level was August of 2010. So it took the S&P 500 almost seven years to double – 30 times longer than it took bitcoin to do the same.  Against equities  Bitcoin's performance is also quite impressive when analyzing it against equities by sector.  For instance, the top three equities sectors by performance over the last year have been Financial, Technology and Industrials.  For the sake of argument, let's just say you were able to divine that these three sectors were the ones to invest in. The rate of return in S&P Sector Tracker Spyder ETFs, which serve as a proxy for the underlying stocks over the last 12 months, have been 29.5 percent for Financials, 23 percent for Technology and 17.1 percent for Industrials.  So, on a 12-month basis, even if you were lucky enough to pick the top performing sector, bitcoin outperformed the sector ETF by about a 20 fold.  And that outperformance assumes that you picked the best performing sectors to invest in. If an investor had instead picked other sectors, such as Energy and Real Estate, which were the two worst performing sectors over the last 12 months, they would have actually lost 7.2% and 4.1%, respectively, as of press time today.  The downside risks  While the case for bitcoin may sound very bullish when you're just looking at recent returns, there are potentially very large downside risks to investing in bitcoin – and, in this sense, bitcoin's very nature makes it quite challenging to compare it to stocks in an apples-to-apples way.  One of the virtues of investing broadly in stocks via the S&P 500 Index is diversification.  The S&P 500 is made up of a basket of 500 companies, comprising many of the largest publicly traded corporations in America.  The stocks in the S&P 500 are drawn from 11 different sectors across 24 different industry groups. That kind of diversification means people are shielded, in large measure, from risks to any one company and, to a lesser extent, shielded from risks to any one industry group or market sector.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an investment in a single asset. In a certain sense, investing in bitcoin is roughly analogous to investing in a single stock.  Although that metaphor probably doesn't go far enough, still. What you're really investing in is a single implementation of one technology, a single instance of code.  This means that investing in bitcoin rather than the S&P massively concentrates your risk, and as we've seen today, that risk can equate to hundreds of dollars per bitcoin.  That's not to say, though, that investing in the S&P 500 with all its diversification ensures investors won't lose money.  Investors can and do lose money investing in stocks – even when they diversify their risks by investing broadly in an index like the S&P 500.  In the last 89 years, the S&P 500 went down on a yearly basis two dozen times. The worst year stock investors suffered in the last nine decades was in 1931, during the Great Depression, when the S&P 500 lost nearly 44 percent. More recently, in 2008, during the depths of The Great Recession, the S&P 500 suffered its second worst loss of all time, dropping 36.5 percent.  Proceed with caution  Bitcoin has only been in existence since 2009. Moreover, it's interest as an investment vehicle was really only established in early 2013, when it hit $266 after a price rally where its value was growing between 5 percent and 10 percent daily.  The one thing we can say for certain about bitcoin is that it does not possess a long enough track record for investors to understand the long-term historical price patterns in the same way they understand the directional swings of the S&P 500.  That absence of historical data, if nothing else, should signal to investors and potential investors to be wary.  Bitcoin and blockchain are exciting technologies – but investors should not lose their heads.

42379781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kf1H,1502820060,$45 Million: Ukrainian Lawmakers Reveal Big Bitcoin Holdings,"Recent disclosures by members of Ukraine's national legislature revealed that three lawmakers have a combined wealth in bitcoin of more than $45 million.  According to a report from RIA Novosti, Russia's international news service, the three lawmakers are all members of the ""Petro Poroshenko Block,"" which constitutes the largest grouping of legislators within the Parliament.  Of the three named by the report, Dmitry Golubov possesses the most bitcoin: 8,752 BTC, an amount worth roughly $36 million at current prices. Alexander Urbansky possesses 2,494 BTC while Dmitry Belotserkovets owns 398 BTC, worth approximately $10 million and $1.6 million, respectively.  The disclosures come as Ukraine inches toward regulating the cryptocurrency.  As reported previously, the National Bank of Ukraine – the country's central bank – revealed last week that the legal implications of cryptocurrencies will be discussed at the next meeting of the Financial Stability Board of Ukraine. That hearing, scheduled for the end of August, will bring together the nation's financial authorities.  It's unclear at this time exactly what steps the government will ultimately take. Local sources reported last week that a large cache of bitcoin mining machines were confiscated after authorities discovered at a state-owned facility.  And while officials determine how they intend to regulate bitcoin, some agencies have moved to begin testing how blockchain might be applied more broadly to their offices. For example, work has begun on a new land registry powered by blockchain, with a formal trial commencing in October.

15990214,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/price-bitcoin-reaches-record-high,1502815772,Price Of Bitcoin Reaches Record High!,"Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoins reached an all-time high. For the first time ever, they broke through the $4,000 mark on Sunday, and continued to rise throughout the whole of Monday, and the beginning of Tuesday morning, before eventually peaking at $4,339.79. Quite a big weekend for Bitcoin. Although the peak seems to have been halted for now, Goldman Sachs’ believes that Bitcoins really is a cryptocurrency to keep a watch of this coming week, believing that it could rise as high as $4,827 in the short term. They are describing this rise as the currency rising a ‘fifth wave’ of an ‘impulsive’ rally. In one weekend, the price of Bitcoins actually quadrupled in value for the year; however, it has been warned that because of the five-wave sequence, you should expect the market to enter a corrective phase, which will in turn see a dip in the price of Bitcoins. Experts say that the corrective phase would normally last at least one-third of the time that it took to complete the advance, and should retrace at least 38.2 percent on the entire move, which would therefore take Bitcoins value down to $2,221, based on the current figures shown above. So, although it is likely that some investors would have seen an increase in profit, based on the fifth wave theory, this would not be expected to last. However; of course, we should not base everything on the prediction of one analysis. Others are in fact predicting that Bitcoin will continue to grow over the next few years, with some analysts predicting that it could climb into the tens of thousands. This would definitely see an increase in profits to investors. The reason for this favourable prediction is that in recent years, Bitcoin popularity has grown considerably, and they believe that it will be this interest combined with a limited circulation of 21 million coins that will naturally drive the prices higher. Although it is still very early days, the same could not be said for Bitcoin Cash, which was the cryptocurrency that was split off from Bitcoin at the start of this month, which saw a loss in value.

42379771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KenR,1502815534,"Prosecutors: Rogue Silk Road Agent Stole 1,600 BTC After 2015 Guilty Plea","New charges have been filed against a former Secret Service agent who previously pled guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin during the US government’s Silk Road investigation.  Shaun Bridges, as reported by CoinDesk, was sentenced to nearly six years in prison in late 2015 after pleading guilty to money laundering and wire fraud charges. The case dates back the investigation of the Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market that was the target of a multi-agency crackdown. Its creator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison two years later.  Bridges, along with another agent involved in the Silk Road investigation, was later arrested and charged after he allegedly went rogue during that period. The development was a controversial one at the time, given that information about it was withheld during Ulbricht's trial.  Yet after he plead guilty and was sentenced in 2015, Bridges was arrested in February 2016 as he tried to leave the US before beginning his prison term. The US government revealed in subsequent court filings that it believed Bridges stole additional Silk Road funds using private keys he obtained during the investigation.  According to new court documents filed yesterday, Bridges stole 1606.6488 BTC, an amount worth roughly $6.5 million at current prices. At the time of the alleged theft – in late July 2015, just after he had agreed to plead guilty – those holdings were worth around $470,000 given that bitcoin was trading at about $294.  After taking control of the funds, prosecutors have alleged, Bridges deposited them on BTC-e, the long-running bitcoin exchange that was shut down earlier this month following a crackdown by US authorities.  Court documents list 19 different bitcoin transactions, including one deposit of 605 BTC on bitcoin exchange Bitfinex in November 2015.  If convicted, Bridges could receive as many as 10 years in prison, as well as a $250,000 fine.

42379776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Keuz,1502811906,"Ripple Confirms China Expansion Plans, Shoots Down Alibaba Rumor","Ripple is opening up about its plans to enter one of the world's largest markets.  In new statements to CoinDesk, the San Francisco blockchain startup aimed to address rumors that first appeared last Thursday on XRP Chat, a forum dedicated to gossip and commentary on both the company and its technology.  In short – yes, the blockchain company is planning to set up operations in China, but no, it's not doing so with the help of one of the region's e-commerce giants.  Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's director of joint venture partnership, told CoinDesk:  ""China is a key market for a global payments network, which is why we are looking to build a presence there. Total cross-border [business-to-business] payment value involving China is $5 trillion annually, and the large Chinese e-commerce market currently lacks a highly efficient and low-cost solution.""  Most recently, Ripple added 10 new financial institutions to its blockchain network, including MUFG in Japan, BBVA in Spain and SEB in Sweden, but membership by Chinese firms has so far been absent.  And it appears it will have to keep working on adding a big name from China to that impressive list of collaborators. Ripple also put to rest speculation that Alibaba was already running a validator node on the Ripple network.  Images in the post showed a node that appeared to be operating in Hangzhou, China, with an address linking it to Alibaba Advertising Co., Ltd.  This led some to believe the Chinese mammoth would help Ripple maneuver its way into the country, though a Ripple spokesperson said such an effort is not in the works:  ""Alibaba (the company) is not running a validator.""

42379790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kf8p,1502805590,Blockstream Is Using Satellites to Beam Bitcoin Down to Earth,"Sounds fantastical? Maybe, but Blockstream swears it isn't as crazy as it sounds.  Today, the bitcoin infrastructure company is launching Blockstream Satellite, an ambitious attempt to use leased satellites to beam bitcoin nearly anywhere in the world. Now in beta, bitcoin users in Africa, Europe, South America and North America can already use the satellites to download a working bitcoin node capable of storing the network's entire transaction history.  But while complex conceptually, the company believes its end result can solve a real issue facing the $66 billion network – without internet, you can't access bitcoin.  And this poses a problem for bitcoin proponents who believe the cryptocurrency could be especially beneficial to people without internet, who also generally live in areas with economic instability.  So, Blockstream decided to set its sights on a solution, and found it in space.  According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the project is all about putting bitcoin into the hands of those who ""desperately need"" it.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There is some coincidence between countries with poor internet infrastructure and unstable currencies. The people who are in direct need of bitcoin are those who currently have unstable access to bitcoin. This project will address that problem, and, we hope, will allow many more people to use bitcoin.""  While running a full node is a cumbersome process, it's nonetheless the most secure and trustless way of using the digital currency, and for individuals dealing with political and economic instability, this process could prove crucial.  But because full nodes require an Internet connection and 160 GB of free space, they are a rarity in some regions of the world. There's allegedly only one man running a full node in all of West Africa, for example.  While Blockstream is now taking care of a way to download a full node, there are a few other choice technologies those that want to take advantage of the satellite will need.  Users will need a small satellite dish – if they already have a TV satellite, they could use that – and a USB to connect the satellite to a personal computer or a piece of dedicated computer hardware such as a Raspberry Pi. The rest can be accessed through free, open-source software, such as GNU Radio for establishing a radio connection.  ""The cost to entry is extremely low,"" said Blockstream's head of satellite, Chris Cook. According to him, the package of equipment costs ""a little under $100.""  Then, once users have those tools, they can pull bitcoin blocks from the satellite, building a bitcoin full node.  Cheaper technology  But while they'll now be running a full node, it still takes some sort of Internet connection to make transactions over the network.  While many users in the areas Blockstream is targeting won't be able to afford mobile data connection plans to initiate transactions, Back argued cheaper communications technologies, such as SMS or bi-directional satellite, could be used instead.  Transactions, he said, take up about 250 bytes, which wouldn't cost more than one penny to transfer using such technologies.  In this way, Back's vision of the satellite as bringing bitcoin even to people completely off-the-grid is theoretically possible. He offered the example of a small hut on the side of the road in the Sahara Desert in Africa, adding:  ""With a perpetual generator out back with a satellite dish, a Raspberry Pi by the generator, a local wi-fi hot spot, and the necessary software set up, you could be transacting globally with bitcoin.""  Sounds like a lot, but Back argued that it would be pretty cheap, especially if costs are pooled between multiple people, like if an entire village shared the costs of setting up the infrastructure that they could then all use.  Monetizing space bitcoin  While it's ambitious as is, Blockstream is taking that mission even further, adding more satellites as the year goes on, with the hope the most people on earth will be able to access a bitcoin satellite by the end of the year.  ""The only people that won't be covered are those in Antarctica,"" Back said.  While the project is technically feasible, though, is it financially so?  Bitcoin is admittedly a different beast, but other Internet space projects don't have a great track record so far. Although, Blockstream does have plans to monetize the satellite.  According to Back, Blockstream will eventually release an API for developers and companies to send data over the satellite connection for a small bitcoin fee.  He concluded:  ""That might allow a smartphone wallet that sends messages to send it via satellite or some application to send messages via satellite. That's a way to monetize the infrastructure and to expand to more services on it.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.

Speaking with Russian media source Invest-Foresight, Elina Leonidovna Sidorenko – a professor Moscow State Institute of International Relations who serves in the working group – remarked that the process is being pushed back to the winter at the earliest, due to a number of factors.  Of particular note, Sidorenko said, is the fact that not all stakeholders are aligned on what the bill should accomplish. Recent changes in the market for cryptocurrencies are also driving a reassessment of the measure.  She told the publication (according to a translation):  ""In April, we announced that the draft law would be ready in October. However, the situation on the market made us, in addition to the main bill, consider several more options. And now all these projects are postponed, we are watching the situation to understand: which solution will be optimal?""  One point of contention, according to the professor, is whether the bill should exist as a stand-alone measure or if it should be written as an amendment to an existing law. The ever-changing landscape for cryptocurrencies – she cited ""serious fluctuations"" in prices and the collapse of bitcoin exchange BTC-e as issues of concern – is also spurring some working group members to assess the progress thus far.  Sidorenko went on to suggest that policymakers aren't in agreement on more fundamental points, either, including the classification of cryptocurrencies themselves.  ""The issue is being actively studied, [and] it is impossible to pass to other issues without solving it. ... We are trying to coordinate this issue with ministries and departments,"" she said.  The bill was also delayed last December, with the plan being to introduced it possibly this autumn.

Since May, bitcoin had been fluctuating in the mid to high $2,000s, then August 4 saw enthusiastic trading that catapulted prices upwards – quickly reaching the $3,000 mark and just nine days later passing $4,000 for the first time ever.  In a likely surprise for those expecting a sell-off, a fall never came and, yesterday, bitcoin surged on to hit an astonishing $4,483 at around 3:50 a.m. UTC.  Reasons for the buoyant market have been put down to growing interest in the cryptocurrency space by institutional investors, alongside the passing of a split of the bitcoin network to form a new cryptocurrency on August 1. When that event – which saw the creation of a rival digital asset called bitcoin cash – passed uneventfully, money seemingly held back by cautious traders poured into the asset.  Since opening today at $4,382, however, prices across global exchanges have fallen somewhat, and at press time were around $4,200 – a drop of 4.15 percent, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Looking at the industry more widely, the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies today sits at around $138.7 billion – down from $141 billion yesterday, data from CoinMarketCap indicates. Bitcoin's market cap currently stands at over $68 billion.

With the news, the bank becomes the first of its kind in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region to join the effort. Majority-controlled by Libya's central bank, Bank ABC operates in Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan, among other areas.  In statements, Bank ABC indicated that it plans to leverage the partnership to provide additional services to its customers. Blockchain, the institution said, ""will propel us further to achieve our strategic goals.""  Sael Al Waary, deputy group CEO for the bank, said:  ""We are committed to continue to provide our customers with exceptional customer service and innovative financial products. DLT will help us fulfill our promise to clients.""  Though it's the first MENA-based bank to join R3 – which unveiled more than $100 million in new funding in May and launched the beta of its Corda software platform a month later – Bank ABC isn't the only bank in the region to pursue potential blockchain applications.  As previously reported, Emirates NBD, one of the Middle East's largest banking groups, has already been working with the central bank of the United Arab Emirates on a blockchain trial focused on bank check fraud.

Just an hour after the August 15 session opened, the average price of bitcoin was up across global exchanges, rising from an opening total of $4,382. At press time, the price continued to edge upward, following a day in which in gained more than $200, rising to $4,382 from $4,111 on Sunday.  Week-over-week, price gains were even more impressive, with the value of the cryptocurrency rising just over 30% from $3,382 at the end of trading a week ago.  The movement comes at a time when institutional investors are beginning to take a new interest in bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency asset class.  Not only are major investment managers and analysts now tracking the asset, but accredited investors have been seeking to diversify opportunities in the space, investing nearly $200 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) for a blockchain network called filecoin last week, a venture aimed at creating a distributed protocol for file storage.  Also up on the day was the value of all cryptocurrencies issued, with data from Coinmarketcap indicating the asset class is now valued at $141 billion, up nearly 20 percent from $118 billion last week.
