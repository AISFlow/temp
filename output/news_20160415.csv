42426807,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjTh,1460753758,Ether Prices Plunge 50% as Bitcoin Stays in Holding Pattern,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class    Bitcoin prices fluctuated largely within a tight range between $415 and $425 during the seven days ending 15th April, while the value of ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, declined sharply after weeks of advances.  Bitcoin's lack of volatility largely mirrored the last several weeks, when the digital currency was stable across international markets.  This stability again took place amid modest volume, as market participants traded just over 11m BTC during the seven days through 9:45 EST on 15th April, according to figures from Bitcoinity.  Transaction volume was similar during the week through 8th April, far below the robust trading activity that had existed in preceding weeks.  Ether's descent  While bitcoin has seen range-bound prices, ether plunged more than 56% during the week ending 15th April at 12:00 UTC, according to Poloniex figures.  George Samman, blockchain advisor and consultant, described the development as one that had been foreshadowed by changes in market fundamentals.  ""Ether has fallen back to earth for sure,"" Samman told CoinDesk. ""Its technicals were deteriorating for a while and finally price fell with them.""  Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, spoke to the currency’s selloff, noting that exchange data signaled a shift was forthcoming as well.  ""The sell order book on [digital currency exchange] Poloniex has consistently been 30-50% deeper than the buy order book,"" he told CoinDesk.  But while ether has been suffering sharp price volatility, it has also been experiencing robust transaction activity.  The currency’s daily trades neared 35,000 on 14th April and remained above 30,000 during the several days prior. Since mid-March, these daily transactions have almost always stayed above 30,000.  In comparison, the digital currency did not consistently exceed 10,000 trades per day before December 2015.  Downside projections  Ether has also been enjoying a steadily rising hashrate, as this measure of processing power reached 2,000 GH/s on 14th April, compared to 1,232 GH/s a month before, Etherscan.io figures reveal. The figures indicate that interest in rewards for transaction processing on the network is increasing.  As for what ether prices will do going forward, experts provided varying forecasts. Samman offered a bearish prediction, speaking to technical analysis performed on the digital currency.  ""I expect more downside follow through in the coming weeks and $6.50 area is pretty major support,"" he stated. ""On the upside, $8.80 to $9.00, which was support is now resistance. It should continue to be volatile as traders look for new levels.""  Burniske offered a different point of view, choosing to focus on basic market variables.  ""As fundamental transaction use continues to build over time, ether could enjoy a sustained rise,"" he stated, adding:  ""As with all markets, it’s a function of supply vs demand, buyers vs sellers, and it will be particularly interesting to see what happens over time, as Ethereum is constructed to always release new coins each year, albeit at a lower percentage of total outstanding.""  Holding pattern  On the bitcoin side, some experts have emphasized that at least for now, the digital currency is stuck in a holding pattern.  ""In bitcoin, volume and volatility continue to drop,"" said Samman. ""At this point as it sits range-bound and I've been saying this for a few weeks, it’s a broken record. It’s still ‘sit on your hands’ and wait time.""  However, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, sees a light at the end of the tunnel. Geopolitical turmoil in Europe will push bitcoin prices higher over the coming months, he predicted.  Such a development could provide bitcoin with headwinds, as market observers have repeatedly observed that in times of market turmoil, the digital currency can act like a safe haven similar to gold.  Aside from the challenges affecting Greece, another development in Europe that could push bitcoin prices higher is the chance the UK might exit or ""Brexit"" the European Union. Markets will enter a risk-off phase amid concerns the EU is over, and this development will place upward pressure on bitcoin prices, Hayes told CoinDesk.  However, he predicted that if Greek politicians back down from their demands, bitcoin prices could fall.  Charles L.

42426800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwjFh,1460737072,Fed Governor Advises Regulators to Be ‘Attentive’ to Blockchain,"US Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Lael Brainard issued new remarks this week on the potential of blockchain technology and distributed ledgers to impact the US financial markets.  In remarks given at a blockchain roundtable held by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Brainard praised the emerging technology while cautioning that the financial industry should be careful not to undermine confidence in the world’s financial markets through its attempts to investigate its potential.  Brainard further offered encouragement and words of caution to regulators, who she stated have the responsibility to help maintain this balance between public and private interests.  Brainard said:  ""Regulators should seek to analyze the implications of technology developments through constructive and timely engagement. We should be attentive to the potential benefits of these new technologies, and prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety and integrity is proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest.""  In her remarks, the former under secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs noted the increasing frequency of blockchain technology trials, noting what she considers the key challenges and considerations facing their development and large deployment.  For example, Brainard said that the interoperability of distributed ledgers both with other versions of the technology and legacy systems would be “critical” as would who maintains the rights to access these databases.  ""New and highly fragmented ‘shared systems’ may create unintended consequences even as they aim to address problems created by today’s siloed operations,"" she said.  Brainard ended by indicating that the Federal Reserve would seek to continue to engage industry stakeholders and regulatory colleagues on issues facing the technology’s development.  The comments follow speeches from a variety of domestic and international regulators, who are increasingly voicing their opinions on the technology and its adoption. In recent weeks, representatives of the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FCA) have both issued notable statements.  Brainard’s remarks come more than two years after Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen stated that the US central bank did not have authority over bitcoin, the network Brainard acknowledged as the longest-running example of blockchain technology.  Reason for optimism  Despite words of caution, Brainard appeared careful not to sound reproachful in her remarks, adding that she believes the financial industry and regulators should be optimistic of technologies that have the potential to bring positive change.  For instance, she stated that it shouldn’t be assumed that any changes to the financial system would bring greater risk noting that computerized book entry may have once seemed like a “technologist’s pipe dream”.  In particular, Brainard lauded blockchain technology for innovations in peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and data storage; cryptography; and consensus algorithms.  Still, she said that the technology and its applications would need to undergo a process of continual re-evaluation, noting that technology itself does not have the power to solve industry problems.  She concluded:  “Much will depend on the technology itself, its scalability, its level of maturity, the controls and environment surrounding it, the standardization and accessibility of transactions data, the quality of management and governance, and the policy environment in which it is deployed.""
