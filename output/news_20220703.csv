Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds its new support over $19K; other cryptos are flat in weekend trading.  Insights: The Monetary Authority of Singapore's reprimand of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital may only be a first step.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $19,200, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin fell below $19,000 at one point on Thursday following the U.S. Securities and Exchange's (SEC) rejection of two spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, a reprimand for troubled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the latest drumbeat of discouraging economic indicators, but subsequently regained ground.  ""Bitcoin price action remains weak, with some volatility seen on both sides, which is typical in pauses between trend continuations,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""Currently, we expect BTC to see more downside action but we are also keenly watching the market's reactions to assess a decline in selling momentum and interest.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands below $1,100 and little changed from the previous day. Other cryptos among the CoinDesk top 25 by market cap were mixed with some flat, a few rising slightly and others in the red. MATIC was recently down nearly 5% but AXS was up over 3%.  Crypto prices continued the pattern they've largely followed in recent months of tracking equity indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a heavy tech component, both closed up about a 1%. The upswings were a rare break from the steady declines that have sent both indexes into bear market territory, meaning they have both lost at least 20% of their value from their last highs.  Troubling macroeconomic conditions  Rising inflation, the looming prospect of recession and geo-political unrest have forced investors into risk averse defensive crouches. Last Wednesday U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to tame inflation even at the expense of economic contraction. And separate reports by the University of Michigan and U.S. Conference Board have shown consumer confidence in the economy waning.  Meanwhile, the crypto industry spent much of Friday wrestling with the latest fallout from Three Arrows Capital's liquidity problems and other events with crypto broker Voyager Digital (VYGVF) temporarily suspending all trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards. CoinDesk also reported that troubled crypto lender Babel Finance had hired U.S. investment banking firm Houlihan Lokey, a specialist in restructuring and distressed mergers and acquisitions.  BitBull's DiPasquale, who in recent weeks has seen an increasing likelihood of bitcoin support sinking into the low to mid teens, remained pessimistic about a rebound, short of the Fed offering some encouraging signs at its July meeting.  ""June's closing was not very optimistic, and July might remain choppy unless the FOMC meeting near the end of the month presents any surprises.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,825 +1%  DJIA: 31.097 +1%  Nasdaq: 11,127 +0.9%  Gold: $1,807 +.03%  Insights  The Monetary Authority of Singapore's Reprimand May Only Be a First Step  In early 2021 Three Arrows Capital reported a $1.2 billion position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), evenly split between its entities in Singapore and the British Virgin Islands.  But there’s a slight problem.  In Singapore, Three Arrows Capital is only registered to manage assets under $250 million (US$179.9 million) – well under what its position in GBTC is worth.  (New York-based Grayscale, the manager of GBTC, is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  There was likely a lot of leverage involved as Three Arrows bought into GBTC as part of a premium harvesting play. Super leverage that, according to the opinion of one analyst, helped cause the current crypto winter when the whole thing collapsed.  Regardless, the Monetary Authority of Singapore isn’t happy. Late Thursday, MAS issued a public reprimand of Three Arrows Capital for providing “misleading information to the regulator and exceeding the threshold set for assets under management.”  Questions should have been asked by the media around the time that Three Arrows filed its GBTC position with the SEC about how the firm was doing it. Crypto and business publications should have been bolder because the fund’s management team owed the industry an explanation of how this arrangement worked.  We’ll probably be hearing more from MAS about Three Arrows in the near future. One interesting note in MAS’s notice is that Three Arrows informed the regulator of its intent to cease operations in the Lion City in early May, presumably as part of its move to Dubai – which hasn’t yet happened.  MAS also notes that “in light of recent developments which call into question the solvency of the fund managed by [Three Arrows], MAS is assessing if there were further breaches by [Three Arrows] of MAS’s regulations.“  Get your popcorn.  Let’s see if management declares the Singapore fund insolvent, as it did its BVI counterpart.

4051,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=240479,1656891019,Here’s the Significance of Total Value Locked (TVL) in Cryptocurrencies,"Even though it has flaws, the crypto industry has grown like never before, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And, because the cryptosphere is constantly changing, savvy investors are always looking for indicators that can help them determine how profitable various crypto products are. Trading volume, market capitalization, and total value locked (TVL) are some of the indicators used to gauge the performance of the crypto market. TVL has become especially popular among DeFi investors when assessing the overall fiat value of assets deposited in a single project or across all DeFi protocols. But before we get into the significance of TVL in cryptocurrencies, let&apos;s take a moment to discuss what it is. What Does Total Value Locked Mean? TVL is simply defined as the total value of digital assets locked or staked in the smart contract of a DeFi protocol. It is a measure of the total funds that can be transacted, lent, or borrowed through a particular DeFi platform. TVL also demonstrates to market observers and potential investors the level of interest, activity, and value currently present in the DeFi protocol. TVL is determined by taking the number of crypto tokens that have been staked in a particular DeFi project and multiplying that number by the token&apos;s current dollar value. On platforms that allow investors to stake more than one cryptocurrency, the total value locked of each crypto is c...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/significance-of-total-value-locked-tvl-in-cryptocurrencies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=significance-of-total-value-locked-tvl-in-cryptocurrencies,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

XRP/USD pair found resistance at $0.3886. Most indicators are bullish. Past Performance of XRP In the last 24 hours, XRP has been on an upward trend. The token started the day at $0.3818 and reached a high of $0.3902. At the time of writing, it is trading at $0.3167. Source-Tradingview XRP Technical Analysis Analyzing the momentum indicators, we see that the MACD is currently in the bullish territory as the fast-moving line crosses above the signal line. The RSI is also rising, which indicates that the token is in bullish territory. The price is above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is a positive sign for the bulls. Looking at the hourly chart, we see that the XRP/USD pair has formed a descending triangle pattern which is a bearish sign. The price is currently trading near the triangle&apos;s support at $0.3050. A breakout below this level can push the price towards $0.2750. Overall, the technical analysis shows that XRP is in a bullish trend in the short-term and is likely to continue its upward movement. Therefore, we believe that XRP is an excellent long-term investment and is likely to continue its upward trend soon. Upcoming Trend If XRP breaks out of the descending triangle pattern, it can retest the $0.3886 resistance level. A breakout above this level can push the price towards $0.4000.

As recently as November 2021, its value reached an all-time high as people found out how useful it is in the real world. Bitcoin is mostly used as an alternative way to pay for things, but it is also a good way to save money because it is more resistant to inflation. In some sections, it is felt that Bitcoin&apos;s continued upswing and widespread use around the world could see it replace the U.S. dollar as the world&apos;s reserve currency in the long run. Such views have become increasingly popular lately and many believe that it&apos;s high time governments across the world started holding BTC in their national reserves. How did the Dollar Become the World&apos;s Reserve Currency? 78 years ago, 730 delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to chart a post-war financial order for the world. The deliberations laid the foundation for the global financial system we have today. They led to the founding of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. The U.S. dollar remains the dominant reserve asset.

42421517,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWL7,1656859800,Hard Times in Crypto: the Unintended Consequences of Going Public,"Happy Fourth of July to all who celebrate! Hope you’re lucky enough to have time off. Spend some of it doing something you love.  This is the last of a three-part newsletter series about the risks facing crypto right now.  Here are the three topics this newsletter series covers.  Price and macro risk (two weeks ago)  Platform and protocol risk (last week)  Public company risk (this week)  This week we’ll take a look at public company risk.  Public companies are widely misunderstood, especially among the bitcoin and crypto crowd. That’s not really surprising. The whole thing is (enter: 100% of my cynicism) intentionally convoluted and confusing to make the investment bankers, lawyers and insiders on Wall Street feel smart.  I mean, these are called “public companies,” but they are decidedly private, for-profit enterprises. Words matter, but just not in high finance, apparently.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  For context, I want to lay out what it means to “go public” or “be a public company.” A company goes public by selling some or all of its equity to a group of underwriters, who then issue stock to trade openly on exchanges like the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.  It’s “public” in that (almost) anyone can invest in this equity freely (in practice, it isn’t truly open). Also its financial information – from quarterly income statements to stock price – is publicly shared. Companies do this to receive an injection of money to aid growth or reward long-time equity holders and have easier access to future capital. These seem to be reasonable reasons to go public, and a lot of the time it works out.  But for more context, I’m going to tell you what I think about going public.  I think it’s dumb.  Going public puts the focus on short-term growth over long-term growth, and that could spell disaster under improper management for even the best companies. Corporations can survive longer and are best served when they have the long term in mind. Going public, in most jurisdictions, requires quarterly financial reporting, which is generally onerous. Additionally, you have public shareholders who demand the stock performs well or else they will tank your equity value of the company by selling the stock en masse.  What’s more, the capital markets have become exceedingly more open to private companies as a glut of private capital (debt and equity alike) is on the sideline looking for things to put money into. I’m mostly being fantastical for dramatic effect, but in general, going public isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.  Especially in crypto. Hence this week’s focus on risks posed by public companies in the Hard Times of crypto …  Public company risk  During the last bear market in 2018, there were no public companies in crypto. Now we have trading platform Coinbase (COIN) and an army of public crypto mining companies. This is how their stock prices have performed this year (COIN, CORZ, HUT, HIVE, RIOT, MARA).  That’s not good. Normally, if these companies were private, they would be trying to figure out how to survive. Take Coinbase for instance. It has been around since 2012, and so it has survived multiple bear markets. But this time around, it has the public shareholder to worry about. And the highly liquid, public shareholder is far more impatient than the highly illiquid, private shareholder.  Going public has led to an unsavory situation for Coinbase.  The insistence for consistent, infinite, short-term growth by shareholders led to an immense expansion in headcount. At the same time, Coinbase also scrambled to increase revenue by listing countless (and sometimes off-the-wall) digital assets on its platform.  That strategy generally works in a bull market, but the market downturn has led to an absolute PR nightmare when Coinbase cut back on hiring in May, which rolled into rescinding new job offers. The blowback in turn led to a pointed tweet thread from co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong urging dissenters to quit, following an employee petition to remove executives from the company, which was then followed promptly by the exchange laying off 18% of its workforce.  That same insistence for growth combined with post-Global Financial Crisis cheap capital has hit mining companies, as well. Miners were able to cheaply finance mining equipment and facilities, all while thriving without needing to sell much of the bitcoin they mined since the price of bitcoin was high and capital was cheap. Now that bitcoin is dipping and interest rates are increasing, public miners may be forced to dig into their coffers to sell some of the 40,000 BTC they collectively hold to survive.  While 40,000 BTC of potential selling might feel like a bad thing, Castle Island Venture’s Nic Carter pointed out in a podcast that miner selling marked the last move down during the 2018 bear market. So while we could be in for more pain, perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel is visible.  And to be undeniably clear, I’m not suggesting that going public is the sole reason these companies are struggling. In fact, these companies would be struggling if they were still private. Many companies are struggling across many industries, not just crypto exchanges and miners. I am suggesting that a company going public while it is still in growth mode with a business model highly dependent on the price of highly volatile assets was potentially unadvisable.  The only thing worse than being a private company going through a tough time is being a public company going through a tough time. I think most of these companies will be fine, but it will be tough going for the foreseeable future.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/03/hard-times-in-crypto-the-unintended-consequences-of-going-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d70c7afc7c41f3c182816f8f5fb67515aeed5710-4516x3387.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
