Other notable participants include VC firms Electric Capital and Greenoaks. According to a recent Fortune Magazine report, Monad Labs, the company behind the blockchain project, aims to compete with established players such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum and the Layer 1 blockchain protocol Sui (SUI). Monad’s Rebuilt Ethereum Blockchain Per the report, Monad’s initiative is to rebuild the Ethereum blockchain from the ground up, while retaining the ability to execute smart contracts. The project aims to achieve faster transaction speeds, handle higher volumes, and offer lower costs compared to existing networks. Notably, Monad ensures compatibility with Ethereum’s programming infrastructure, known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows developers to port applications built for Ethereum, ensuring a fluid transition to the new blockchain. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Crash? Analysts Cite Possible Downtrend Keone Hon, the founder of Monad, stated in an exclusive interview with Fortune that the company has dedicated approximately two years to developing its blockchain solution. Hon noted that Monad Labs stands out by fully supporting the EVM bytecode standard. Developers use this standard to create decentralized applications (dApps) on platforms such as Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism. According to Avichal Garg, managing partner of Electric Capital, nearly 90% of developers working across various crypto ecosystems focus exclusively on EVM chains. This statistic, highlighted in a recent report by Electric Capital, demonstrates the significant appeal of EVM compatibility. Although Monad does not undergo a complete redesign of its programming language like some other blockchains, it still benefits from the widespread usage and familiarity of the EVM. Blockchain-Powered Exchanges? According to the report, Monad plans to launch its mainnet by the end of the year and expects to launch a testnet in the coming months. The company, which currently employs around 30 people, is also looking to launch a native token, although details of its launch alongside the mainnet have not been disclosed. While Keone Hon emphasized the pursuit of mainstream adoption, he pointed out that Monad’s initial use case is likely to be “high-frequency” trading activity, drawing on his own experience at Jump Trading, a data and research-driven trading firm. Hon emphasized the need for a highly performant blockchain to enable exchanges on the scale of Nasdaq or Chicago Mercantil Exchange (CME), which process millions to billions of transactions daily. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst Lastly, Hon also highlighted the potential for a blockchain with high transaction capacity and low fees to enable various applications, such as gaming. He cited examples where blockchain-based games, such as RuneScape, require frequent updates of player statistics, necessitating low-cost and fast transactions on the blockchain.

42418429,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThC73,1712699538,VanEck CEO Says Transaction Fee Is Bigger Story Than Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs,"The CEO of VanEck – the global investment firm whose Bitcoin Trust (HODL) is among the almost dozen spot bitcoin ETFs – thinks the cryptocurrency industry should focus more on transaction fees and not so much on Bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum {{ETH}} or their related exchange-traded funds.  Jan van Eck said on CoinDesk's ""Markets Daily"" that the transaction fees on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are unpredictable, making it harder to build applications in those ecosystems. ""The most important story of 2023, which people know, but I don't think they focus on enough, which is simply that transaction costs are now available at affordable rates through Solana or the so-called layer 2s,"" van Eck told CoinDesk TV's Jen Sanasie in an interview.  ""Because you see the transaction fees for Bitcoin and Ethereum, no one would ever use that database to build anything on, right? My analogy for non-crypto people is, would you want to fill your car at $50, you know, week after week, and then one week at $600? And that's effectively what high gas fees are on Ethereum,"" he said.  Solana (SOL), often referred to as an Ethereum killer, is a layer 1 protocol with cheaper costs and faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. Layer 2s are separate blockchains that are built on top of layer 1 chains, such as Ethereum, to reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data that layer 1s face. Ethereum rollups and the Lightning network on Bitcoin are examples of layer 2s.  With new solutions for lower and much more predictable transaction fees, developers can now build applications that are much more useful, which Jan Van Eck predicts will be more prominent going forward. ""The most interesting thing happening in crypto to me right now is that you have databases that can scale, that can take a lot of users of high uptime and now have predictable costs. And so real stuff can be built on these databases now,"" he said. ""We're going to see that in the next couple of years.""  He also said that its unlikely that ether ETFs will be approved by their May deadline, as unlike the bitcoin ETF approval process, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been not responsive to filings by the prospective issuers.  ""We've filed our S1 and we haven't heard anything. So that's kind of a sign. It won't happen without getting the disclosure documents in order,"" Jan Van Eck said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/09/vaneck-ceo-says-transaction-fee-is-bigger-story-than-bitcoin-or-ethereum-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04074cce3ea0e571ab87ef2115c1b671f74a5eb0-2047x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This also includes the burn rate, with a recent development showing a sustained increase in the number of SHIB tokens burned. Shiba Inu Demand Looks To Be On The Rise There has been an increase in Shiba Inu whale activity these past few days. On-chain data shows the transfer of 1.7 trillion SHIB to a Robinhood-linked wallet. Transferring such an amount to a centralized exchange will usually raise fears about an incoming dump on the market, but that doesn’t look to be the case this time around. Related Reading: Expert Maps Out Timeline For The XRP Price To Cross $1,000 Instead, Robinhood looks to be accumulating as many SHIB tokens as possible to meet customers’ demand. This also seems to be the case with Binance, the largest crypto exchange by market share, which recently transferred over 464 billion SHIB from one of its wallets to another. These large transactions also come at a time when Bitcoinist recently reported a Shiba Inu whale that spent $19 million to purchase 692 billion SHIB. This whale in question also looks to be holding for the long term as they immediately transferred their SHIB holdings to a non-custodial wallet for safekeeping. The increase in whale activity presents a bullish outlook for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which could aid the meme coin’s price recovery. SHIB had previously experienced a price dip thanks in part to multiple on-chain metrics, which turned red last week. One of those metrics included the number of large transactions on the network, which Bitcoinist reported had declined by over 10%. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Increases By Over 1,200% Data from the burn tracking website Shibburn shows that SHIB’s burn rate has surged by 1287% in the last 24 hours, with 135 million tokens burnt during this period. Furthermore, there has been a sustained increase in these SHIB burns, with the burn rate rising by 129% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Skybridge CEO Says Bitcoin Can Reach Half Of Gold Market, How Much Will BTC Be? This is significant considering these token burns’ impact on SHIB’s price. The sustained increase in the SHIB burns is also undoubtedly a welcome development, considering the decline these past few weeks. Interestingly, the SHIB community has pulled this off while Shibarium’s daily transactions continue to lag. However, activity on the layer-2 network is expected to pick up soon as the Shiba Inu team actively promotes it. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) WoofSwap also recently announced that they have introduced the SHIB -314 token protocol on Shibarium, which could also help drive up the number of transactions on the network. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00002884, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418427,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThC4z,1712692420,Why Christie's First Bitcoin Inscriptions Auction Matters,"NFTs aren’t for everyone. In the years since non-fungible tokens first entered public consciousness there has been a fierce backlash against what is essentially just a way of authenticating data. Part of this negativity was as a response to the gross financialization and speculation around these tokens, and environmental concerns that have since basically been resolved by Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake in 2022.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  However, the general public’s distaste of NFTs hasn’t stopped the art industry from embracing them. In 2021, Christie’s auction house made history with the $69 million sale of Beeple’s “Everydays” collage. Since then, the storied company has expanded further into the realm of crypto, including countless NFT auctions, investments in Web3 firms via Christie’s Ventures and even the launch of its own NFT marketplace, Christie’s 3.0.  The company, founded before the birth of the American Republic, is taking this one step further today through its first auction of inscriptions, the NFT-like tokens on Bitcoin made possible by Casey Rodarmor’s Ordinals Protocol. The “Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB)” sale, although not the first inscriptions auction (Sotheby’s beat its closest competitor to the punch late last year), is something of a turning point for Ordinals, and a signal that these objets d’art may just have staying power.  “Slowly but surely people are getting very interested,” Christie’s Director of Digital Art Sales Nicole Sales Giles told CoinDesk in an interview. “The market has matured quite significantly since the boom in 2021 when Christie’s first got involved. We don't take our responsibility lightly.”  This is a meaningful statement from Sales Giles, who was instrumental in setting up Beeple’s auction that first brought public attention to NFTs. While the auction house doesn’t yet have current plans for more inscriptions sales, Sales Giles said that this was just the beginning of its move into the world of inscriptions.  The works at auction were curated by pseudonymous Ordinals advocate and OMB co-creator ZK Shark, and contain works by artists Tony Tafuro and berkinbags. Each auction lot has a starting bid of $100, a callback to the starting price of the Beeple’s auction, which was set at that price because Christie’s “didn't really fully understand the market at that time,” Sales Giles said.  There’s an argument to be made that Ordinals represents a significant technological advancement over NFTs, in part because it's a method that actually allows artists to inscribe data directly on-chain. In contrast, NFTs are better thought of as digital signatures for data that often exists elsewhere. Because they exist on “someone else’s server,” they can’t truly be owned.  An example of how this can go wrong happened after the disastrous collapse of FTX: When the exchange went down the images associated with 1.5 million worth of NFTs minted at the Coachella Festival became inaccessible because it was stored on an FTX website. With Ordinals, the only way for the data to be erased is if Bitcoin goes down.  See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  “I don't think inscriptions will ever fully replace current NFT token standards like ERC-721,” Sales Giles said, mentioning the current file limitations of inscriptions that can prevent artists from minting data intensive things like HD videos on-chain. “There's still going to be a market for every new technology that's come up.”  But the auction comes at an interesting time for inscription adoption. Currently, two of the five largest NFT projects by market capitalization, Runestones and NodeMonkeys, are built on Bitcoin, according to CoinGecko data. And, Ordinals are less than a year old.  While the Bitcoin community has torn itself apart over the question of whether Ordinals is destroying something meant to primarily be a monetary network and driving up transaction fees, it’s clear that inscriptions aren’t going away.  As ZK Shark noted in a recent X post, Bitcoin has been both a system for transferring value and storing data since the very beginning, with Satoshi Nakamoto inscribing the blockchain’s “genesis” with a message to the world.  “We are interested in the artistic historical story around these collections,” Sales Giles said. “It's really interesting to us to see the zeitgeist form around this community.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZK,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/09/why-christies-first-bitcoin-inscriptions-auction-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8de283997c48ac4567e55046bdd50af69bceccdb-558x314.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future,"As the Bitcoin (BTC) “Halving” approaches, expectations increase about how the flagship cryptocurrency will perform. Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering momentum after facing a significant correction in the first few days of Q2, and some analysts are forecasting new heights for the number one cryptocurrency soon. Related Reading: Beyond Halving: Expert Predicts Bitcoin To Soar Above $200,000 With Surprising Catalyst Are The Odds In The Bulls Or Bears Favor? Bitcoin had its best quarterly close during Q1, 2024. Despite BTC’s stellar performance, as Q2 started, the market was dragged by the leading cryptocurrency’s price correction. Since then, Bitcoin has been steadily recovering, testing the $70,000 resistance level over the weekend. As the week started, BTC appeared to have regained support above the $70,000 level. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez seems to think that Bitcoin’s performance so far reflects a positive sentiment from investors. In an X post, Martinez shared a chart that paints an optimistic picture, at least for now. When you compare support (1.4 million addresses holding 893,000 $BTC between $68,220 and $70,325) with resistance (474,000 addresses holding 285,000 #BTC between $70,760 and $71,200), the odds appear to favor the #Bitcoin bulls! pic.twitter.com/pceCyGa8mb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 9, 2024 According to Martinez’s post, the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator seems favorable to the bulls. Per the chart, the addresses holding BTC at the support level massively outnumber those holding Bitcoin at the resistance level. The chart suggests that Bitcoin is at “stable support” as 474,000 addresses hold 285,000 BTC between $70,760 and $71,200. Meanwhile, 1.4 million addresses hold the flagship cryptocurrency between $68,220 and $70,325. When compared, the addresses and BTC held at the support level nearly triple those in the resistance zone. To the analyst, bulls are the current victors as “odds appear to favor” them. Analyst Forecast Bitcoin To 90,000 Soon Captain Faibik, another crypto analyst, also seems to perceive more bullish momentum for Bitcoin. In an X post, the analyst suggests that BTC’s “bullish pennant upside break is confirmed on the daily chart.” Per the chart, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price started a consolidation period in early March, forming a pennant pattern. This pattern saw an upside breakout after Monday’s daily candle closed above the $70,000 price range. Due to this breakout, the analyst forecasts a surge to the $88,000-$90,000 price range this month. $BTC Bullish Pennant Upside Breakout is Confirmed on the Daily timeframe Chart.. ✅ Now, Send Bitcoin to the 88-90k this Month. 📈🚀#Crypto #BTC #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ok2DGPXsAb — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 9, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains above the $70,000 support level, only 5% below its most recent all-time high (ATH) price of $73,373. Despite the positive resistance, BTC’s price performance shows a slight decrease of 2.3% from yesterday. Similarly, its daily trading volume and market capitalization have mildly dropped. According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC’s daily trading volume is down by 6%, while its market cap of $1.38 trillion represents a 2.1% decrease. Nonetheless, Bitcoin remains 8.4% above its price seven days ago, trading at $70,378. Further bullish sentiment, fueled by the upcoming “Halving” event, could help the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization consolidate its support above the current levels.

42418433,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCCD,1712686203,EigenLayer and EigenDA Launch on Ethereum Mainnet,"EigenLayer, a ""restaking"" service for Ethereum that has already racked up $12 billion in user deposits, announced today that it is officially launching to the blockchain's mainnet. The launch comes alongside the release of EigenDA, a data-availability (DA) service from the team behind EigenLayer.  Even before EigenLayer launched, it had already become one of the most popular destinations for crypto inflows – a hot ticket partly because of its highly touted innovation of pooled security, a technology that could fundamentally reshape the industry landscape by extending Etheruem's security apparatus to other crypto protocols.  Eigen Labs, the development firm behind EigenLayer, announced the launch on Tuesday on EigenLayer's X account.  EigenLayer's pitch is that it lets upstart blockchain protocols borrow Ethereum's security – allowing users to take ETH they've staked with Ethereum, and then ""restake"" it with a much larger pool of ETH from other users in exchange for extra interest.  That restaked ETH is used to collectively secure auxiliary networks, called actively validated services (AVSs), which can be anything from blockchain bridges to exchanges or oracles.  EigenDA, the first AVS to launch, is built by Eigen Labs as a way to help other blockchain protocols store transaction data and other information. It will compete with similar protocols, like Celestia, that have quickly become critical pieces of blockchain infrastructure as the industry has expanded.  EigenLayer's initial launch will have a restricted feature set for now, and Eigen Labs CEO Sreeram Kannan referred to the protocol's first release as a ""beta"" version in a conversation with CoinDesk last week.  Notably, AVSs outside of Eigen Labs' EigenDA will be able to ""register"" with the protocol, but they will not be able to deploy in full just yet.  Additionally, ""this mainnet launch does not include: (1) in-protocol payments from AVSs to operators; and (2) slashing,"" EigenLayer said in its X thread.  ""Slashing"" refers to the method that EigenLayer will use to keep AVS operators honest: The protocol will rely on a proof-of-stake system similar to Ethereum's, where AVS operators (also called validators) are at risk of having their stake revoked if they act maliciously. EigenLayer will ultimately pay out interest to restakers, but that function, too, will remain in progress until Eigen Labs works out kinks with its ""in-protocol payments"" system.  ""We are allowing the EigenLayer marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to mainnet later this year,"" EigenLayer said in the thread.  Eigen Labs raised $100M last year from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and the project's points system – a loyalty score that users expect might be attached to a future token airdrop – has helped fuel billions of dollars worth of deposits into the protocol.  EigenLayer's rise has also birthed a cottage industry of ""liquid restaking"" protocols like Ether.fi and Puffer, which funnel money into EigenLayer on behalf of users, and offer their own points systems as an incentive for depositing with them.

25465337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602208,1712685649,"Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible?","Amid the issues that continue to plague the network, the Solana open interest has seen a drop in the last week. This drop coincides with a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, suggesting that investors may be getting wary of waiting for a fix to come through. Solana Open Interest Drops By $370 Million Solana saw its open interest rise steadily since the start of 2024, hitting an all-time high after an all-time high in the process. Between January and April, the Solana open interest went from around $1.22 billion to hit a new all-time high of $2.86 billion on April 1. This translates to an over 100% increase over this three-month period. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When However, since hitting this new milestone, the cryptocurrency has encountered issues which have presented in the form of a network halt. Around a week ago, Solana users noticed that the blockchain had stopped processing transactions as usual, leading to a standstill in network activities. Expectations at the time were that the network would be back up and running in a matter of hours like it usually does. However, this has proven not to be the case, as the network is going on a week of downtime, one of the longest in its history. Since the network issues began, the SOL open interest has been falling as traders take a more cautionary approach. Coinglass data shows that the open interest is currently sitting at $2.39 billion on April 19, down $370 million from its all-time high, which is a 12.9% decline in around a week. Source: Coinglass Open interest measures the total number of outstanding futures and options contracts, so it means that traders have been closing their positions during this time. SOL Network Ready To Bounce Back? Developers are still working on getting the Solana network back on track but it has not been an easy road. Even now, the network continues to battle the blackout, with developers giving a week as an estimated delivery time for the network to be back on track. CEO of Helius Labs, Bert Mumtaz, revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the current issues were being caused by an implementation bug. This bug has been the reason there have been more failed transactions on the network. Mumtaz also clarified that this bug does not equal a design flaw in the fact that it is relatively easier to fix. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals What To Expect For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP In 12-16 Months The CEO explained that a patch for this implementation bug would still take a while and that developers are shooting for a fix by April 15, which was a week from the post. However, he added that this date was subject to change in the case where other bugs are discovered in testing. Following Mumtaz’s post, the Solana community is waiting with bated breaths for the network to return to fill operation. In the meantime, the price of Solana and other coins in the ecosystem has taken a hit. Bears have pushed down the SOL price as low as $175. However, the expectation is that SOL will come back with a vengeance once the network is operational again. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto has said that they expect that the price of SOL will eventually rise above $400. If this is correct, then the present predicament will be a short-lived roadblock in Solana’s rise.

42418435,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCBB,1712682424,Republican Sen. Tillis Calls for ‘Light’ Crypto Regulatory Framework Ahead of Presidential Election,"Bipartisan senators called for a new regulatory framework for the crypto industry during a Senate Banking Committee meeting on Tuesday.  Republican Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) stressed that a ""light"" regulatory framework is needed to both prevent illicit crypto financing and help the industry grow.  Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo is asking Congress for increased powers to go after crypto crime.  U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said on Tuesday that the crypto industry needs a “light” regulatory framework put in place to both combat risks – including another FTX-like collapse and illicit terrorism financing – and create a “hospitable environment” in which digital assets can thrive.  The remarks came during a Senate Banking Committee meeting with Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo on Tuesday, who testified about the Treasury’s efforts to counter illicit finance, terrorism and sanctions evasion. Adeyemo also pressed the members of the Committee for “additional tools” to fight crypto crime, following legislative requests he made last November.  “One thing I’d tell people in the crypto or digital assets space that say ‘Nothing to see here, everything is fine’ – they’re wrong,” Sen. Tillis said. “There needs to be some light regulatory regimen put into place, otherwise there are risks…We want to create the most hospitable environment for digital assets to thrive. We don’t want to overreach and lose the opportunity to be that jurisdiction.”  Tillis added that if there is a change of administration following the presidential election in November, the view of how to regulate crypto will be “vastly different.”  “I, for one, would like to look at the possibility of working with [the Treasury Department] to address some of the things in your punch list that we agree with, so that we may be able to get regulations on the books in this Congress that will certainly not go as far some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to go, but [will be] far short of the wild, wild West that we find ourselves in now,” Tillis said.  On Monday, Tillis and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) released a discussion draft of a new bill – the Ensuring Necessary Financial Oversight and Reporting of Cryptocurrency Ecosystems (ENFORCE) Act – aimed at making sure centralized cryptocurrency companies are adhering to Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards.  Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) also called for more crypto regulations.  “Name your bad guy, and crypto is the way they can move money around,” Sen. Warren said.  Warren added that validators – which validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains – are not subject to the same anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws that banks are.  “Stablecoins make it easier to convert dollars into crypto and crypto into dollars, so they are an onramp into the crypto world,” Warren said. “If we’re going to create new onramps…then we need a regulatory framework that will put the rules for anti-money laundering into place so that we do not have new opportunities for Iran and terrorists and drug lords and human traffickers to make more money.”  Expanded powers  During the hour-long hearing, Adeyemo maintained that the Treasury needs expanded powers to effectively crack down on illicit crypto financing.  Adeyemo told the Committee that, as the Treasury has improved its ability to cut foreign enemies – including state actors like Iran, Russia and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups like Hamas and Al-Qaeda – off from the traditional finance system, they are increasingly turning to crypto as a workaround.  He has asked Congress for three legislative reforms. First, a “secondary sanctions tool” against exchanges that facilitate illicit finance, which would “help Treasury evolve its targeting capabilities.”  Second, Adeyemo asked for an expansion of the Treasury’s reach to “explicitly cover the key players and core activities of the digital assets ecosystem.”  Lastly, he requested a reform to address the “jurisdictional risk from offshore cryptocurrency platforms,” which would allow the Treasury to “clarify that our authorities can reach extraterritorially when digital asset entities harm our national security while taking advantage of our financial system.” In addition to countering illicit financing, Adeyemo added that this reform would “ also promote a level playing field for U.S.-based VASPs.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/09/republican-sen-tillis-calls-for-light-crypto-regulatory-framework-ahead-of-presidential-election,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfb654560b80cbfcfdbf439c2ed902fa2db78af0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25462818,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602238,1712682054,"Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst","With Bitcoin ripping higher and closing in on breaking all-time highs, one analyst on X thinks $150,000 post-halving is “programmed.” The analyst remains upbeat in a post, highlighting several fundamental developments that could drive the world’s most valuable coin to new valuation and more than 2X from spot rates. Currently, the path of least resistance remains northward. Buyers have shaken off the bears of the past trading month, finding anchor from the March 20 bull bar. On April 8, the coin soared above the key liquidation level at around $71,800. Bitcoin has since cooled off, but the leg up remains, and it may form the basis of another breakout above $74,000. For bulls to be firmly in control and align with the analyst’s outlook, there should be a follow-through of the April 8 surge, ideally with rising trading volumes. This could catalyze demand, even placing Bitcoin above $74,000 and fresh 2024 highs before the highly anticipated Halving event. Eyes On Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze In The Making? As the analyst explains, the “Halving” event is a crucial catalyst for this potential surge. Less than ten days away, this event is a protocol-driven occurrence that will see the network reduce block rewards to 3.125 BTC, down from the current 6.25 BTC. Related Reading: Filecoin Bull Run On The Horizon? Analyst Sees 250% Surge This reduction, combined with sustained demand, will likely create a scarcity of Bitcoin, potentially driving up its price. Ahead of Bitcoin’s Halving, the analyst said the amount of BTC held by exchanges is dwindling. To illustrate, Coinbase’s holdings stand at a six-year low. However, this is not an isolated event; data shows that major exchanges like Binance are seeing decreasing supply. At the same time, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which handle large, private cryptocurrency transactions, are reportedly running low on Bitcoin, indicating strong institutional demand. This suggests a potential supply squeeze set to only worsen in the coming months. Impact Of Spot BTC ETFs: London, Hong Kong In The Picture Already, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) issuers, the analyst added, are on a buying spree, gobbling up over $300 million of BTC every day. Since these issuers are acting on behalf of investors, both retail and institutions, they are actively infusing capital into the market, a huge boost for prices. It should be noted that the surge from Q4 2023 to early January was primarily because of the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spillover effect and the billions flowing into the asset make BTC more liquid and resilient against aggressive sellers. Additionally, the London Stock Exchange plans to list exchange-traded notes (ETNs) backed by Bitcoin in Q2 2024. Like the spot ETFs in the United States, this product will inject liquidity into the market and legitimize the coin as a worthy asset class, similar to gold.

42391030,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdT3TH,1712681535,"DeFi Trader Eisenberg 'Wasn't Borrowing, He Was Stealing,' Prosecutor Says in Opening Argument","NEW YORK – To federal prosecutors, Avi Eisenberg's $110 million crypto trade on Mango Markets put a digital twist on an old scam. But to the DeFi trader's defense team, it was a legitimate windfall from the risky world of crypto, where finance's old rules don't apply.  Each side presented crisp opening statements Tuesday in the U.S. government's commodities manipulation and fraud trial against Eisenberg. Their competing narratives gave the courtroom's 15 jurors a taste of the highly complex two-week trial ahead.  At issue is the October 2022 trade where Eisenberg turned $13 million of crypto into $110 million by draining the trading venue Mango Markets of all of its assets, in part by trading against himself.  He did so by making a massive bet on the future price of MNGO tokens and then allegedly gaming the crypto markets to drive up their value. Once the token was up over 1,000% he borrowed against their inflated value to capture virtually all of the crypto on MNGO, rendering it insolvent.  These kinds of trades aren't allowed at the banks, swaps shops and equities exchanges that power traditional financial markets and are closely regulated in the U.S. Mango Markets isn't like those institutions; rather than a company, it's a set of computer programs that operate on a blockchain where the old rules don't so easily apply.  But they should, according to federal prosecutors bringing this landmark criminal case against Eisenberg, the first crypto trader facing potential jail time for allegedly breaking commodities rules while trading in DeFi.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Tian Huang kicked off the government's case by comparing Eisenberg's ""scam"" to a con artist who lures his victim into loaning him money by offering a ""beautiful, fake diamond ring"" as collateral.  ""He wasn't really borrowing, he was stealing,"" she said in her opening statement, adding ""he committed commodities fraud and market manipulation.""  The government plans to use Eisenberg's private chats, public trades and flight records to prove he knew his ""huge, fake bets"" were illegal.  Eisenberg's five-person trial team hinted they intend to use crypto's nascent state and cloudy regulatory status to their advantage. In his opening statement, Sanford Talkin said the government ""is not going to get out of the gate"" in its attempts to apply commodities rules to highly speculative tokens, like MNGO.  Regardless, their defense appears to hinge on the proclaimed legitimacy of Eisenberg's actions in a trading landscape punctuated by high-risk, high reward bets.  ""Avi Eisenberg risked $13 million of his own dollars"" to net $110 million from Mango Markets, Talkin said, adding ""he could have lost everything.""  He said Mango Markets' traders understood and accepted the risks of playing in this murky field. Eisenberg just happened to hit it big.  ""It is in this world that Avi Eisenberg operated a successful, legal, trading strategy,"" Talkin said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/09/defi-trader-eisenberg-wasnt-borrowing-he-was-stealing-prosecutor-says-in-opening-argument,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95ce1b4e5373d7fef085562213e50c6810e5a0c0-1980x1320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cynthia Lummis, a Republican, sees crypto as a likely topic coming up in Senate races that are vital to the future leadership of the Senate Banking Committee.  She asked crypto enthusiasts to attend public forums in the elections and make sure the candidates have to answer questions about their positions on digital assets.  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said that the high-stakes Ohio election that could decide both the Senate majority and the leadership of the Senate Banking Committee is likely to dig into cryptocurrency issues, and she encouraged industry insiders to make sure it does.  Crypto skeptic Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), whose Democratic Party currently controls the Senate, is the chairman of the Banking Committee and has been reluctant to allow digital assets regulatory bills to move through the panel, despite some progress in the House of Representatives. In Ohio's general election, he faces Republican challenger Bernie Moreno, an Ohio businessman and crypto enthusiast who founded a blockchain startup, and Lummis – a member of Brown's committee – predicted on Tuesday that digital assets could be front and center in this matchup.  At a Bitcoin Policy Institute event in Washington, she suggested that industry supporters should make sure to attend public forums in that race and make sure the candidates get on the record about crypto.  ""Have people in the crowd to ask questions,"" she said, adding that Brown ""seems to have Elizabeth Warren whispering in his ear on this topic,"" referring to the Massachusetts Democratic senator widely seen as crypto's chief detractor in Congress.  Read More: Crypto Fan Won Ohio Senate Primary That Could Alter the Industry's U.S. Destiny  ""The Banking Committee is kind of the obstacle here,"" Lummis said.  Lummis also flagged the Montana race against Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), another Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee that'll likely be instrumental in any future crypto bills. She said she's been ""trying to educate"" his Republican opponent on blockchain and crypto matters.  Lummis noted that her Democrat partner in one of the leading crypto legislative efforts, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), is also facing an election this year.  Earlier at the same event, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said a stablecoin bill still has a shot at being approved by Congress this year.

Analysts Cite Possible Downtrend,"Investors in the cryptocurrency space are eagerly awaiting the halving of Bitcoin in order to fuel future market growth. However, top cryptocurrency expert and trader Benjamin Cowen cautions that if the price of BTC follows a previous pattern, there may be a correction. Bitcoin Halving Could Impact Price Negatively Cowen has highlighted a trend that could potentially lead to a significant decline in the crypto asset’s price when the Bitcoin halving event commences, which suggests that BTC could be poised for a decline in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Final Dance: Analyst Eyes Final Peak Ahead Of Halving According to Cowen, should Bitcoin continue to follow the same trajectory as it entered the spot ETF during the halving, BTC may witness a trend toward the downside. The crypto expert advocates that these patterns typically do not repeat precisely. However, he believes putting the idea out there is crucial in case it happens again in a similar manner. In response, a pseudonymous user commented on Cowen’s post and reminded the expert that he forgot the arrow backup. Responding to the user, Cowen stated that he believes the outcome of the next phase will depend on whether or not ALT/BTC pairs have collapsed by then. Furthermore, he affirms there could be a move on the upside if they have not broken down. Meanwhile, in the event that they have broken down, the pattern can transit to something new. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin halving event is forecasted to take place within the next 11 days. Given Bitcoin’s halving previous significant impact on price, BTC could be positioned for a notable price surge in the coming days. However, if Cowen’s recent prediction manifests, it could paint a different picture for the crypto asset during the halving event. The expert’s prediction has sent quite a frenzy in the crypto community, with analysts like Peter Brandt supporting his insights. Peter Brandt acknowledged Cowen’s projections noting that previous Bitcoin bull markets have exhibited a similar fundamental trend. What To Expect During The Halving Event As the halving event approaches, the cryptocurrency data analytics platform Kaiko has laid out a perspective to watch out for. Kaiko’s perspective delves into the impact the halving has had on BTC’s price in the short term over the years.

Nonetheless, historical data reveals that the coin tends to rise 9-12 months after halving, making it a generally bullish development. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was up by 8% in the past 7 days, valued at $70,770. Its overall market cap is down by over 2%, however, while its trading volume is up by over 8% in the past day.

42391034,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdT3sv,1712678400,"Venture Firm A16z Releases Jolt, a 'Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine'","Silicon Valley venture giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) made news last year when it announced that it was wading into deep tech research – switching off its investor cap to become a part-time computer science researcher and builder. On Tuesday, the firm unveiled some of the first fruits of that foray with the release of an open-source code implementation for ""Jolt,"" its zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM).  In addition to positioning a16z as a bona fide research and development firm, the new code could help blockchains – and some of a16z's own portfolio companies – scale their operations.  Virtual machines, colloquially known as VMs, are software-based computer environments that serve as the foundation for blockchains and other programs. The ""zero-knowledge"" (ZK) bit of Jolt refers to a form of cryptographic trickery that powers a16z's VM under the hood – allowing the virtual computer to process and verify data while adhering to special constraints around privacy and security.  Jolt currently supports RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) – an open-source standard for designing computer processors – and applications written in the Rust programming language. Programmers can run an application through Jolt to ""verify its execution,"" explained Eddy Lazzarin, CTO at a16z crypto. The program will ""output a 'proof' that proves that the result of that program indeed came from the correct running of that program."" A16z's big claim with Jolt is that it's ""10x"" faster than RISC Zero, its nearest competitor.  ZK cryptography has applications outside of blockchain, but ZK research has boomed in parallel with the industry's rise. So-called ""ZK proofs"" – the mathematical proofs outputted by ZK programs – have become the dominant method for helping blockchains reduce fees, increase speeds, and preserve transaction privacy.  Read more: What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?  The tech powers many of the so-called zkEVMs – zkVMs specific to Ethereum's runtime environment, known as Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM – that have emerged in recent years to make that blockchain quicker and more secure. (A16z is an investor in Matter Labs, one of the leading zkEVM makers).  ZK proofs “scale blockchains by kind of doing the hard work off-chain, and only having the blockchain verify the proofs,” Justin Thaler, an a16z researcher and associate professor at Georgetown University who co-authored the Lasso and Jolt research, explained in an interview last year. With ZK proofs, “you can get a guarantee that this work was done correctly, but not have all the blockchain nodes in the world doing all the work.”  While Jolt has not been fine-tuned for Ethereum or any other blockchain, a16z insists its tech can be layered into zkEVMs and other blockchain-based ZK applications. ""Fine-tuning specific circuits makes them very brittle. It's very hard and opaque to do that properly,"" said Lazzarin. ""Our techniques are not just simpler, but faster.""  A16z first embarked on its deep tech journey in August of last year when it announced a pair of projects: Jolt, the one that's launching today, and Lasso, a special method for powering ZK systems that undergirds some of Jolt's programming.  Read more: Andreessen Horowitz Wades Into Crypto Tech Research with ZK Projects ‘Jolt’ and ‘Lasso’  According to Lazzarin, a16z embarked on its deep-tech research journey in part as a way to improve its cache as an investor: ""I mean, why take money from someone who is just money when you can take money from someone who is right there with you at the cutting edge, doing the hardest possible things in crypto?""  But that's not the only way Lazzarin thinks a16z's research initiatives can help advance the firm's bottom line. The code for Jolt has been open-sourced, meaning anyone can theoretically use or repurpose it without paying a16z. ""Because we're long-term investors, we don't trade day-to-day, week-to-week, or even month-to-month,"" said Lazzarin. ""We benefit most if the space advances fastest over the next five to 10 years, and so our incentive is purely to advance everyone through public goods that we will never monetize.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | RESEARCH | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/09/venture-firm-a16z-releases-jolt-a-zero-knowledge-virtual-machine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4807bd4b7a5d63a1b3f436c44778d8e98e383bc8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move lower triggered the largest amount of leveraged long liquidations in a week, CoinGlass data showed.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} buckled below $69,000 as cryptocurrencies slid Tuesday, paring optimism after Monday's rally.  BTC slipped as low as $68,580 from above $71,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was recently priced near $69,000, down about 4% over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.  The drop echoed through the crypto markets, with the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) losing 3.2% in the same period. Ether {{ETH}} fell below $3,500, almost 4% lower, and major altcoins solana {{SOL}} and dogecoin {{DOGE}} slid as much as 6% to 7%.

The Company's balance sheet is strong with ample liquidity, giving it a material competitive advantage. The Company has outperformed the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miner's ETF since that ETF's inception. Introduction In this article, I continue my coverage of crypto miners by examining Cipher Mining, Inc. ( CIFR ) (the "" Company ""). Recent articles have covered Bitfarms Ltd. ("" BITF "") and TeraWulf Inc. ("" WULF "") and, in this article, I will compare the Company to those two competitor miners. In the past, I have also covered Argo Blockchain Ltd . ("" Argo "") and hope to post an update article on Argo in the near future. Relative to BITF and WULF, I am upbeat about the Company and have purchased a small position in the crypto miner. At this juncture, I think the Company is a speculative BUY for several reasons, which will be discussed below. Before I address those reasons, however, I have included some background information with respect to the Company. Brief Background Per its recent 2023 Form 10K (Annual Report) Filing (the "" 2023 10-K ""), the Company styles itself as an emerging technology company. The Company develops and operates four (4) industrial scale bitcoin mining data centers in Texas. A fifth Texas mining data center is in development, and the Company has ambitious expansion plans beyond that. Per the 2023 10-K (linked above): Our key mission is to expand and strengthen the Bitcoin network’s critical infrastructure. As of February 29, 2024, we operated approximately 80,000 miners, with an aggregate hashrate capacity of approximately 8.4 exahash per second (“EH/s”), deploying approximately 267 megawatts (“MW”) of electricity, of which we owned approximately 70,000 miners, with an aggregate hashrate capacity of approximately 7.4 EH/s, deploying approximately 236 MW of electricity."" There are several other articles on Seeking Alpha which provide background data regarding the Company. See also the Company's website . For purposes of this article, my focus is primarily on financial data. Speculative Buy Rationale I own shares of the Company for several reasons: First, I remain bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ("" Bitcoin "") because of reckless U.S. fiscal spending , and the Company is leveraged to the price of Bitcoin -- and probably more so than many of its competitors. Second, the Company's stock performance is outpacing both the S&P 500 and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) (the "" Bitcoin Miners ETF "") since the inception of the Bitcoin Miners ETF. Seeking Alpha While the Company's stock performance has been impressive over such period, it is hard to believe it can continue at this pace unless the Company can start to report positive GAAP earnings. Unlike many of its competitors, however, the Company is doing just that (see Third below). Third, per the recent earnings release, the Company achieved GAAP profitability for the fourth quarter of 2023: We are delighted to announce our fourth quarter 2023 results, which reflect our first full quarter in which all four of our data centers were operating at full capacity. We delivered a quarter with strong positive net income on both a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis. And while recent FASB accounting changes have been a tailwind for all the miners’ earnings, Cipher was net positive for the quarter even without those accounting changes,” said Tyler Page, CEO of Cipher. “These record results are driven by our best-in-class unit economics.” Specifically, for the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported results which compared favorably to the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4, 23 Q3, 23 Q4, 22 Revenue (millions) $43.4 30.3 $3.0 GAAP Net Earnings (millions) $10.6 (17.7) ($51.6) Bitcoin Mined 1,327 1078 377 For Q3, 2023 data, see the 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Notably, for the fourth quarter of 2023, BITF and WULF lost $57.4 million and $10.5 million , respectively. Fourth, the Company has a strong liquidity position relative to BITF and WULF. December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Company BITF WULF Cash $86,105 $84,038 $54,439 Bitcoin/Digital Assets $32,978 $31,870 $1,801 Total Liabilities $74,801 $83,963 $155,617 Source: For Company data, see the 2023 10K; for BITF data, see here ; and for WULF data, see here . Fifth, the Company is not diluting its shareholders at the same rate as many of its competitors. Over the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, the Company increased its share count by less than 20%. BITF and WULF, on the other hand, have not been as shareholder friendly. The table below shows that common stock outstanding for the Company at the end of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, as per the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder Equity included in the 2023 10-K and the 2022 10-K Annual Report (the "" 2022 10-K ""), respectively. Date No. of Common Shares Outstanding (Company) 12/31/2021 252,131,679 12/31/2022 251,095,305 12/31/2023 296,276,536 Bitfarms The table below shows that BITF's dilution of its common stockholders over the last two years has been greater than the dilution experienced by holders of the Company's common stock. Date No. of Common Shares Outstanding 12/31/2021 194,806,000 12/31/2022 224,200,000 12/31/2023 334,153,000 TeraWulf The table below show that WULF's dilution of its common stockholders over the last two years has been far greater than the dilution experienced by holders of the Company's common stock. Date No. of Common Shares Outstanding 12/31/2021 99,976,253 12/31/2022 145,492,971 12/31/2023 276,733,329 The numbers provided above speak for themselves, and I expect the Company's advantages to compound relative to those two competitors, at a minimum. In this regard, it is not surprising that the Company has materially outperformed BITF and WULF for the January 1, 2022 through April 8, 2024 period. Seeking Alpha For the reasons outlined above, on a relative basis, I like the Company's prospects compared to those of BITF and WULF. Q4 2023 Earnings On March 05, 2024, the Company announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. In that announcement, the Company's CEO highlighted that: We are particularly excited about our expansion plans for 2024 and 2025. We expect to be at 9.3 EH/s by the end of Q3 2024 via the fully funded expansions at our Bear and Chief data centers and over 16 EH/s in the first half of 2025 via the fully funded phase one build of our Black Pearl data center. We have the potential to grow to 25 EH/s by the end of 2025 with the eventual completion of Black Pearl. We have already seen the results we can achieve with our operational leverage. With the strength of our balance sheet, our expansion plans and proven track record on execution, we expect to be a clear winner through the halving and into the next cycle.” The Company also highlighted ""record revenues and net profits on both a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of operations since inception with fully deployed data centers"" and, as part of its expansion plans, closure of an ""acquisition of the 300 MW Black Pearl facility...."" Review of Balance Sheet Selected Balance Sheet Items (in thousands) Dec. 31, 2023 Dec. 31., 2022 Dec.31, 2021 Cash 86,105 11,927 209,841 Digital Currency 32,978 6,283 ----- Total Current Assets 155,498 47,735 223,660 Total Assets $566,137 $418,463 $354,167 Total Current Liabilities 33,793 40,326 499 Total Liabilities $74,801 $75,571 $636 Accumulated Deficit (136,777) (111,209) (72,156) Total Equity $491,336 $342,892 $353,531 Source: 2023 10K and 2022 10k. A couple of things stand out in looking at three years of balance sheet figures. First, the asset base has grown each year, while liabilities have stabilized. Notably, the Company does not have any debt, although it does have capital and operating leases that show up on the balance sheet as non-current liabilities. Second, shareholder equity has increased materially off of the 2022 base, and the growth in the accumulated deficit is slowing. Should the Company continue to build on its profitable 2023 fourth quarter, that deficit should decline in 2024. Third, as was discussed earlier in the article, the Company is demonstrating excellent liquidity, with current assets exceeding current liabilities at roughly 4.6X. Fourth, because the Company's liquidity is solid, there is no pressure on the Company to raise funds and dilute shareholders. Moreover, with no debt, the Company is not being run for the benefit of creditors, as is the case with some over-indebted crypto miners. Risks and Conclusion General Risks The risks of investing in the Company are included in the 2023 10-K linked above. Particular concerns about investing in the Company include the volatility of Bitcoin and the capital intensive nature of the business, and the overall competitiveness of the industry. Bitcoin Halving In addition, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event (the "" Halving Event "") will make it more difficult for the crypto miners to generate revenue absent a material increase in the price of Bitcoin. The Halving Event is expected to occur on April 20, 2024 . Specifically, the Halving Event will result in the reduction of Bitcoin rewards for mining a block by 50% (from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin). Should the price of Bitcoin fail to rise after the Halving Event, the Company's revenue related to mining new coins could decline and such decline could be material. In its 2023 10-K, the Company describes the Halving Event risk as follows: Our revenues are directly impacted by changes in the market value of bitcoin. For example, the average bitcoin price for 2021 and 2022 was $47,385 and $16,526, respectively. Bitcoin price generally increased throughout 2023. As at December 31, 2023, the price of bitcoin was $42,288. Furthermore, block rewards are fixed at 6.25 per block, and it is estimated that it will halve again to 3.125 per block in April 2024. The halving events happen without any regard to ongoing demand, meaning that if the ongoing demand remains the same after a halving event, whatever demand was being met by new supply will be restricted, which may necessitate an adjustment of the price of bitcoin, though there is no definitive evidence of a causal link between bitcoin's programmatic decrease in supply and broadening demand. Once the halving occurs, we expect that it could have a negative impact on our revenues as the reward for Bitcoin mined will be reduced."" [Emphasis Supplied] Conclusion The above risks notwithstanding, based on my analysis of the financial data, I think the Company, which was previously unknown to me, could be one of the longer term winners in the space (assuming there will be winners, which is not guaranteed). In summary, for the reasons set forth in this article, on pullbacks, the Company is a BUY for the speculative part of your portfolio.

The money will help in the development of its faster version of the Ethereum blockchain that is compatible with existing DeFi applications.  Monad Labs, which is looking to develop a faster version of the Ethereum blockchain, said it raised $225 million in a funding round led by Paradigm that will allow it to add staff and spend on bringing the test version of its blockchain into production.  The layer-1 blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that executes the rules of Ethereum and makes sure submitted transactions and smart contracts follow the rules. More than 96% of the capital invested in decentralized finance (DeFi) is processed by the EVM, Monad said in a post on Substack.  However, while Ethereum processes fewer than 20 transactions per second, according to etherscan.io, Monad says its testnet, which went live in March, can handle some 10,000 TPS.  Ethereum's speed, or lack of it, has spurred many efforts to provide a faster DeFi environment, including alternative layer-1 blockchains such as Solana and Cardano and layer-2 chains that bundle, or roll up, transactions and process them at a faster pace before sending them back to Ethereum for validation.  Monad said it rewrote the blockchain code, introducing techniques such as parallel execution to optimize performance at all levels of the protocol, to improve throughput.  Other investors in the round included Electric Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Animoca Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and CoinFund.

Bitcoin Fire Sale Imminent In his blog post, Hayes provided a detailed analysis, explaining his perspectives on how the Bitcoin halving event would adversely affect the price of the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When The Bitcoin halving is an occurrence that takes place every four years which reduces Bitcoin miner block rewards by half. This, in turn, decreases the amount of Bitcoin created and leads to an increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. While most analysts in the crypto market anticipate a bullish rally for Bitcoin and other altcoins during the halving event, Hayes holds a more contradictory view, suggesting that the halving period could instead initiate a more bearish action than expected. Hayes has acknowledged that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to pump during the halving period, at least in the medium term. However, the BitMEX co-founder has also predicted that the price action of Bitcoin both before and after the halving event could potentially turn negative. He revealed that because the 2024 Bitcoin halving coincides with a period of diminished liquidity in the United States Dollar (USD), it could potentially ignite a “raging fire sale for crypto assets.” The crypto founder also foresees the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plummeting around this time. As a result, Hayes has advised the broader crypto community to refrain from trading cryptocurrencies during this period. He emphasized that when the majority of the market participants agree on a specific outcome, such as a rally induced by the Bitcoin halving, the market tends to move in the opposite direction. Despite his captivating predictions, Hayes conceded that the crypto market could defy his bearish forecasts, essentially recognizing the speculative nature of his prediction. Hayes Says April Is The Best Time To Short Sell In his blog post, Hayes unveiled that the period from April 15 to May 1, 2024, would be precarious for risky assets in the financial sector. This is attributed to tax payments draining liquidity from the system and Quantitative Tightening (QT) accelerating during this timeframe. Related Reading: Expert Maps Out Timeline For The XRP Price To Cross $1,000 The crypto founder has suggested that this period might potentially present a prime short position for traders, indicating that April could be the ideal month for short selling.

The token will have a total supply of 1 billion, and 10% of the supply will be initially allocated to community members and stakers through an airdrop.  Zeta Markets, one of the top five decentralized derivatives platforms on Solana, announced the launch and airdrop of its native token Z on Tuesday in a bid to become a community-driven protocol.  The governance token will empower Zeta users and community members from the broader Solana ecosystem to weigh on important decisions within Zeta and provide additional rewards to token stakers, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The Z token will have a total supply of 1 billion, of which 10% will be initially distributed through an airdrop to active Zeta traders and community members, stakers of the Z token, and Zeta users belonging to strategic Solana communities.  Active traders will receive 50% of the initial distribution based on their Z-score, or Zeta’s point system that rewards platform users. Stakers of Z will receive 40%, while the rest will go to strategic Solana community members.  Besides, Zeta will use 30% of the token supply to incentivize market makers, the key players in ensuring top-tier liquidity and optimal exchange conditions. Market makers are entities tasked with creating buy and sell orders in an order book and maintaining healthy liquidity that facilitates the execution of large orders at stable prices.  The press release added that the governance token’s debut is part of a broader strategy, including plans to release Solana’s first layer 2 scaling solution.  “Zeta’s vision from day one has been to make decentralized finance a viable alternative to centralized, black-box financial systems. With a platform that has already stood the test of time and facilitated billions in volume for tens of thousands of traders, we’re excited to launch Z, the governance token of Zeta, to closely align the long-term interests of users with the protocol,” Tristan Frizza, Founder of Zeta Markets said.  “This will empower the community to shape the future trajectory of the protocol and weigh in on important decisions as we collectively strive to deliver the ultimate DEX experience,” Frizza added.

Mara Schmiedt, 29, wants to solve this problem with her software company Alluvial. Alluvial works with clients like Coinbase, Bitcoin Suisse, Figment and six other crypto platforms to stake ether for their users. Thanks to Alluvial, ether owners are able to sell their cryptocurrency to users on competing platforms--increasing the pool of potential buyers. ""Visa was a company that was built in collaboration with competing companies,"" she says. ""We have the same model. We connect many different platforms together to build that market, and that is really hard to do.""

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) is sticking to his guns that Congress can produce a stablecoin regulation law before he retires at the end of the year, despite a volatile political climate and the failure of the full U.S. House to vote on a bill his House Financial Services Committee passed previously.  ""I think we can get our stablecoin policy set through and signed into law,"" McHenry said Tuesday at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event in Washington. ""That will be the first sign that there is hope and that there is bipartisanship when it comes to this world of digital assets.""  While individual U.S. senators have produced legislation that would address stablecoins – the tokens pegged to steady assets such as the dollar – the Senate Banking Committee hasn't yet taken any of it up. Both chambers would need to pass a bill that President Joe Biden would then be willing to sign.  McHenry has been negotiating stablecoin legislation with members of his party and House Democrats for months, and when a bill cleared his committee, it did so with the support of several Democrats. But there has been some resistance from the administration and from the panel's top Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), about the role of the federal government in overseeing stablecoin issuers.  Lawmakers have long seen this corner of the crypto sector as the easiest to establish regulation over, but predictions of pending legislative success have often been stymied by the realities of a chaotic, closely divided Congress.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/09/key-congressman-mchenry-is-bullish-us-stablecoin-law-will-pass-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/946125788cce2706d8eee32022b6db20f413bef7-1536x864.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25455993,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602217,1712671247,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price On The Verge Of Major Breakout, Here’s Why","Since reaching its peak for the year at $0.00004749 over a month ago, on March 5, the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has fallen by approximately 40%. Nonetheless, there may be brighter days ahead. Following a meteoric rise of 390% in just eight days from the end of February till the beginning of March, a period of consolidation was inevitable for the SHIB price. However, this phase could be drawing to a close. Shiba Inu Price About To Surge 65%? On the daily chart, the meme coin is exhibiting a critical chart pattern that suggests a significant price movement may be imminent. The analysis of the daily SHIB/USD chart reveals the emergence of a symmetrical triangle pattern. This classic chart pattern is generally considered a continuation pattern, typically heralding an uptick in volatility. Given that SHIB has been on a notably strong uptrend, the momentum could swing back in favor of the bulls. Over the past five weeks, the price of SHIB has been making a series of lower highs and higher lows, which is evident from the converging trend lines that are containing the price action. The apex of the triangle is fast approaching, suggesting that a breakout is imminent. This type of consolidation suggests market indecision, and as the pattern reaches its conclusion, we can expect a significant move in either direction. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When The current price at the time of the analysis is $0.00002842. Notably, the volume has been declining as the pattern developed, which is typical during the formation of a symmetrical triangle and further validates the pattern. Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) also paint a crucial picture. The 20-day EMA is flatlining, suggesting a neutral short-term trend, while the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs are all trending upward, providing strong support levels. Particularly, the price is currently above the 20-day EMA, which is positioned at approximately $0.00002817, and this level could act as a strong support in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near the 52.40 level, which is slightly above the midpoint of 50 that separates bullish momentum from bearish momentum. The RSI level indicates a neutral stance in the market momentum but leaves room for an upward push should the market sentiment sway positively. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fires Up With 4,000% Burn – Price Rebound Coming? In terms of deriving price targets from this pattern, technical analysts typically measure the height of the triangle at its widest part and project that distance from the point of breakout. If SHIB breaks above the triangle, the price could surge, targeting the height of the triangle, which could be in the region of the yearly high at approximately $0.000048, considering the widest part of the pattern. This would translate into a 65% price rally from the current price. Conversely, a downward breakout could send the price to test the $0.00001500 level, which would be the equivalent target on the downside. It is important to mention that while symmetrical triangles can lead to a substantial breakout, the direction is not certain until a clear breakout occurs with an accompanying increase in volume. Traders and investors need to watch for a daily close outside of the triangle’s boundaries, with increased volume, to confirm the direction of the breakout.

After a stellar start to 2024, Sui’s Total Value Locked (TVL) – a metric reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited in its DeFi protocols – surged to a record $724 million in late March. However, this celebratory moment proved fleeting, as the platform has since experienced a downward trend. Related Reading: Don’t Miss The Boat! Ethereum Whales Signal Bullish Run With $40 Million Bet SUI TVL Takes A Tumble Despite the recent decline, Sui’s TVL currently sits at a healthy $654 million, according to DeFiLlama. This translates to a 12% drop from its peak, showcasing a correction following its initial surge. However, it’s important to note that Sui remains in a positive light compared to some established players. SUI TVL. Source: Defillama Silver Linings For Sui While the recent dip might raise concerns, Sui boasts a more optimistic outlook when considering a broader timeframe. Compared to its New Year’s Day value, the current TVL represents a significant 25.5% increase. This upward trajectory extends further back, with a staggering 68% growth since the beginning of the year. This impressive background performance fuels optimism for Sui’s potential to regain its momentum, potentially propelling it towards a coveted spot amongst the top 10 DeFi chains. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.571 trillion. Chart: TradingView SUI Token Mirrors Market Trends The price of Sui’s native token (SUI) reflects a similar pattern to its TVL. Currently trading at $1.65, SUI has shed nearly 30% of its value compared to its all-time high of $2.20 reached in late March. Despite the recent slump, SUI has managed a modest 2% daily increase. However, zooming out reveals a 11% loss over the past week. SUI price action in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap. Can Sui Recover its DeFi Mojo? Regaining the lost TVL will be a key test for Sui’s development team. Identifying the reasons behind the user exodus is essential. Were there any security concerns or technical glitches that caused users to pull their funds? Transparency and addressing these issues head-on will be critical for rebuilding user confidence. Related Reading: Filecoin Bull Run On The Horizon? Analyst Sees 250% Surge Building A Thriving DEX Ecosystem Is Vital Meanwhile, a vibrant DEX ecosystem is another pillar for Sui’s future. Decentralized Exchanges allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a centralized intermediary. Fostering a healthy DEX landscape will attract more users and liquidity to the Sui blockchain, ultimately boosting its TVL. Enticing established DEX protocols to migrate to Sui or supporting the development of native DEX solutions could be effective strategies.

Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano and former TechCrunch reporter Jacquelyn Melinek are behind a new crypto communications startup, Token Relations.  Not quite a media brand or a PR shop, Token Relations instead will give clients a direct path to talking to their ""community"" about metrics, milestones, product launches – the kinds of things that don't always fit neatly into a marketing plan, the two told CoinDesk in a recent interview.  Token Relations will seek to partly displace X, formerly Twitter, the chaotic catch-all for nearly every piece of content currently released by crypto companies. Crypto Twitter's ""one-to-many"" distribution model prevents companies from getting their message to their core audiences, Pompliano said.  ""We're stepping in as a dedicated effort to communicate to your existing stakeholders,"" the podcast host and investor said. He called Token Relations a ""third bucket"" separate from ""marketing intended to get new users,"" and ""PR, intended to talk to the press.""  Token Relations enters an industry whose loudest voices are perhaps well-attuned to debating media theory and the value (or lack thereof) of talking through the press. Last week the widely followed entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan railed against PR companies as a ""sleeper cell"" for what he described as tech-hating journalists, advocating instead for founders to go ""direct.""  Pompliano and Melinek aren't quite creating a PR shop for their clients, who include entities associated with blockchain projects Avalanche, Optimism and Aptos. The startup is instead betting on direct channels, be it video interview content or newsletters disseminated to crypto buffs who want to be most in-the-know.  The startup seeks to solve a decidedly crypto problem. No other industry has quite the same mashup of stakeholders whose interests can be financialized (token holders), career-focused (developers) and even cultural. They want to know what's going on, direct from the source and unfiltered through media, according to Token Relations' founders.  Crypto's comms landscape is also unruly: There's no regulator in crypto pushing token-issuing startups toward making streamlined portals for disseminating critical information to their stakeholders, as with publicly traded companies and their investor relations websites.  Instead, there's the black box of social media algorithms that Pompliano said suppress and lose information.

Bitcoin fell to $70,800, with traders expecting the price to range between $69,000 and $73,000. “Some liquidations will take place this week which shall test both resistance and support levels for a short term as we have seen this morning,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETP specialist at CEC Capital. Kssis warned that the market might witness further downward pressure during the weekfollowing bitcoin’s halving later this month.  The percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply that last moved on-chain at least a year ago declined to the lowest since October 2022, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. On Monday, 12.95 million BTC, equating to 65.84% of the circulating supply of 19.67 million BTC, remained unchanged for over a year, the lowest percentage since October 2022. The metric peaked above 70% with the debut of nearly a dozen spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in mid-January and has been falling ever since. Since late December, the percentage of the circulating supply that has not moved in at least two years has fallen to 54% from 57.4%. The decline likely represents profit-taking by investors who held coins for one year and over and marks a shift from the holding strategy seen through 2023.  Filecoin liquid-staking platform STFIL said some of its team members are under investigation by the Chinese police. STFIL, which has just under $40 million total value locked (TVL) on its platform, said the core technical team is being investigated and that lawyers have been hired to provide assistance to the individuals, according to a post on X on Tuesday. Furthermore, tokens on the platform were moved to an ""unknown, external address"" last week while its team members were under detention. The address in question holds over 2.5 million FIL tokens worth around $23 million.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of active or open call options tied to Solana's SOL token across maturities on the leading derivatives cryptocurrency exchange, Deribit.  Maximum open interest is concentrated in strikes above $200, indicating a bullish market bias.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a later date at a predetermined price.

The insider suggested that VET’s tepid price action is a strategic ploy by the team, and the token will eventually make a parabolic rise when the time comes. VeChain Will “Reach The Finish Line” The self-claimed insider known as ‘VeChain Whale’ admitted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that VET’s price is slow but added that the token will “reach the finish line.” He made this statement while comparing VET to a “snail” in terms of price action. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals What To Expect For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP In 12-16 Months VeChain Whale further revealed that the team could “pump the token” if they wanted but haven’t because of fear of “regulation and other factors.” The claim about regulation looks to be related to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the fear that the network could face regulatory scrutiny from the Commission. The VeChain “insider” also claimed that the team wasn’t worried about VET’s price because they were aware that “90% of tokens will vanish” after the bull run, but VeChain would still be around. That is why they are choosing to play the “snail game,” unlike the other tokens that “do whatever to gain attractions and move up in the ranking at all cost.” VeChain Whale added. As expected, VeChain Whale’s post attracted criticism from crypto community members who questioned when he became a VeChain insider. In response, VeChain Whale stated that he needed to prove the doubters wrong and suggested that a major announcement was coming in June, which would make those doubting him now offer an apology when the time came. VET’s Price Set To “Explode” In a subsequent X post, he mentioned that the team would make many announcements in the next two months, which would cause VET’s price to “explode.” He further assured VET holders that they can expect to see a 10x increase in the token’s price by June. Related Reading: Skybridge CEO Says Bitcoin Can Reach Half Of Gold Market, How Much Will BTC Be? Meanwhile, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto previously provided some insights into how high VET’s price could rise when the time comes, mentioning that the crypto token could see a 140x increase in its price. However, Egrag failed to say when precisely this parabolic price surge will happen. Crypto analyst and YouTuber Crypto ZX also once predicted that VET was primed to enjoy significant price increases and further stated that the crypto token could hit new all-time highs (ATHs) if it succeeded in breaking certain resistance levels. At the time of writing, VET is trading at around $0.0455, up over 7% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42391032,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdT3if,1712664000,Financial Stability Study Calls for Consistent Regulatory Response to Stablecoins,"Countries around the world must ensure consistency in their approaches to regulating stablecoins, a new report by the Financial Stability Institute says.  Differing approaches could pose challenges to an integrated financial system, the FSI added in its report.  Countries need to make their regulatory frameworks for stablecoins consistent with one another, the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) warned in a report published Tuesday.  The FSI, jointly created by the Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is tasked with assisting regulators worldwide in strengthening their financial systems. The institute's report on policy implementation insights for stablecoins – which refers to cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets such as sovereign currencies – warns of the dangers of fragmentation in supervision across the world.  ""Stablecoins may still be unregulated or lightly regulated in other jurisdictions,"" said the report, authored by FSI Deputy Chair Juan Carlos Crisanto and Senior Advisors Johannes Ehrentraud and Denise Garcia Ocampo.  The authors argued that while many regulatory approaches have similarities when it comes to key requirements, the differences are largely driven by the variety of stablecoin design features and perceived risks. The report warned that this fragmentation in approaches to supervision could pose challenges to an integrated financial system and threaten financial stability.  Nations around the world have been exploring how to regulate stablecoins for several years. The U.K., for instance, passed legislation to recognize stablecoins as a means of payment in 2023, while the European Union passed the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) to supervise issuers and service providers handling stablecoins. Japan too has started regulating stablecoins, while the U.S. is considering a stablecoin bill.  The FSI report says jurisdictions have varying definitions and categorizations for stablecoins that may pose a risk to financial stability. There are also discrepancies in requirements for the disclosure of reserve assets kept by stablecoin issuers to maintain the crypto's value against its reference currency.  ""A consistent regulatory framework, as well as its global implementation, is essential to address stablecoins’ risks, prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure a level playing field in the digital asset ecosystem,"" the FSI report said.  Ensuring the interoperability of stablecoins with central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and other digital assets would also be key to promoting an integrated financial system, the report added.  Global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) have issued or are working on universal norms for stablecoins.

42391023,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdT2tN,1712662058,Fantom Cofounder Mulls Idea for 'Safer' Meme Coins,"Andre Cronje proposed a plan to issue meme coins on the Fantom network, addressing risks such as team dumping tokens and removing liquidity.  The plan includes allocating tokens for team expenses, marketing, and liquidity pool support, focusing on fair distribution and investor safety.  Fantom Foundation co-founder Andre Cronje on Tuesday proposed a plan to fairly and safely issue meme coins on the network, aiming to sidestep risks associated with buying non-serious tokens.  Issuing and trading meme coins has become a fun and multibillion-dollar sector among crypto investors in the past year. An ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana and Base networks has netted millions in profits for platform owners and users, but it comes with risks for the community and investors.  Some risks include teams dumping tokens after creating social media hype, early investors selling large amounts, removal of liquidity, and developers having access to change code for tokens, Cronje said.  The proposed plan is to issue tokens with the Fantom Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to Fantom blockchain's development and maintenance, as one of the signers controlling the token’s liquidity pools.  “Up to 5% of the tokens to support the meme team expenses. This will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from 2 project members and at least 1 foundation member,” Cronje said.  “The remaining 85% of the tokens will be put up in a FTM/token LP in foundation multisig. An amount of 100,000 FTM will be provided. Any Fantom-based exchange can be nominated for LP,” he added. LP refers to liquidity pool, a smart contract on an exchange that holds two or more tokens and facilitates trading.  Up to 10% of tokens can be allocated for marketing-related expenses, such as exchange listings, and will be locked in a multisig requiring signatures from two project members and at least one Foundation member.  “Should the FTM in the LP token reach at least 2,000,000 FTM, the original provided 100,000 FTM (5%) will be removed to cover the initial cost and the rest of the LP will be burned,” Cronje added.  Fantom’s Cronje is the latest in a line of blockchain teams that aren’t shying away from engaging with meme coins directly – marking a clear departure from previous cycles in which such tokens were treated as mere tradeable assets.  Avalanche Foundation, a similar body for the Avalanche network, earlier this year announced a fund that invested directly in and supported the growth of meme coins (which it termed culture coins). In March, it invested in five tokens.  Last week, BNB Chain developers unveiled a $1 million prize pool that attracted submissions from developers behind meme coins. The pool aimed to award projects it deemed unique for investing in their future growth.",POSITIVE,FTM,AVAX | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FTM | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/09/fantom-cofounder-mulls-idea-for-safer-meme-coins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec42862086a9b35e22a6a2f7d9aad390d8948435-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There have been signs of early adoption by payment firms such as Paypal and Visa, the broker said.  Stablecoin supply is growing, the report noted.  The stablecoin market is growing and these cryptocurrencies are being adopted for cross-border settlements with payments firms, fintech companies and consumer platforms among the early users, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Tuesday.  Bernstein notes that stablecoin supply currently stands at $150 billion, with tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) dominating the market with shares of 75% and 22% respectively. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that’s usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets such as gold are also used.  “Stablecoin value settled on the blockchain indicates strong adoption of digital dollar with the crypto trading ecosystem as well as a cross-border payments currency,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote, noting that “Q1 2024 annualized value transferred stands at $6.8 trillion, equivalent to 2022 high of ~$7 trillion.”  The authors said there have been signs of stablecoin adoption by payments firms such as Paypal (PYPL) and Visa (V) and consumer fintech platforms such as Grab (GRAB) in Singapore and Mercado Libre (MELI) in Latin America.  Solana is leading the field in blockchain payments, but has scalability issues, the report said. “The big change this cycle has been the dominant market share of Solana (43% highest share) in value of stablecoins transferred versus prior cycle market leader Ethereum,”  Solana is conducting pilots with Visa and Shopify, but it's unclear whether the blockchain can break into more mainstream consumer and business-to-business payments, which would require a massive jump in scalability, the note said.  “Scalability requirements for consumer payments would require 15-20 fold growth from here (Solana ~700 TPS versus 10K+ for payment networks), and general purpose blockchains are yet to cross that chasm,” the report added.

The decline probably indicates profit-taking by some investors in a rising market.  The percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply that last moved on-chain at least a year ago has declined to the lowest since October 2022, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  On Monday, 12.95 million BTC, equating to 65.84% of the circulating supply of 19.67 million BTC, remained unchanged for over a year, the lowest percentage since October 2022. The metric peaked above 70% with the debut of nearly a dozen spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in mid-January and has been falling ever since.  Since late December, the percentage of the circulating supply that has not moved in at least two years has declined to 54.% from 57.4%.  The decline likely represents profit-taking by investors who held coins for one year and over and marks a shift from the holding strategy seen through 2023.  The urge to sell likely stems from bitcoin's massive 148% price surge since April last year and the 50% rally since the ETFs began trading in the U.S. At press time, bitcoin changed hands at $70,400. However, it's difficult to ascertain the exact percentage of bitcoin that left the inactive supply has been liquidated in the market.  According to the data tracking website MacroMicro, a decrease in the percentage of inactive BTC is a ""leading indicator for the end of the bull run.""  Past data, however, show that bull markets tend to peak as the percentage of inactive supply bottoms out and begin rising.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/09/bitcoin-supply-inactive-for-a-year-slides-to-18-month-low-of-658,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67d8815156a51253c97b6c6610cc5a845e9a4cc9-2112x1275.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price increase, coupled with bullish analyst predictions, has ignited optimism for FIL’s future. Related Reading: Don’t Miss The Boat!

Source: Coingecko Filecoin Price Poised For A Rally? Technical analysis plays a crucial role in predicting cryptocurrency prices. Analysts like “World Of Charts” emphasize the importance of retesting key support levels. A successful retest, they argue, could pave the way for a significant bullish wave, with estimates ranging from 200% to 250% price increase for FIL. $Fil#Fil Testing Key Support (Accumulation Zone) Real Move Can Start After Successful Retest Expecting 200-250% Bullish Wave Incase Of Successful Retest #Crypto pic.twitter.com/3n0BpklAxh — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) April 7, 2024 In 2023, Filecoin experienced its peak performance, with FIL prices surging by 130% from $3.00 to $6.85. Conversely, 2022 marked its lowest point, witnessing a drastic drop of 90% from $34.20 to $3.05. Over the past five years, Filecoin has maintained an average yearly growth rate of 4.05%. Typically, Filecoin tends to shine brightest in the first quarter, boasting an average gain of 190%, while its performance tends to falter in the second quarter, often resulting in a loss of 58%. FIL market cap currently at $4.7 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Analyst Shares His Views This sentiment of World of Charts is echoed by other market observers. “Captain Faibik,” another analyst, encourages investors to capitalize on price dips, expressing confidence in FIL’s future appreciation. Such endorsements can significantly influence investor sentiment and contribute to the overall market dynamics for FIL. $FIL #Filecoin Buy the dip Now, you’ll thank me later. 🔜🚀 pic.twitter.com/9HLyZzteRu — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) April 7, 2024 Will Filecoin Reach $20? Meanwhile, analysis of Filecoin’s (FIL) potential ascent to $20 demands a comprehensive examination given its current dynamics. Despite FIL showcasing strengths like a 65% price surge over the past year and consistent trading above the 200-day simple moving average, several factors could hinder such a substantial climb. Related Reading: PEPE In Peril? Dwindling Exchange Supply Raises Price Jitters Although FIL has seen 15 green days in the last month, indicating short-term bullish sentiment, it has been outpaced by 60% of the top 100 crypto assets, including leading ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, FIL remains -96% down from its all-time high, indicating a significant historical price decline. Moreover, FIL faces challenges due to its high yearly inflation rate of 28.81%, despite its strong liquidity demonstrated by its market capitalization. Thus, while the $20 target for FIL isn’t out of reach, attaining it would likely necessitate a sustained positive market sentiment, improved performance relative to other assets, and effective management of inflationary pressures.

The move aims to reduce yen exposure and offer Japanese investors crypto access with a preferential tax structure.  Metaplanet (3350), a Web3 infrastructure provider, saw its Tokyo-listed stock rise almost 90% in two days after saying it was adding $6.56 million in bitcoin {{BTC}} to its balance sheet in partnership with Sora Ventures, Morgan Creek Capital's Mark Yusko and others.  The company, which started as a budget hotel operator under the name Red Planet before becoming a Web3 software developer, said it is looking to minimize its exposure to the Japanese yen.  The yen, the company wrote in an update to shareholders, has been damaged by Japan's generation-long low-interest-rate environment that has eroded its position as a key global currency. In March, the central bank increased short-term interest rates to 0-0.1% from minus 0.1%, the first increase in the rate for 17 years.  ""The Company’s decision to incorporate Bitcoin into its treasury assets is driven by a multifaceted understanding of its potential as a hedge against inflation, a tool for macroeconomic resilience, and a basis for long-term capital appreciation,"" it wrote.  The strategy also mimics that of Tysons Corner, Virginia-based MicroStrategy, the software developer that in 2020 said it would start building up its holdings of bitcoin. Since then, its stock price has often mirrored the fluctuations in bitcoin's price, reflecting investor sentiment toward the cryptocurrency market. It is now the largest corporate owner of bitcoin, according to bitcointreasuries.net, holding more than 214,000 valued at more than $15 billion.  In a post on X, Jason Fang, managing partner and co-founder at Sora Ventures, which participated in the partnership to add bitcoin to Metaplanet's balance sheet, highlighted it as a way for Japanese investors to get exposure to crypto through a publicly traded company instead of holding the asset itself, which is subject to a high tax on unrealized crypto gains.  This tax is controversial and has been debated and modified by lawmakers since it was first introduced. In June 2023, Japan's National Tax Agency announced that tokens issued by crypto startups would be exempt from the rules.  Bitcoin is currently trading around $70,500, according to CoinDesk Indices data.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/09/metaplanet-shares-soar-as-japanese-firm-mimics-microstrategy-on-bitcoin-buying,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db098663204a34ba46394ebc74f1a9958c9571e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform allows users to create tokens with $2 and offers an inbuilt safety mechanism against scams like rug pulls, making it an attractive option for traders interested in meme coins.  Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world.  Pump, a meme coin generator platform, has earned over $5 million in fees since going live in March amid an ongoing meme coin frenzy on Solana, making it one of the biggest revenue-generating applications in a relatively short period.  The platform made $300,000 in the past 24 hours alone on Solana, data shows, contributing a significant chunk to the network’s total generated fees of $2.5 million. Annual revenue projections based on current usage and growth are about $66 million, DefiLlama data shows.  Pump lets anyone issue a token for $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned. Last week, the platform also extended support to the Blast and Base networks.  The draw for traders is a supposed inbuilt safety mechanism: “Rug pulls,” a common crypto scam that sees token issuers drain liquidity, aren’t possible on Pump-issued tokens.  “Pump prevents rugs by making sure that all created tokens are safe. Each coin on Pump is a fair launch with no pre-sale and no team allocation,” its site says.  The ease of usage means new tokens are created nearly every other second. CoinDesk calculated a total of 35 issuances in a one-minute period in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, although this figure is likely to wildly change based on timezones and interest in new types of memes.  While there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million.  The largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively.  Cat memes are a popular draw for issuers, although popular Pump tokens range from a can of Arizona Iced Tea and Lord of the Rings character Gandalf to a pixelated image of a rubber duck.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/09/solana-meme-coin-generator-pump-on-track-for-66m-yearly-revenue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cec511dc7142e3298608f2bdaa37966a00165c7-1262x710.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. tax payments could suck dollar liquidity from the financial system, fueling risk aversion and a fire sale of risk assets, Hayes said.  Gear up for some pain in the digital assets market.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, will probably face selling pressure in the days before and after the mining-reward halving due April 20, a supposedly bullish event.  That's the message from Arthur Hayes, a co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX and the chief investment officer at Maelstrom.  In his latest blog post, ""Heatwave,"" Hayes explained that the bullish halving narrative is ""well entrenched,"" leaving the doors open for a so-called price correction. In crypto, a correction is considered a price drop of at least 10%.  Read More: Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?  The bullish narrative stems from data showing bitcoin tends to chalk out stellar multimonth rallies in the months after the halving, an event that reduces the pace of supply expansion rate by 50% every four years. This time the halving will cut the per-block issuance to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.  ""The narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched,"" Hayes wrote. ""When most market participants agree on a certain outcome, the opposite usually occurs. That is why I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving.""  Several analysts have argued that the supply slowdown is priced in and the market could correct following the event. Bitcoin has rallied over 65% this year, setting new records above $70,000 well before the halving.  Tax payments to suck out liquidity  Hayes added that U.S. tax payments, due on April 15, coupled with the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) policies, could remove dollar liquidity from the market, leading to broad-based risk aversion and a fire sale of crypto assets around halving.  ""Given that the halving occurs at a time when dollar liquidity is tighter than usual, it will add propellant to a raging firesale of crypto assets. The timing of the halving adds further weight to my decision to abstain from trading until May,"" Hayes said.  Tax payments typically remove liquidity from the financial system as individuals withdraw cash from bank deposits and market funds to pay their dues.  When the dollar's liquidity dries up, it appreciates against other fiat currencies, and borrowers with dollar-denominated loans face higher interest expenses and scale-back exposure to risk assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. The dollar's weakening has the opposite impact. The U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency, plays an outsized role in global trade, non-bank borrowing, and international debt.  Liquidity outflows due to impending tax payments could be sizeable, thanks to capital gains from the booming stock markets and interest income from elevated interest rates. In other words, the balance in the Treasury General Account (TGA) is set to rise sharply in the second half of April. The TGA is the government's operating account maintained at the Fed to collect tax revenue, customs duties, proceeds from securities sales and debt receipts and meet government expenses.  ""When the Treasury receives tax payments, the TGA balance rises. I expect the TGA balance to swell well above the current ~$750 billion level as tax payments are processed on April 15th. This is dollar liquidity negative,"" Hayes said. ""The precarious period for risky assets is April 15th to May 1st.""  Hayes expects Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to run down the Treasury General Account after May 1, providing a bullish tailwind to risk assets in months leading up to the U.S. presidential election in November.  ""After May 1st, the pace of QT declines, and Yellen gets busy cashing checks to jack up asset prices. If you are a trader looking for an opportune time to put on a cheeky short position, the month of April is the perfect time to do so. After May 1st, it’s back to regular programming … asset inflation sponsored by Fed and U.S. Treasury financial shenanigans,"" Hayes wrote.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/09/bitcoin-could-slump-around-reward-halving-time-arthur-hayes-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4dab0810dfbf963e3f0e881bd54602c9d4266cc-1439x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko. When whales engage in large-scale purchases, it often triggers a ripple effect throughout the market. This phenomenon sees smaller investors and traders being influenced to emulate similar actions, thereby amplifying the positive momentum. However, amidst the excitement of heightened market activity, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential consequences of increased concentration of assets in the hands of a few entities. While large purchases by whales may initially boost prices, they also pose risks to market stability. Ethereum market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Specifically, such concentration can lead to reduced market liquidity, making the price of assets like Ethereum more susceptible to sudden and significant fluctuations in the future. Thus, while whale activity can serve as a barometer of market sentiment, it also underscores the need for cautious consideration of its broader implications on market dynamics. Bitcoin Halving Hype Fuels Marketwide Rally Meanwhile, Ethereum’s impressive rally is not an isolated event. The broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing a period of bullish momentum. Bitcoin, the undisputed leader, has also witnessed a significant surge, climbing above the $72,000 mark.

Deutscher’s discourse comes in the wake of BlackRock’s groundbreaking venture into tokenized funds, signaling a seismic shift in the digital asset landscape. With projections indicating that tokenized assets are poised to reach a valuation of $10 trillion by 2030, Deutscher’s enthusiasm is palpable. “If you’re still sleeping on this sector, now is the time to wake up,” he declares, laying the groundwork for a deep dive into RWAs and their associated investment opportunities. The Genesis And Essence Of Real World Assets (RWA) Real World Assets (RWA) serve to bridge the tangible with the digital, tokenizing physical commodities such as gold, real estate, and various other commodities, thereby enhancing their efficiency and accessibility. This digitization process eliminates the need for traditional brokers, reduces entry barriers, and significantly cuts down on associated costs. “RWAs represent a revolutionary step forward in democratizing access to investment in major assets,” Deutscher asserts. He further explains that RWAs not only unlock vast markets for participation—such as global bonds and gold—but also integrate real-world, income-generating assets into the DeFi yield ecosystem. At their core, RWAs embody ownership rights over physical assets through the digital tokenization on blockchain platforms. Through smart contracts, issuers can mint these tokens, defining their value and the mechanics of their trade. This innovative approach has seen the market capitalization of tokenized public securities surpass $700 million, with the tokenized gold market nearing a $1 billion valuation, according to a report by Bank of America. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals What To Expect For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP In 12-16 Months This growing demand underscores the sector’s potential, significantly buoyed by BlackRock’s recent foray into RWA with its digital asset fund focused on bonds. Within a mere fortnight, this fund ballooned to a $274 million market cap, capturing a 37.53% market share. BlackRock’s pivot towards RWAs is not an isolated trend but a bellwether for the industry’s trajectory. “Larry Fink’s bullish stance on tokenization heralds a new era for securities,” Deutscher notes, highlighting the BlackRock CEO’s long-maintained belief in the transformative power of tokenization. This movement is gaining momentum, with heavyweight TradFi players such as Citi, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan exploring RWA avenues. “The convergence of traditional finance and blockchain through RWAs is a testament to the sector’s viability and growth potential,” Deutscher adds, underlining the legitimization of RWAs by these financial titans. Deutscher’s Curated List Of Top RWA Altcoins Delving deeper into the specifics, Deutscher categorizes his top picks within the RWA ecosystem: Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchains: Highlighting the significance of foundational blockchain platforms, Deutscher points to L1 and L2 chains that are pivotal in hosting RWA protocols. He emphasizes the strategic advantage of these chains in attracting liquidity and users, albeit noting the nuanced investment approach needed to maximize RWA-specific gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price To Rise 5000% To $0.001 – Here’s When “Hyped narratives often drive a lot of liquidity and users to the main chain that powers the underlying dApp. The issue with this style of investing, despite its ability to hedge against downside, is the lack of direct upside. If you want capture more RWA-specific upside, RWA-focused chains like Redbelly Network & MANTRA offer more direct exposure,” Deutscher argues. Oracles as the Backbone of RWA Tokenization: Oracles play a crucial role in ensuring the accurate reflection of real-world asset values on the blockchain. Deutscher is particularly bullish on Chainlink (LINK), citing its foundational role in secure, cross-chain information bridging. “Chainlink is indispensable for the RWA sector, offering real-time data verification that’s critical for the integrity of tokenized assets,” he explains. Moreover, the crypto analyst points to Pyth Network (PYTH) if investor want to “move further down the risk curve.” He added, “whilst Chainlink serves more broader sectors, Pyth is interesting as a DeFi-centric bet, due to its wide L1 compatibility.” RWA-Specific Protocols: Projects like Ondo Finance, Pendle Finance, and Frax Finance are lauded by Deutscher for their direct engagement with RWAs, each offering unique solutions to leverage real-world assets within the DeFi space. Deutscher applauds Ondo Finance for addressing liquidity challenges, Pendle Finance for its innovative yield-tokenization approach, and Frax Finance for its multifaceted DeFi offerings that include traditional investment avenues. Emerging Stars in the RWA Space: Deutscher also sheds light on upcoming projects like Lingo and Truflation, earmarking them as ones to watch. With Lingo’s unique model of funding RWA pools for brand partner rewards and Truflation’s infrastructure play in decentralizing economic data, these platforms are at the forefront of RWA innovation, according to him. At press time, ONDO had a market capitalization of $1.12 billion and was the 94th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The price stood at $0.80.

42418447,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThGbl,1712643000,South Korea’s April 10 Election: What’s at Stake for the Crypto Universe,"South Koreans will vote on April 10 having considered crypto-related poll promises that the two main parties have made.  The role of crypto may have become even more significant in this election than the previous one.  In March 2022, former prosecutor Yoon Suk Yeol won the South Korean Presidential election by a margin of less than 1%, or 247,077 votes. It was the closest presidential election in the nation’s history.  Just about two months later, the Terra stablecoin crash wiped away some $60 billion globally, with some 280,000 South Koreans reported to have been victims.  There are more than 280,000 crypto investors in the nation – South Korean prosecutors said there were 6.27 million crypto users in September 2023.  If even 247,078 of these voters had cast their ballot only based on the crypto policies of candidates, the numbers suggest, the election result could have turned out differently. South Korea is one day away from an important election in which crypto has certainly been an issue. The role of crypto may have become even more significant in this election than the previous one.  Young people could play a decisive role, analysts say, in a nation of about 52 million people. The crypto ecosystem of which young people make up a majority, has gone through a frenzy, shaking off and emerging from the shadow of Do Kwon and Terra, but crypto-related political promises may have acted as dopamine to activate voters from the sector.  2024 Legislative Election  On April 10, 2024, the nation is heading into its legislative polls which will see multiple parties and coalitions battle it out for 300 seats in the national assembly. It’s expected to come down to two parties – President Yoon Suk Yeol’s conservative People Power Party (PPP) will be seeking to improve its tally of 114 seats, while the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) will hope to consolidate its 156-seat hold on the assembly.  South Korea’s legislative elections take place every four years. In 2020, the liberal party (DPK) won the election with ease. Thus, crypto, which was not as prominent as it is today, likely had a minimum impact.  But in this election, political analysts said it will be difficult for either party to get a majority, making any group of voters significant. “I would think so,” said the Seoul-based Head of Legal at Hashed Jin Kang when asked whether crypto could be a deciding factor in the coming election. ""In the close presidential election of 2022, a key deciding demographic was the young population in their 20s and 30s. Both parties will be interested in capturing these younger votes."" Perhaps what is unclear is whether the crypto-savvy voters will vote as one block.  “A close election is a given,” said Abel Seow, the Seoul-based BitGo Asia-Pacific director. “But it’s hard to say whether crypto will be a deciding factor. What I can say is that with the passage of time and each cycle, the market has become bigger and bigger. Not only the involvement of investors but also traditional corporations. So, at some stage when these traditional corporations come in, and they have a crypto angle, elections could be impacted by the space.”  Crypto-related political promises  In the presidential election of 2022, President Yoon Suk-Yeol pledged to restrict taxes for crypto gains and allow initial coin offerings (ICO).  It is unclear whether his crypto-pledges were decisive in helping him win the historically close election. In the end, he couldn’t live up to the promise of allowing ICOs, and – with bipartisan support in the assembly – the taxes were deferred if not restricted.  But the potential for crypto election influence does explain why both the major parties in South Korea are making new crypto-related pledges in the lead-up to this election.  The opposing Democratic Party (DPK) has promised to allow investors to purchase spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while the PPP has said it’s also looking for ways to allow the ETFs.  The slight difference in the promises comes from their political outlook on pending crypto taxation policies.  The PPP has said it would prioritize a regulatory framework before taxation, effectively delaying a crypto gains tax scheduled to be implemented in January 2025.  Taxation on income from virtual assets, as well as income from the “transfer or lending of virtual assets,” was initially delayed from 2023 to 2025. The DPK is expected to propose a comprehensive framework too, and wants to maintain the start of crypto-taxation in 2025. But it wants to put the 22% tax on crypto asset gains exceeding 50 million Korean won ($37,316) instead of the currently proposed 2.5 million Korean won ($1,865).  The PPP has also promised to establish a ‘digital asset promotion committee’ to propose laws and impose sanctions.  “When it comes to taxes, both parties are giving a reason for a crypto-savvy person to vote for them, and the same goes for ETFs,” Seow said. “The fact that the topic of digital assets and whether or not to proceed with a spot bitcoin ETF during an election is a reflection of how the digital asset market has grown and the importance of it to the Korean economy, including to that of institutional investors.”  Crypto-friendly policies for institutions in South Korea may still be a long way off, because in this year of elections, known as the ""super election year,"" lawmakers may want to make sure their framework is not cast in stone before global consensus.  “It is unlikely that we will see a market regulation during this super election year,” Kang said. “South Korean authorities are wary of jurisdictional arbitrage in crypto regulation that may be inconsistent with approaches of major countries such as the EU and the U.S.""  South Korea’s election is “part of a slew of upcoming elections across the world that will inevitably influence the direction and pace of crypto policy making, but I think it’s the U.S. presidential elections that will be a major one for crypto policy,” said Angela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs.

Ether's performance seems to be based on market interest in new DeFi protocol Ethena, versus an anticipation of a spot ether ETF approval  Ether {{ETH}} prices rallied during the early hours of the East Asia trading day while Bitcoin {{BTC}} remained relatively stable.  According to CoinDesk Indicies data, ether prices rose to $3600, while bitcoin was in stasis around $71,000.  The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the world's most liquid digital assets, was up 3.5% and trading above 2,600. Decentralized liquid staking protocols like Lido DAO and Rocket Pool ETH also saw their tokens push well into the green, up 10% and 8%, respectively, according to CoinGecko data.  ETH's bitcoin-bearing performance could be attributed to continued market interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena, which has seen its total value locked (TVL) cross the $2.2 billion mark over the last few days after crossing $2 billion on April 6.  Ethena's USDe synthetic stablecoin recently added bitcoin as collateral, CoinDesk reported.  This may be purely a rally based on token demand rather than the hope of an ether spot exchange-traded fund being approved in the near future.  Bettors on Polymarket see a 16% chance of a spot ether ETF being approved in the U.S. by the end of May and only a 45% chance of it being approved by the end of June.  Some traders were positioned for bitcoin leadership after the ether-bitcoin ratio dipped below key support last week. As such, ETH's market-beating rise has brought rapid adjustment in market positioning, leading to a sharp uptick in the perpetual funding rates or cost of holding long/short positions, Singapore-based QCP capital explained in a note on Telegram. The upside volatility has also led to a significant short covering in ETH front-end call options.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has gained popularity and reached $10 billion in managed assets faster than any other ETF. The upcoming Bitcoin Halving event and reduced supply of Bitcoin could further boost the prospects of IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs. Investment Thesis The launch of Bitcoin ETFs since the start of this year has been a major catalyst in further improving awareness and optimism around Bitcoin as potential investments and ETFs as the primary vehicle for investing in it. In addition, other catalysts such as general market sentiment and other indicators in the economy have also aided somewhat in the rise in prices for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and spot Bitcoin ETFs that invest directly in the digital asset. IBIT ETF vs its peers and Bitcoin, Ethereum (SA) Take the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), for example. As seen in the chart above, the ETF gained in popularity by amassing funds faster than its incumbent peer, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) ETF ( GBTC ). In fact, last month, the IBIT ETF hit its $10 billion milestone in managed assets faster than any other ETF, according to this Bloomberg ETF analyst . Some of that optimism may also be coming from the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, which, in my opinion, reduces the supply of Bitcoin circulation. Through my analysis below, along with the comparisons drawn to prior cycles, I believe Bitcoin will continue to grow on its rapid growth trajectory, boosting the prospects of the IBIT and other ETFs. Based on my analysis, I rate this ETF as a Buy. About iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Note: I may refer to Bitcoin through this post as a ‘digital asset,’ ‘digital currency’ or ‘digital money.’ The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, whose assets are managed by BlackRock’s ETF arm, iShares, The IBIT fund invests its assets directly in Bitcoin, thus offering investors exposure to this digital asset. While there exist many other digital assets such as Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) or Solana ( SOL-USD ), the SEC only granted the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January this year, which led to the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, with IBIT being the second-largest of them all. Based on IBIT’s prospectus , the fund's objective is to track the performance of Bitcoin and allocate fund capital to hold Bitcoin in its asset base. In IBIT’s case, Coinbase provides the necessary custodial services, holding Bitcoin on behalf of the IBIT fund that is used to back the fund’s assets. The fund achieves its investment objective by tracking the price of Bitcoin, primarily using CME’s CF Bitcoin Reference Rate . Peer comparison In my previous coverage of one of IBIT’s peers, GBTC, I explained why my Hold rating on GBTC was warranted. Further research suggests that the fund outflow continues to put GBTC at further risk. In my previous post on GBTC, I also explained certain issues with the GBTC fund structure that posed inherent problems unique only to GBTC. In my view, these issues will not exist with IBIT and most of its other peers. Having said that, there do exist certain risks in generally investing in Bitcoin and digital assets, which I will cover in a later section. For now, I will move on to assessing IBIT in light of its peers. I have not included Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) in this post since I had already covered it in my previous post on GBTC. IBIT fund versus its 2 largest peers (SA and Fund Prospectus documents) For comparison’s sake, I have looked at some of the largest ETFs to compare IBIT to. My reason to do so is because Bitcoin is still an emerging investment alternative. Therefore, for investors looking to gain exposure, it would make sense to go for larger ETFs that provide liquidity. In general, we can see from the peer comparison table above that Bitcoin ETFs tend to be quite liquid. While ARK's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) and Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) have just over 3 million shares exchanged daily on average, IBIT’s shares have more than 10 times the average daily volume of their peers. For broader comparison’s sake, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ ) has an average daily share volume of ~45 million. Another differentiating factor here is the expense ratio. Currently, IBIT seems the cheapest of them all, but that is only because of the lower rates in its expense ratio. I have attached an excerpt below that explains the fund’s stand on its expense fee positioning, and I believe the new expense fee will be applied from here on. BlackRock will waive a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee for the first 12 months commencing on January 11, 2024, so that the fee will be 0.12% of the net asset value of the Trust for the first $5.0 billion of the Trust’s assets. If the fund exceeds $5.0 billion of the Trust’s assets prior to the end of the 12-month period, the Sponsor’s Fee charged on assets over $5.0 billion will be 0.25%. All investors will incur the same Sponsor’s Fee which is the weighted average of those fee rates. After the 12-month waiver period is over, the Sponsor’s Fee will be 0.25%. In comparison, ARKB and BITB are cheaper by 4–5 basis points. Even FBTC’s teaser rates for expense fees will end in August, after which FBTC will charge a 25-basis-point expense fee, in line with IBIT. I believe the marginal difference in expense fees here will not be meaningful enough for investors to jump ship to IBIT’s peers. The huge asset base in IBIT will continue to be an advantage for BlackRock’s iShares and IBIT’s investors, who will continue to reap the benefits of IBIT’s large asset size and the subsequent liquidity advantages. How the Bitcoin Halving Affects Bitcoin and IBIT Simply put, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event occurs approximately once every four years, where the rate of new bitcoins circulated in the network is cut in half until the network’s goal of 21 million coins in circulation is reached, according to the Bitcoin network’s own developer documentation . This is done to control for inflation in the network and reduce the supply of Bitcoins, which can be clearly seen in prior halving events as shown in the charts below. Prior cycles prove Bitcoin may have long-term upside (Glassnode) The reduced supply of Bitcoins in the network is actually a long-term positive development for Bitcoin and IBIT. From previous halving cycles, I can observe how the price of Bitcoin benefits from the reduced supply of Bitcoin, which can be seen in both the 2016 Halving and the 2020 Halving. I also feel it is important to note that each halving event has its own set of characteristics that differentiate the performance of Bitcoin over prior halving events. For example, in the 2016 halving event, Bitcoin’s price saw a sharp contraction, from ~$760 to $540, around a -30% drop, but the price recovered and Bitcoin proceeded to touch $1k over the next year since the 2016 Halving. In the 2020 Halving, economic uncertainty due to the pandemic and globally depressed interest rates occurred, but Bitcoin still ended up crossing $20k by the end of that year. In 2024, Bitcoin is at ATH along with an influx of Bitcoin ETFs, while global liquidity has returned to aid Bitcoin, as I reflect on Lynn Alden’s observation in her foundational piece on this platform . So far, Bitcoin is following a similar trajectory as seen in prior Halving cycles, as seen in the chart below since the previous ATH in each cycle. ( live chart ) Bitcoin’s price is so far moving in a similar trajectory as seen in prior Halving cycles (Glassnode) Glassnode’s chart above compares the current 4-year price trajectory of Bitcoin to previous 4 year price trajectories of Bitcoin around the Halving events. The research points out that “the bull market may run for longer still despite the fact that we have breached the previous ATH before the halving.” I find it very plausible that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory continues if it has followed previous cycles. If this happens, I believe IBIT stands to benefit from this positive outlook. Other Factors and some Risks Investors should be aware of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility characteristics pose risks to my bullish take on Bitcoin. At the moment, there is no solution for the volatility, which also reflects the rapidly changing short-term investment sentiment and perception towards digital currencies. I noted earlier how in prior cycles in the short term there may be ~-30% drawdowns in the price of Bitcoin only for the digital asset to have scored larger gains a year later. In that case, I propose risk-averse investors wait for a retrace approximately to the 50-100 day moving average to enter. What would be a slight concern in IBIT’s case is if there is a shift in investor interest towards other ETFs. If its peers do make their expense fees more attractive for investors, there may be some outflows from IBIT. Further, the SEC has moved the review stages of various Ethereum ETFs to the next phase, and J.P. Morgan believes there is a 50/50 chance they may be approved by May. In this case, I can expect Ethereum to start outperforming Bitcoin on a relative basis, coupled with some outflows from all Bitcoin ETFs into Ethereum ETFs once the latter are made available which have some impact on Bitcoin ETFs. Note: As I had listed in my previous coverage on GBTC, this month's Bitcoin Halving event is expected to take place within a few weeks, around April 20th. Investors should be mindful of that date while entering or exiting their positions. Takeaway The long-term outlook is quite strong for Bitcoin, in my opinion. The IBIT ETF presents itself as a stable alternative for investors looking to invest in Bitcoin without the bells and whistles that come with directly investing in Bitcoin, such as digital wallets, etc. Post-halving, there may be some volatility, but my belief is that Bitcoin’s price will continue to expand, raising the prospects of the IBIT ETF.

The research firm finds key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s price increase, market cap dominance, and the emergence of new trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Inscription Activities Drive Bitcoin Fees Up Analyzing the key figures detailed in the report, Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant increase in Q1 2024, rising 68.78% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to reach an all-time high (ATH) of $73,100. This price increase propelled Bitcoin’s market cap dominance to 49.7% in March 2024. Interestingly, the research firm notes that such dominance is a typical feature at the start of a new halving cycle, with Bitcoin often leading the way for other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Drops After Massive Whale Dump, Casting Doubt On $1 Target In April Another relevant figure is the inscription activity in Q4 2023, which drove fees up by 699.4% QoQ. However, in Q1 2024, subscription-related fees decreased by 41.9%. Despite declining total fees, inscription-related transactions still accounted for 18.4% of Bitcoin’s total fees, demonstrating their continued relevance. Average daily transactions and daily active addresses also experienced a decline of 15.3% and 4.7% QoQ, respectively. The report suggests that the decline in transaction activity may be attributed to decreased activity from bots or “super users.” This shift aligns with the decrease in inscription-related activities and fees. Inscription-related activity initially surged in February 2023, leading to a considerable transaction increase. Although Q1 2024 witnessed a decline in inscription-related activity QoQ, it remained significantly higher year-over-year (YoY), indicating its continued impact on the network. ETFs Amassed 212,000 BTC In Q1 Messari highlights that Q1 2024 showed the growth of programmable layers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Established layers such as Rootstock and Stacks led the way regarding total value locked (TVL), while newer layers such as BOB and Merlin experienced rapid growth. TVL’s 127% QoQ growth was primarily in non-BTC assets, as Bitcoin-locked amounts lagged behind the Lightning Network and alt-L1 networks, which host significant amounts of BTC. Ultimately, the approval and launch of nine spot ETFs and one ETF conversion marked a significant milestone for Bitcoin’s legitimization by the US government and traditional finance (TradFi). The report notes that these ETFs garnered over $12 billion in inflows within the first month. Notably, BTC ETFs surpassed silver ETFs in assets under management (AUM) but still lagged behind gold ETFs. Institutional BTC holdings were also surpassed by MicroStrategy, the largest institutional holder, with 215,000 BTC. The ETFs accumulated 212,000 BTC in inflows during Q1, further establishing Bitcoin’s prominence in the financial markets.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Distributing Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode lead analyst Checkmate discussed the recent behavior of the long-term Bitcoin holders. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for over six months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. Since the LTHs hold for significant periods, they are considered quite resolute. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Takes $52.3 Million In DOGE Off Binance, Sign Of Buying? And indeed, they display this resilience in their behavior, rarely selling despite whatever is happening in the broader market. As such, the times they sell are all the more noteworthy. Historically, the LTHs have taken to distribution during bull runs when the asset has broken its previous all-time high (ATH) price. Due to their long holding times, these investors amass large profits, which they start to spend when a high amount of demand comes in during bull rallies that happily take coins off their hands at high prices. Checkmate explained that the recent ATH break of the cryptocurrency has looked similar to any other past one, with the LTHs already having started spending for this round. The chart below shows the trend in the supply of Bitcoin LTHs over the past few years. The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTHs have recently observed their supply heading down. Remember that when it comes to increases in this metric, there is a delay associated with when buying is happening and when this supply is going up. This is natural because the newly bought coins must age for six months before they can be considered a part of the cohort’s holdings. When it comes to drawdowns, though, the same delay doesn’t emerge, as the age of the coins instantly resets back to zero, and they exit the group. Thus, the latest distribution from the LTHs is indeed happening. “In the prior two cycles, new demand for Bitcoin was able to absorb this LTH sell-side for around 6-8 months while pushing prices multiples higher,” explains the Glassnode lead. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) In Buy Zone That Earlier Led To 112% & 87% Surges The chart below shows that the LTH supply has typically gone through a drawdown of around 14% during these bull run selloffs. The data for the drawdown in the LTH supply over the various cycles | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X Checkmate notes that, based on this historical average drawdown in the LTH supply, the current Bitcoin cycle would be around 40% completion for this process.

25428517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602048,1712621139,"Crypto Expert Reveals What To Expect For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP In 12-16 Months","Crypto expert Ash Crypto has outlined his price predictions for several crypto tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP, heading into this bull run. He also suggested that these price levels could be attained in the next 12 to 16 months. How High Will Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP Rise? Ash Crypto predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) that BTC would rise between $100,000 and $250,000 by 2025. This prediction aligns with those made by other notable crypto analysts. One of them is Skybridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci, who predicted in January that Bitcoin would rise to $170,000 18 months after the Bitcoin Halving. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Makes Bold Prediction For Crypto Market – $5 Trillion In 2024 Source: X Meanwhile, some other crypto analysts will argue that Bitcoin hitting $100,000 could even happen this year rather than 2025. This includes Tom Dunleavy, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, who claims that Bitcoin will rise to $100,000 by the end of this year. Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, also predicted that Bitcoin would rise to as high as $150,000 this year. Regarding his price target for DOGE, Ash Crypto predicted that the meme coin would rise to $1 in the next 12 to 16 months. This prediction is also a common sentiment shared by several other crypto analysts and members of the crypto community. Specifically, crypto analyst DonAlt once mentioned that “it isn’t too unlikely for Dogecoin to go to $1,” while crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa stated that DOGE could do “something silly like go to $1 this cycle eventually.” Ash Crypto also shared his price target for XRP, stating that the crypto token could rise between $3 and $5. This price prediction, however, seems conservative, considering other predictions that crypto analysts have made for the XRP token. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently mentioned that XRP could rise to as high as $20 in this market cycle. Meanwhile, Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has repeatedly stated that XRP hitting $27 is possible. Undervalued Altcoins Make The List Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe recently included Chainlink (LINK), Celestia (TIA), and Polkadot (DOT) in a list of ten crypto tokens he believes are undervalued. Interestingly, these three altcoins also made their way into Ash Crypto’s list of coins, for which he outlined price targets.

LINK’s rise to such levels would undoubtedly be massive, considering it currently trades at around $17. Ash Crypto also predicted a parabolic surge in TIA and DOT’s prices, as he believes they could rise to as high as $150 and $120, respectively.
