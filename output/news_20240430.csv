26636570,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605896,1714518054,"Solana Projected To Reach $500 This Year Despite Market Meltdown, Expert Predicts","Solana (SOL), currently ranked as the fifth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $56 billion, has experienced a significant decline amid the recent market meltdown affecting the digital asset space. Over the past 24 hours, SOL has witnessed an 8% drop, reflecting the broader market downturn. Despite this setback, experts believe that if the cryptocurrency maintains support above the $120 price level, it holds notable potential for a strong price recovery in the coming months. Bullish Price Outlook And Key Support Levels To Watch After reaching a yearly high of $209 on March 18, SOL‚Äôs current trading price is $124. However, according to crypto market experts, SOL still has a promising outlook. Altcoin Sherpa, a renowned analyst, suggests that if the altcoin market continues to decline, the $120 price level may become an area of significant interest for SOL. Altcoin Sherpa maintains a bullish sentiment, strongly believing that SOL can potentially exceed $500 this year. Such a surge would represent a significant 300% price increase from current levels, building upon the impressive 426% year-to-date price growth. It is worth noting that this projection is nearly double SOL‚Äôs previous all-time high (ATH) of $259, reached during the last crypto market bull run in November 2021. Related Reading: Crypto Funds Mark 3rd Consecutive Weeks Of Outflows With $435 Million In Withdrawals In addition to the analyst‚Äôs focus on the $120 price mark, other major resistance levels for SOL have been identified.¬†These include $110, $102, and the critical long-term support level at $74, representing SOL‚Äôs uptrend structure over the past six months. Solana Dominates Blockchain Trading Volume According to a recent CoinGecko report, Solana has secured its position as the second-largest blockchain by trading volume, commanding a substantial 21.3% market share in March 2024. The blockchain platform experienced a notable monthly growth of 244.8%, with trading volume surging to $40.05 billion, a significant increase from $11.61 billion in February. Solana‚Äôs performance in the first quarter of 2024 was equally significant. It accounted for 14.4% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume, totaling $62.31 billion. This represents a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth of 242.7% compared to the previous quarter‚Äôs volume of $18.18 billion. Despite strong growth, Solana‚Äôs market share in the same quarter ranked fourth, trailing behind Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Related Reading: XRP Price On Watch: Can This 23 Million Token Purchase Spark A Rally? According to CoinGecko, Solana‚Äôs trading volume has been greatly bolstered by several factors. Firstly, the doubling in the price of Solana‚Äôs native token, SOL, has attracted increased attention and trading activity on the platform. Additionally, the network has witnessed large airdrops from projects such as Jito (JTO) and Jupiter (JUP), further fueling trading volume. Moreover, the surge in memecoins on the Solana network has significantly contributed to its trading volume. Notably, the launch of Book of Memes (BOME) in March proved successful, as it achieved a market capitalization of $1 billion within two days. BOME also secured listings on crypto exchanges like Binance and Bybit, further amplifying trading activity on Solana.

But his reputation, at least in a Seattle courtroom on Tuesday, was never better.  The judge, CZ's defense lawyers and even prosecutors acknowledged during the 2 1/2 hour sentencing hearing that this 47-year-old billionaire was not your run-of-the-mill criminal defendant. Instead, he was a philanthropist, a do-gooder, a first-time lawbreaker and family man who turned himself in to accept whatever may come.  This unexpected resuscitation of the crypto kingpin's reputation factored into his fate: a tremendously light sentence of four months, far less than the three years prosecutors sought to punish ‚Äì in their telling ‚Äì this historically egregious violation of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  U.S. Judge Richard Jones, 74, had none of it. ""To be honest with you, sir, everything I see about your history and characteristics are of a mitigating nature,"" he said to Zhao near the start of his sentencing. He recalled going through a book of glowing sentencing letters that CZ's friends and family had submitted.  Read more: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Gets 4 Months in Prison  Not everything worked out for CZ in court. He's still due to spend four months in prison for failing to implement effective money-laundering controls as CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. A source at the U.S. Department of Justice said he's the first CEO to go to prison under the BSA.  If the court proceedings were the model of the man, though, CZ will enter prison rejuvenated.  ""Lots of really good people do bad things and violate the law,"" prosecutor Kevin Mosley told Judge Jones when asked if his team's sentencing recommendation factored in CZ's prolific global philanthropy efforts. CZ's lawyers later called out Mosley's unconvincing insistence that it had.  Judge Jones said he spent the weekend poring over the voluminous letters of support for CZ from friends and family until the book they were contained in literally fell apart. ""I don't think I've ever seen a volume of letters"" consistent in their characterization of a passionate if flawed defendant, the judge said.  Read more: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Apologizes Ahead of Sentencing, 161 Others Send Letters of Support  CZ leaned forward in his seat throughout Judge Jones' sentencing remarks. He nodded every time the judge pointed out the former CEO's instances of wrongdoing. His body language telegraphed he anticipated the light sentence he got; it was almost like CZ knew what was coming when he flashed those four fingers months ago.  ""You risked your entire net worth to make Binance a success,"" Judge Jones said at one point.  Naturally, the most sterling representations came from CZ's own legal team. They reminded the judge repeatedly that Zhao had been living in the United Arab Emirates, a country with no extradition treaty with the U.S. His massive fortune could have funded a lifestyle on the run, they said. But he cracked a deal with prosecutors instead.  That, the support letters, his ""extraordinary"" cooperation with the government and a whistle-clean past (""No criminal history, no fraud, no other crimes,"" as defense lawyer William Burke put it) led Judge Jones to impose a light sentence, he said.  Still, CZ's hubris worked against him. ""The mere fact that you can place your name next to the largest crypto operation on the planet does not give you discretion to pick and choose which regulations to follow,"" Jones said, adding that wealth and power did not free CZ from following the law.  The whole thing makes CZ's coming prison sentence likely to be more of a blip in his story than the end of his line.

Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who said Gensler's agency already knew it considered Ethereum's ether a security before he attended a hearing and declined to answer that question.  ""Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC's classification of ether,"" McHenry said in a statement posted on X. ""New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission's position.""  The classification of {{ETH}}, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a major question hanging over the U.S. oversight of digital assets, and it's being fought on multiple legal fronts. If ETH is a security that should be registered and regulated by the SEC, then many other tokens may also fit that definition.  Documents in Consensys' newly filed lawsuit against the SEC describe how the agency was pursuing an investigation into the nature of ETH days before Gensler testified in April 2023. Consensys is suing the agency ahead of an expected SEC enforcement action.  Read More: SEC Chair Gensler Declines to Say if Ether Is a Security in Contentious Congressional Hearing  But McHenry's argument suggests that the agency's investigation equates with an actual policy position.  Spokespeople for the SEC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on McHenry's accusations.  According to the SEC's investigations manual, an investigation ""is appropriate and necessary to determine whether a violation of the federal securities laws may have occurred or may be occurring,"" crypto attorney Grant Gulovsen pointed out to CoinDesk. It's not a finding in itself, so the SEC may not have made a formal determination on how ETH should be categorized.  ""I agree with Consensys that if the SEC determined all offers and sales of ETH involved securities transactions it would be devastating to the entire crypto industry, but since the SEC hasn‚Äôt actually done that yet, why try to force the issue?""

BTC could drop to the mid-to-low $50,000 region, Ledn CIO said.  The Hong Kong spot crypto ETF debut wasn't as poor as it was made out to be, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst noted.  It might be time to call the cryptocurrency correction a bear market, as bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled below $60,000 with what appeared to be a poor debut of spot ETFs in Hong Kong and interest rate fears giving traders plenty of reason to sell on Tuesday.  BTC hit a $59,100 low in the afternoon hours, its weakest price since late February and down over 5% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) declined even more during the same period, falling 6% as ether {{ETH}}, solana {{SOL}} nursed 7%-8% losses.  Bitcoin now lower by roughly 20% from its all-time high above $73,000 hit in mid-March.  Traditional markets struggled as well after a spate of U.S. economic reports Tuesday morning had a stagflationary feel, showing slowing growth and speedier price pressures. The Nasdaq shed 2% for the day, while the S&P 500 fell 1.6%.  Recent reports showing stronger U.S. economic data and hotter inflation significantly tapered U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations and that's weighing on the digital asset market, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, pointed out in a Tuesday report.  ""We continue to see evidence of the Fed needing to be leaning back to a higher for longer policy outlook, despite investor calls for more accommodation,"" Kruger said. ""With the U.S. dollar coming back into favor across the board, we are seeing this filter over into crypto assets as well.""  Worst month since FTX  With Tuesday's decline, BTC and the broader crypto market are on track to snap their seven-month winning streak with their worst monthly decline since November 2022, when crypto exchange FTX imploded.  With a few hours left from the last day of the month (UTC time), bitcoin is down over 16% through April, and ether is lower by 18%.. Smaller cryptocurrencies suffered an even deeper correction, with altcoin darlings SOL, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, avalanche {{AVAX}} lower by 35%-40% this month.  Overall, the total crypto market capitalization shed nearly 18% of its value, recording its biggest decline since June 2022, TradingView data shows.  Bitcoin's decline might not be over  ""I‚Äôm expecting a sell-off to the mid-to-low $50,000 region [for BTC], which should prove to be a buying opportunity,"" said John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn.  Seasonal effects with lower interest during the summer months also point towards lower prices, K33 Research noted.  ""A trader opting for a strategy of buying BTC on the May open and closing the trade on the  September close would‚Äôve seen a cumulative return of -29% in the past five years,"" K33 analyst Vetle Lunde said. ""Whereas a trader buying the October open and selling during the April close would‚Äôve experienced a massive 1,449% return.""

26631935,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605854,1714510803,Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Expert Says ETH Is Yet To Bottom Against Bitcoin,"A crypto analyst has predicted when Ethereum, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency, will bottom against Bitcoin, however, under certain conditions. Analyst Predicts ETH/BTC Bottom Timeline In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst and founder of ITC Crypto, Benjamin Cowen, shared his forecast regarding the Ethereum to Bitcoin price ratio, projecting the timeline for when ETH/BTC would hit its lowest value in the current market cycle. Sharing insights on the market conditions, Cowen noted striking similarities between the present market‚Äôs dynamics and the one seen in 2019. He disclosed that ETH/BTC‚Äôs recent bounce mirrored the market‚Äôs behavior in 2019, two months before the Federal Reserve (FED) cut down rates. Cowen predicts that the ETH/BTC ratio will reach the lowest point in its price cycle when the FED makes a significant change in its monetary policy, often referred to as a ‚Äúpivot.‚Äù The crypto expert expects this pivot to occur in a few months, ultimately suggesting that Ethereum would bottom against Bitcoin in the coming months. His analysis is also based on the assumption that macroeconomic conditions and the FED‚Äôs monetary policies can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. Sharing a price chart of Ethereum against Bitcoin in another post, Cowen projected that the ETH/BTC ratio will head towards a range of 0.03 and 0.04 by summer. Commenting on his prediction of ETH/BTC‚Äôs bottom, a crypto community member expressed skepticism about the FED‚Äôs likelihood of cutting down rates while inflation was still high. Cowen responded that the absence of a rate cut further reinforced his beliefs that the ETH/BTC ratio has not yet reached its lowest point. He suggests that unless inflationary pressures are addressed, the ETH/BTC ratio may continue on its downward trend. Crypto Expert Calls Ethereum A Higher Risk Asset In another post, Cowen referred to Ethereum as a higher-risk asset and Bitcoin as a lower-risk asset. The crypto analyst‚Äôs forecast on Ethereum against Bitcoin is underpinned by his interpretation of capital migration dynamics, suggesting that higher-risk assets typically depreciate relative to lower-risk assets. He highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the future market movements of ETH/BTC following the halving event. Cowen predicted that if ETH/BTC witnesses a ‚Äúrelief rebound‚Äù after the halving, then he expects a rejection by the bull market support band, particularly in the context of weekly closing prices, estimated to range between $0.053 to $0.054. While acknowledging his past successes in predicting ETH/BTC price movements, Cowen highlighted that his predictions remain speculative, stating, ‚ÄúJust because I have been right so far about ETH/BTC does not mean I will continue being right.‚Äù ETH bulls fail to hold $3,000 | Source: ETHUSDT on Tradingview.com Featured image from Finbold, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-prediction-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42408309,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCg2M,1714508230,Why Eigenlayer‚Äôs Airdrop Is Controversial,"Users of the Ethereum restaking pioneer Eigenlayer, many of whom are about to be rewarded with a massive airdrop of a new EIGEN token, are voting with their dollars. In response to what some have called Eigen Labs‚Äô overly complicated white paper and relatively limited rewards, users have queued to withdraw about 25,000 ether {{ETH}}, worth about $72.7 million, from the platform.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Eigen Labs, which recently raised $100 million from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, essentially pioneered the concept of restaking ‚Äî the ability to reuse capital to staked on Ethereum to simultaneously secure other blockchains. Nearly $16 billion has been locked on the platform, which has been called the single biggest innovation in crypto in years.  According to the Eigen Foundation‚Äôs announcement on Monday, 15% of the initial 1.67 billion EIGEN tokens will be set aside for the community and distributed over multiple ‚Äúseasons.‚Äù Early users who accrued ‚Äúpoints‚Äù will be airdropped the first 5% of those reserved tokens ‚Äî with one point equating to one token. This could equate to a hefty reward for users who have long been clamoring for a native Eigenlayer token.  However, many are annoyed with the project‚Äôs plan. Of particular concern is that the tokens will be initially non-transferable, essentially making the cash reward worthless. Additionally, 30% of the tokens will go to Eigen Labs investors, with another 25% earmarked for ‚Äúearly contributors.‚Äù While investors and early contributors also won‚Äôt be able to immediately sell their tokens, the vesting schedule starts when they receive the tokens ‚Äî raising concerns a lot of tokens will be sold off once they become transferable.  ‚ÄúEigenLayer team and investors are getting 55% but stakers are getting only 5% and even that will not be transferable at the beginning,‚Äù crypto trader CoinMamba said on X.  As The Block reported, the token distribution plan echoes Starknet‚Äôs token airdrop that stirred controversy in February, before it was reformed after community backlash. Starknet‚Äôs token was created a year before it was made available for trading, which gave investors a headstart on their vesting schedule and meant they were able to sell off just weeks after trading commenced.  Another point of contention is that many Eigenlayer users will be cut out of the airdrop. Residents of the U.S., Canada and China are not going to receive tokens (alongside Russia), and users who interacted with the system via a VPN, a popular means of protecting privacy by routing through virtual networks, will also be shut out. This rankled some critics because users from these countries aren‚Äôt barred from interacting with the platform, though they are being excluded from the reward.  ""Accepting stake from those countries and not rewarding them isn‚Äôt right,‚Äù crypto researcher Aylo said on X. ‚ÄúThey took a very real risk for nothing.""  For its part, Eigenlayer said that making the token non-transferable for a few months will enable the platform to decentralize and work out how the token could be used. ‚ÄúCertain goals should be accomplished in the coming months before the EIGEN is made transferable and forkable,‚Äù the company said.  While some parts of the community backlash are more valid than others, it‚Äôs hard to fault Eigenlayer‚Äôs plan to geofence U.S. users, given the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) unclear guidance on airdrops. As Variant Fund lawyer Jake Chervinsky noted on X, the SEC has ‚Äústeadfastly refused to provide a workable pathway‚Äù for crypto token registration, putting Eigenlayer‚Äôs team in potential legal jeopardy.  ‚ÄúNon-transferability and geofencing are both useful options when it comes to managing regulatory risk around token distributions. They just aren‚Äôt the only options, nor are they necessarily the right ones for every team and token,‚Äù he added. Making an asset non-transferable limits any ‚Äúreasonable expectation of profit,‚Äù a key part of determining whether an asset is a security.  See also: EigenLayer-Powered Aligned Layer Raises $20M  Further, Eigenlayer is not the first and certainly won‚Äôt be the last project to block U.S. users or exclude them from token rewards programs. While this policy does punish users who would otherwise be handed essentially free money ‚Äî or money earned for just clicking a few buttons ‚Äî it is a reasonable response to the situation.  ‚ÄúBoth of these options are on the conservative end of the regulatory risk spectrum for token distributions. I call this a spectrum for a reason: given a lack of regulatory clarity, every team (with the advice of their counsel) has to decide how much risk to take on,‚Äù Chervinsky wrote.  It‚Äôs an interesting day when projects said to be at the cutting edge of financial innovation are forced to take a conservative approach.

42408299,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCfYb,1714506550,"Stablecoin Bill Unlikely to Get Pinned to FAA Reauthorization, Putting Effort On Hold Again","A Democratic aide familiar with the negotiation said House and Senate leaders are insisting on a clean FAA reauthorization that wouldn't allow the attachment of a stablecoin bill.  The effort has drawn key support and may be tried again as the congressional session wanes.  Advocates for long-awaited U.S. stablecoin legislation tried to tie it onto an unrelated must-move reauthorization bill, but leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives are seeking to keep that effort clear of such attachments, according to a Democratic aide.  U.S. lawmakers had been engaged this week in serious conversations about whether to jam a stablecoin regulation amendment onto the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization legislation, which is approaching a deadline. Such efforts to use that bill for other business were rebuffed by leaders favoring a so-called clean bill, so the leading stablecoin negotiation between House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and its top Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), will return to talks on a final deal, said the aide, who requested anonymity because the negotiations aren't public.  Still, the serious maneuvering on behalf of stablecoin oversight reveals how much closer that vital corner of the industry is getting to daylight.  For the first time, the necessary senators engaged in the negotiations. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has said he's open to pairing stablecoin regulation with his push for a bill opening access to the financial system for cannabis businesses. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) seemed to be on board for that, though Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) continues to signal he opposes marijuana banking.  The energy devoted this time could suggest that stablecoins may come up again when other must-pass bills move through Congress ‚Äì and it may now be intertwined with the high-profile marijuana legislation.  ""We believe this push will reveal how much support both have in Congress and who remains opposed,"" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, in a research note. ""It is why we see this effort offering insight into what could happen with these bills later this year when we expect the real push for enactment.""  The vehicle that carries the stablecoin (and possibly marijuana) legislation doesn't have to make sense. As the industry learned previously, an infrastructure bill carried the most important move against crypto to date.  A final compromise version of the stablecoin bill that pleases both parties and both chambers hasn't yet emerged, so industry insiders are hesitant about cheering it on until they can get a good look.  ""As with all legislation, the devil is in the details,"" said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We look forward to seeing and providing feedback on any new drafts of compromises that emerge.""  At this stage, multiple lawmakers could have major incentives to make a stablecoin bill happen.  ""Brown has an incentive to get SAFER Banking [the marijuana banking bill] over the finish line this year, which would give him a win on a subject popular with voters, cannabis reform, months before a tough re-election fight,"" according to a Tuesday analysis from Beacon Policy Advisors, a firm that tracks financial policy in Washington. Beacon also noted that this is ""a legacy-defining issue for McHenry, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term.""

The verdict was delivered in Seattle federal court and marks the culmination of US authorities‚Äô multiyear investigation into Binance.

In contrast, the defense had requested five months of probation, ultimately given the outcome wanted.

Regulatory Pressure Mounts Zhao was also accused of knowingly allowing Binance to process transactions involving funds derived from unlawful activities, including transactions between US citizens and individuals residing in sanctioned jurisdictions.

26627428,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605875,1714503645,"USDT Dominance Falling, Analyst Predicts Bitcoin To Reach $80,000","Though Bitcoin prices are fast-dropping, looking at events in the daily chart, one analyst thinks the coin is gearing up for a comeback, citing developments in the USDT dominance chart, or USDT.D. USDT Dominance Falling, Good For BTC? Taking to X on April 29, the analyst¬†said USDT.D recently fell, breaking below a critical support trend line. Thus far, USDT.D faces strong rejections at immediate resistance levels, signaling weakness. Related Reading: XRP Price On Watch: Can This 23 Million Token Purchase Spark A Rally? All this, while considering the inverse relation the USDT.D chart has with Bitcoin, the analyst now expects the world‚Äôs most valuable coin to tear higher, reversing recent losses and rejuvenating the broader crypto scene. To understand what‚Äôs going on, one has to understand what the USDT.D chart represents. In essence, it compares the market capitalization of USDT, the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin, versus the total market capitalization of other stablecoins, including USDC, DAI, FUSD, and every other USD-pegged asset. This chart reflects the dominance of USDT in the stablecoin scene. However, analysts have also been using this chart to gauge sentiment and correlation with Bitcoin. As expected, USDT.D and Bitcoin, analysts note, enjoy an inverse correlation. Since stablecoins like USDT act as a safe haven when prices are plunging, USDT.D will rise when BTC prices are plunging and fall whenever Bitcoin is tearing. Following the drop below the support trend line and dipping USDT dominance, the analyst predicts Bitcoin prices will stabilize and even expand in the sessions ahead. So far, BTC is under pressure, shrinking by over 15% from all-time highs. Meanwhile, the USDT.D chart has found resistance. If it rejects, it could signal the resumption of Bitcoin‚Äôs early Q1 2024 uptrend. Bitcoin Bears Pressing On: Next Stop $60,000? Currently, Bitcoin is trending lower but above $60,000. Despite the slowdown, the possibility of BTC finding traction and expanding, even reclaiming $73,800, cannot be discounted. The analyst expects a ‚Äúmassive leg up‚Äù for Bitcoin should USDT.D continue falling, aligning with the support trend line break. According to the analyst‚Äôs projection, BTC can rally above the all-time high towards $80,000 or even higher. Even so, though the analyst is optimistic, BTC prices will not be guaranteed to fly because of shrinking USDT dominance.

26625081,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605853,1714500001,"Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $59,800 Is An Important Level For Bitcoin","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided insights into why $59,800 is a crucial price level for the Bitcoin future trajectory. The analyst revealed two things that could happen if the flagship crypto drops that low. Why $59,800 Is An Important Level For Bitcoin Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin short-term holder‚Äôs (STH) realized price is at $59,800. He added that BTC historically often bounces off this level during an uptrend, which would mean that the flagship crypto could experience a massive pump if it were to drop to that price level. Source: Glassnode However, Martinez also warned of what could happen if Bitcoin fails to experience this bounce, noting that a fall below this level could ‚Äútrigger notable Bitcoin price corrections.‚Äù Although the crypto analyst didn‚Äôt mention how low Bitcoin could drop, his choice of words suggests that a price breakdown for the crypto token could be severe. STH is an important metric that measures the average price at which Bitcoin short-term investors bought the crypto token. A drop to that level suggests that these short-term investors have realized their profits, which leaves room for Bitcoin to make another run following this wave of sell-offs. On the other hand, as Martinez warned, Bitcoin could drop further if it fails to establish support at that level. This brings crypto analyst DonAlt‚Äôs recent prediction into context. He hinted that BTC could fall between $52,000 and $47,000 if it eventually breaks the $60,000 support level. Meanwhile, Martinez also drew the crypto community‚Äôs attention to the $61,900 mark, which he remarked has ‚Äúconsistently been a crucial support level for Bitcoin.‚Äù He further claimed that BTC could rise to as high as $71,000 if it continues to hold above that level. Is The BTC Top In? In a more recent X post, Martinez gave his opinion on whether or not Bitcoin has reached its market top. He tried to analyze it from both sides of the divide. First, he noted that a spike in BTC‚Äôs realized profits has ‚Äúhistorically coincided with market tops.‚Äù He then revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs realized profits skyrocketed to $3.52 billion when it hit $73,880 last month. This would suggest that the market top was indeed in. However, Martinez added that he was waiting for another confirmation before confidently claiming that the market top is in. He claims that this confirmation will come if BTC¬†achieves a sustained close below the short-term realized price, currently around $59,800. Meanwhile, he further stated that this market top theory could be invalidated if Bitcoin surges above $66,250 and claims this area as support. Bitcoin rising above that price level will help it gain the strength it needs to move towards $69,150. If BTC eventually breaches that resistance level, Martinez claimed it could advance to a new all-time high (ATH) of $92,190. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $62,300, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Needs To Breach This Resistance Barrier To Rise To New ATH In a new thread on X, analyst Ali discussed whether the BTC price has hit the top. The one signal the analyst has pointed out that may point towards the top has been the massive scale of profit-taking that the market has seen recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance: Traders Preferring The OG To Dogecoin & Other Altcoins Ali is waiting for another confirmation before the top can be confirmed. In the scenario that the top gets validated, these are the targets the analyst has marked based on on-chain data. The distribution of UTXOs across the various price levels | Source: @ali_charts on X The above chart shows the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data from Glassnode, which tells us how many coins were last bought at what price levels. Generally, the cost basis is an important level for any investor, so they are likely to show some reaction when a retest of it happens. This reaction is the largest when many investors share their cost basis around the same level. When this retest happens from above, the holders may respond by buying more, as they could see the drop as a dip opportunity. As such, large cost basis zones below the current price can prove to be centers of support. ‚ÄúIf the market top is confirmed, BTC could drop toward $51,530 or even $42,700!‚Äù notes Ali, given that these two levels are the next major support lines for the coin. The analyst says, however, that if BTC can instead break the $66,250 level, which is a source of major resistance right now since these loss holders may be desperate to exit at their break-even, then this bearish outlook could become invalidated. An on-chain pricing model could provide some hints about what might happen when such a break occurs. The trend in the MVRV Pricing Bands for BTC over the past few years | Source: @ali_charts on X The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands is a model that, in short, tells us about where the different multipliers of the average cost basis of the entire market currently lie. The chart shows that the market cost basis is currently at $28,800. Historically, three multipliers of this metric have been relevant for the asset: 0.8x, 2.4x, and 3.2x. The 0.8x level is where bottoms occur, while the 3.2x line is a probable spot for tops to form. Bull rallies in proper have occurred after a breach of the 2.4x level. At present, the 2.4x level lies at $69,150. ‚ÄúBy rising above $66,250, Bitcoin will gain the strength to push towards $69,150. And if this resistance barrier is breached, BTC can advance toward a new all-time high of $92,190,‚Äù explains Ali. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Foreshadowed Recent Price Drops, Quant Reveals This ATH target is based on the fact that the 3.2x level is equivalent to $92,190 at the moment.

42408307,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCfsR,1714492958,Crypto‚Äôs Transition: Bringing Capital Onshore,"The world of cryptocurrencies and digital assets is currently in transition from a largely unregulated world of innovation into a much more regulated and structured world of large companies and organized product offerings.  The opportunity for blockchain-based digital assets is enormous because, large though they might seem, offshore assets are a pretty small share of total global assets.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  It is estimated that there are about $700 trillion of global financial and business assets on planet earth. That includes roughly $100 trillion in global stock markets, another $100 trillion in bonds, another $100 trillion in bank deposits, and over $350 trillion in real estate, and that‚Äôs just what you need to buy a two-bedroom condo in San Francisco. Of that, the blockchain ecosystem is about $2 trillion in total and there‚Äôs another roughly $20 trillion in commodities.  Of this approximately $700 trillion, about $685 trillion is considered an ‚Äúonshore‚Äù asset ‚Äì that is, they are held by people and entities that are officially and accountably residents in the countries in which they operate or exist. Estimates by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) put all the offshore assets at around $12 trillion. That‚Äôs a lot of money, but in the context of global assets, it‚Äôs a drop in the ocean, less than 2% of the total. Right now, that 2% is relatively lightly, or not at all regulated and a fair chunk of that is cryptocurrencies.  As much money as that is, it‚Äôs not a big deal compared to the vast quantities of money that reside onshore in structured, regulated markets. Much of the world‚Äôs liquid assets are managed by regulated institutions. CalPERS, the California state employee pension fund, has nearly $500 billion under management alone. TIAA-CREF, which represents about 5 million active and retired teachers in the U.S., has another $1.3 trillion in assets. That‚Äôs more than the entire crypto-asset market today, and neither firm can make sizable investments that aren‚Äôt highly regulated.  As the world of blockchain-based digital assets becomes structured and regulated, that opens up a flood of capital and will transform the industry. Based on the data available, we‚Äôre still very clearly in the early stages of this transformation. Of the top 10 crypto exchanges, seven are based in offshore environments like the Seychelles or British Virgin Islands, and they represent 80% of current spot crypto volume (as of 21 February per CoinGecko).  If you go and read reports about asset allocation, you can‚Äôt even find a category that is crypto-focused. A few European pension funds do have explicit allocations for commodities and precious metals, but the overwhelming majority of assets being managed still fall into some basic categories such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. We have, in other words, barely scratched the surface of likely future allocations to digital assets and cryptocurrencies.  To be clear, we should not confuse less-regulated or offshore money with criminal activity. These are not the same, though some might like to conflate the two. However, we should expect that as the scope of regulatory control grows, most of the net new growth in transactions and volumes is likely to come from onshore enterprises doing business with regulated peers in pension funds, banks, and private equity.  This doesn‚Äôt mean that the offshore component of the business is going away or likely to fail, but it does mean that onshore, regulated firms are likely to be the main beneficiaries of the next wave of growth. And for companies in this space, it has never been more important to be engaged in local markets with local regulators.  The challenge here exists for much of the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency exchanges: nearly all of them are based in offshore markets like the Seychelles, the Bahamas, Virgin Islands, for example. Today, offshore firms dominate the list of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. My guess is that this won‚Äôt last.  As regulation matures, the center of gravity for exchanges is going to migrate from offshore to onshore. Right now, there is nearly no-overlap between these offshore and onshore ecosystems ‚Äì what I mean is that almost no companies offering offshore services have also successfully navigated onshore regulatory rules and established themselves in those markets.  The transition ahead, then, isn‚Äôt just where the center of gravity will be; it will also be where the dominant industry players are focused. For firms that top the leaderboard today, the challenge is clear: get into onshore, regulated markets, or see your relevance shrink in the future.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/30/cryptos-transition-bringing-capital-onshore,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/175b96dbd597f0de61d90b42191d705711545187-3992x2242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408317,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCgFa,1714492800,Distilling the Tornado Cash and Samourai Suits,"There was a lot of news last week, but maybe the biggest news came Wednesday when the U.S. Department of Justice arrested two co-founders of Samourai Wallet, a bitcoin wallet that offered mixing services. The arrest ramps up the federal government's efforts to tamp down on what it sees as money laundering enabled by privacy tools, and sets up a continuation of that broader conversation on where the right to transact in privacy fits within national security interests.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Controlling interest  The narrative  Between last week‚Äôs Department of Justice filing in its case against Roman Storm and its new indictment against Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill, the U.S. government‚Äôs concerns around crypto mixing are becoming clearer ‚Äì as is how the DOJ is approaching these cases.  Why it matters  Is code speech? Are you responsible if you write code and someone else uses it to launder stolen funds? Is that even the correct question, or is that abstracting a legitimate national security issue into a broader hypothetical in an effort to conflate the bigger philosophical question with real ‚Äì and illicit ‚Äì activity?  These are now just some of the questions at the heart of a back-and-forth between the U.S. Department of Justice and the crypto industry in the ongoing criminal case against Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm. The stakes rose last week after the DOJ also arrested and charged Rodriguez and Hill, the co-founders of Samourai Wallet.  Breaking it down  There are basically four different main arguments. The first is about the right to privacy. People should be able to send money to another person in a way that others can't track them. This isn't an issue unique to crypto, though crypto being what it is, there are a lot of mixing tools that are genuinely specific to crypto because most digital assets don't have a native, built-in privacy functionality (and the ones that do, don‚Äôt see a ton of usage).  The second is the right to create code. If code is speech, merely programming smart contracts cannot in itself be a crime, even if malicious actors use those smart contracts to launder illicit funds.  The third focuses on questions of national security. The U.S. dollar is a tool, and the federal government will use it to try and prevent bad actors, as defined by U.S. and other national authorities, from engaging in economic activity. These sanctions have been imposed on individuals, like private citizens who laundered ransomware proceeds; groups, like Russia's Sovcomflot or Suex; and on nations, like the governments of Iran and North Korea. And they can be effective, research shows.  From that point of view, the fact that crypto mixers allow (maybe even encourage) users from these sanctioned entities or regions to use their services is a pretty obvious red line, and criminal indictments are a logical next step.  And then there‚Äôs the most important point of contention: what did the developers actually do, and is the mixer a money-transmitting entity capable of complying with anti-money laundering regulations?  According to the Department of Justice, the answer is yes. The Tornado Cash developers didn‚Äôt just build an open-source piece of software; they developed an actual business facilitating transactions that the federal government deemed illegal, the DOJ said in both an indictment last year and a filing last Friday. Tornado Cash isn‚Äôt just a set of smart contracts released into the world; it‚Äôs an entire ecosystem of smart contracts, a front end, a user interface and experience, and so much more. In pursuing this argument, the DOJ is also raising new questions about the activities an entity might engage in to be deemed a money transmitter.  Questions about a right to privacy are almost a red herring. Sure, it's an important issue, but it's not the main issue at the heart of these cases. However the cases are resolved, the issue in court won‚Äôt necessarily be whether Americans (and others) have a right to transact privately or whether code alone is speech; it's what the services providing privacy are doing and how they're doing it.  In other words, just what in the world is a money transmitter, anyway?  We already have some hints. The DOJ recently won a case against Roman Sterlingov, the operator behind crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog, successfully arguing he committed money laundering, operated an unlicensed money transmitter and other related things.  That case touched on these same issues, though, of course, the underlying facts are different. In the Tornado Cash case, the facts themselves seem to be a point of contention between the prosecution and the defense. Storm asserted ‚Äì as his colleague Roman Semenov did well before Tornado Cash was first sanctioned ‚Äì that he did not have much control over Tornado Cash at the time. The DOJ disagrees with the premise, writing in last week‚Äôs filing that the relevant part of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance doesn‚Äôt address the idea of ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù  Rather, the DOJ argued that the money-transmitting business includes relayers, the Tornado Cash pools, a commercial enterprise, etc. Moreover, the DOJ argued that something that can transfer value qualifies as a money transmitter (an assertion that‚Äôs drawn quite a bit of pushback online).  Long story short, much of the debate leading up to the trial ‚Äì and maybe during the trial itself ‚Äì will center around the question of whether any system of smart contracts that transfer value qualifies as money transmitters. If the answer is yes, does that mean that other decentralized autonomous organizations or similar types of autonomous entities might be transmitters? If that answer is yes, we come back to the question of just what a money transmitter is and where the line is that requires a service to register as such in the U.S. and implement know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules. This case may well define a money transmitter, and the crypto industry is unlikely to like the answer should the DOJ win.  This line of questioning is reminiscent of the unhosted wallet proposal by FinCEN near the end of 2020 ‚Äì and, coincidentally, the FBI also just published a warning about unhosted wallets just last week.  And this brings us to (also) last week, when prosecutors brought conspiracy to commit money laundering charges against Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, the developers behind Samourai Wallet.  For many in the industry, this was an escalation of the federal government's ongoing efforts against the right to transact privately and/or write code. But it goes back to the basic questions at the top ‚Äì what are those red lines, and did the Samourai Wallet team create a wallet they controlled and offered privacy mixing features on top of?  Samourai, like Tornado, collected fees for services rendered, the DOJ alleged in its indictment, and the defendants built tools knowing there may be illicit usage.  It remains to be seen how far the comparisons extend, but the core arguments seem to be similar.  Some platforms are announcing blocks against U.S.-based customers as a result, though unless they actually build know-your-customer programs, that may not be enough to satisfy the DOJ's concerns.

42408313,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCg8y,1714491399,"‚ÄòIt's Modding, But on Steroids‚Äô: Mark Long on the Future of Web3 Gaming","Web3 games have a shaky track record. It‚Äôs easy to see the appeal: There are literally billions of people playing games, and most of them do it for free. They spend countless hours ‚Äî and often their own cash ‚Äî to create content that grows the ecosystem, and they get nothing while the gaming companies get everything. Web3 games, in theory, give power (and equity) to the players.  Or, that was the pitch in the last bull cycle, when Web3 games like Axie Infinity seemed to create new economies and even lift players from poverty. Then prices tumbled, games crumbled. Can Web3 games make a comeback?  Mark Long is a speaker at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Now at least one thing is different: Top-tier gaming talent has entered the Web3 space, focused on creating games that are actually a blast to play, not just a means to grind out crypto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important that it‚Äôs a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3,‚Äù says Mark Long, CEO of Shrapnel, the blockchain-infused and ‚Äúmoddable‚Äù first-person shooter game, which is expected to be released in 2025. (Modding refers to the ability of gamers to modify aspects of the game experience.)  Long knows about building great games. He‚Äôs the former head of Xcloud, a game-streaming service, at Microsoft, the former head of publishing at HBO Interactive, and he‚Äôs produced over 32 games in his 26-year career. And now he‚Äôs bringing that savvy to Web3. Long opens up about the extra challenges in creating a Web3 game (the wrong tweak to a database can cost players millions), what gamers can expect from Shrapnel (‚Äúmodding on steroids‚Äù), and why he views Consensus as the most ‚Äúscholarly‚Äù crypto conference.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What‚Äôs the vision of Shrapnel? What are you trying to pull off?  Mark Long: So, I love triple-A shooters. I just love all shooters; I play all of them all the time. But what I love more is actually modding shooters. And I mean, going all the way back to Doom 2 and Quake and Half-Life.  You're speaking my language. I still remember the keyboard shortcut to pull up the shotgun in Doom.  Yes! So even though I was making games in the studio during the day, at night I would come home and mod those type of games. And if I got 11 people to play my map, I'd be thrilled. Right? Which is ridiculous because I'm making games for millions of players. But this is something very personal. I get a personal joy from modding a game that I really like.  So, fast forward to the Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite era. Kids start off making their own content in Minecraft, and they age into Roblox, and so they become more proficient. And with Fortnite, 50% of the engagement is made by other players, which is stunning. But when you turn 18 to 35 years old, there's nothing for you to age into.  And I don't think young players are going to stop wanting to make their own games. And our theory is if you gave them the same professional level of tools that we have, they'd actually make some pretty cool shit. So, that's what Shrapnel is. It's an extraction first-person shooter based on Web3. And it‚Äôs a free, frictionless database technology that allows us to seamlessly attribute all these contributions that players can make to a game, and then reward them for it.  How so?  You‚Äôll be rewarded for your contribution. And in our world, that can be a lot of things. You can modify our maps ‚Äî just use all our static meshes and modify them. You can do character skins. You can do character customization. Make emblems, customize weapons. And then, of course, you just mint those. And then I could sell, trade, rent, stake all those items. That's what I'm really excited about. It's modding, but on steroids.  Let‚Äôs talk about Web3 gaming more broadly. Taking Shrapnel out of the equation, why do you think there haven‚Äôt yet been any great Web3 games?  So, all these games were put into production in the last bull cycle, right? And they‚Äôre just now coming to the public in early access or open beta. But I'd argue there are a handful of really good games out there that I'm excited to play. There‚Äôs MetalCore, the mech shooter. There's Wildcard, the card-battler game by the husband and wife team that did Words with Friends. I like Dead Drop. I like Off the Grid, which has art direction by Neill Blomkamp. I fucking love Neill Blomkamp. So the short version is there are a handful of games that actually are going to be really good and break through, and then of course there‚Äôs Shrapnel.  Fair enough! There are some good games. But those seem to be the outliers.  I think part of your lament for the earlier Web3 games is because of two reasons: A lot of the teams are not game development teams, they're crypto development teams. Right? And two, it‚Äôs production values. They haven‚Äôt had the money to put into the game to make it really great.  What‚Äôs extra challenging about building a Web3 game, compared to a traditional video game? What are the additional wrinkles caused by decentralization?  Great question. I want to start by saying that it‚Äôs very important that it‚Äôs a great game, period, whether for Web2 or Web3. It‚Äôs easy to lose track of that. But to answer your question, one simple thing comes to mind. Think about working on a database in a game. Think about, for example, all the items I can collect for my character ‚Äî my gear, my helmet, my weapon, all that stuff. You have a pretty complex database and it has to provide for all this attribution. If I make a mistake in normal development, you just reset the database and then start over again.  But here with web3, that has real-world value. Right? So if we fuck up and I delete your $1,000 worth of stuff, I can't claim that I'm World of Warcraft and you never really owned it anyway. That‚Äôs a huge problem. So we have to be especially meticulous as we integrate any Web3 component. Then there‚Äôs the problem of potential exploits ‚Äî things that we miss could create a disaster for the economy. It takes longer to integrate the Web3 component. The code has to be audited at a level that game code never normally needs to be audited. That was all brand new to us. It slows down our roadmap. But as we get better at it and there‚Äôs more tooling APIs and SDKs available, it will just get better and better.  For many who are only casually following the Web3 gaming space, they‚Äôve heard of the boom-and-bust cycle of ‚ÄúPlay to Earn.‚Äù There are concerns that this model is not sustainable ‚Äî it only works when the token price is rising, but then, if the price falls, the economy collapses. What‚Äôs the solve for this? What‚Äôs the trick for making Web3 games viable for the long-term, and not relying upon price appreciation?  So I would probably guess that for the economies that you‚Äôre thinking about that collapsed, they‚Äôre kind of pyramid economies where you have to have a large number inflowing at the bottom, and they grind and level-up assets or characters that then get sold to the person above them who‚Äôs also grinding. You need lots coming in at the bottom to do that. And then when the community collapses or the token price collapses, nobody's playing because it's a fun game ‚Äî they‚Äôre there to make money off it. So they abandon it.  Ah, so the trick is the game quality itself‚Ä¶  What we think will happen in game economies like Shrapnel is the more players you have, and the more engagement you have, the more they‚Äôre using the token in-game. That‚Äôs driving the need for the token and it kind of has a burn effect. It‚Äôs consuming the supply, and that means there's more buy pressure than sell pressure.  If I hear you right, it sounds like you‚Äôre saying there needs to be actual legit utility in these tokens. It‚Äôs not sham utility. People are using it. They're using it because they want to play the game and have fun. So the game needs to be good, period. Am I getting that right?  Yeah. Let's just use a rough order of magnitude example. The average paying player in Web3 might be $100 a month versus $10 a month on Web2. So every one of those new Web3 players adds $100 of consumption. Remember, the economy is in the token, so they are spending $100 of the token.  Okay, last couple of questions are about Consensus itself. What‚Äôs your favorite Consensus memory?  Well, you know, last year we demoed the game for the first time at Consensus. We were right at one of the main entrances, and by the end of the first day, they had just moved the bar to our space because so many people wanted to play the game, and were excited to get their hands on it.  What are you most looking forward to at Consensus this year?  It‚Äôs a really well-curated conference. I would call it a scholarly conference, where the panels are well-vetted.  Love it, and thank you. On a less scholarly front, what‚Äôs the best Consensus side-party?  It'll be ours.  Good answer.

26618354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605852,1714489259,Crypto Funds Mark 3rd Consecutive Weeks Of Outflows With $435 Million In Withdrawals,"Crypto investment products are now going through rough times, as shown by inflow and outflow data. The crypto market is known for its volatile market cycles of ups and downs. Investment products are now struggling, and confidence in the space seems shaken. Crypto funds have now seen outflows for three straight weeks, with investors pulling $435 million from digital asset funds last week, according to CoinShares data. The recent stretch of outflows highlights the souring investor sentiment around some digital assets after a bull run earlier this year. The Third Consecutive Week Of Crypto Withdrawals CoinShares‚Äô recent weekly report on digital asset fund flows has revealed the current sentiment among institutional investors. According to the report, investment funds witnessed $435 million in outflows last week to mark the biggest outflow since March. This comes on top of the $206 million and $126 million pulled out in the previous two weeks. Unsurprisingly, the majority of outflows came from Bitcoin funds. Of the total $435 million outflows, $423 million came from Bitcoin funds. Notably, a bulk of Bitcoin‚Äôs outflows ($328 million) came from Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. A look into previous crypto fund flow data since the beginning of the year shows that the majority of the inflows recorded in January, February, and March can be attributed to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs recorded so much inflow of funds that investment products were able to record their best year on record in less than three months. However, inflows into these ETFs have declined in the past few weeks, and the largest digital asset is now failing to attract inflows amidst interest rate stagnation in the US market. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, in particular, continued its run of withdrawals, recording $440 million in outflows. At the same time, the other ETFs failed to attract inflows during the week in order to offset these withdrawals. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, for instance, failed to register inflows for three days straight last week, bringing its 71-day run of inflows to an end. Ethereum, the altcoin king, also witnessed $38.4 million in outflows last week to offset inflows into other altcoins. Inflow data shows investors pouring $6.9 million worth of inflows into multi-coin investment products. Solana, Litecoin, XRP, Cardano, and Polkadot witnessed $4.1 million, $3.1 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million in inflows, respectively. Short Bitcoin products also witnessed $1.3 million in inflows, showcasing a glimpse into investors‚Äô sentiment. What‚Äôs Next? Investor sentiment can shift quickly in the fast-moving crypto space and the coming weeks may provide more clarity on the direction of crypto fund flows. Six Spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set to launch in Hong Kong today April 30. Their entry into the Asian market has been long anticipated and is expected to surpass the first-day inflow record set by their counterparts in the US.

Growth of Ondo Finance's OUSG token was responsible for large part of the inflows.  Asset management company BlackRock's (BLK) tokenized asset fund BUIDL became the largest of its kind Tuesday, overtaking rival Franklin Templeton's similar offering just six weeks after its debut.  The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, represented by the BUIDL token on the Ethereum {{ETH}} network and backed by U.S. Treasury bills, repo agreements and cash, now boasts $375 million of deposits after enjoying $70 million of inflows last week, blockchain data by rwa.xyz shows. The fund, created with tokenization services platform Securitize, has captured almost 30% market share since its debut on March 21.  Meanwhile, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund with the BENJI token slid to $368 million in assets under management after experiencing minor outflows during the same period.  The change in guard was largely thanks to the growth of Ondo Finance {{ONDO}}, whose tokenized Treasury offering OUSG leverages BlackRock's token as reserve asset and enjoyed $50 million of inflows in a week.  The rapid growth of BlackRock's first tokenized offering, occurred as putting conventional assets like bonds and credit onto blockchain rails in forms of tokens ‚Äì also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) ‚Äì has captivated digital asset firms and traditional finance (TradFi) giants alike. Tokenization could offer benefits like faster, around-the-clock settlements, increased operational efficiency and greater transparency.  U.S. Treasuries among RWAs have emerged as a gateway for tokenization efforts as a low-risk, well-known instrument where investors can park their on-chain cash and earn stable yield without leaving the blockchain ecosystem.

42408306,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCfvk,1714486367,Web3 in the Middle East: Do All Roads Lead to Riyadh?,"The Middle East has been making strides in Web3. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) established digital assets regulators such as the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) in Abu Dhabi. Last year, ADGM-based Hub71 launched a $2 billion initiative to support Web3 startups in the region. Thanks to its favorable stance towards cryptocurrency, innovation, and tax incentives, the UAE has become a hotspot for crypto and blockchain projects and funds. And now Saudi Arabia, its rival, is ambitious to prove it can become its own Web3 hub.  U.K.-based Outlier Ventures recently announced it is launching its own Web3 accelerator program in partnership with Saudi‚Äôs National Technology Development Program (NPDP). ""The level of dedication, education, and international experience of the highly skilled workforce, as well as the people coming to the Kingdom, is very interesting to see,"" said Outlier Ventures CEO Stephan Apel.  ‚ÄúWhile the Web3 ecosystem in the Kingdom is still developing, we observe an extraordinarily fast rate of development and a huge potential,‚Äù Apel told CoinDesk.  Saudi Arabia‚Äôs $95 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has reportedly held partnership talks with Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), one the leading VC backers of Web3 startups. Animoca Brands, a leading Asian Web3 gaming VC, has partnered with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) in the capital, Riyadh to advance the gaming ecosystem in the country.  Speaking at The Outer Edge Summit, held at The Garage, a 28,000 meter squared startup district in KACST, Robby Yung, CEO of Amonica Brands lauded opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. ‚ÄúWe are coming here a little bit late, we recognized the opportunity here a decade ago but didn‚Äôt have the resources to tackle a new market at that time,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a really big piece of the world map‚Ä¶ Since 2020, the UAE has become a gathering place for Web3 as a community because of the regulatory framework. Here, you have a huge country and over 60% of them are under the age of 30. Those are gamers, those are our people. So, we want to be on the ground, we want to understand how we can communicate with them. We felt it was important to start here as a point of contact,‚Äù Yung told CoinDesk during Animoca‚Äôs Outer Edge Summit in Riyadh.  Meanwhile Golden Gate Ventures, a Singapore-based VC firm, has expanded its offices to the Gulf region and sees Saudi Arabia as the next frontier.  ‚ÄúOverall, investment appetite in Saudi Arabia is very healthy, although we haven't seen Web3 as prominent as in other parts of the region. With the increased investment in artificial intelligence, we'll see more investments in Web3 follow swiftly,‚Äù Micheal Lints, a partner at Golden Gate, said.  Saudi Arabia has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to attracting Web3 investment. It ranks in 62nd place in the World Bank‚Äôs ‚ÄúEase of Doing Business‚Äù country index, outperforming for criteria like ‚Äúsetting up a business‚Äù (38th place overall) and ‚Äúgetting electricity‚Äù (18th). It does less well for ‚Äúgetting credit‚Äù (80th place) and ‚Äútrading across borders‚Äù (86th). Its policies on women in the workplace, and alcohol, may make it unattractive to startups used to operating in less socially-restrictive environments.  A metaverse NEOM  XVRS, the metaverse platform for NEOM, the $1.5 trillion desert city that was announced in 2017, is one of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs largest Web3-related projects to date. More than $1 billion has been invested in the creation of an immersive digital twin of NEOM, it has been reported. The space will offer immersive entertainment, a social platform, and a built-in digital marketplace for crypto and NFTs, the project backers say.  During the Saudi Ministry of Investment Association‚Äôs inauguralLeap Summit, in February, the Hashgraph Association announced a five-year partnership to support local tech startups, including DeepTech, a $250 million venture studio. Leap Summit, Saudi Arabia's annual tech conference, attracted more than 220,000 attendees this year ‚Äì nearly double that of Las Vegas‚Äô Consumer Electronic Show (CES).  Legislation  While the Kingdom‚Äôs legal provisions for cryptocurrency are unclear, a report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reveals growing appetite for crypto among the Saudi population of 36 million. Saudi crypto investors amassed more than $350 million in crypto gains in 2023, overtaking the UAE, which recorded approximately $204 million in during the same period, the analysis shows.  Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is eyeing the country as a source of growth, according to Bandar Al Tunisi, Development Lead for Binance in Saudi Arabia. Binance is talking with regulators, including the SAMA central bank and the capital markets regulatory authority, along with the Ministry of Communications and Information, he said. Al Tunisi hopes for ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù regulation for digital currencies in the country as soon as this year.  ‚ÄúI think it's one of the most important places in the world in terms of opportunity, in terms of growth, in terms of the willingness of the leadership, in terms of nimbleness of the leadership and the capability of the local population,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúWe are hopeful [the regulatory framework] will happen this year. Obviously that's not something that we have control over, but we're on the ground. We're ready.‚Äù  Saudi Arabia's proactive approach to fostering innovation, coupled with strategic partnerships and its Vision 2030 initiative, positions the Kingdom as a significant contender in the global Web3 landscape.

42408300,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCfbu,1714485405,Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Gets 4 Months in Prison,"Binance's CZ got a four-month prison sentence.  ""There's no evidence that the defendant was ever informed"" of illegal activity at Binance, the judge said.  SEATTLE ‚Äî Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced Tuesday to four months in prison.  U.S. Judge Richard Jones immediately sounded skeptical during a hearing of the Department of Justice's arguments for a years-long sentence.  ""There's no evidence that the defendant was ever informed"" of illegal activity at Binance, the judge said in a Seattle courtroom, before saying he disagreed with the U.S. Department of Justice's recommendation for an increase from the baseline sentencing guideline of 10 to 16 months in prison and up to three years of supervised release.  ""The court finds the defendant has accepted responsibility,"" the judge said. ""Everything I see about you and your characteristics are of a mitigating nature,"" the judge said to Zhao as he began to read through his order.  A court document released after the hearing concluded also notes the judge recommended Zhao serve his sentence at the Federal Detention Center, SeaTac, though the Bureau of Prisons will make a final decision. The Probation and Pretrial Services Office will set a reporting date for Zhao to surrender himself.  Zhao, with buzz-cut hair and wearing a navy blue suit and light blue tie, learned his fate accompanied in court by his mother, sister, nephew and son. Zhao's plea deal last year saw him agree to pay a $50 million fine, a small fraction of his estimated net worth. Bloomberg reported Monday that he might have some $43 billion in assets to his name.  ""I think the first step to taking responsibility is to fully recognize the mistakes. Here, I failed to fully set up a [know-your-customer program],"" Zhao said moments before hearing the judge's decision. ""I also recognize the importance of having a robust KYC/[anti-money-laundering] program. That is why I directed Binance to cooperate with the U.S.'s investigation.""  The former head of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange pleaded guilty in November to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, a charge that might normally carry up to 10 years in prison. But his guilty plea and cooperation reduced that. A presentence report filed by the court's Probation Office recommended he spend just five months in prison.  Prosecutors and defense lawyers had vastly differing recommendations: The DOJ asked a federal judge to sentence Zhao to three years in prison, twice what was laid out in his plea agreement. His defense, on the other hand, asked for no prison time, suggesting he just get probation.  His sentence contrasts with the 25-year penalty his former rival, FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, recently got.     Read more: Why the DOJ May Have Recommended a Three-Year Sentence for CZ  Binance agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine the same day Zhao pleaded guilty last year. The agreement also saw him step down from the exchange he'd founded in 2017.  A prosecutor argued Tuesday that the Bank Secrecy Act guidelines were too lenient, pointing to Binance's huge size as evidence for why Zhao should spend a ""meaningful"" amount of time in prison, if not three years.  ""If Mr. Zhao does not face incarceration after deliberately and willfully planning to violate U.S. law to build the largest crypto exchange in the world and get rich in the process ‚Ä¶ then no one will face incarceration and the BSA will for intents and purposes be a dead letter,"" a prosecutor said Tuesday.  The judge should be able to infer Zhao's understanding of any illicit activity occurring on his platform, even in the absence of specific evidence, the prosecutor said.  Zhao's defense attorneys pointed to a lack of precedent in arguing for no prison time at all, saying there have been no cases with similar circumstances where a defendant was incarcerated. The U.S.'s previous case against BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes was one such example, the defense said.  Moreover, Zhao cooperated with the U.S. government, one defense attorney argued, saying this cooperation was ""well-documented"" and even acknowledged by the DOJ.

26615084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605837,1714483813,Major Bitcoin Developments Points To A Wilder Bull Cycle Than Anticipated,"Lark Davis, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst and trader, has identified several significant developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem that could trigger an even more intense bull cycle than initially anticipated.¬†Davis‚Äôs perspective delves into the revolutionary changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as institutional and global acceptance, which hold the potential to accelerate the current bull market. According to the analyst, there is about to be a big shock to the Bitcoin supply. This is a result of miners now being able to produce just 450 BTC each day, due to the recently concluded Bitcoin Halving event, which cut down miners‚Äô reward in half. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Poised To Catalyzed Prices Another key catalyst pointed out by Davis is the US Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Since the approval of the products by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10, over 3,000 BTC have been purchased on a daily basis. Consequently, BTC witnessed a surge of nearly 60%, rising from around $46,000 to $73,000 after the SEC green light BTC spot ETFs. Related Reading: Samson Mow On Bitcoin Halving: Brace For Supply Shock, Omega Candle In Sight The latest country to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETFs is Hong Kong. Two weeks ago, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong granted approval for BTC Spot ETFs to multiple leading asset managers, thereby positioning the city as a primary hub for these products. Given the previous impact of the funds propelling BTC to a new all-time high, the approval of the products in HK could cause the asset to see another surge in value. Hong Kong‚Äôs move to approve the spot ETF products, which have¬†already started trading today, has inspired other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, to consider doing the same. On the other hand, the Australia Securities Exchange is already on the verge of accepting the funds within the year. As a result of these developments, institutions from all around the world are vying for a share of the Bitcoin market. This could trigger a much broader adoption of BTC, thereby impacting prices significantly. Davis highlighted that the availability of Bitcoin on all exchanges is presently at a record low, and the OTC desks are getting low. Due to this, the crypto expert believes this current bull cycle will be far crazier than predicted. BTC Prices Continue To Struggle Despite the funds clearance in Hong Kong, BTC has yet to witness major price movements, as it continues to struggle between $61,000 and $66,000. Given this, several analysts are anticipating a further price decline in the coming weeks.

26611776,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605827,1714478403,XRP Price On Watch: Can This 23 Million Token Purchase Spark A Rally?,"The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a period of sluggishness. Yet, a recent whale activity has injected a flicker of hope for XRP, the native token of Ripple. On Tuesday, a significant investor, commonly referred to as a whale, acquired a hefty 23 million XRP, sparking renewed interest in the embattled token. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? Whale Movement: A Sign Of Shifting Tides? The purchase was identified by Whale Alert, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. The tokens originated from a Binance exchange wallet, with the recipient address remaining undisclosed. However, the fact that the recipient was a Binance user suggests potential for further trading activity. This whale movement is seen by some analysts as a potential turning point for XRP. Historically, large-scale purchases by whales have often preceded price surges. However, some experts caution against overinterpretation. Whale activity can be driven by various factors, and a single purchase doesn‚Äôt guarantee a sustained upward trend for XRP. üö® 23,037,429 #XRP (11,550,284 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallethttps://t.co/K00G3Ry7ab ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 29, 2024 Open Interest: A Mixed Signal Adding a layer of complexity is the recent decline in XRP Open Interest (OI). As per data from Coinalyze, XRP OI has dipped by 2.12% over the past 24 hours. Open Interest reflects the total value of outstanding futures contracts for a particular cryptocurrency. A decrease suggests a potential reduction in leveraged positions, which could indicate short-term selling pressure. However, analysts point out that the perpetual contracts, which constitute the majority of XRP OI, still hold significant weight at over $374 million. A renewed buying spree could trigger a reversal in the Open Interest trend, potentially propelling the price upwards. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.19 trillion. Chart: TradingView The Lingering Shadow Of The SEC Lawsuit It‚Äôs impossible to discuss XRP‚Äôs future without acknowledging the ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which alleges XRP is an unregistered security, has undoubtedly cast a long shadow over the token‚Äôs performance. While the recent ‚Äúremedies phase‚Äù of the lawsuit hints at a potential settlement, investors remain cautious. The final outcome and its timeline are still uncertain, leaving a cloud of ambiguity over XRP‚Äôs regulatory status. XRP Price Outlook: A Glimmer Of Optimism? Currently, XRP is trading at around $0.50, a significant drop from its all-time high of over $3. The price reflects the broader market slump and the ongoing legal battle.

42408314,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCgMC,1714478400,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Falls to $62K as Hong Kong ETFs Fail to Meet Expectations,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $62,000 during the European morning, having treaded water around $63,000 throughout most of the Asian session. BTC was changing hands at about $61,670 at the time of writing, down 1.3% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has dropped around 2.7%. The debut of crypto ETFs in Hong Kong looks unlikely to inject any life into this sedentary market for now, with BTC products drawing just $8.5 million in volume and ETH drawing $2.5 million on the first day. Issuers expected the initial volume to be over $100 million, according to local media reports.  MicroStrategy now holds almost 1% of the total circulating supply of bitcoin, having acquired 25,250 BTC in Q1. Broker Canaccord Genuity cut its MSTR price target from $1,810 to $1,590 while maintaining its buy rating after the software company reported a net operating loss of $53.1 million following a digital asset impairment charge of $191.6 million. Canaccord said the main drivers of the new price target are continued appreciation of BTC and ""some revaluation up for the software business."" There is a scarcity value to MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin holdings, given it remains one of the best ways for most equity investors to gain exposure to the digital asset, Canaccord added, and this setup ‚Äúprovides the potential for an additional premium to spot to re-emerge in MSTR shares.‚Äù MSTR sunk over 5.5% to $1,220 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.  A NASDAQ-listed coal miner has mined $30 million worth of bitcoin using excess power at its facilities. Alliance Resource Partners said in an earnings call that it had 425 BTC on its balance sheet, which it had acquired as part of a pilot project to monetize underutilized electricity at its River View mine in Kentucky. The $30 million valuation represents a gain of around $7.3 million, the firm's CFO Cary Marshall said. Marshall added that the company isn't buying bitcoin but mining it with its existing equipment. ""We do have some extra capacity that we're renting out to other bitcoin miners within the data center that we've effectively built for this bitcoin mining to take advantage of the low energy costs we have,"" he added.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows Google's search value for the term ""Bitcoin"" in Japan over the past five years.  Despite the yen's recent sharp depreciation to over three-decade lows, retail interest in bitcoin, an alternative asset often touted as a hedge against fiat currency volatility, has declined.  Google Trends provides access to a primarily unfiltered sample of search requests made to Google. It scales their searches from 0 to 100, with search values representing interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and period.

26609363,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605810,1714474858,PEPE Chart Heats Up: Crypto Analyst Calls It One Of The Most Attractive,"Cold Blooded Shiller (@ColdBloodShill), a well-known figure in the crypto analysis community, recently shared a technical analysis of the PEPE/USDT pair on Binance, marking it as one of the most promising charts in the current market landscape. With his analysis, posted to his 272,000 followers on X, he describes the potential movements of PEPE, both bullish and bearish, as it approaches a critical juncture on its trading chart. Why PEPE Is One Of The Most Attractive Crypto‚Äôs Right Now The chart, set on a four-hour time frame, details PEPE‚Äôs price action and its interaction with significant technical levels. A key focal point of Shiller‚Äôs analysis is the resistance-turned-support zone between approximately $0.0000063 and $0.0000062. This level, highlighted in green, previously acted as a strong resistance zone, and its conversion to support suggests a foundational shift in market sentiment towards PEPE. Moreover, PEPE is currently approaching a crucial resistance marked by a descending trend line in red, indicating a potential breakout point. However, Shiller cautiously notes that while the asset is on the verge of breaking this downtrend, there‚Äôs a risk of what he terms a ‚Äúfakeout.‚Äù This scenario could see the price initially breaking above the trend line only to retract back below it, potentially leading to a decline of about 13% towards the established support zone at $0.0047423. Related Reading: 1,503x Profit: How A Memecoin Trader Made $13 Million With PEPE Should this support hold against market volatility‚Äîa common challenge in the crypto trading sphere‚Äîit may serve as a springboard for PEPE. Shiller speculates a possible rally that could result in a 47.47% increase from the support level, targeting an upper price level of $0.000011. Such a movement would not only confirm the strength of the current support but also signify a strong bullish market phase for PEPE. The analysis also pays close attention to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering near the 50 mark, a neutral territory that indicates the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. This positioning suggests the potential for significant price movement in either direction, emphasizing the importance of the upcoming potential breakout or fakeout scenario. Related Reading: 69% Of PEPE Holders Left In Profits After 26% Plunge Cold Blooded Shiller‚Äôs analysis concludes with a nod towards taking a chance on PEPE if it begins to show signs of a firm breakout. His detailed observation and the technical markers he highlights suggest that, despite potential risks, the reward could indeed be substantial should favorable conditions prevail. ‚ÄúPEPE [is] one of the sexiest looking charts out there right now. Consolidating above it‚Äôs former significant level. Does it have the chance for lower and some fuckery with a fakeout? Yes. Is it worth the opportunity shot if it starts to breakout? Absolutely yes,‚Äù he stated. At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.000006976. Thus, the meme coin is approaching the 200-EMA at $0.000006677. If this support does not hold, a retest of the red support zone seems plausible.

Among these, Tron (TRX) and Aptos (APT) are two significant altcoins that have made headlines recently for their market movements. Both coins are now catching the eye of investors following the announcement of the DTX Exchange presale, a new deFi platform that promises a 100X rally with its innovative trading features and zero KYC requirements. Aptos (APT) 12.69% Price Drop Unlocks Buying Potential Amidst 24.6% Trading Surge Aptos (APT) aims to redefine transaction speed and reliability in decentralized networks. Founded by ex-Meta engineers, Aptos is built on a novel blockchain architecture designed to enhance throughput and security significantly. This technology foundation aims to support various applications from DeFi to social media platforms, maintaining high levels of user safety. Despite its innovative approach and strong foundation, Aptos has recently experienced a 12.69% drop in its price over the last week, currently standing at $8.88. However, this price adjustment has not affected investor interest, as seen by a 24.60% increase in trading volume in the past 24 hours. This indicates strong trading activity and a possible rebound for APT. Tron (TRX) Enjoys A 7.04% Price Surge with 37.55% Boost in Trading Volume In The First Week of May Tron (TRX) has established itself as a strong altcoin in the crypto market, building a decentralized internet. Founded by Justin Sun, Tron facilitates decentralized applications (dApps) and their accessibility. The platform‚Äôs native token, TRX, plays a central role in maintaining and operating the network and is used as the primary medium for transactions. Tron‚Äôs performance has recently seen a positive uptick, with its price increasing by 7.04% over the past week to $0.11. This rally was complemented by a decent 37.55% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours, indicating a growing interest and confidence in the TRX market. Such dynamic market activity suggests a positive outlook from the investors‚Äô community. DTX Presale In The News: Investors Jump In Join The Wave With Over 100X Gains As the crypto market is showing continuous expansion, the DTX Exchange emerges as a groundbreaking development network, especially for communities involved with assets like TRX and APT. DTX‚Äôs presale is drawing attention for its high-leverage options and the hybrid model that integrates the liquidity of centralized exchanges with the anonymity of DeFi platforms. The DTX Exchange is set to revolutionize the trading experience by offering 1000X leverage without KYC requirements, thereby attracting a broad spectrum of traders. With over $100K raised in just the first two days of its public presale, the platform is on fire toward reforming market access and trader autonomy. DTX Exchange Leverages Best Trading Features To Attract Crypto Giants: Trade Smarter, Not Harder. DTX Exchange not only supports the trading of cryptocurrencies but also extends its capabilities to forex and equities, all while ensuring trader security through non-custodial wallets. This approach significantly lowers the risk of security breaches, placing power directly in the hands of its users. As the crypto world continues to evolve with platforms like DTX Exchange, the integration of advanced trading features with user-centric policies could indeed kick off a new era of trading, potentially leading to more inclusive and expansive market participation.

Winning vice-presidential candidate of the current ruling party, Gibran Rakabuming, promised to create blockchain experts during his campaign.  Indonesia‚Äôs presidential election in February initially ended in controversy when the winning duo claimed victory before official results were released. For the crypto industry, however, this win means consistency and maybe even continued crypto-friendly regulations.  Former defense minister Prabowo Subianto and the incumbent president‚Äôs son Gibran Rakabuming had 60% of the nation‚Äôs votes immediately after polls closed, according to a Quick Count. These results ‚Äì finalized last week ‚Äì mean the ruling party will remain in power, and while crypto industry members are careful not to take sides, they view the election results as a sign that the country‚Äôs blockchain strategy could remain unchanged or change for the better.  Subani, the head of the national crypto bourse, CFX, told CoinDesk Indonesia that the exchange is politically neutral.  ""However, it's true that during the election period and presidential debates, Mr. Gibran specifically mentioned crypto, and we're pleased about the attention to the crypto industry in Indonesia,"" Subani said.  Indonesia is an enthusiastic crypto adopter and Gibran made a point to mention crypto during his campaign, promising to create blockchain experts in the country.  Under Gibran‚Äôs father, President Joko Widodo‚Äôs government, Indonesia's cryptocurrency industry has enjoyed mostly unencumbered growth. Widodo‚Äôs government set up regulations for the crypto sector and launched the world‚Äôs first national bourse for crypto assets. A comprehensive tax system was also established by his government, and there are signs that it may greenlight tax cuts for crypto.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that Gibran, representing the younger generation, has a roadmap that will advance blockchain and crypto,‚Äù William Sutanto from INDODAX, one of the leading crypto exchanges in Indonesia, told CoinDesk Indonesia.  Sutanto hopes the government will provide full support for cryptocurrency to position Indonesia as a competitive force in Southeast Asia, especially against countries like Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.  Indonesia leads Southeast Asia in terms of the number of registered crypto users, but trails behind Thailand and Vietnam in terms of trading volumes.  Crypto and blockchain could stimulate the national economy and investments, according to Yudhono Rawis, CEO of Tokocrypto, another prominent local exchange.

Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) has pulled off a surprise victory, recording a higher transaction volume than Tether in April 2024, according to on-chain analytics from payments giant Visa. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? This development marks a significant shift in the stablecoin landscape. While Tether boasts a staggering market capitalization of over $110 billion, USDC, with its $33 billion valuation, has emerged as the more actively traded coin. Visa‚Äôs data reveals USDC processed a whopping $456 billion ‚Äì which is 400% more ‚Äì in transaction volume last week, compared to Tether‚Äôs $89 billion. Stablecoin transactions. Source: Visa USDC: A Slow And Steady Climb This victory wasn‚Äôt a sudden overnight success. USDC has been steadily chipping away at Tether‚Äôs dominance since late 2023. Visa‚Äôs data shows USDC‚Äôs monthly transactions surpassed Tether‚Äôs for the first time in December 2023, with 145 million transactions compared to Tether‚Äôs 127 million. The April figures solidify this trend, with USDC clocking in at over 166 million transactions against Tether‚Äôs nearly 164 million. Source: Visa Experts point to several factors behind USDC‚Äôs rise. Increased regulatory scrutiny surrounding Tether‚Äôs reserves and ongoing concerns about its transparency may be driving users towards USDC, perceived as a more regulated and auditable stablecoin. Additionally, USDC‚Äôs partnership with Visa itself could be playing a role. Visa launched a stablecoin analytics dashboard in April, prominently featuring USDC alongside other major stablecoins. This increased visibility might be attracting new users to the platform. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Tether Still Holds The Crown (For Now) Despite USDC‚Äôs impressive transaction volume surge, Tether remains the undisputed king in terms of market capitalization. Its $110 billion dwarfs USDC‚Äôs $33 billion, indicating a much larger total value of outstanding coins. This suggests Tether is still the preferred store of value for many crypto investors, even if they aren‚Äôt actively trading it as frequently. Related Reading: Polygon In Peril: Will MATIC Bounce Back Or Stay Stuck In The Sub-$1 Doldrums? Furthermore, Tether boasts a significantly larger user base. While USDC processed more transactions in April, Tether saw activity from over 34 million unique wallets compared to USDC‚Äôs 9.57 million. This could imply Tether is used for larger transactions or by a wider range of individuals, while USDC caters to a more active trading community. The Future Of Stablecoins: A Two-Horse Race? The battle between USDC and Tether is far from over. USDC‚Äôs recent success in transaction volume demonstrates its growing influence within the crypto ecosystem. However, Tether‚Äôs established user base and market cap dominance suggest it won‚Äôt be easily dethroned. The evolving regulatory landscape and user preferences for transparency and security will likely be key factors shaping the future of stablecoins. Whether USDC can maintain its momentum and challenge Tether‚Äôs market cap advantage, or if Tether can regain its transaction volume lead, remains to be seen.

The company bought more bitcoin in the first quarter and now owns a total of 214,400 BTC worth about $13.6 billion, the report said.  MicroStrategy reported a first-quarter net operating loss of $53.1 million after taking a digital asset impairment charge of $191.6 million.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised over $1.5 billion in the first quarter and used the proceeds to acquire an additional 25,250 bitcoin {{BTC}} and now owns 214,400 BTC worth around $13.6 billion, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a research report on Monday.  MicroStrategy‚Äôs corporate strategy is partly based on the acquisition and holding of bitcoin. The firm‚Äôs total holding is almost 1% of bitcoin‚Äôs total circulating supply of 19.7 million tokens.  The software company achieved double-digit subscription services revenue growth in the first quarter as it moved its business to the cloud, the report said. Still, it reported a net operating loss of $53.1 million after taking a digital asset impairment charge of $191.6 million, the company said in a press release Monday.  The company could have adopted the new digital asset fair value accounting standard and reported a large profit due to the rally in bitcoin in the first quarter, but it decided not to do so.  Canaccord cut its MicroStrategy price target to $1,590 from $1,810 while maintaining its buy rating. The stock slipped 2.5% to $1,261 in after-hours trading.  ‚ÄúThe main drivers are of our new price target are continued appreciation of BTC and some revaluation up for the software business,‚Äù analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote, adding that ‚Äúgiven MSTR‚Äôs current premium to its BTC holdings, we are not assuming this to be an upside driver from current levels.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe note that the current 71% equity value premium to the HODL is still quite significant, and thus contraction here should be viewed as a risk factor,‚Äù the authors wrote.  There is a scarcity value to MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin holdings, given it remains one of the best ways for most equity investors to gain exposure to the digital asset, Canaccord said, and this setup ‚Äúprovides the potential for an additional premium to spot to re-emerge in MSTR shares.‚Äù  The setup for bitcoin is also positive.‚ÄúBTC is biased higher given recent approvals of U.S. BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coming from heavyweight asset managers and the very strong adoption there combined with the recent BTC halving,‚Äù the report added.

The EU has already established the world‚Äôs first comprehensive crypto rules alongside strict anti-money laundering measures for the sector. But with revisions to the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation likely in the works and the legislation's two key architects‚Äô political futures up in the air, Europe‚Äôs crypto industry is bracing itself for change.  Change could mean a number of things, including the industry potentially losing the handful of lawmakers who really know crypto or a slackening of new policymaking. More challenging still is getting ahead of shaping the sector‚Äôs new role in a discourse centered on artificial intelligence (AI) ‚Äì something the EU has already started legislating.  Earlier this year, four leading EU industry groups joined forces to pen a manifesto pledging to promote the use of blockchain tech in the bloc to avoid falling behind ‚Äúin the global race‚Äù towards a digital economy.  The groups say the timing for the manifesto is ‚Äúcrucial considering the upcoming elections and political changes Europe will undergo‚Äù this year and makes a case for continuing work on blockchain.  ‚ÄúWhile we recognize the intrinsic value of technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and robotics, we believe that blockchain will serve as the trust layer for the convergence of all these technologies, allowing them to build upon each other and form the framework of the future digital economy,‚Äù the manifesto said.  Young blood  The associations‚Äô hope is that a new and hopefully younger parliament will be easier to approach than the last ‚Äì at least where digitization is concerned.  For crypto and blockchain policy in particular, political parties may matter less than lawmakers‚Äô age, according to Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, one of the four industry associations that collaborated on the manifesto.  ‚ÄúIf you have a wallet full of crypto, you're much more open to the idea that this will be part of the future economy, right? Because you have it, you know how it works, you understand it,‚Äù Kopitsch said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Marina Markezic, co-founder of the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), which also collaborated on the manifesto, says younger politicians are likely to be more tech-savvy as well.  ‚ÄúSo it would be, like, kind of also easier to explain, to talk to them‚Äù about blockchain technology, Markezic said.  But first, things overall might potentially slow down, according to Benedikt Faupel at German digital industry association Bitkom, ‚Äújust because we don't know how the elections play out.‚Äù  MiCA architect up for re-election  Crypto policy in the European Parliament (EP) didn‚Äôt have a lot of support to begin with and was spearheaded by ‚Äúmostly three or four people,‚Äù Markezic said.  Kopitsch and Markezic agree that Greek politician and former EP Vice President Eva Kaili was crypto‚Äôs driving force in government. Kaili‚Äôs dismissal from Parliament over a high-profile corruption scandal was seen as a blow to policy efforts, but thanks to German lawmaker Stefan Berger, MiCA made it through to the end of the line.  Berger, who was the rapporteur for the package and in charge of handling the framework through negotiations, helped stamp an effort by the EP‚Äôs Green politicians to limit the use of the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism that would have effectively banned Bitcoin in the union.  ‚ÄúHe did so much,‚Äù said Markezic, referring to Berger‚Äôs work on MiCA.  Berger is currently rapporteur for the EU‚Äôs legislative proposals for a digital euro but is also up for re-election this June. According to Jonas Gross, head of the Digital Euro Association, the outcomes of an election of this scale are tough to predict, and it‚Äôs ‚Äúinfeasible to discuss specific officials who might not be back this year.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe do see that the European Parliament is currently ‚Äì under the guidance of Stefan Berger ‚Äì following a very innovative and open-minded approach when it comes to crypto assets, stablecoins and the digital euro,‚Äù Gross added. ‚ÄúIt would be desirable to get a Parliament in place that has a similar innovative focus to bring these digital money-related topics further forward so that it benefits the EU.‚Äù  Another architect of MiCA whose future is up in the air is Mairead McGuinness, who serves as the commissioner for financial stability. MiCA was proposed by the European Commission under McGuinness‚Äô purview. She has said she won‚Äôt be contesting in the 2024 parliamentary elections but is open to staying on another term as Commissioner ‚Äì though that decision ultimately rests with the EU's overarching government.  Digital euro  With MiCA mostly out of the way, another key framework for some crypto watchers is the EU‚Äôs push for a central bank digital currency, which is stoking controversy ‚Äì and even conspiracy theories ‚Äì with some politicians raising concerns that a digital euro could give the EU governments too much power and access to private information.  According to Anne-Sophie G√≥gl, executive board member of the Digital Euro Association, some right-wing political parties are using plans for a digital euro to ‚Äúcreate a mood against the European Union.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey are using words such as control and surveillance. They also accuse the digital euro of excluding marginalized groups,‚Äù G√≥gl said in a written statement. ‚ÄúWe fear that this trend will also have an impact in Europe after the elections: a larger proportion of right-wing populist representatives in the EP and therefore the risk that the topic of the digital euro will be misused for misinformation.‚Äù  Polls are projecting rising support for the far right, but likely not enough to tip the scales in favor of anti-EU sentiment this election.  If these parties do snag a nice chunk of new seats though, it could ‚Äúmassively slow down the policymaking process‚Äù for a digital euro, G√≥gl said.  Positioning blockchain in AI  The EU‚Äôs tech policy priorities have shifted away from crypto to focus on AI, and the crypto industry is pushing for the application of blockchain technology in conjunction with AI, according to Anja Blaj, policy expert at EUCI.  ‚ÄúWhat we are arguing most of the time is that AI alone raises a lot of fears as well, and how those fears can be quite often addressed is through blockchain technology,‚Äù Blaj said, referring to arguments that blockchain could be used to help preserve the integrity of data fed to AI systems and decentralize them.  This won‚Äôt be the first time industry bodies pushed for the acceptance of blockchain technology over the adoption of speculative assets. During the last bear market, which saw several crypto giants fall, the industry quickly pivoted to promoting blockchain applications in traditional finance and other areas at events such as the World Economic Forum.  ‚ÄúWhat people are actually moving away from is the financial connotation of the blockchain industry. So quite often, we actually push for the narrative of focusing on the ReFi of regenerative finance‚Ä¶ supply chains or how, for example, data can be handled,‚Äù Blaj said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Regenerative Finance (ReFi) sees cryptocurrency projects investing in sustainability in an effort to fix some of the problems markets create.  Setting up blockchain as something vital to the digitization of Europe may prove critical to the industry‚Äôs survival in the region.  When the current government was formed, ‚Äúthere was a lot of hype around blockchain,‚Äù and Europe was the first to get moving on policy and initiatives, Markezic said.  ‚ÄúNow it is more on AI and‚Ä¶ why would you use your political power in order to talk about something that might not be that present anymore?‚Äù Markezic said of the risk of fading political interest in blockchain.  The elections will take place from June 6 to 9.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/ahead-of-eu-elections-crypto-industry-pushes-blockchain-merits-as-policy-focus-shifts-to-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec1974f69af87105740ea7144c1b1074f57c41ef-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408312,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaCgCH,1714462400,Bitcoin Set to Become More Dominant Even as BTC Stares at First Monthly Loss Since August,"Bitcoin is about to snap a seven-month winning streak due to several factors, including a slowdown in demand for spot ETFs.  According to Fairlead Strategies, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rate has risen past a critical level, signaling further upside.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} appears on track to end a seven-month winning streak. Still, the largest token by market value is likely to become more dominant in the crypto market, according to one analyst.  As of the time of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $63,200, representing an 11% monthly loss, the first since August 2023, according to data source CoinDesk and TradingView. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, traded nearly 20% lower for the month at 2,185 points.  A bevy of factors like the dwindling probability of the Fed rate cuts, reduced demand for the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and broad-based risk aversion in financial markets have taken the wind out of the bitcoin bull run this month. Meanwhile, a continued expansion of prominent stablecoins has been a supportive factor.  Analysts are now closely watching Wednesday‚Äôs quarterly refunding statement by the U.S. Treasury. According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, a higher issuance of short-term bills could free up liquidity, supporting risk assets.  ‚ÄúThe upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on May 1 could also see higher issuances of short-term U.S. bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity,‚Äù QCP said in a market note.  The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow more in the April to June quarter. Higher-than-expected borrowing means more bond supply, higher yields or risk-free rates and less reason to invest in risky assets.  The Treasury also said it expects to maintain a balance of $850 billion in its Treasury General Account by the end of September, slightly higher than the $750 billion expected.  BTC to become more dominant  Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, recently rose to a three-year high of 57%, breaking higher from a six-month consolidation pattern.  The breakout means bitcoin could continue to outshine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in the coming months.  ‚ÄúIt [the dominance rate] recently had a breakout favoring bitcoin over altcoins in the intermediate-term, which is in line with the weekly RRG [relative rotation graph] where most altcoins point lower,‚Äù Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients Monday.  ‚ÄúThe breakout in the index marks a continuation of a long-term turnaround phase, which has reversed much of the altcoin gains made in early 2021,‚Äù Fairlead Strategies added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/30/bitcoin-set-to-become-more-dominant-even-as-btc-stares-at-first-monthly-loss-since-august,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc132488b28007b8555faebcb774a37e0739e63d-2710x1214.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The announcement led to an immediate 1.9% increase in XRP‚Äôs price, although this gain was slightly pared back; as of the latest data, XRP stands 1.1% higher since the news broke. The Ripple And HashKey Partnership: Details The collaboration leverages the substantial success HashKey Group has seen in mainland China. HashKey‚Äòs blockchain-powered solutions for supply chain finance have registered over 4,000 companies, including 23 banks and 4,300 suppliers. The total transaction volume through these solutions has exceeded $7 billion, with almost $3 billion in financing transactions. In Japan, these blockchain solutions will be adapted and deployed through a partnership involving Ripple and SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between SBI Holdings and Ripple. The XRPL will be the foundational technology platform. This blockchain specializes in tokenizing and exchanging both crypto-native and real-world assets. Related Reading: XRP Sees Over $12 Million Sell-Off: Whale Warning Or Buying Opportunity?

With its proven enterprise track record and unmatched performance metrics, including rapid settlement speeds, low costs, and scalability, we are confident in our ability to drive meaningful transformation and introduce innovative, cutting-edge solutions for businesses in Japan.‚Äù Emi Yoshikawa, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple, echoed this enthusiasm for the partnership: ‚ÄúWe are excited to join forces with HashKey DX and SBI Ripple Asia to introduce XRP Ledger-powered solutions to Japan. This collaboration exemplifies our shared commitment to advancing blockchain technology and delivering tangible value to businesses.‚Äù XRP Price Analysis The initial spike in XRP‚Äôs price post-announcement reflects the market‚Äôs optimistic reception of Ripple‚Äôs strategic moves. However, the broader price action context reveals more complexity. Related Reading: Forbes Unveils 20 Crypto ‚ÄòZombies,‚Äô Declares Ripple And XRP Among The Undead Over recent weeks, XRP has experienced volatility, notably breaking down from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart that began forming in September 2021. This pattern typically indicates a period of consolidation, with the eventual breakout direction suggesting the prevailing market force. Currently, the breakdown suggests that sellers have gained the upper hand, with the triangle now acting as a resistance zone. XRP faces multiple hurdles ahead as it is currently trading below several critical exponential moving averages (EMAs) ‚Äì 20, 50, 100, and 200-week EMAs, all nested within the former triangle pattern. This setup presents significant resistance levels that need to be overcome for bullish momentum to resume. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 49, hovers near the neutral 50 mark, indicating that neither bulls nor bears have definitive control.

Related Reading: Polygon In Peril: Will MATIC Bounce Back Or Stay Stuck In The Sub-$1 Doldrums? Whales Making Waves On The Cardano Sea IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics firm, reported a surge in Cardano transactions exceeding $100,000. Over the past week, the average daily volume for these large transactions reached nearly $14 billion. Cardano whales are busy, with an average large transaction volume of $13.84B a day in the last 7 days. For comparison, this is a third of Bitcoin‚Äôs current volume, 5x as much as Litecoin‚Äôs volume and over 16x that of Dogecoin! pic.twitter.com/xU2XMoEQbM ‚Äî IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 29, 2024 This represents a third of Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction volume within the same timeframe, showcasing a surge in activity on the Cardano network. Interestingly, the data dwarfs Dogecoin‚Äôs large transaction volume by a whopping 16 times, highlighting the increased interest in Cardano compared to the meme coin. Unveiling The Mystery: Are Whales Buying Or Selling? While the high transaction volume is undeniable, its implication for Cardano‚Äôs price remains unclear. Large transactions can represent both buying and selling activity, making it difficult to predict a definitive price direction. ADA market cap currently at $16 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, the sustained volume exceeding $10 billion throughout the week, even during a recent price dip, suggests continued movement within the network. This could indicate institutional investors entering the Cardano market or signify significant internal token transfers within the ecosystem. Data Hints At Bullish Undercurrents While the exact nature of the large transactions remains to be seen, Santiment, another on-chain analytics platform, provides a potentially bullish signal. Their data suggests a growing accumulation trend among large holders. Addresses containing between 100,000 and 100 million ADA have been steadily increasing their holdings since the beginning of April. This accumulation by whales could be a positive sign for Cardano‚Äôs future price, indicating their confidence in the project‚Äôs long-term potential. Technical Analysis Paints A Target-Rich Environment Market analyst Cobra Vanguard has weighed in on the recent developments, employing technical analysis to predict Cardano‚Äôs price trajectory. Vanguard identifies an expanding price channel that Cardano has been trading within since the start of the year. This pattern suggests higher highs and lower lows, potentially indicating continued price volatility. Based on this analysis, Vanguard outlines several price targets for ADA, with the first hurdle at $0.52. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? If successfully breached, the analyst predicts further climbs towards $0.57, $0.61, and $0.67.

The recent surge in large transactions on the Cardano network has undoubtedly generated excitement within the cryptocurrency community.

The price could gain bearish momentum if it breaks the $0.50 support. XRP is attempting a fresh increase and facing hurdles near $0.520. The price is now trading near $0.5150 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.520 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $0.520 resistance. XRP Price Aims Upside Break Recently, XRP price climbed above the $0.550 resistance and tested $0.570. A high was formed at $0.5705 before there was a pullback like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price dipped below the $0.5250 support zone. It even spiked below $0.500 and tested $0.4980. A low was formed at $0.4990 and the price is now consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5705 swing high to the $0.4990 low. It also trades near $0.5150 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $0.520 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.520 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near $0.5350 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5705 swing high to the $0.4990 low. A close above the $0.5350 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.570. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.570 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.620 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.680 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.500 level. The next major support is at $0.490. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.490 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.460 support zone.

The SEC's limited interest in engaging on Ethereum ETF products suggests low near-term approval odds, but a legal challenge could still lead to approval on a multi-year view. Lack of ETF approval in May would likely have a negative impact on the Grayscale Ethereum Fund, but there is potential for upside if an ETF is ultimately approved. For much of 2023 into 2024 there was an interesting opportunity to purchase the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) which traded at a discount to its asset value because it ultimately was approved by the SEC to convert into an Exchange Traded Fund. That conversion caused that NAV valuation gap to effectively close. I wrote about that process here after a favorable legal decision in August 2023, effectively paved with way to ETF conversion. Some risk remained (such as the SEC disputing the legal verdict, or delaying Bitcoin ETF approval further, or finding another route to block Bitcoin ETFs), but the SEC did ultimately follow the court's ruling and approved a range of Bitcoin ETF products. Data by YCharts Please note that looking at NAV discounts alone is only part of the story because the price of crypto assets has been extremely volatile. Nonetheless, it is argued that the ETF conversion also helped broaden mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and helped support demand, too. Furthermore, the recent Bitcoin 'halving' (where supply is reduced every 4 years according to Bitcoin protocols) may have played into price trends too. I'm not going to explore those important topics in any detail here, but rather remain focused on the NAV discount and ETF approval prospects, which is itself quite a complex topic. A Similar Story For An Ethereum ETF? There is a similar narrative for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( OTCQX:ETHE ) to the Bitcoin ETF approval process. Today, ETHE trades at approximately a 25% discount to NAV. That's down substantially from earlier in 2024, when there was greater confidence ETF conversion would be approved by the SEC in a similar vein to Bitcoin ETF approval. I wrote here and here that the logic of the Bitcoin legal ruling likely had a positive read-across for Ethereum ETF chances. However, on January 12 of this year, I argued that the NAV discount for ETHE had become a bit too narrow compared to the risks and potential delays inherent in Ethereum ETF approval. I now think we're getting back to a point where the risk/reward is looking more favorable for investors. Data by YCharts Rumors Of Low Approval Odds A decision on Ethereum ETFs is expected to come from the SEC in late May, and so far, the SEC has apparently had limited interest in engaging on the specifics of the ETF products. That implies approval is not coming, according to Reuters . This does make sense, ahead of Bitcoin ETF approval these same media outlets were reporting constructive engagement with the SEC, this time for ETHE it apparently feels different. In this sense, you can argue that the recent widening of the discount to NAV for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is rational, without approval there's no mechanism for the discount to close, and you're stuck paying a 2.5% management fee while you wait . But Legal Precedent Could Ultimately Lead To Approval However, even if the SEC decides not to approve the Ethereum ETFs, they may face a legal challenge along similar lines to the Bitcoin ETF case. The ruling in the Bitcoin ETF case is here , I'm not a lawyer, but essentially the court found that the SEC could not block a spot Bitcoin ETF and approve a Bitcoin futures ETF. That's because spot and futures markets for the same underlying instrument are strongly correlated and hence to block one and approve the other is evidence of ""arbitrariness and caprice,"" which is something regulators should not do, according to the law. Now, the read-across for Ethereum is quite powerful. Once again, the SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs. For example, there is the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF, which holds CME Ether Futures contracts. Hence, unless the SEC is able to find a different way to block an Ethereum spot ETF, there is some chance that a legal ruling once again finds that the SEC cannot approve a futures ETF for a financial product but block a spot version of the same product. The Details Now let's get into the details. First off, there is still some chance the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs in May, perhaps 20% or so. I believe market rumors that this is on course not to occur, but there's always a chance things change. Here my view is probably around consensus. But then I think there is quite a good chance of a legal challenge that does enable an Ethereum ETF. However, like all legal processes, if it happens it will take time. The SEC rejected Grayscales spot Bitcoin ETF application in June 2022 . Bitcoin ETFs then first started trading in January 2024 . That's a lag of 19 months. Hence, if the same were to occur again, then we'd be looking at spot Ethereum ETFs starting to trade around December 2025. We should also consider the maximum discount for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. In recent history, that's about 60%, though at that point a path to ETF conversion based on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's legal challenge was not evident, and we were in something of a 'crypto winter' with depressed pricing. Data by YCharts The Model Here's how I think about the value of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust today. Scenario Probability Logic Discounted return based on NAV (current discount 24%) May surprise approval 20% Unlikely based on market chatter, but not impossible +31% No legal challenge 10% Discount would widen to perhaps 50% with no prospect of closure -34% Failed legal challenge 10% Discount would widen to perhaps 50% with no prospect of closure -34% Successful legal challenge 60% Seems likely based on GBTC precedent, but discounted for 19 months +20% Expected value (probabilities x returns) +11.4% In summary, there's about an 11% expected return if you believe the values above. A Potential Kicker From Approval One thing that we saw from Bitcoin ETF approval, was that ETF approval may have supported the value of the cryptocurrency itself, as ease of access through the ETF structure improved for many retail and institutional investors. A similar process could play out if an Ethereum ETF were approved, that could improve the upside scenario. For example, an investment manager holding a small Bitcoin ETF allocation for their clients, might theoretically add in some Ethereum exposure to diversify, hence bidding up the Ethereum price. That may suggest that upsides based on NAV discounts are understated in the upside scenarios. Risks Regardless of what happens subsequently, lack of Ethereum ETF approval in May (should that occur) will likely be a negative for the Grayscale Ethereum Fund. My main concern is that no legal challenge is mounted. That's in part because Grayscale would be who you would expect to take the SEC to court based on previous experience, but I'm not sure that converting Bitcoin to an ETF was net profitable for them. That's because even though the Bitcoin ETF AuM has grown, they have lost significant market share and pricing power from the ETF conversion process and now have to compete more directly with the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity. Grayscale are perhaps something of a maverick firm and are hence 'happy' to take on the SEC. Would a company like BlackRock or Fidelity want to risk its relationship with the SEC by taking them on in court? I'm not sure. Clearly, if ETF conversion happens, Grayscale will want to participate in a ""prisoners' dilemma"" sense, but I'm not convinced they'll want to drive the process once again. The price of Ether is very volatile. There's some risk that attempting to 'arbitrage' NAV discounts on crypto instruments is like picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. It's possible the value of Ether could fall to zero at any point if the technology were found to be flawed or for some other reason. Many smart people believe crypto is fundamentally worthless, and even if it's not, historic crypto drawdowns have been extreme. Grayscale Ethereum Fund is a relatively high-cost fund given its 2.5% fee that creates material costs for investors in the product and creates a cost in addition to the time value of money waiting for any conversion. Even if conversion does ultimately occur, with an estimated 19-month window to conversion (should that forecast hold) even if everything plays out relatively well and positively there will almost certainly be better entry points along the way for Grayscale Ethereum Fund investors to achieve greater upside.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4687381-ethe-grayscale-ethereum-trust-interesting-even-near-term-etf-approval-prospects-low?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/26593634.jpeg

There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $3,170 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below the $3,170 support. Ethereum Price Faces Uphill Task Ethereum price failed to settle above the $3,250 level and started another decline, like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $3,200 level and even spiked below $3,120. A low was formed at $3,113 and the price is now consolidating. There was a minor increase above the $3,200 level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,355 swing high to the $3,113 low. However, the bears were active near the $3,240 and $3,250 levels. The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,355 swing high to the $3,113 low acted as a hurdle. There was a fresh decline below the $3,200 level. Ethereum is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $3,170 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Immediate resistance is near the $3,200 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near the $3,240 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,300, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,350 level. A close above the $3,350 resistance could send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. If there is a move above the $3,450 resistance, Ethereum could even test the $3,550 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,620 resistance zone. More Downsides In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,250 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,170 level and the channel zone. The first major support is near the $3,120 zone. The main support is near the $3,070 level.

The protocol unveiled its native token, EIGEN, which the newly formed Eigen Foundation will distribute. Alongside this, EigenLayer introduced a major plan for an airdrop and released a comprehensive new Whitepaper. EigenLayer Unveils EIGEN With Novel Mechanism According to the protocol‚Äôs announcement, the introduction of the EIGEN token brings forth a complementary mechanism designed to address ‚Äúintersubjective‚Äù faults, which cannot be resolved through ETH restaking alone. By expanding ETH restaking, EigenLayer positions ETH as the Universal Objective Work Token, while the universality of EIGEN makes it the Universal Intersubjective Work Token.¬†EIGEN‚Äôs universality is reportedly aimed at allowing it to fork and slash for intersubjective errors committed by EIGEN stakers in any AVS (Automated Verification System) within the protocol. To ensure widespread adoption of EIGEN across applications, EigenLayer has designed an application-independent mechanism to maintain the system‚Äôs cryptoeconomic security. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? In EigenLayer, EIGEN staking and ETH restaking play complementary roles. EIGEN addresses safety properties through objective slashing, and ETH restaking ensures liveness and censorship-resistance properties dependent on stake decentralization. The launch of EIGEN also introduces intersubjective staking, marking a significant milestone for the protocol and the Ethereum ecosystem. However, due to its newly introduced design, the concept requires widespread adoption and discussion among ecosystem participants. At launch, the Eigen token will have a total supply of 1.67 billion tokens, with the Foundation allocating 45% of the tokens to the community. This allocation is further divided into staked drops, community initiatives, and ecosystem development. Investors will reportedly receive almost 30% of the tokens, while early contributors will receive over 25%. Both these groups are subject to a three-year lockup period for their allocations. A complete lock will be in place during the first year, followed by a gradual release of their total holdings at a rate of 4% per month over the subsequent two years. EIGEN Token Launches Meta-Setup Phase While the initial implementation of intersubjective staking at launch mirrors only a limited extent of the full protocol, several parameters still need to be determined for its full actuation. To address this, EIGEN is being launched in a meta-setup phase, serving as a call to action for researchers, experts, and the broader community to engage in public discourse. As EigenLayer announced, this collaborative effort aims to help define the necessary parameters to make the protocol and its interaction with the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem as effective as possible.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Latest Halving Sends Hash Price Into Freefall As Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving event on April 20, expectations were high regarding a potential increase in miner revenue. However, contrary to these expectations, the hash price witnessed a steep decline, currently valued at less than $50 per PH/s per day. The concept of hash price, developed by Luxor, a Bitcoin mining services company, helps understand the daily dollar earnings a miner can expect per unit of hashing power. Related Reading: Expert Makes Bold Call: It‚Äôs Time To Swap Your Dollars For Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate remaining strong, the halving event, which reduced the mining reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, has exerted downward pressure on the critical profitability metric. This reduction in potential earnings comes when the overall cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is experiencing volatility. This downturn in hash price is not isolated but coincides with other declining metrics in BTC. According to TradingView, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance index has also reduced, highlighting a decrease in capitalization relative to the total crypto market. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has declined from 57.10% mid-month to approximately 54.69% today. Concurrently, Bitcoin‚Äôs market value has also trended downward; over the past week, the cryptocurrency experienced a decrease of about 4.4%. This downward trend persisted into the past day, with Bitcoin‚Äôs price dropping an additional 0.8%. Signs Of A Bullish Future Amid Bitcoin Current Slump Despite the downward turns, analysts like those from CryptoQuant suggest that bullish signals might still be¬†on the horizon. They point to the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR), which, despite current market indecisiveness, continues to exhibit bullish trends. Moreover, expert analysts like Rekt Capital have weighed in with a long-term perspective, suggesting that Bitcoin could see a significant rally as part of this halving cycle, drawing parallels with previous cycles. Historical data shows that Bitcoin typically reaches a market peak within 500-550 days post-halving. If these patterns hold, Bitcoin could be poised for substantial gains by mid to late 2025, reinforcing the cyclical nature of this leading digital asset‚Äôs market movements.

With their approval, the newly regulated index funds are poised for a noteworthy debut, surpassing the first-day inflows in the United States. HK Bitcoin ETF Market Poised For Record-Breaking Debut Zhu Haokang, the Digital Asset Management Supervisor and Family Wealth Supervisor at Warsaw Fund expressed great confidence in the trading volume of Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs on its inaugural day. This volume exceeded¬†the scale achieved during the US launch on January 10th of this year, which amounted to over 125 million US dollars. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Altcoins Are About To Enter A Parabolic Curve, Here‚Äôs Why Haokang further stated that Huaxia, one of the three ETF issuers, is confident in becoming the largest ETF issuer on the first day of trading. At the same time, OSL, a digital asset platform, has already completed the initial fundraising with two funds, including Huaxia. Furthermore, the capital inflow during the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETF‚Äôs first-day listing transaction has surpassed that of the US spot ETF market. According to Haokang, this difference can be attributed to two factors: the purchase and redemption of spot and in-kind transactions, which are unavailable in the US spot Bitcoin ETF. Unprecedented Investment Options One unique aspect of the China Summer Fund‚Äôs Hong Kong spot ETF is its incorporation of Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, and dual counter offers (RMB counters), distinguishing it from the other two offerings. Additionally, the fund features a non-listed share alongside the listed share, further setting it apart from its counterparts. Given the physical purchase method, investors, including Bitcoin miners, can directly acquire the Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETF using the Bitcoin they already hold. Moreover, outreach efforts have reportedly been made to attract investors from countries and regions without ETF offerings, such as Singapore and the Middle East, generating significant interest. Despite the substantial market size of the current US spot Bitcoin ETF market, Hong Kong‚Äôs utilization of cash and in-kind subscriptions, coupled with the appeal of open trading during Asian market hours, is expected to attract numerous American investors, according to Haokang. Mainland Chinese Investors Restricted Wayne Huang, OSL ETF and Trusteeship Business Manager, highlighted that Victory Securities could facilitate physical purchases, and the winning securities in China can also leverage OSL‚Äôs support. Three vouchers enable physical purchases, with more expected to follow suit. Following the ETF‚Äôs listing, various voucher chambers of commerce are likely to participate, increasing the overall ecosystem of the Bitcoin ETF market in May. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Dive: Will This Spark A Surge In Network Activity? On the other hand, Zhu Haokang also clarified that mainland Chinese investors are currently restricted from investing in Hong Kong‚Äôs spot ETF market. However, qualified investors, institutional investors, retail investors, and qualified international investors in Hong Kong can participate in the spot ETF race. Individuals seeking further details are advised to consult voucher providers and sales channels while closely monitoring potential regulatory adjustments and the development of a specific regulatory framework in the future. Currently, BTC is trading at $63,000 after failing to consolidate above the key $66,000 level in recent days. However, the launch of the ETF market in Hong Kong is expected to significantly impact¬†the price of BTC in the long run.

26582851,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=605654,1714435235,Bitcoin Dominance: Traders Preferring The OG To Dogecoin & Other Altcoins,"On-chain data suggests Bitcoin has recently experienced an influx of investors while Dogecoin, Cardano, and other altcoins have seen a slowdown. Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Rise While Altcoins See Flat Movement According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the number of Bitcoin investors has sharply increased recently. The on-chain metric of interest here is the ‚ÄúTotal Amount of Holders,‚Äù which keeps track of the total number of addresses on a given network carrying some non-zero balance. When the value of this indicator goes up for any asset, it can be due to several things. The first and most obvious contributor to this trend would be adoption, as a fresh influx of users would naturally create more addresses. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Foreshadowed Recent Price Drops, Quant Reveals Another contributor could be old investors returning to reinvest in the coin after selling out their balance earlier. The indicator would also increase when investors spread out their holdings among multiple wallets for reasons like privacy. In general, some net adoption occurs whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. Historically, adoption has been a constructive sign for any blockchain in the long term. Naturally, when this metric‚Äôs value goes down, it implies that some investors have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency as they have completely cleaned out their wallets. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for some of the top assets in the sector: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Chainlink (LINK). How the number of investors has changed for some of the top cryptos | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the graph, Dogecoin started 2024 with some rapid adoption as its Total Amount of Holders had been observing a sharp uptrend. However, this growth only lasted for the first couple of months, as the metric has since flattened for the memecoin. Other altcoins like Chainlink and Cardano have also witnessed flat action in the metric in this period. The trend had been just the opposite for Bitcoin, where more or less flat movement had occurred in its number of investors earlier in the year, but the asset has seen some uptrend in the metric this month. It‚Äôs possible that investors were previously attracted to Dogecoin and other networks, but now that markets have been undergoing bearish price action, traders are back to preferring the original cryptocurrency. Overall, DOGE‚Äôs holders are still up 13.8% in the past three months, while BTC‚Äôs growth stands at 2.6%. Naturally, the latter‚Äôs userbase is also larger, so a relatively small percentage could be due to that. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Active: Here‚Äôs Where They Are Sending Coins Cardano is among the few networks in the sector that have observed negative action in the Total Amount of Holders during this window, although the decrease is a mere 0.1%.
