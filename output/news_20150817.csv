42398616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJBk,1439847665,Microsoft's John Farmer: Bitcoin is Blockchain's Least Interesting App,"With the sound of New York traffic raging noisily in the background, former pro-baseball player John Paul Farmer tells me he’s intent on finding new ways in which technology can make a difference to people’s lives. Lucky for him, he has the weight of Microsoft behind him.  Farmer, an ex-shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers, joined the tech giant last year, having spent four years working as a senior advisor for innovation at the White House.  Joining a large company wasn’t really on his agenda – he considered joining a startup or even setting up his own company – but this all changed after he met with Microsoft’s general counsel Brad Smith and corporate vice president Dan’l Lewin.  “Dan’l and Brad had this vision for how Microsoft – obviously a gigantic global company with billions of users – could engage in a really local way on civic issues. So, how could we use technology to address social problems?” he explained.  Farmer said it struck him as a really important mission, especially for such a big company with a colossal reach.  “The more I talked to them, the more I really came to believe that they had the right approach in mind.”  He became the company’s director of technology and civic innovation, and now heads up a team of 10 people in New York.  Blockchain and societal improvement  Farmer doesn't have much time for bitcoin, the currency. “I find that to be the least interesting part of what bitcoin and the blockchain can do,” he explained.  He concedes cryptocurrency must be given some praise for bringing blockchain tech into the limelight, but he doesn’t spend much time thinking about that particular application of the technology.  “I actually spend most of my time thinking about what it means when you can have an identity that can be controlled and shared in a granular way, when you have titles and deeds that can be stored and shared easily and without middlemen.”  Farmer said, while blockchain technology has the potential to make a real difference in the developing world – helping the unbanked become banked for the first time – his interests lie closer to home.  He explained that, recently, he heard 25% of African-Americans – around 10 million people – don’t have a government-issued identification card.  “That is amazing, and there are states here that require you to show your identification card in order to vote. So the ability for these technologies to empower and enfranchise the disenfranchised here in the US and in the UK and in other developed countries, I think is also really really powerful.”  Connecting sectors  Farmer and his team work with a wide variety of sectors, including governments, academics, startups, for-profits, nonprofits and simply “anyone who wants to solve problems”.  He described the team’s work as being threefold: to participate, partner and produce.  Firstly, they utilise their presence in New York, making sure they’re involved in and aware of the goings-on in the community so they can identify ongoing issues and work on solutions.  In terms of developing partnerships to work on these solutions, Farmer said his team has been reaching out to other organisations, groups and individuals that are working on “interesting applications of technology”. Microsoft seeks to work with these people to bring their ideas to fruition.  Farmer has been in talks with the team over at MIT Media Labs’ Digital Currency Initiative, which is headed by his former White House colleague Brian Forde. For the time being, they're still just engaging in early talks, but Farmer believes it's “highly likely” the two groups will work together on projects.  He’s keen not to rushing into anything, taking his time to make sure his team forms partnerships with the right groups and projects within the blockchain space.  “Obviously there are a lot of people doing a lot of things to do with the blockchain, but we’re trying to find the ones where there's a good fit and it makes sense, both for them and for us,” he explained.  In terms of what the team is producing, it’s very much still in the R&D stage when it comes to solutions based on blockchain technology. But any promising ideas will be trialled both within the company and within communities.  “We produce prototypes of what could exist and then we share those with the community externally, but also internally to the various product groups of Microsoft, to help those product groups imagine what could happen and what could really benefit end users,"" Farmer said.  Progress  Regardless of how much, or little, progress Farmer’s team has made in the blockchain space, he knows his counterparts on other teams within Microsoft have made some real headway.  “They're all further along than we are in terms of how they are using blockchain and how they're thinking about integrating it. But our mission as a team within the company is very different. We're specifically focused on how to use it for social good,” he added.  The company director said he’s been highly impressed by the innovation that has taken place in the blockchain arena so far and the calibre of people involved.  There are people in the space that he knows from the traditional finance world (Farmer previously held roles at Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse) as well as highly accomplished academics, developers and ""hardcore technologists"".  “It's not one-sided, it's not just one-dimensional, it actually bringing together people with a variety of perspectives and experiences, and that's going to drive us all forward that much faster,” he concluded.

42398621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJEh,1439825989,Nathaniel Popper: Bitcoin is Still Lacking a Killer App,"Nathaniel Popper, a business reporter at The New York Times – and author of critically acclaimed Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money fell into the digital currency by chance.  It was Spring 2013, Popper said, and both he and The Times watched on as bitcoin was taking off, trying to figure out whether it was worthy of coverage or just a passing fad.  The answer to their question became apparent after the Winklevoss brothers – Internet entrepreneurs better known for their lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and now the masterminds of upcoming bitcoin exchange Gemini – approached the newspaper to discuss the cryptocurrency and eagerly opened up about their private bitcoin stash (at the time worth approximately $11m).  ""I liked the fact that we could sort of talk about it in concrete terms, through some people that actually owned [bitcoin]. It was people sort of putting their reputation on the line a bit, nobody with any name or reputation had been really willing to do that before,"" said Popper.  The response to the article, he added, was completely unexpected, in a positive way. Popper attributed part of its success to the Winkevoss' public profiles, but also highlighted people's increasing interest in this new idea of money, ""independent from any other currency"".  Bitcoin skepticism  Although Popper inadvertently became one of The Times’ main bitcoin reporters, he said he was, and still is to an extent, largely skeptical about the digital currency.  ""I similarly found it pretty fascinating, although I was very skeptical that it would survive,"" he said, adding ""if people lose confidence in it, it dies.""  Initially, Popper resisted proposals from book agents, telling them he didn't believe bitcoin was a long-term phenomenon and didn't warrant a book nor the effort required to write it.  He was, however, eventually compelled to write Digital Gold due to a confluence of factors.  ""One was that I just continued talking with sort of serious people who were taking this [bitcoin] seriously and talking about the fact that there was something really interesting and new in the technology and the network.""  Then, Popper met Charlie Shrem – approximately two weeks before the former CEO of BitInstant and Bitcoin Foundation board member was arrested – and engaged in a ""very vibrant conversation"" with him and Nic Cary, co-founder of wallet provider Blockchain.  Seeing how passionate they both were about bitcoin struck a chord with Popper, who finally decided to pursue the book, which he said was never meant to be about the technology, but rather a story of bitcoin and the people behind it.  A social movement  Popper sees bitcoin as a social movement.  ""The technology might be interesting but if people hadn't adopted it and been willing to spend money on it, it would not matter,"" he said, adding ""and so, it's only when you understand why people adopt it that you understand what it is"".  With questions continually emerging about bitcoin's quest to achieve mass consumer adoption, Popper signalled that its failure to do so was ""pretty simple"":  “There’s nothing for an ordinary person to use [bitcoin] for right now ... in a place like Argentina where there is value in bitcoin, it does something right now, better than the alternative.”  In places like China, Popper added, it is more of a speculative gambling game, but still a step up from the existing online lotteries. Elsewhere, in the US, he said bitcoin had mostly been used in online gambling and drug purchases.  “It needs to be better at something for people to want to use it and that includes the whole experience of, not just the actual transaction, but getting money in and out.”  Like others before him, Popper noted that finding bitcoin's killer app is what would lead to the digital currency's adoption.  “Bitcoin needs to find those things that it does better than the alternative, it can’t just be equal to … it has to be much better. I think it’s still very much looking for that or to create a new use.”  Bitcoin in the media  Bitcoin has been misrepresented by the mainstream media in the past, with journalists sometimes including inaccuracies in their definition of the currency and its underlying technology.  Popper explained how as a journalist, you often have to describe something quickly. ""It's not the way a bitcoin person would want to have it described ... there is a lot of misrepresentation ... I mean it is an incredibly complicated technology.""  However, Popper said, that the media's understanding is changing.  “I think a lot of the media does kind of get it generally right now … I do think some of the things bitcoin fans think are misrepresentations in the media are sometimes just bitcoin fans being overly sensitive about some short-hand way of describing something.”  This change, Popper said, could potentially be attributed to journalists taking bitcoin more seriously.  Early on, bitcoin probably seemed like a joke, added Popper. “I took it pretty lightly as well. Now people take it more seriously and so they are trying to understand what it is and how it actually works.”  Bitcoin on Wall Street  As the media is becoming increasingly well-versed in bitcoin and blockchain technology, so is traditional finance.  Bankers, Popper believes, must have gone through the same kind of process as him, slowly realising the blockchain’s potential in the wider financial market.  Blythe Masters – widely credited with creating the credit default swap – for example, joined Digital Asset Holdings as CEO.  “She particularly got peoples’ attention because she is not just any Wall Street executive, she was one of the ten best known bankers of the last 20 years.”  Beyond this, Popper also alluded to the increasing interest of traditional finance institutions on blockchain technology.  “I’ve been amazed since the book came out and dealing with bankers and financial folks just how they are more interested in this than I even grasped.”  Popper thinks traditional finance will continue to focus on blockchain tech. “It may not be on the bitcoin blockchain … a lot of these guys, what they want is to find a way to do this without using the bitcoin blockchain, but I think that’s where some of the most intense work is going on these days.”  Is adoption by Wall Street necessary to legitimise bitcoin? Popper doesn’t think so.  “I think that bitcoin was doing pretty well at growing slowly … I think that’s how a good technology [succeeds], it doesn’t bite off more than it can chew ... I think it will probably continue developing at that pace. That being said, now that these [Wall Street] guys are involved, it will increase the pace of development.”  New York Times image via Erika Cross / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/17/nathaniel-popper-bitcoin-is-still-lacking-a-killer-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c0388d641db9a67bbd38cfad63f15a87cc43c45-1500x1420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ2t,1439813169,Bitcoin 'Forked' in Controversial Bid to Resolve Scalability Question,"Two of bitcoin's best-known developers have 'forked' the software in a controversial attempt to resolve its scalability crisis.  The client, Bitcoin XT, was dreamt up earlier this year as a way to 'opt out' of bitcoin's current 1MB block size limit – which has proved a divisive issue as the digital currency grows.  Currently, the network handles between three and seven transactions per second. However, blocks on the network are beginning to fill up. Reaching bitcoin's so-called 'capacity cliff' – depending on who you ask – could create a competitive market for transaction fees or destroy the robustness of the network completely.  Increasing bitcoin's block size – a 'quick fix' for the issue – carries its own long-term implications for the network, which some argue would make the network more centralised and, thus, less trusted.  Gavin Andresen, who handed over the reins as bitcoin lead developer to Wladimir Van der Laan last year, is behind XT's code, with ex-Google employee Mike Hearn reviewing and adding bug fixes. As of Saturday, it is now subject to public scrutiny as the final part of the testing process.  Governance model  Speaking to CoinDesk, Hearn said the project had come about as a result of long-standing frustrations with the consensus-driven governance of Bitcoin Core, which he said has ignored any changes that trigger disagreement – even among those who do not contribute to its code.  ""This model falls apart the moment even small differences of opinion and vision appear, as it allows anyone – including people who hardly contribute – to block any change.""  Bitcoin XT will use the ""traditional"" open source model, Hearn said, in which the code ultimately reflects the decisions of its maintainer. Unlike Bitcoin Core, it won't run on consensus, but can be forked and modified by others.  ""This takes a little bit of work, but not much – it's similar to creating a political party. Convincing people to run it is like convincing people to vote for you,"" he added.  Technically speaking, anyone can run XT. However its new rules, which include other patches that didn't make it into Core, such as updates on double-spending and protection against DDoS attacks, will only be triggered by miners doing so – 75% of miners, to be exact.  Hearn explained:  ""By mining with Bitcoin XT you will produce blocks with a new version number. This indicates to the rest of the network that you support larger blocks. When 75% of the blocks are new-version blocks, a decision has been reached to start building larger blocks that will be rejected by Bitcoin Core nodes.""  If XT doesn't receive enough of these 'votes' then nothing will change. It's up to Hearn to convince other stakeholders, including exchanges, payment processors and wallet developers to join its bigger blocks – at press time it had 6.9%.  ""At the moment, we think it's plausible we can get majority. But it will likely be a lot of work,"" he told CoinDesk.  The 75% majority  Others are more cautious about XT achieving the majority it needs. Speaking to CoinDesk, fellow Core developer Peter Todd said that while it was possible for the 75% threshold to be achieved, he warned the standard 95% threshold for soft-forks was chosen for good safety engineering reasons.  ""For technical reasons 75% is really low and has a high risk of leading to huge reorganisations of the blockchain; miners would be taking a big risk by adopting that code,"" he said, adding that the team behind the software was ""unproven"" and ""inexperienced"".  If Bitcoin XT succeeds, it seems like a risky strategy to be left on the wrong side of the fork. For one thing, any new coins mined on the 'losing side' would be unsellable. Hearn isn't too worried about this, citing the fact that miners have rejoined the majority within hours in the past.  However Pieter Wuille, another Bitcoin Core developer, told CoinDesk this 'losing' and 'winning' fork was a big concern:  ""People not being able to send coins from one 'side' of the fork to another, and all coins that existed before the fork being able to be spent twice (once on every side of the fork) [is] the very thing that bitcoin was designed to prevent.""  ""Maybe it works and maybe it doesn't, but I do think that it is a grave risk for centralisation of influence over the network, even if it works,"" he added.  Action and inaction  The blocksize debate has overshadowed development for many months now. It's proved the most divisive issue among bitcoin's core developers – and the stalemate between those demanding bigger blocks and those seeking other scalability workarounds, Todd included, shows no sign of abating.  Jeff Garzik, who made a proposal, BIP 102, for a 2MB block as an emergency 'fallback' if consensus is not reached, recently put it: ""There is no perfect answer; as with most modern policy changes, any action –­ including inaction – generates winners and losers.""  Understandably, XT has garnered its fair share of detractors – not just for its aims, but its methods, too.  A message purporting to be from Satoshi Nakamoto – whose email account was rumoured to have been compromised last year – appeared on the bitcoin dev mailing list Saturday to denounce the ""dangerous"" project. It read:  ""If two developers can fork bitcoin and succeed in redefining what 'bitcoin' is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare bitcoin a failed project. Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.""  Whether or not it came from the real bitcoin creator, the message that the project violates the 'original vision' of bitcoin is shared by others.  Discussion of XT was recently banned on the most popular bitcoin subreddit, r/bitcoin, with moderator 'Theymos' claiming that as a fork of Bitcoin Core, XT should be classed as an 'altcoin' or a 'forkcoin', similar to litecoin.  Wuille said: ""I think that people are free to fork the software and make changes. Not all users have the same demands, and software diversity is good. However, we're not talking about switching software, but about changing the rules of the network.""  ""I consider proposing software that intentionally changes the consensus rules while controversy exists about it, and marketing this as a safe choice for people in the network to run to be disingenuous and dangerous.""  Todd told CoinDesk: ""Well, keep in mind there is no debate among the experts in the community about the big picture: blockchains don't (yet) scale. Even Gavin admits any block size increase is just 'kicking the can down the road'.""

42398603,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ1u,1439806918,Bitcoin: Another Banking Headache,"A recent flurry of media reports and surveys have touted that some banking and financial services sector players are undertaking interesting projects with blockchains and decentralized ledgers in particular. But this burst of activity is hardly enough to prematurely claim victory on behalf of the few banks who have publicized such initiatives.      It is naive to assume that the blockchain will make the most impact where it is to be adopted early. Rather, it will make the most impact where change is hardest to achieve, and that might take a little longer, realistically.      The blockchain and its derivative technologies are one of the biggest opportunities for reengineering financial services. It’s a looming tsunami, and the big question is whether the banks will fail to reinvent themselves as they did with the Internet, or if they will dare to induce a self-inflicted shake-up and embrace the future.      Based on the early activity that I’m seeing, it appears that the banks are taking a narrow minded view of the opportunity being presented to them. Not unlike how they tackled the Internet in 1995.      If you’re a CEO or senior executive at a big bank or large financial institution, you will remember the advent of the Internet and its subsequent entry into the world of finance. That was around 1994-1997. Having been there too, and involved with some banks in an advisory capacity, I remember well that the banking sector didn’t take the Internet too seriously for at least the first three-to-four years of its commercialization. For example, when it came to Internet payments, banks didn’t want to touch them initially under the pretext that they “weren’t safe”.      Then, a handful of Internet-only banks and online brokerage startups were created, and banks followed by offering online banking, buying the brokerage companies, and much later rushed to develop smartphone apps for their customers.    Slow progress    Even when the banking sector took the Internet seriously, they did so very slowly, and without much innovation and without rocking the boat. When I look at my online banking today, the features are mostly about convenience, but I can’t do too much beyond the basics. My foreign exchange account doesn’t link to my banking card, I can’t exchange money online, and can’t initiate a wire transfer unless I visit the bank or have a fancy business account.      If I was a millennial today, I wouldn’t think twice about not using a traditional bank because most of the services I am attracted to are offered by alternative financial services companies, primarily due to innovative FinTech startups that sprung up in the past decade.      Here’s a typical millennial’s “financial stack”. In fact, a mere $2.3bn has funded the production of 126 FinTech companies in the past few years only. That certainly pales in comparison to the $200bn globally spent each year on IT by the banking sector, a high figure backed by the fact that the financial services industry consistently outspends other industries on technology. But we would be hard pressed to see real innovation coming out of that huge spending, because the bulk of those budgets are for keeping the lights on and infrastructure running.      Indeed, many banks have established so-called innovation and research centers with multi-million dollar budgets. But that’s not enough. These supposedly act as research laboratories with a mandate to run pilots and experiments. But are they really innovating at the pace of external innovation or are they being gatekeepers to the real innovation that’s happening outside banks?      In reality, few of these centers are real innovators. They are still bound by the bank’s current and legacy business models. It is puzzling that your business units couldn’t innovate on their own. Why not issue innovation mandates everywhere, not just in the “innovation center”?      And that’s all before bitcoin in the mix yet.      Enter bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchains, distributed ledgers and more technical jargon.    Hello bitcoin, another banking headache    Bitcoin is the “Internet of money” after all, so that should have gotten a banker’s attention from day one. Then we have the blockchain, the infrastructure behind bitcoin and other decentralization technologies. Well, let’s say it’s like a new type of database that has the potential to wreak havoc for your IT departments. It sounds like a perfect discussion between a CEO and their CIO.      I have said this before many times. The novel field is not bitcoin and it’s not just blockchain. It’s the intersection of cryptography technology with software engineering. We could call it CryptoTech for a lack of a better word.      CryptoTech is not a unidirectional phenomenon. It’s multi-dimensional, therefore it will have different bifurcations. It has multiple identities. And it’s more than just about bitcoin or blockchains. It is simultaneously:    Currency with wings, and no borders  Software Technology with a new development architecture paradigm  Accounting Ledger that is distributed and decentralized  Consensus Clearing network that acts as a “trust layer” that can validate business logic, not just transactions  Real-Time Messaging System that’s built-in, therefore it’s very fast  Global Online Community with special network effects  Transactions Engine that can verify transactions and approval levels  Computing Infrastructure that is global and similar to a cloud-based one  Reengineering Catalyst that enables innovation and new processes focused on enabling decentralization    The larger the organization, the more it needs to address all of these pieces, because it will be touched by each one of them, sooner or later.      So, in addition to focusing on the decentralized ledger properties of the blockchain, the banking sector needs to take a more holistic approach to determining what blockchain technologies (including bitcoin) can do for them.      Look out for part two in this series, coming soon.      This article originally appeared on Startup Management, an edited version has been reposted here with permission.
