The Neptune  sports 3 TH/s of hashing speed and carries a price tag of $9,995. The 20-nm miner is based on the Jupiter design, but consumes 30% less electricity at an estimated rate of 0.7 watts per GH/s.  The announcement, published on the company's website, offers KnCMiner customers an alternative to waiting for the production of the Neptune line of mining hardware.  Technology swap available  The modified Jupiters, according to KnCMiner, are capable of achieving the same 3 TH/s estimated for the Neptune line. KnCMiner is offering this alternative free of charge and with immediate shipping.  The company outlined the alternative in a statement:  ""If more than 400 people want to have the conversion, we will ship in order of payment for the original Neptune order. This offer will be open for seven days for people to contact us.""  After the seven-day period, KnCMiner will close submissions and reach out to those who requested the modified Jupiter unit.  Assuaging customer concerns  KnCMiner has a history of offering alternatives to its customers in the event of a delay of the Neptune line.  Earlier this year, the company released a ""Plan B"" which enabled customers to receive refunds in US dollars or 3 TH/s worth of mining power hosted at a Sweden-based data center. Last September, KnCMiner announced that Jupiter buyers who faced delays would receive upgraded units that provide additional processing power.  The announcement is notable in light of the frequent delays experienced by consumers who order personal mining equipment.

The event was founded by TechCrunch editor-at-large Mike Butcher, and includes more than 20 categories.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Butcher explained that the addition of a digital currency category to The Europas is indicative of the rise of the Bitcoin protocol and other virtual methods of payment.  Said Butcher:  ""I think you'd have to live under a rock not to realise that digital currency is potentially one of the biggest tech trends in the last 20 years.""  Founded in 2009, the event also includes categories such as ""Best E-Commerce Startup"", ""Best Founder(s)"" and ""Fastest Rising Startup."" The event is known for having a special focus on Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Digital currency startups rise in prominence  Butcher told CoinDesk that there are a few key characteristics that define a quality digital currency startup.  This includes a clear message to the market, a robust technology platform and a sign that founders are committed to putting the product first.  As for the future of digital currency startups, Butcher remarked that a challenging marketplace like the one facing today's businesses is actually good for development.  Butcher explained:  ""It's clear there is going to be growth then some consolidation. But, it's an unpredictable sector, which is in part what makes it so interesting. Tech startups thrive in that kind of environment.""  This year's judges  Judges for the event include investors, journalists, entrepreneurs and developers from across the tech industry.  This year, Butcher, Jemima Kiss, head of The Guardian's tech team; Ben Holmes, a partner at Index Ventures; and Alice Zagury, CEO of tech startup accelerator TheFamily, have all been named as judges.  Nominations for The Europas are still open, with the deadline being this Friday, 11th April.

42397512,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoWM,1397077361,MultiBit User's Loss Highlights Need for New Bitcoin Wallets,"The developer of popular bitcoin wallet MultiBit is battling a wave of criticism this week after a user suggested that a bug in the software rendered his bitcoins inaccessible.  Reddit user 'wetseals', who asked us not to reveal his real name, said that he transferred 0.5225 bitcoins into his Multibit wallet from his Blockchain wallet, hoping for a more secure form of offline storage.  Wetseals planned to use the wallet to help sell multiple Starbucks gift cards to chatroom users of the online power site SealsWithClubs, and set up 550 separate bitcoin addresses for that purpose, he said. He then tested the wallet by sending 0.024 bitcoins to his Seals With Clubs account.  The wallet sent the output from the initial address to the Seals With Clubs bitcoin address, and then - as is normal with bitcoin - sent the 'change' back. That went to one of the 550 addresses in his wallet.  But when wetseals went to send bitcoins from that address, they did not send. And when he tried to export the private keys from the wallet, he said all but the change address private key exported.  Wetseals gave his wallet files to a contact on Seals With Club who works as a senior software analyst (he asked CoinDesk not to reveal his identity and job, but proved his identity).  Said the analyst, identified as 'Dave23':  ""I exported the private keys and then imported them to a new wallet, and that address was missing.""  MultiBit's response  Wetseals accused MultiBit's main developer Jim Burton of responding generically to the request, and not addressing the issue.  Later, Burton commented on Reddit:  ""In the life of MultiBit (i.e from 2011) there's probably a handful of cases like these. If there is damage to the private key bytes (for whatever reason) and there is no other copy available/backed up then you've lost access to the bitcoins.""  MultiBit uses code from the BitcoinJ project, headed by bitcoin developer Mike Hearn (there is no suggestion that there is a bug in BitcoinJ). Hearn asked wetseals to send him the files for review, but told CoinDesk that he hadn't seen them yet.  He was skeptical that it was a bug, arguing that until he had seen the files directly, he could think of several possibilities, including incorrect manual editing.  However, another user, btcfun, posted on reddit about a similar issue using MultiBit.  ""I went through what you did - going through the backups, exporting private keys and trying to import them into blockchain, bitcoinqt, electrum, armory, etc. NOTHING WORKED.""  Need for change  Whether it was user error or a bug, the incident highlights the need for more development in bitcoin wallets, particularly in the area of hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. These wallets have an advantage in that they derive all of the keys for their addresses from a single piece of human-readable data small enough to be written down.  [post-quote]  One reason that MultiBit isn't providing personal support at present is because the team is working on such a wallet, which will likely hit beta in around a month, Burton said:  ""Mike Hearn is coding up HD support in BitcoinJ and we will integrate that into our GUI. There is lots of discussion at the moment between devs to harmonise everybody's HD implementation so that they can all work together.""  Hearn pointed to wider issues in bitcoin wallet development.  ""Until now wallets have all been written by volunteers who put huge time and effort in for free. This is one reason bitcoin has low transaction costs, but it isn't sustainable.""  Hearn argues that the support resources of the volunteers will be overwhelmed when the wallets become more popular.  ""One of the most critical transitions the community will have to make this year is to a world where most of us are paying for our wallets in some way.""  MultiBit is ""donationware"", and has collected just over 49 bitcoins in donations since launch. It has experienced 1.5 million downloads since going live.  All of this still leaves Wetseals out of pocket. The loss of the coins - which amounted to around $220 - was a blow, he told CoinDesk:  ""Losing the .4985 bitcoins would not have been a large hit to the majority of people, and honestly, probably not even myself, up until recently. My fiancee went on maternity leave, and at the same time, we had car issues.  He added: ""I do work full time, but I do not make a large sum of money, and with the new addition to our family back on 20th March, money is very tight.""

42397520,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAocG,1397073657,"BitAccess, CaVirtex to Speak Before Canadian Senate Committee Today","Canada's Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce is set to meet today (9th April) as part of a hearing that will aim to study the use of digital currency and feature notable members of the local community.  In attendance will be Haseeb Awan, co-founder of bitcoin ATM provider BitAccess; Joseph David, CEO of Calgary-based digital currency exchange CaVirtex; and Kyle Kemper and Victoria van Eyk, partners at Bitcoin Strategy Group, an organisation dedicated toward helping Canada's bitcoin businesses develop their public image.  The in-person meeting is meant to educate the Senate committee on the benefits of bitcoin, as well as the different businesses that are providing bitcoin-based services, and is part of the group's larger, 18-month study on the use of digital currencies.  Speaking about the event, BitAccess co-founder Haseeb Awan said:  ""[The Bitcoin] industry will flourish with regulations in place, however everyone involved in the process needs to understand the protocol and implementations in detail before [regulating it].""  The event is scheduled to run from 4:15 pm to 6:15 pm local time. A full webcast of the event can be viewed here.  The study so far  The Senate committee is already actively studying the use of digital currencies, and has so far heard from a range of different individuals and entities with interest in the space.  The study was revealed on 25th March in a blog post by Senator Doug Black, who indicated that the committee has been charged with delivering its report on digital currencies at the end of June, 2015.  Said Black in the post:  ""By analyzing the use and regulation of emerging digital currencies, such as bitcoin, the Senate can make an important contribution to keeping Canada ahead of the digital currency curve.""  To date, the Senate has heard from the Department of Finance Canada, the Bank of Canada and a professor from the University of Toronto, among others. However, this will be the first time the committee hears from members of the local digital currency business community.  The US Senate banking committee notably explored bitcoin in a similar manner in November of last year.  Bitcoin in Canada  Canada has already developed a robust bitcoin ecosystem, and is home to notable bitcoin projects and installations such as Bitcoin Decentral, a novel co-working and business development space, and the first operational bitcoin ATM.  Still, the local ecosystem, particularly its major exchanges, have faced operational difficulties due in part to a lack of regulatory clarity around bitcoin and digital currencies.  Further, recent news suggests the country's major financial companies are waiting for more direction as to the government's decision-making on this issue as well.  Victoria van Eyk will recap the day's events for CoinDesk as part of an article to be published this week.

42397523,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAogC,1397069958,Building a Greener Bitcoin: How to Reduce Carbon Emissions,"In this, Part Three of a three-part series, we explore the impact the bitcoin network is having on the environment.  Part One projected exactly how much carbon dioxide each bitcoin produces, while Part Two put this figure in context with the broader financial sector.  This article explores potential solutions to bitcoin's growing environmental problem.  It turns out that the electricity used to produce bitcoins produces quite a bit of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of burning 16 gallons of gasoline, in fact. That means the entire bitcoin network uses slightly more power than it takes to run the US Treasury for a year.  That's a lot of electricity, and potentially, a lot of greenhouse gas. Yet, the cost we'll have to pay in carbon emissions is going to rise with the mining difficulty.  So, what can we do to try and reduce the carbon footprint of the bitcoin network? Here are a few options, along with their strengths and weaknesses.  Changing the bitcoin code  Is there a way to change bitcoin at the source, by tampering with the software behind the bitcoin network itself?  Some altcoins have already done this. Solarcoin is largely pre-mined, for example, to avoid the race for computing power by miners. Several other currencies, such as Ripple's XRP, weren't mined at all, but were instead produced algorithmically. This eliminates the need for dedicated high-speed mining equipment.  The creator of peercoin and primecoin who goes by the pseudonym 'Sunny King', explains that they are both designed to mitigate the energy problem.  Peercoin uses 'proof of stake', in which people are given more coins based on how many they already have, rather than how much they're hashing.  Said King:  ""Peercoin is actually entirely secured by proof of stake. The energy from proof of work is only used for minting, and the relative consumption rate will drop as the inflation rate drops.""  Primecoin uses a proof-of-work algorithm, but at least tries to ensure that it's doing useful work at the same time, by searching for chains of prime number that can be useful to researchers.  The problem is that bitcoin doesn't have these luxuries.  The opportunity for pre-mining large parts of the currency has obviously passed, and proof of stake isn't coded into the protocol. It would take a hard fork to do that, and the risk is high – so much business now relies on bitcoin that the core developers are naturally and sensibly conservative.  Said core developer Mike Hearn:  ""In theory, we should only be paying for what we need, where 'need' is a bit vague but possibly defined like 'enough hashing power that the vast majority of merchants do not need to worry about double spending/rollback attacks'.""  A certain amount of mining power is necessary on a decentralized network like bitcoin to stop people taking control of the block chain. The more distributed that mining power is, the better it is for the network.  You can have too much of a good thing, however.  Hearn said that we're ""vastly over-mining"" today, because there are no reports of double-spending attacks, which would happen if bad miners caught up the block chain and replaced it with their own:  ""This is not surprising – creating new money distorts decision making and leads to misallocation of resources. In this case, misallocation towards excessive mining.""  So, should we change the protocol to restrict the amount of mining?  ""I don't think so. You can't do something like bitcoin without creating new money out of thin air, and therefore you can't do it without misallocating resources,"" he argued, adding:  ""The difference between bitcoin and the dollar is, of course, that misallocation in the latter is structural and infinite, whereas bitcoin is due to phase it out after a while.""  So, in other words, the situation will improve over time. But in the meanwhile, we're still burning carbon at a speedy rate.  Gavin Andresen  , former lead developer of the Bitcoin protocol and chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation said:  ""If you are concerned about CO2 emissions, then the correct economic answer is a carbon tax to make emitting CO2 more expensive.""  The core developers are unlikely to try and impose some kind of environmental tax on bitcoin mining directly in the software. It would be incredibly unpopular, almost impossible to manage, and probably fork the chain.  It would also penalise those who weren't burning fossil fuels to produce their bitcoins. So, that leaves governments to impose carbon taxes on the fuel producers, which is happening in some jurisdictions.  Given that we're stuck with rising difficulty for the time being, what can you do to make your mining operation more environmentally friendly?  Changing hardware  GPUs (graphics processing units) are notoriously power-hungry, and in any case they're practically useless for producing bitcoin at present, because of the high difficulty level.  Many people have switched their GPUs to mine other coins based on the scrypt protocol, but this still chews up plenty of power. ASIC miners use less power to generate more coins, and are now starting to become available for scrypt-based cryptocurrencies too. (See the CoinDesk guide to mining for more information on how it works.)  [post-quote]  On the other hand, ASIC hardware also takes a lot of energy to manufacture, and once the difficulty gets high enough, they effectively become expensive paperweights.  Buying carbon credits  This can be done in multiple ways. Solarcoin, for example, is designed to underpin renewable energy credits, meaning that when you trade them, you're supporting a market that rewards the production of solar energy.  Another digital currency, called carboncoin, is styling itself as a carbon-offset coin. Its anonymous manager, who calls himself 'Axis Mundi', explains that it started off as a pre-mined coin without a carbon-offset focus, but the developer gave up the coin and sold his pre-mine. Mundi is trying to repurpose the coin as part of a carbon-offset initiative.  He is collecting carboncoin donations, and has a deal with owners of land in the US and UK, to use those coins to fund the planting of saplings. Each sapling will offset one ton of carbon, Mundi says.  He has collected about 1.25% of all the coins in circulation, and has more pledged. Mundi also accepts bitcoin donations. The coin is currently a proof-of-work coin, meaning that mining difficulty will rise, although he wants to fork to a proof-of-stake coin at some point in the future.  Several suppliers let you pay for these directly in bitcoin, such as My Clean Sky. And then there are always traditional fiat-based carbon offset schemes, which you could pay into by converting some of your bitcoin to conventional currency.  Buying green power  Most jurisdictions offer ways to purchase power from alternative energy suppliers. Alternatively, you can buy renewable energy certificates or their equivalents, which are tradable certificates rewarding producers of renewable energy.  Some hope that the use of renewable power on the bitcoin network will increase. The bitcoin mining system is well-suited to renewables.  Said Hearn:  ""A lot of renewable power is unused because it'd be too hard to get it to the consumers [eg: solar panels in the middle of a desert]. Mining rigs can locate anywhere and use power nobody else wants.""  The average residential bitcoin user may not be willing to build a rig in the middle of a desert with a solar array, but institutional miners running their own data centres may grab an increasing share of the pie. If those data centres garner their power responsibly, as those operated by KnCMiner and MegaBigPower claim to, it could be good environmental news.  There's a trade-off for everything. Bitcoin difficulty will rise, and so will the carbon emissions that we use to create our cryptocurrency. But, at least at an individual level, there are some steps that we can take to make it better.

42397510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoUO,1397061494,"US Congressman Jared Polis Buys Bitcoin, Will Spend on Socks","After inviting bitcoin ATM maker Robocoin to give a presentation at Capitol Hill yesterday (8th April), US Congressman Jared Polis has become the first representative to buy bitcoin – in public, at least.  Polis had asked Robocoin to demonstrate its two-way bitcoin machine to other members and officials unfamiliar with the practicalities of the technology. Showing just how easy it is to buy bitcoin using such a device, he put $10 into the ATM, receiving 0.02 BTC in return.  According to CoinReport, Polis said some US politicians have little understanding of bitcoin and are therefore sceptical of the technology.  He explained:  “When people don’t understand something there’s a natural tendency to fear it to try to preserve the status quo, and I expect those forces to continue to rear those heads, particularly with inevitable consumer loss and criminal activities that occur with any currency.”  However, Polis will not hang onto his coins for long, as he plans to spend them on a new pair of alpaca socks.  Making a stand  While Polis has an understanding of digital currencies and is eager to promote their legitimate uses, others in the US government are not so up-to-date on the cryptographic technology. Many have been solely exposed to largely negative stories of crime and incompetence, most famously the torrid tales of Silk Road and Mt. Gox.  In late February, Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, sent a formal letter to federal regulators calling for an outright ban on bitcoin and suggesting that the failure of immediate action could negatively impact US consumers.  In response, Polis sent a tongue-in-cheek response – a letter to the same federal regulators that satirically called for a ban on the US dollar.  Polis told CoinDesk at the time:  “As digital currencies like bitcoin become more popular, the level of awareness will increase in Congress as well. It’s important to continue to establish the basic fact that the dollar is the currency of choice for cartels, criminals and illicit transactions and is likely to stay that way for the forseable future.”  While Polis' letter was a stunt, he did have a serious point to make: “I think that digital currencies, whether it is bitcoin or other existing digital currencies, have many advantages over government currencies. I think there will be an increased role for digital currencies over time, but I doubt that they will replace government issued currencies any time soon.”  Donations on the increase  Although Polis' symbolic purchase from the Robocoin machine was the first time a representative has bought digital currency, bitcoin has already started making small inroads into the world of political donations in the country.  Since last November, when the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) gave tacit permission for political campaigns to accept bitcoin donations, a growing number of politicians have turned to digital currency in an attempt to find new streams of fiscal support, and perhaps present a youthful, tech-savvy image.  Steve Stockman, a Republican representative from Texas, raised funds for his Senate campaign by wearing a QR code at the NYC Bitcoin Center last New Year’s Eve.  Furthermore, Cadillac, Michigan, mayor Bill Barnett has accepted bitcoin for an election campaign, as has Bryan Parker, a Democrat currently running for mayor of Oakland, California.  It is likely that through further exposure to the benefits of digital currencies, a greater understanding and acceptance of bitcoin will develop – which can only be a good thing for bitcoin's sock retailers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/09/us-congressman-jared-polis-buys-bitcoin-will-spend-on-socks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e1365e86b3ac6f2a520dd7fd800dc43b8fc839f-942x718.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While there is already a large and fast-expanding base of merchants that accept bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin are far less represented and, in doge's case, used more for microtransactions such as tipping on reddit or charitable fundraising campaigns.  However, while it initially started more as a joke than a viable digital currency, dogecoin has taken off and seen an unexpected climb in value. Although the price of 1 DOGE pales in comparison with 1 BTC, its success has provided it with growing clout in the world of commerce and makes its inclusion on the GoCoin platform a logical step.  Furthermore, providing gift cards that can be purchased with these altcoins suddenly vastly increases the merchants that can be accessed by this underrepresented market.  Painless process  Singapore-based GoCoin added litecoin payments back in January, and only started accepting dogecoin this month.  Steve Beauregard, founder and CEO of GoCoin told CoinReport:  “We are thrilled to see key merchants in the bitcoin eco-system embrace the [altcoins] and their unique communities. Together with eGifter, we are building bridges between retail shopping and digital currency communities.”  The partnership means that eGifter does not need to be involved with digital currencies directly. GoCoin accepts the crypto-coins from the customer, coverts them into fiat and then passes this onto the merchant.  In this way, eGifter has little of the technical and security hassle involved with taking and storing bitcoins, and is also protected from the digital currencies' volatility by the instant conversion into cash.  The move also means that, should either altcoin take off in a big way, the company is primed to reap the rewards.  Rise of the gift card  eGifter is one of several gift card companies that have recently made it much easier for bitcoin-weilding shoppers to gain access to the many big retailers still without a cryptocurrency payments option.  SnapCard gives bitcoiners access to Amazon and eBay, and even lets customers to pay their IRS tax bill in the digital currency too.  Gyft, a similar service, offers customers access to retailers such as Walmart and to buy Dell computers with bitcoin, should they desire.  However, as these companies are bitcoin-only, opening up the gift card market to the litecoin and dogecoin communities may prove a shrewd move by eGifter.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/09/egifter-partners-with-gocoin-to-accept-dogecoin-litecoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/101f34fd882c40e99bb75312d70e4c129d234820-945x568.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The customer, 'Yo Shima,' who trades bitcoins face-to-face as AusBitcoins, said he was in good standing and there had never been any hint of fraudulent or other untoward behavior associated with his business or bank account. He is currently one of Australia's most active over-the-counter bitcoin traders, buying and selling about AU$50,000 worth per week on average since he began almost a year ago.  Other bitcoin-related businesses in Australia confirmed they had also been informed NAB was turning its back on bitcoin, and were currently working with other financial institutions to establish a more reliable relationship.  Banks and bitcoins  Australia's banking industry is dominated by the ‘Big Four’ corporate banking groups: NAB, ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac. Of the four, Commonwealth had previously been the one most hostile to bitcoin, while ANZ reportedly works with digital currency businesses on a case-by-case basis. Westpac’s policy remains unknown.  NAB produced a report on bitcoin for its currency traders last December, where it compared bitcoin and digital currencies with existing national currencies. The report was generally curious and neutral in tone, but said bitcoin would take a few more years to achieve mainstream acceptance.  The bank did not give a reason for its policy change, however Mizuho, one of Japan’s largest banks, may have spooked other large banks around the world when it was named as a defendant in the US class action lawsuit against departed exchange Mt. Gox. The complaint stated that by continuing to provide banking services to Mt. Gox, Mizuho ""profited from the fraud"".

42397526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAoiA,1397045408,French Retail Chain Monoprix to Accept Bitcoin Payments This Year,"Major French retail chain Monoprix is making plans to start accepting bitcoin payments on its merchant website this year, according to the company's director of e-commerce, Patrick Oualid.  Oualid made his comments in an interview published yesterday (8th April) on French news site JDN.  When asked why he thought accepting bitcoin payments would be good for his company Oualid explained:  ""Monoprix has always been a pioneer and sought to bring to its customers what we do not necessarily see elsewhere. For 2,500 years, the Phoenicians sailed the seas to seek different products in the countries bordering the Mediterranean. We want to fill the same role.""  He went on to explain that the company takes the same approach with bitcoin. The idea is not to try and impress by being the first to accept bitcoin in France, but to try and improve the lives of customers.  Even if it is far too early to expect a significant turnover in bitcoin sales, many at the company believe in the digital currency, he said, further indicating that the company is also working on a mobile payment solution for physical stores and bitcoin could eventually be used there too.  Said Oualid:  ""Bitcoin is not a flash in the pan [...] We need to start using it, as it is in [the company's] DNA. If bitcoin does not bring us cold hard sales and cash, it does not matter.""  Bitcoin in France  Oualid explained that, in France, the general perception of bitcoin is still that it is primarily a tool for thieves and money launderers.  There is not yet much understanding of the ""magnitude"" of bitcoin, he said, but to not believe in bitcoin's potential now would be like deriding the importance of social networks a few years back.  CoinDesk recently reported on attempts to raise the understanding of digital currencies in France. InnoCherche, a France-based think tank dedicated to fostering innovation in the country, held an event composed of seven of its peer organisations earlier this month as part of a discussion that touched on some of the biggest digital trends, including digital currencies.  A representative of the organisation indicated afterwards that the panel members were not very educated about bitcoin, and that he had to defend against the spectre of now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the perception that digital currency exchanges are unsafe for the general consumer.  About Monoprix  Monoprix opened its first store in the French city of Rouen in 1938. It now has a presence in 85% of French towns and combines food retailing with hardware, clothing, household items and gifts. A subsidiary of the Casino Group, the company had over 300 stores across France as of 2008, according to online sources.  As for its future plans for digital currencies, Monoprix plans to be bitcoin ready on its web store by the end of 2014, said Oualid, adding:  ""In this way, if the [bitcoin explosion] occurs in 2015, we are ready.""

The vulnerability has been patched by major bitcoin exchanges in a matter of hours.  In case you missed it, Heartbleed is a pretty big deal in the security community. The crypto bug in OpenSSL (an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS internet security protocols that encrypt and secure internet traffic) has opened up two thirds of the web to eavesdropping. It was uncovered earlier this week and many observers described it as nothing short of catastrophic.  Bitcoin players quick to address Heartbleed  Luckily the news quickly translated into industry-wide action: patches are being implemented across the world as we speak.  Bitcoin exchanges  and wallets are targeted by hackers on a daily basis, so serious bitcoin outfits keep track of zero day exploits, new attack vectors and a host of other vulnerabilities.  The Bitcoin Core team says version 0.9.1 is a maintenance release to fix an urgent vulnerability (ie Heartbleed), and all users should upgrade as soon as possible. Most have heeded the call and as a result the vast majority of major bitcoin sites and exchanges have implemented the fix.  What is Heartbleed all about?  OpenSSL is the most popular code library for HTTPS encryption. It is not used by Microsoft IIS, so Windows-based systems cannot be directly affected.  While this is good news for most desktop users out there, IT departments would rather have it the other way around. OpenSSL is used on Linux, BSD and numerous custom server platforms. Mac OS X is affected, too. The bug does not affect all versions of OpenSSL, either. Some major banks like Chase and Schwab rely on Microsoft IIS. Others rely on Linux/Apache, Java and other systems.  Ars Technica  reports the bug is the result of a “mundane coding error” in OpenSSL. The bug essentially allows attackers to gain access to chunks of private computer memory that handles the OpenSSL process.  The contents of said memory chunks may include authentication credentials or even private keys that can undermine the website’s entire cryptographic certificate.  Hence, website operators need to patch their servers with OpenSSL version 1.0.1g and update their security certificates. The problem is that the OpenSSL patch is just the first step. Users need to think about replacing their X.509 certificates once they apply the OpenSSL update.  All admins and users are advised to change their passwords as a precaution as activity is traceless, and this scale of vulnerability is unprecedented in OpenSSL.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2014/04/09/bitcoin-core-version-091-fixes-heartbleed-vulnerability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8dd9741effd9c16e43e0f93ad64b4248d9622dc-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397527,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAohB,1397037166,Industry Group Aims to Change Bitcoin Symbol to 'Ƀ',"An effort to better represent bitcoin as a symbol has been launched.  The Unicode Ƀ symbol has been chosen by a website of industry members as a way to better legitimize bitcoin as a symbol both in print and online media.  It is already an existing Unicode character under the non-profit corporation Unicode Consortium, which describes it as a ""latin capital B with stroke"" that has the hex Alt +0243.  A number of bitcoin companies already use Ƀ as the symbol to denote bitcoin. They include ZeroBlock, Lamassu and Tip4Commit.  The current bitcoin symbol  Bitcoin has long been denoted as B⃦, however it is not recognized as a Unicode symbol by the Unicode Consortium, which develops such standards.  Having a symbol in Unicode form means it would work in different fonts and formats and would help to better convey the cryptocurrency to the masses in various forms of media.  There has been community discussion to get B⃦ used in conjunction with the Unicode Consortium, with a Bitcoin Wiki resource devoted to it.  However, since the Unicode Consortium already accepts Ƀ, it could be an easier path to adoption since there are no standardization roadblocks in the way.  Differing viewpoints  CoinDesk asked several people in the bitcoin industry their views on the Ƀ symbol – and reactions were mixed. Sean Neville is the chief technology officer of Circle, a company focused on consumer adoption of bitcoin. Neville said:  ""I'm not a huge fan of that actual symbol, but I think it's a pretty neat idea.""    Adam Draper, founder of startup accelerator Boost VC, said that there's nothing wrong with the bitcoin symbol used today: ""What's wrong with the double dashed B?""    John Light, who organizes cryptocurrency meetups in the San Francisco Bay Area, sees the marketing potential for using something already accepted by the Unicode Consortium:  ""I think it's a good branding move – open source, no currency symbol conflicts, available as a font.""  Community consensus  The community that has developed around bitcoin is what has helped it grow and any decision-making on what bitcoin's official symbol should be will require its direction.  The abbreviation BTC has been adopted as a simple, yet unofficial acronym for bitcoin. And the ISO 4217 standard has taken steps towards making XBT an official currency code, even though many, like the IRS, still don't consider bitcoin a currency.  Setting standards for bitcoin are important to maintaining its legitimacy, but a consensus on this particular subject of bitcoin's Unicode symbol has not been made yet.  So, what's the right choice - B⃦ or Ƀ?
