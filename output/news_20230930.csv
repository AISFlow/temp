42409615,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM79V,1696109990,"FTX Customers, Investors Will Testify Against Sam Bankman-Fried, DOJ Says","Federal prosecutors want to call former FTX customers, investors and employees in its upcoming trial against onetime crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried, the Department of Justice confirmed in a pair of Saturday filings.  The customers and investors who owned FTX shares can speak to their expectations of how FTX would hold their funds, while the cooperating witnesses can speak to ""their interactions with the defendant and their understanding of the purpose of certain statements and actions of the defendant,"" a letter signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thane Rehn said.  ""In each of these cases, the anticipated testimony about how the witnesses understood their relationship with the defendant and his companies, and their interpretation of statements made by the defendant and his agents, is directly relevant to the issues in dispute at trial, and is probative of how reasonable persons would have interpreted and understood representations made by the defendant regarding FTX’s treatment of customer assets and other issues,"" the letter said.  The DOJ intends to call retail customers who ""transferred tens of thousands of dollars worth of assets"" and institutional clients who moved ""tens of millions of dollars worth of assets"" to FTX, with the expectation that the exchange would custody these funds, the letter said.  The letter did not identify any of the prospective witnesses or say how many the DOJ intends to call. A second letter said the customer witnesses are likely to testify for less than 30 minutes each ""and will involve minimal, if any, exhibits."" The DOJ identified former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, former FTX Head of Engineering Nishad Singh and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison as three cooperating witnesses who all pled guilty to charges tied to the exchange and will testify. Another former FTX executive, Ryan Salame, pleaded guilty to charges but hadn't agreed to testify as of a few weeks ago. The DOJ is also planning to call forward at least another two witnesses to testify under a grant of immunity, but has not publicly identified them yet.  Ukrainian customer  One of the customer witnesses, which the DOJ identified as ""FTX Customer-1,"" lives in Ukraine and cannot easily travel to the U.S. for both legal and logistical reasons, the second letter said. Because of the war in Ukraine, the customer needs permission from the government to leave the country. Should that permission be granted, the logistics of getting the customer to the U.S. would ""take at least approximately three days"" (and another three days back) and require multiple forms of travel.  The DOJ is asking the judge to approve testimony via video conference, supervised by a U.S. government official possibly at the embassy, instead of requiring in-person testimony. The defense does not agree to the motion, the DOJ said.  ""To obtain likely less than 30 minutes of testimony from overseas FTX customer witnesses, however, requires, for at least some countries, coordinating with local authorities, arranging multi-day travel itineraries to accommodate varying time changes and travel delays, and incurring significant costs associated with such arrangements. Notwithstanding those hurdles, the Government is in the process of arranging for some overseas FTX customers to travel to New York to testify,"" the letter said.  Inner City Press first reported on the letter about a Ukrainian witness.  Bankman-Fried's trial starts next week, with voir dire – the jury selection process – kicking off on Oct. 3. Opening statements may then begin as soon as Oct. 4.

If lawmakers can’t renew funding by that critical deadline, which is looking more likely, a great number of government operations would cease. For cryptocurrency investors, what impact, if any, does a government shutdown have on the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD )? Seeking Alpha analyst Giesbers Investment Strategy uncovered the price action of bitcoin, widely seen as a gauge of the broader crypto market, during the previous three shutdowns. In the most recent one, from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019, the digital token slid 9.8%. That followed a 15.7% decline in the Jan. 20-23, 2018 shutdown and a 7.8% climb in the Oct. 1-16, 2013, shutdown. Bear in mind there have only been three government shutdowns during bitcoin's existence, ""so there’s not a whole lot of data here,” Giesbers noted this past week. The contributor argued that, during these government shutdowns, other sources of volatility influenced bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) more than the volatility stemming from the shutdowns. And in 2013, bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) popularity was only a fraction of where it is now, ""and people especially did not view it as a safe harbor in case of financial turmoil."" In other words, BTC was a beast of its own, and ""I believe a government shutdown will not lead to a rally in Bitcoin price,” he predicted. As it relates to crypto securities regulation, one of the larger forces driving crypto prices, a shutdown would result in delayed regulatory decisions, including matters concerning crypto exchange-traded funds, as the Securities and Exchange Commission would face substantial staff reductions. Financial heavyweights like BlackRock ( BLK ) and Fidelity Investments have been vying to be the first to market for a U.S. ETF that invests directly in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). So a delay in a potential SEC approval for such a product could prompt further uncertainty. Some crypto investors have turned bullish on the prospect of a government shutdown, with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) set to close out the week ending September 30 nearly 3% higher, on the notion that non-sovereign currencies wouldn’t be affected by government procedure. Others, though, have argued that a government shutdown risks a liquidity drain across financial markets as investors flock to safer assets, thus bitcoin could unexpectedly suffer in the wake of a wider selloff, at least in the nearer term. “Crypto has always grown in an economic downturn. If you look at the inception of bitcoin, it was founded as a direct result of a great financial crisis caused by banks. Every financial crisis helps to highlight the strength of bitcoin as a decentralized asset uncontrolled by banks or governments,” said Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation. Meanwhile, traditional alternative assets like gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), as well as the stock market ( SP500 ), are on track to end the week in the red, suggesting “the market might view bitcoin as a ‘flight to safety’ asset during a time of instability,” said David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits.

This development marks the first time assets have been transferred out of the hacker’s wallet following the exploit about a year ago. Related Reading: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Joins Ethereum Futures ETF Race After Spot Bitcoin ETF Delay FTX Hacker Moves 5,000 ETH, Spot On Chain Reveals Marked as one the biggest crypto heists ever, the now-defunct FTX exchange suffered a loss of over $600 million through an hack in November 2022, a few hours after filing for bankruptcy. According to the on-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain, the FTX exploiter has now transferred 5,000 ETH in two transactions, moving 2,500 ETH to two separate wallets with a space of two hours between both transactions. Spot on Chain further revealed that following the first transaction, the hacker moved 700 ETH through the Thorchain Router and 1,200 ETH through the DeFi wallet Railgun, both crypto projects that are lauded for their privacy-focused features. Aside from the origin of these transferred assets, the movements of the FTX exploiter have drawn much attention due to a key development in the crypto space, with many enthusiasts and analysts now speculating on a possible market sell-off. Related Reading: Grayscale Takes New Approach As It Files For Another Ethereum Futures ETF Could FTX Hacker Be Planning A Sell-Off As Ether Futures ETF Launch Nears? This week, reports swelled that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was looking to clear some Ether futures ETH for launch next week ahead of a possible government shutdown. These reports picked up more steam in less than a day when the VanEck Investment firm announced plans to soon launch an Ether futures ETH, named the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF. However, Valkyrie Investments, who had been tipped to be the forerunner for the SEC’s approval, finally won the race, securing the commission’s green light to launch the first-ever Ether futures ETF in the US. Following the official launch of an Ether futures ETF, there is likely a massive positive effect on ETH price movement. Just in the last two days of similar positive news around this investment fund, the second-largest cryptocurrency already rose by 4%, based on data from CoinMarketCap. Now, the recent token transfers by the FTX hacker are usually associated with an impending sell action. Thus, there is a possibility that this bad actor could be planning to take profit from the potential ETH price surge, which could be generated from the launch of ETH futures ETF. Such selling action is a common practice by crypto whales and is known to induce a bearish trend, which could be dangerous for small traders. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $1,677, with a 5.77% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 44.35% and valued at $3.8 billion.

In light of this, a crypto CEO has disclosed his insights on XRP’s bullish outlook, acknowledging the prospects of a bull run in the future.

Related Reading: CRV Price Surges 16% – What’s The Next Move For Curve DAO Token? Matthew Dixon, Chief Executive Officer of Evai, a renowned crypto valuation platform, has recognized and highlighted this shift in market sentiment and aired his remarks on the token’s bullish position in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Friday. A price surge for the XRP price may be inevitable according to Dixon who used market insights from well-known crypto market analysts who were bullish on the crypto as a basis for his belief. “Listening to other market commentators I hear a lot of Bullishness in the air for XRP. They may well be right,” Dixon stated. XRP price still holding at $0.51 support | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Dixon Exercises Caution Amidst XRP Price Bullish Sentiment Amid the backdrop of crypto market volatilities and regulatory uncertainties that have plagued the XRP ecosystem, the cryptocurrency’s bullish trend comes as great news for the XRP community and its investors. There have been many price predictions for the XRP token. Some market analysts have predicted that the XRP price may see an increase as high as $250. Another analyst also forecasted a price surge of 2500% for the XRP token, pushing the cryptocurrency as high as $20 in the future. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Inks 20% Price Advance, Leads Top 50 Coins Today XRP’s bullish trend started taking effect after its win over the SEC when US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of XRP, stating that programmatic XRP sales do not qualify as securities. Market observers are presently watching the XRP price and the developments in its ecosystem closely. The cryptocurrency has had its fair share of gains and losses this year. Therefore, it remains to be seen if XRP can sustain its bullish sentiment. Dixon has stated that he would remain cautious of XRP’s bullish momentum while waiting for more compelling evidence of a bull run in the future. The crypto CEO explained that he would remain a short-term investor to avoid significant losses. Nevertheless, he stated that he was also open to being a long-term investor of XRP if the prospects of a bullish run remain strong and the overheard resistance is overcome. “I will remain cautious until that overhead resistance is convincingly breached. If it is I’m happy to go long but until then shorts are favored with close stop losses,” Dixon stated. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

18218353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553620,1696080622,Ethereum ETF: Valkyrie Halts Purchase Of ETH Futures Contracts,"Asset management firm Valkyrie, one of the frontrunners for the first Ethereum ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States, has decided to pause its purchase of Ether futures contracts until the US Securities and Exchange Commission approves an Ether futures ETF. This comes barely a day after the asset manager reportedly secured approval to offer investors exposure to Ether futures under its existing strategy ETF (BTF). SEC Might Be Behind This Action, Bloomberg Expert Speculates On Friday, September 29, Valkyrie filed a 497 with the SEC, saying that it would halt the purchase of Ether futures contracts and unwind its existing positions. A part of the filing read: Effectively immediately, The Fund will not purchase ether futures contracts until the effectiveness of an amendment to the Fund’s registration statement contemplating the addition of ether futures contracts to the principal investment strategy of the Fund. Until such time, the Fund will unwind any existing positions in ether futures contracts. As reported on Thursday, September 28, the SEC appears to be fast-tracking the approval of Ethereum futures ETF in anticipation of a potential US government shutdown next week. Following this report, Valkyrie disclosed that it had begun purchasing Ether futures contracts for its combined strategy ETF ahead of a possible launch next week. However, this latest action poses questions about the odds of Valkyrie becoming one of the first firms to introduce an Ethereum ETF in the United States. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Registers Breakout But Lacks Momentum, $1,620 Is The Key Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has put forward a possible reason for Valkyrie’s decision to halt and unwind its Ether futures purchases. “SEC must have threatened them to cut it out,” Balchunas speculated via a post on X (formerly Twitter). Valkyrie filed its unique Ethereum ETF application with the SEC in August. The asset manager seeks to convert its existing Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) to a combined Bitcoin and Ether futures ETF. Nine Ethereum ETFs To Launch Next Week? According to Eric Balchunas’ analysis, about nine Ethereum ETFs will potentially start trading on Monday, October 2. Notably, asset manager ProShares owns three of these funds, with two being combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Related Reading: Is The Ethereum Winter Over? L2 Exploding, ETH Futures ETF Launches VanEck is another frontrunner for the first Ether futures ETFs in the US. The investment manager recently announced its intention to donate 10% of profits from its Ethereum ETF (EFUT) to The Protocol Guild, a compensation plan for Ethereum core contributors. VanEck wrote on X (formerly Twitter): If TradFi stands to gain from the efforts of Ethereum’s core contributors, it makes sense that we also give back to their work. We urge other asset managers/ETF issuers to consider also giving back in the same way. It is worth mentioning that the ETH price has seen some reprieve since news of the potential Ethereum ETF launch started making rounds. As of this writing, Ether is valued at $1,676, reflecting a substantial 5% price jump in the past week.

This is evident in the latest weekly development report shared by Essential Cardano. Cardano: Highlights From The Report One of the notable highlights from the report includes the updates being made to Cardano’s Lace wallet. This week, the team is said to have worked on a feature that allows users to choose the delegate ratio between “different stake pools, integrated portfolio persistence.” The team has also fixed issues relating to the User Experience (UI). Related Reading: CRV Price Surges 16% – What’s The Next Move For Curve DAO Token? The wallet launched earlier this year to a welcoming reception, with many excited about its functionalities and the multiple use cases it provided to users. Upon launch, the development team promised to continue introducing new updates to the wallet. The report also indicates that users could get an update on the DApp connector, allowing them to enable it with selected extensions “such as those listed on CIP-95.” An update to the wallet’s UI reflecting the different types of governance actions is also imminent. Meanwhile, the Plutus tools team identified key issues relating to the Cardano blockchain using the new Marconi API. Marconi was developed to help index and query the blockchain. The team also used this solution to test the new “Cardano-node-emulator”, which is expected to be integrated into the blockchain’s smart contract code. While at this, the Plutus tools team made certain optimizations to Marconi, which improved synchronization times and the system’s overall performance. ADA market cap currently at $8.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The Marlowe team was also busy this week, making specific adjustments to the Marlowe oracle. Marlowe is the code which allows Cardano users to create decentralized applications (dApps) that are specifically designed for financial contracts. Updates To Basho And Preparation For Voltaire The Hydra and Mithril teams focused on updating Cardano’s current development stage, Basho. The Basho era is the fourth stage of Cardano’s development, primarily focusing on scaling and interoperability. On one hand, the Hydra team worked on improving the network’s usability and identified ways to enhance the network’s resilience. On the other hand, the Mithril team released a new update which allows support for certain actions on the network. They also made corrections in the Mithril nodes.

18214054,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=553603,1696069826,Crypto Analyst Reveals Which Meme Coin Will Topple Dogecoin In The Bull Market,"Popular crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain recently voiced his opinions on when the bull market would start and how several meme coins are poised to dominate the market when that happens. Specifically, he seemed most bullish on Shiba Inu (SHIB), asserting that SHIB would topple the biggest meme coin by market cap, Dogecoin (DOGE). The #BullRun Has Officially Begun. — JAKE (@JakeGagain) September 27, 2023 DOGE Has Elon, SHIB Has? In response to Gagain’s tweet, another X user laughed at the possibility of this happening and stated that DOGE had Elon Musk likely suggesting that there was no way SHIB could topple the largest meme coin since it had the support of the world’s richest man. Related Reading: JPEX Scam: Hong Kong Cops Nab 4 More People Linked To Crypto Exchange Musk has been known to be a huge admirer of DOGE and has partially contributed to the token’s growth, especially when it soared by 23,000% to hit an all-time high of $0.7 in 2021. It was also recently revealed that besides his vocal support, Musk is invested in the meme coin as he has been “quietly funding” the token’s development. With this in mind, many believe that there is no way that SHIB could topple DOGE, which happens to be ranked as the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with SHIB coming far behind at 19th. However, while it is undoubtedly a huge task, there are signs that SHIB could be massive (and possibly go head-to-head with DOGE) when the bull market returns. The fundamentals behind SHIB are stronger than ever, especially with the rejuvenation of Shibarium following its botched launch and the increased utility the layer-2 network is currently enjoying. Crypto market cap currently at $1.055 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Furthermore, SHIB’s burn rate has increased significantly, which could spark a surge in the token’s price as more and more SHIB tokens are cut out of circulation. It is also worth mentioning that SHIB once surpassed DOGE in market cap at some point in 2021, according to data from CoinGeko. Crypto: Pepe In The Mix Meanwhile, Pepe is another meme coin in which Gagain stated that he was bullish and gave four reasons for his stance. The first reason he gave was that major players, including crypto exchanges like Binance, OKX, Crypto.com, and Bybit, form part of the largest holders of the token and noted that these firms are holding their Pepe bags rather than selling. His second reason was that Pepe survived the saga, which involved three of the project’s developers dumping $15.6 million worth of Pepe on the market. Despite this, the token has risen in market cap since that event, which could likely mean that the token has bottomed out, in Gargain’s opinion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Metrics Point To A Different Scenario Than 2019 Fakeout: Top Analyst The third reason is that Pepe is currently listed on over 100 exchanges, including the biggest centralised and decentralised exchanges. This is something which Gargain believes could give the token more visibility and liquidity by extension. Lastly, he noted that Pepe is currently ranked in the top 100 tokens by market cap and, specifically, the third-largest meme coin by market. As such, it is well positioned to surge massively, especially because meme coins will dominate the next bull run.

This expansion isn’t limited to the realm of decentralized finance alone; recent data underscores a correlated upward trajectory within Tron’s TRX token staking ecosystem. This trend suggests that both DeFi and staking on the Tron blockchain are witnessing increased interest and participation from users and investors, thereby fostering a more robust and dynamic Tron ecosystem. But, there’s more interesting side of the narrative that has provided Tron a major lift. In recent days, Tron has observed a notable uptick in its Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, signifying an increase in the value of assets participating in various activities within the Tron ecosystem. Related Reading: CRV Price Surges 16% – What’s The Next Move For Curve DAO Token?

Total Value Locked is a crucial metric in DeFi, representing the total value of assets locked within a specific DeFi platform or protocol, typically measured in US dollars. It encompasses assets used as collateral, liquidity in trading pools, staked tokens for rewards, and governance participation. TVL is essential for assessing a DeFi project’s health, security, and attractiveness to users and investors, and it plays a vital role in risk evaluation and competition analysis within the DeFi ecosystem. TRON market cap currently at $7.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com TRX Sustains 6% Climb In The Last Week At the time of writing, TRX is trading at $0.088, down a measly 0.1%, but notched a decent 6.0% gain in the last seven days. TRX maintained its remarkable rise on Friday due to an increase in demand for the coin. The token reached its highest point at $0.090 since July 22nd. It is one of the top performing major cryptocurrencies of the year, close to its all-time high of $0.094.

The strong crypto market, with Bitcoin reaching $27,000 and XRP rising to $0.052, also helped TRX price surge. Source: TronScan Meanwhile, TRON’s blockchain has seen significant growth recently.

Ether held in a wallet associated with the FTX accounts drainer began moving for the first time in nearly a year. The funds were split into two, and then a few times in subsequent transactions, with 700 ETH transferred using the Thorchain Router, about 1,200 ETH being moved through the Railgun privacy tool. Another 550 ETH is sitting in an intermediate wallet.  Railgun is a privacy wallet that lets users store tokens and use funds for decentralized financial services, such as lending and borrowing. These transactions are shielded, meaning the exact use of such funds is not known. On the other hand, Thorchain is a bridge that lets users swap tokens between different blockchains.  There is still 12,500 ETH (worth around $21 million at current prices) sitting in the original wallet.  Accounts tied to FTX and FTX US were drained on Nov. 11, 2022, mere hours after the company filed for bankruptcy and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned from the crypto empire he ran. The attacker took over $600 million worth of ether at the time. In a since-deleted tweet, the then FTX general counsel Ryne Miller said the exchange was taking “precautionary steps” to secure funds from other FTX wallets.  John J. Ray III, the CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of the FTX Debtors, which handles the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, later said that $323 million in various tokens were hacked from its international exchange and $90m from its US platform, as per reports.  The attacker(s) who made off with the funds was(were) never identified. Some 21,500 ETH, worth $27 million at the time, were converted into the stablecoin DAI a few days after the hack. Another 288,000 ETH remained in some of the addresses affiliated with the attacker.  Saturday’s transactions come days before Bankman-Fried goes on trial in the U.S. over fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud charges filed by federal prosecutors last December. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though other former FTX and Alameda Research executives have pleaded guilty; some are expected to testify against their former boss.

42409616,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcM7Co,1696036485,"DOJ's Proposed Jury Questions 'Risks Tainting' Bankman-Fried's Panel, Defense Says","Some of the U.S. Department of Justice's proposed juror questions could bias either miss juror biases or prejudice potential jurors into thinking Sam Bankman-Fried was guilty before the trial begins, the FTX founder's defense team charged in a late Friday filing.  ""As a general matter, the Government’s proposed voir dire discourages full disclosure from potential jurors, fails to elicit sufficient information to allow the defense to ascertain potential juror bias, and risks tainting the jury by presenting the allegations in a prejudicial manner,"" attorney Mark Cohen wrote.  Specifically, the defense team believes that omitting the word ""allegedly"" when describing the crimes Bankman-Fried is accused of ""improperly suggests that fraud by Mr. Bankman-Fried is an established fact,"" Cohen wrote. Other questions are too limited and may not reveal if the potential jurors might be predisposed to agreeing with prosecutors just because they're part of the federal government or if they lost money in crypto ""that they believe was the result of wrongdoing.""  Other proposed questions would provide potential jurors with instructions, Cohen wrote.  ""Finally, we specifically object to Question 31, which seeks to elicit irrelevant information,"" he concluded. ""The question asks whether potential jurors or their close friends or relatives have 'ever been stopped or questioned' by law enforcement. This question appears designed to elicit information concerning potential jurors’ encounters with law enforcement and law enforcement practices that disproportionately affect people of color. Neither race nor police misconduct are relevant to the instant case, and this question risks improperly excluding potential jurors on the basis of race.""  The DOJ and defense both proposed voir dire questions to the judge on Sept. 11. Attorneys with the DOJ objected to Bankman-Fried's proposed questions a few days later, saying some of them are ""unnecessarily intrusive"" about the potential jurors' existing thoughts on FTX and its related companies, as well as the case.  Like Friday's filing from the defense, the DOJ objections also alleged that some of the proposed questions seemed designed to prime potential jurors into believing certain defense arguments and otherwise bias them toward Bankman-Fried prior to trial.  Voir dire is set to begin on Oct. 3. CoinDesk asked New Yorkers in lower Manhattan if they'd heard of FTX or Bankman-Fried earlier this month to gauge what a random selection of individuals might say.  As of this writing, a court schedule expects jury selection to last no longer than a day.  In a separate filing earlier on Friday, the defense team said it had no problems with the judge granting immunity to two unnamed witnesses. Judge Kaplan asked if the defense would ask that the witnesses first invoke their Fifth Amendment right to not potentially incriminate themselves first during a hearing on Thursday.

As the anticipation for the next bull market builds, questions arise regarding Bitcoin’s potential future prices. While most predictions are speculative, one analyst has devised a model leveraging historical data to forecast potential tops and bottoms in Bitcoin’s price over time. Bitcoin Price In Previous Cycles Bitcoin's prices changes since 2011. Source: BTCUSDT on TradingView Since its inception, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable growth, rewarding early long-term investors substantially. This price growth is observable in measuring Bitcoin’s prices from the lows to the highs and between the highs of successive bull markets. In 2011, the peak was $33, followed by a peak of $1240 in 2013, reflecting a 3800% increase between peaks. The subsequent peaks in 2017 and 2021 were $20,000 and $69,000, representing increases of 1,600% and 350%, respectively. Comparable levels of increase are also observed when examining the lows of different cycles. Notably, the relative growth between cycles has diminished, possibly due to the increase in Bitcoin’s market capitalization, requiring more substantial capital to influence its price. This diminishing growth aligns with a mathematical pattern known as logarithmic regression. Logarithmic Regression An analyst has devised various logarithmic curves on the Bitcoin chart to forecast Bitcoin’s potential tops and bottoms, utilizing time as the only input. Such models can help investors by offering a straightforward way to see potential market trends and make proactive plans in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Chart of Bitcoin's price in a channel of logistic regression curves.

By the late 2030s, the model begins to break down as predicted tops start falling below the predicted bottoms, potentially indicating a stabilization in Bitcoin’s price post its peak of $750,000-$800,000 Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP Price Receive Boost Following This Coinbase Announcement Final thoughts While models like this offer insightful projections of Bitcoin’s potential future prices, it’s important to acknowledge their limitations and the need for periodic updates with fresh data points. Numerous external factors, including but not limited to regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions, could significantly impact the model’s accuracy. Moreover, the unprecedented nature of Bitcoin’s trajectory, having never endured a recessionary environment, implies a potential susceptibility to more substantial crashes than models might predict.
