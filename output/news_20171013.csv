Speaking with CNBC, Jim Yong Kim said that the technology is ""something everyone is excited about"" – a statement that he followed up with a cautionary argument about cryptocurrencies.  ""[B]lockchain technology is something that everyone is excited about, but we have to remember that bitcoin is one of the very few instances. And the other times when blockchain was used they were basically Ponzi schemes, so it’s very important that if we go forward with it, we're sure that it’s not going to be used to exploit,"" he told the network.  The World Bank – a financial institution that lends money to national governments – is no stranger to blockchain. It launched a blockchain development laboratory this past summer, and has supported research projects that seek to apply the tech in areas like capital formation.  Kim went on to compare cryptocurrencies unfavorably to payment systems like those operated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba  “It takes three seconds, three seconds, to transfer as much as $160,000 to anybody who’s part of the Alibaba network, because they can assess creditworthiness in three seconds,"" he said.

Just a day after declaring on a third-quarter earnings call that he would refrain commenting on the cryptocurrency, the JPMorgan Chase CEO offered a critical take on those investing in bitcoin.  ""If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day,"" he said today at an event hosted by the Institute of International Finance, according to a report from CNBC. During the event, he reportedly voiced support for the cryptocurrency's underlying technology – an area in which the Wall Street bank has undertaken a number of notable efforts, including the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.  Per CNBC, Dimon also reportedly said that he ""could care less about what [price] bitcoin trades at.""  A report from Bloomberg includes additional details about Dimon's latest comments. He reportedly said that bitcoin is ""great"" for criminals, and that – in a refrain from yesterday – that it would be the last time he would comment on the subject.  ""Who cares about bitcoin?"" he was quoted as saying.  The remarks are the latest from Dimon, whose now-infamous comment in September that bitcoin is a ""fraud"" sparked a wave of commentary about bitcoin itself as well as the wider cryptocurrency market. Other Wall Street figures, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and ex-Fortress billionaire Mike Novogratz, have also weighed in on the topic.  His comments also come on the day that bitcoin's price rose above $5,800 to hit a new all-time high.

42427893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bXh,1507919414,At Last? Parity Releases Revised Software Ahead of Ethereum Hard Fork,"Parity, the second-largest provider of ethereum protocol software, has announced its final Byzantium release.  Coming just days before ethereum is to undergo a hard fork to upgrade its underlying blockchain, Parity's release is the latest in four, all of which were found to contain ""consensus bugs"" – or faults in the software that would force network nodes, the computers underlying the blockchain, to split onto a different version of the protocol.  With Parity responsible for maintaining the software that runs nearly a quarter of the nodes on the ethereum blockchain, the delay in releasing code caused panic for some, and even led ethereum's developer team to consider delaying the fork earlier today.  Still, it looks as though the Parity team has rescued the situation with little time to spare – the so-called Bzyandtium hard fork is scheduled for block 4,300,000 (about two days from now according to current metrics).  'Push it back'  Still, while the planned hard fork is generally perceived as beneficial for the network, the ongoing bugs have damaged some people's confidence in the coming change.  Voicing this concern on social media, one user said: “The Silicon Valley philosophy of 'fail fast' is not suited, in my opinion, to permissionless blockchains where millions of dollars are at stake.”  Other users urged ethereum to delay the hard fork, stating:  ""Push it back, make sure there are no errors guys. This is worth it. Don't rush.""  Responding to this request, Parity developer Afri Schoedon said that although the client's team considered proposing a delay, it would be more complicated due to the work that's already been done in an attempt to execute it.  For example, to move the Byzantium hard fork to a later date, all software clients would have to issue augmented releases containing a new hard fork number.  Schoedon summarized:  ""Pushing a fix for one client implementation is easier than pushing an update containing the delay for all clients, especially if this happens on such a short notice.""  Going forward, Schoedon framed the last-minute panic as a good lesson for the ethereum platform, arguing it's safer to implement a hard fork block number only after the client implementations have been prepared and properly tested.  Testing the code  All ethereum releases are subject to a test process called ""fuzzing,"" which involves clashing code against itself until a fault shows up. It's a thorough process, one that manages to reveal tiny exploits that wouldn’t be obvious otherwise.  With this in mind, it’s possible that Parity could continue to demonstrate similar problems going forward that will carry directly into the Byzantium blockchain.  And while the bugs are hard to spot, it's not unimaginable they could be identified by malicious agents bent on attacking the chain (ethereum isn’t without its enemies).  This is evidenced by the ongoing attacks on the ethereum test network Ropsten, where for no material profit, a lone attacker consistently spammed the platform in the run up to the hard fork, causing developers to move to a private testnet.  With all this in mind, it's highly unlikely that Parity could carry these problems into the Byzantium hard fork. According to the startup, an announcement is forthcoming that will include more details about testing and features.

42427902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bth,1507916751,"Basecoin Revealed: A16z, MetaStable Seek Crypto Holy Grail With Stable Token","An all-star cast of investors has backed a little-known startup behind a token called basecoin.  Scheduled to debut with a white paper release on Tuesday, the project, the first from Intangible Labs, boasts investors including 1confirmation, Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Digital Currency Group, MetaStable Capital, Pantera Capital and PolyChain Capital.  Hailed as an evolution of the ""stablecoin"" concept, basecoin is lauded by investors for its unique approach to what's been called the ""holy grail"" of cryptocurrency – a digital asset able to keep its value free from volatility. A draft white paper obtained by CoinDesk details the concept, which outlines a blockchain with the built-in ""brains"" to manage monetary policy.  At a high level, the idea is that the basecoin protocol can be pegged to the value of any asset or basket of assets, dynamically adjusting its market price through the creative use of a combination of tokens.  As explained in the white paper, the idea is that the protocol would be set up to mirror an asset or an index, say the U.S. dollar or the Consumer Price Index, at which point it would use oracles (links to trusted, external data sources) to monitor exchange rates. The protocol would then automatically expand or contract its supply of tokens to maintain its value.  Polychain's Ryan Zurrer hailed it as an ""elegant system,"" with other investors heralding that the idea could have both short and long-term implications – in the near-term, providing an alternative to fiat currencies for crypto traders, and in the long run, serving as a tool for maintaining the stability offered by today's centralized monetary systems.  The former problem was one addressed by Joey Krug, the founder of Augur and a Pantera partner, who spoke to how basecoin could ease issues he's faced as a developer.  ""One of the problems this space faces is volatility; no one is going to want to use Augur if you're right about a prediction, and the price of the reward goes down overnight,"" he told CoinDesk.  Indeed, Intangible Labs founder Nader Al-Naji, who quit his job at Google in July to pursue the project, described stability as the main benefit the protocol would bring to the market.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are a bit of a playground for speculation, and that speculation is undermining cryptocurrency use as money. The fact that it's volatile and that there's speculative value is a blocker to mainstream adoption. We tell people we're trying to be used as medium of exchange.""  In this way, the cryptocurrency project is notable given the extent to which the basecoin team – comprised of Al-Naji, as well as fellow Princeton graduates Lawrence Diao and Josh Chen – draw inspiration from traditional finance.  ""Basecoin would present the world with both the technology and the opportunity to develop an independent, transparent and potentially more stable monetary policy than anything that's ever been possible via central bank,"" the white paper reads.  According to Al-Naji, the company has still to determine how it would launch the protocol – namely, if individual protocols would be needed for each stablecoin, or if a single version of the blockchain could manage many different types of fixed-cost assets.  Either way, investors are keen on a share of the coins, in whichever version they appear. Intangible Labs is said to have completed a small and highly competitive capital raise, and will soon be opening a pre-sale of its coin.  An original version of its draft white paper indicated the startup is also considering an initial coin offering (ICO) as part of its release, though those involved declined further details.  Three tokens in one  But, that's not to say any sale would even be limited to a single cryptocurrency.  As outlined in the white paper, basecoin aims to differentiate from past iterations of the stablecoin concept by using a combination of tokens to replace the centralized management that has been needed to maintain their stability.  The basecoin team, for example, took aim at Tether in its paper, itself recently the subject of criticism for fluctuations in its U.S. dollar peg. ""Tether’s $400 million market cap proves the need, but it is also completely incapable of serving it long term,"" the paper asserts.  Most interesting about the critiques, though, is that the basecoin team offers what appears to be a novel take on how a better system could be achieved.  Namely, to regulate the supply of its tokens, the basecoin protocol itself is made aware of the market capitalization of its cryptocurrency, the demand for the coin and the number of coins in circulation. Further – as the different tokens are used to offer different incentives – they seek to naturally create an equilibrium that keeps the price stable.  The first – basecoin – is the cryptocurrency that powers the system. Pegged 1-to-1 with the value of the U.S. dollar, it serves as the most user-facing of the three tokens, in that it's the one exchange traders and other users would interact most directly with.  The second and third cryptocurrencies, ""base bonds"" and ""base shares,"" are those that underpin basecoin. Base bonds are tokens to be auctioned off programmatically by the blockchain when supply needs to be reduced, and these will expire within a time frame to encourage redemption.  ""When you buy a bond you pay for it with coins, which get taken out of circulation, decreasing supply. And the reason why you like that bond is that it converts back into coin at some point in the future. You're hoping in the future you'll get back a return on what you put in, you want your coin principal plus some coin interest,"" Al-Naji explained.  Base shares, on the other hand, provide a fixed-supply cryptocurrency that does not have a peg.  Rather, they gain value through a dividend policy, whereby holders receive new basecoins that are created if and when the token supply needs to be increased.  Work to go  As for how these coins will be managed, however, that remains less clear.  Al-Naji said that the team is now working on a ""yellow paper"" that he estimates is about ""80 percent"" complete and that will detail the technical specifications of the basecoin blockchain, including aspects such as how mining will function and how consensus will be reached.  In contrast, Al-Naji framed the three different tokens that will underpin the protocol are more mature in ideation. Going forward, he said that the team is also working on a ""robustness analysis"" that will showcase the conditions under which the tokens can be expected to maintain their desired stability.  ""You can think of this as economic research. It aims to prove this actually works and that the pegs stays put no matter what under the assumptions,"" he said. ""That's really mature.""  Still, taken together, Al-Naji was keen to portray the project as not simply another token built amidst the recent ICO craze. Al-Naji said that he has been studying bitcoin since 2012, when he began considering how to apply monetary theory to the technology.  The end result, he said, is a sophisticated take on how public distributed ledgers and tokens could come to replace some of the more advanced aspects of the current monetary system, which he framed as corrupt due to human error.  ""The key thing that we're doing is that there's no central authority. This is totally decentralized, even the exchange rate is decentralized via oracles, which makes it extremely difficult to corrupt the supply of money. It's a much more robust way to do the policy,"" he said.  Forward thinking  Given these weaknesses, the authors go so far as to predict basecoin could ""displace U.S. dollars in transaction volume"" due to the fact that it would (in a sense) leverage the Federal Reserve's work on maintaining a stable asset to bootstrap its value.  It also projects that, should its peg prove reliable, the protocol could be used for ""salaries, loans, futures contracts, options contracts and more.""  Far from far-fetched, the authors believe they are likely to find a large market of cryptocurrency traders eager to act as early adopters, which will provide an onramp into other markets.  In line with criticisms about the sector from thought leaders, the authors think basecoin could one day even be adaptable to serve a similar function as central banks.  The paper concludes:  ""In this future world, governments would do well to support cryptocurrencies that are stable in the face of macroeconomic upheaval. In fact, citizens may even demand it.""

Planned to come into effect from January 2018, the new rules will cover any commercial use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a means to store and transmit value. While this would include cryptocurrency exchanges, the word ""value"" is also defined as including ""assets, holdings, or other forms of ownership, rights or interests."" Investment services (and other controlled financial offerings) connected to the tech would be covered as well.  Under the framework, DLT service providers will be granted a working license, providing they conform to some regulatory principles.  As defined by the paper, these principles include honesty, integrity, the protection of customer assets and maintaining a high degree of cybersecurity. And once the rulings are accepted by Gibraltar's legislature, the British Overseas Territory will be among the few jurisdictions worldwide to offer a fully regulated framework for firms working with blockchain.  Speaking to the Gibraltar Chronicle, minister of commerce Albert Isola said that this was typical of the countries determination to facilitate innovation while maintain a strong regulatory presence. He said: ""We have done this before and will do so again.""  Samantha Barrass, chief executive of the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, said:  ""This regulatory framework demonstrates that regulators can keep up to date with technology without stifling innovation, protect consumers and create a well-regulated safe environment in which financial technology can flourish.""  Earlier this year  , the country's primary securities exchange, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSE), revealed a plan to integrate blockchain into its trading and settlement systems.  And, last month, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission issued an investor warning on initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Ether's Price Is Climbing Ahead of Tech Upgrade,"Ether prices are up 11 percent so far today, indicating increasing market confidence that ethereum may sail through its next big upgrade.  The ""Byzantium"" code, which is a part of the larger upgrade called ""Metropolis,"" will be enforced this Sunday via a hard fork of the ethereum blockchain. Though past hard forks have been mostly smooth, an emergency hard fork last year saw some continue to mine the old blockchain, creating a new asset, ethereum classic, and some users and firms lost funds in the event.  So far, however, developers have indicated that they are confident the hard fork will be activated without issue – and traders seem to agree.  At press time, ether is trading at around $340 levels. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 10.7 percent, while month-on-month, ether is enjoying 23 percent gains.  The price action analysis suggests ether could scale new multi-week highs and possibly extend the rally up to the September high ahead of the hard fork.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows that:  The upside break of the sideways channel (i.e. consolidation ends with a strong upside move) signals continuation of the rally from the Sept. 15 low of $298.29.  The bullish break on the relative strength index (RSI) validates the bullish break on the price chart.  All major averages – 50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA – are perfectly aligned one below the other in favor of the bulls.  View  Ether looks set to test September high of $396 in the short run.  On the downside, only a break below the 50-day moving average level of $307 would abort the bullish view on the daily chart.

At press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,610 levels, as per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin's week-on-week performance of over 28 percent (up more than $1,200,) is double S&P's year-to-date gains of 14 percent.  Further, the cryptocurrency is up 96 percent from its Sept. 15 low of $2,980, and, on a year-to-date basis, is up almost 500 percent.  Following a rally of such astonishing proportions, it would be quite logical to assume bitcoin prices will trade sideways, or witness a healthy pull-back in the short run  The price action analysis indicates that bitcoin could find a short-term top in the range of $5,800-$6,000.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows that:  Bitcoin's price suffers a corrective pull back every time the stochastic and the relative strength index (RSI) signal overbought conditions (marked by hand sign and red circles on the chart). The stochastic oscillator is a chart analysis indicator that helps determine where a trend might be ending.  The trend line drawn from the July 16 low and Aug. 22 low and extended further is seen offering resistance around $6,100 levels.  Though overbought, the RSI is still rising. Meanwhile, the stochastic is looking to retreat from the overbought territory.  A technical correction would gather pace once the RSI starts losing altitude.

42427895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bbh,1507892445,No Token Response: UNICEF Is Open to Doing Its Own ICO,"So-called token sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs) are getting a nod of approval from an unlikely source.  Revealed in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. program tasked with providing assistance to children around the globe, said this week it would be open to exploring how it could issue custom cryptocurrencies, either to further its mission or the goals of its partners.  While it might seem surprising that an organization like UNICEF would make such bold claims, it's actually consistent with the organization's drive to position itself as a leader in blockchain.  From making its first blockchain investment this year to exploring the creation of an investment fund backed by cryptocurrency, the UN agency has embarked on a widespread effort to utilize the nascent technology.  The co-founder of UNICEF Ventures, Chris Fabian, said the humanitarian and developmental children's aid organization is open to following the blockchain wherever it leads.  Fabian, who was previously the senior advisor on innovation to the executive office of the U.N. secretary-general, told CoinDesk:  ""If we are in a place to look at designing our own token, look at others to help design theirs in a way that we can be a part of, and potentially also have a crypto-denominated investment fund, those would all be things that would be on our roadmap for the near future.""  Far from a passing fancy, Fabian framed this outlook as part of a sophisticated two-prong investment thesis driving UNICEF's blockchain work.  First, Fabian said the venture capital arm of UNICEF is being run like a traditional investment arm, and therefore, has an obligation to build a profitable portfolio. And second, and perhaps more interesting in how it aligns with the organization's possible ICO, is the company's emphasis on learning how to utilize blockchains itself.  Eyes on ethereum  To that end, UNICEF's work has largely focused on open-source public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, the latter of which, through its ERC-20 standard is responsible for the recent influx of ICO tokens. The organization began accepting ethereum donations to its own ethereum address in August as part of a study on smart contracts and has raised about $600-worth of ether at current prices.  UNICEF is now running what Fabian believes is the first public ethereum node managed within the U.N., and this is primarily a mechanism to learn more about the tech.  ""We're using that because we think it's important for our team to understand [ethereum smart contract language] Solidity and kind of have a sense of what an ERC token looks like, how that would work,"" Fabian said.  Under the guidance of their first blockchain lead, Qusai Jouda – who previously designed software for wellness startup Lighter – UNICEF has developed a series of curricula on blockchain generally and ICOs specifically.  Previous classes have focused on what Fabian calls ""the less speculative token work that's being done,"" such as the one-off reconnaissance being carried out by the World Bank and U.S. State Department.  But UNICEF's classes aren't just for beginners. Rather, they're primarily designed to explore whether the venture firm could ""invest in companies that would provide a crypto return,"" thereby providing better liquidity on investments.  Seeking startups  ICO or not, UNICEF is already starting to build out a network of blockchain startups to invest in. Last November, the agency invested $99,000 in South Africa-based TrustLab, which is building identity and social development tools with blockchain.  Then, earlier this year, UNICEF became a founding partner in the IXO Foundation, a spin-off of the protocol design part of TrustLab aimed at making the vast amounts of data that could flow through a blockchain more easily measurable.  ""If it works as expected,"" Fabian said, ""we hope that [UNICEF] would have a protocol that we might be able to apply to other parts of our work at UNICEF for monetizing some of the collection of data that we do.""  Currently, UNICEF's investments are limited to $100,000, though it has raised $12.6 million to invest from limited partners including the governments of Denmark and Finland, and public conglomerates like Disney.  According to Fabian, UNICEF is in the final stages of putting out a call for blockchain startups, and expects to fund as many as 10 of them, bringing the maximum amount invested to over $1 million.  Fabian said:  ""We believe that a lot of the places where this particular technology can be applied to global scale come out exclusively when you have the public, permissionless blockchains.""

42427899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bjh,1507888845,History Repeated? Confidence High Ethereum Will Avoid Blockchain Split,"""There is no reason to believe that this one will be controversial.""  Just days away from making one of its biggest-ever upgrades, confidence is high among ethereum supporters that the world's second-largest blockchain will avoid past mistakes and successfully navigate a coming change to its codebase, projected for Sunday night.  ""I expect that nothing will happen,"" Ethereum Foundation developer and designer Alex Van de Sande told CoinDesk. ""Nothing happened with previous hard forks, except for one.""  Packing together a series of upgrades designed to make ethereum lighter, faster and more private, the update, called Byzantium, will be enacted at block 4,370,000 on the ethereum blockchain. Yet, it's how the change will be enacted – using a hard fork – that has some mindful of possible issues.  A common (yet sometimes controversial) strategy for upgrading blockchains, ethereum has gone through three hard forks without complication. Still, the memory of the fork that didn't go to plan is still top of mind.  Last summer, an emergency hard fork saw a contingent of the community continue mining on the old blockchain, creating a new asset, ethereum classic. In the aftermath, some users and companies lost funds, while ethereum was suddenly faced with a competing alternative in the market.  General optimism  That said, most users and developers are embracing this particular hard fork, in part, because it aims to execute changes that have been etched into ethereum's roadmap since the protocol launched in 2015. When contacted, developers largely agreed with this outlook, expressing excitement by the changes to be included in the upgrade.  Stephen King, the principal and co-founder of ethereum-based real estate app RexMLS, parroted Van de Sande's optimism, emphasizing the successful testing that has been completed.  ""The fork is pretty uneventful. Everything went smooth on Ropsten, and it appears like all else is on track for a healthy transition,"" he told CoinDesk.  Ropsten is ethereum's test network, and although the network suffered a spam attack, making transactions impossible and moving some developers to a private testnet, overall, developers said everything moved along as expected. The team was even able to verify a transaction using the technology behind privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, a mechanism which was added to the Byzantium roadmap earlier this summer.  And this possibility of private transactions and smart contracts is something many, including King, are particularly enthusiastic about.  Van de Sande stressed the privacy implications as well, arguing that additions that accommodate the technology underlying zcash are the most user-facing upgrade in the mix.  ""It's cool if you think about the new possibilities,"" he said, painting a picture of a blockchain voting app with privacy built in, shielding who voted for which candidate.  That said, Byzantium is a ""very technical fork,"" said Van de Sande. Most of the changes, he contends, will be difficult to grasp for users, but a relief for developers who will have more options for building applications on top of ethereum.  Rumblings of opposition  But while, for the most part, the changes aren't controversial, one ethereum improvement protocol (EIP) has generated some controversy over the past several months.  By reducing how much ether is issued in each block, the EIP has the potential to reduce mining profits, and, as is to be expected, some miners aren't too happy about it. At least one visible protest movement, called Etherite, has sprung up in response, and its lead developer Dylan Young believes the changes could turn off miners driven by profit.  ""The problem is that there are a lot of miners and pools who solely mine for the revenue and do not actually know what they are contributing to,"" Young said, adding that some miners he talked to are ""completely unaware"" of the changes.  Others, he said, felt that they had ""no choice"" over the block reward reduction.  A representative from mining pool Nanopool, representing about 9 percent of the ethereum hashrate, seemed to concur. ""Block reward is a secondary issue, that is under control of Ethereum Foundation. Let's be honest. Ethereum history is written by developers and investors, not by miners now,"" the representative said.  Still, they didn't seem very interested in the debate, arguing that the benefits and drawbacks of these economic changes are ""hard to predict.""  Further, Etherite doesn't seem to be gaining much momentum, with only one Reddit post and one GitHub contributor. And the mining pool operators that responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment were not interested in joining the movement.  One possible reason for this, according to Van de Sande, is that really most miners understand that while Byzantium will reduce each block reward from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, the change also boosts how often those blocks are created, giving miners more chance to earn the reward.  With that, Van de Sande argued, miners should still make about the same amount of money as they did before the fork.  The difficulty bomb  But even if there was substantial dissent, Young seems right about one thing: miners don't have much choice.  And that's because ethereum developers have built in a so-called ""difficulty bomb"" – a piece of code that gradually slows down the rate that ethereum blocks are issued on its blockchain in order to convince users to move over to a new chain.  So, even if miners continue to mine the old version of ethereum, they'll be economically disincentivized to keep doing so.  Van de Sande said:  ""If they continue to mine it, the fork will die on its own.""  And this trick of sorts is one reason why Young is concerned that miners aren't getting enough say in the decision. At least, not as much say as they got during The DAO fork, where miners were polled as a way to vote on the measure.  ""This time miners were excluded from the decision,"" Young said.  Young argued EIP 649 should be split off into a separate hard fork so ""people can assess it on its own merits.""  ""I think that a controversial change should stand on its own,"" he continued.  Though it's worth noting that others, such as Bitfly founder and CEO Peter Pratscher, operator of ethereum's mining pool Ethpool, don't see it that way. ""Our miners have not yet asked us to organize a vote up to now,"" he remarked.  Either way, with less than three days to go before the hard fork executes, it's unlikely Young, and any potential supporters will get to debate the argument.

On Oct. 12, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published an application for a ""Method to Assure Correct Data Traversal Through a Particular Path of a Network."" The document outlines a way to transfer data from one point to another using a specific path through a Service Function Chain (SFC).  The patent also describes how a blockchain could be used to track the data to ensure it follows the correct path and arrives at the proper endpoint, thus improving the SFC's reliability.  As the document explains:  ""According to an embodiment, a blockchain platform is provided to assure the sequence of processing for the data packet(s) received from the network. In this particular case, each transaction entering the network architecture (e.g. the SFC architecture) is used to create a block of the blockchain platform that is aggregated in the chain and replicated in a decentralized peer-to-peer architecture comprising a plurality of nodes, wherein each Service Function Path (SFP) of the network architecture comprises a node.""  A major supplier of telecommunications services, Telefonica has an interest in maintaining the integrity of data. The company operates across the globe, and is ranked 153 on the Fortune Global 500 list of companies.  In the application, the company explains that traditional, non-SFC systems are dependent on a network's underlying infrastructure, arguing that this restricts how much information can be sent and how it is delivered.  Non-SFC architectures do provide a high level of reliability and ensure data is sent, however. On the other hand, SFC architectures are independent of the network's design, but at the same time, they can't reliably prove that data being sent is arriving at its destination.  To counteract this flaw, Telefonica outlined a plan to provide each data packet with a unique identifier. Every time a packet is transferred, the transaction is logged. If implemented using blockchain technology, those transactions are logged in each new block on the ledger.

42427897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bfh,1507881611,Swift Blockchain Success Sets Stage for Sibos,"Once considered perhaps the largest middleman at risk of being disrupted by blockchain, Swift took a notable step today toward becoming a disruptor.  Revealed on the eve of its largest annual event, Sibos, the inter-bank platform, along with six banks including BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo, has deemed its flagship blockchain trial a success from both a technical and business perspective. First announced in January, the proof-of-concept tested whether moving funds stored in nostro-vostro accounts for international transactions to a blockchain could free up those funds to further investment.  But in spite of the PoC achieving multiple objectives, Swift says there's still a long way to go before implementation, primarily since its 11,000 members will not benefit equally from the project  In conversation, Swift's head of R&D Damien Vanderveken explained that some banks that have invested heavily in traditional, centralized solutions for nostro-vostro accounts are already experiencing efficiency gains, and as such might not be as keen to invest in a blockchain-based solution.  Vanderveken told CoinDesk:  ""The PoC demonstrated that it can fulfill the requirements. The business value depends on the level of automation of the participants. We will need to make sure for the final solution that we take care of the different levels of investment.""  As a result, instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, Vanderveken said each Swift member will eventually have to analyze the value offered by blockchain and weigh it against the costs of implementation.  Benefits of blockchain  Built as part of Swift's Global Payments Innovation initiative (GPI) within its newly revealed DLT sandbox, the PoC uses the open-source Hyperledger Fabric platform to test two main applications.  The first used real, anonymized production data from each of the banks to provide ""the account owner and the account servicer a complete view of all the nostro-vostro accounts that they own or serve,"" Vanderveken said.  The second simulated back-office procedures, which gave the participants a node hosted in the cloud to test the benefits of moving funds from multiple accounts to a single distributed ledger.  These two applications provided users not only increased visibility of and access to available funds, but also simplified the reconciliation process, which uses Swift's ISO 20022 standard.  ""The feedback from everybody is unanimous,"" said Vanderveken. ""What we have built in terms of applications actually does meet the requirements.""  Technical limitations  While the nostro-vostro blockchain PoC was deemed a success, Swift also noted several limitations.  In particular, Vanderveken said Swift is concerned about the possibility that cryptographic security could be hacked with quantum computers. A technology still in the proverbial petri dish, the thought has pushed Swift to create a ""hybrid architecture,"" where some transaction components were distributed on a blockchain, while others were ""operated by a neutral third-party.""  At the top of the list for the latter was the identification of participants, or as Swift described it earlier this month in a paper jointly written by BCG Financial, ""a universally trusted global KYC registry.""  For businesses like Swift, which operate in permissioned systems, this is considered a crucial security feature.  Vanderveken said:  ""If you want to ensure data confidentiality, and you don't want to rely solely on encryption — which is prone to failure in the long run as encryption becomes hacked by technology progress — you need to have solutions where data is then segregated.""  Swell for Sibos?  This successful test of Swift's blockchain PoC is particularly notable leading up to the Sibos conference in Toronto, since the financial incumbent has stiff competition with distributed ledger startup Ripple hosting a competing event called Swell.  Twice during Sibos, Swift will demo the PoC in front of a live audience. But while participants (of both events) perform their own cost-benefit analysis of blockchain, the second phase of Swift's POC will already be underway.  Since Sept. 27 financial institutions — including ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase — have been validating the PoC results, with a final decision expected by the end of year.  But one thing is certain, Vanderveken said Swift only intends to move forward in implementing the new technology if its members benefit.  He said:  ""We need to take care of the differences of the various banks to make sure such a solution is successful.""

42427926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bZh,1507854617,PBoC Digital Currency Director Calls for Centralized State Cryptocurrency,"China may not recognize bitcoin as a legal currency, but it seems to have a clear vision for a state-issued alternative.  At a meeting hosted by the International Telecommunication Union this week, Yao Qian, the Director of the Digital Currency Research Institute under the People's Bank of China, reportedly boasted about the potential of a state-owned digital currency, while suggesting that there is an inherent lack of value anchoring public cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  According to a report by Yicai, Yao also framed a state-issued digital currency as a way to stabilize domestic fiat currency, while better securing country's financial status.  Although the publication made clear Yao's comments reflected his own opinions, the remarks nonetheless reveal how the country may choose to direct the future development of digital currency.  Yao told attendees:  ""The value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin primarily comes from the market speculation. It will be a disaster to recoganize it as a real currency. And the lack of a value anchroing inherently determines that bitcoin can never be a real one.""  Launched by China's central bank in June this year, the Digital Currency Research Institute focuses on R&D related to blockchain-based digital currency. Currently head of the institute, Yao also served as the deputy director of PBoC's technology department.  Pointed barbs  Elsewhere, Qian had more criticism for public cryptocurrencies.  In yet another statement, he was quoted as saying that the deflationary nature of economic systems utilizing the technology could be a hinderance to their success. ""A total cap of 21 million like bitcoin whose current supply also halves every four years is actually driving backward along the currency evolution,"" he said.  Yao went on to argue that a state-owned digital currency, however, creates tangible economic values and helps stabilize the market position of fiat currencies.  ""The nature of a state-owned digital currency is a government liability issued to the public,"" he said. ""And it's backed by the sovereign credibility.""  Yet, Yao takes a different approach from current trials of other central banks' cryptocurrency projects that focus on the distributed ledger technology.  Citing the RSCoin design concept by the Bank of England as a promising example, Yao argued that such state-owned digital currency should not be confined by the ideology of the blockchain and DLT.  ""RSCoin pictures a system that is controlled by the central bank,"" he said. ""The role of central banks may not just be deciding how much to supply but also designing the rule of the supplying algorithm.""
