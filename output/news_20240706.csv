Miner capitulation occurs when miners scale back operations or sell part of their mined Bitcoin and reserves either to sustain themselves or to “earn yield or hedge their Bitcoin exposure.” In recent times, as Bitcoin’s price declined by 13% from $68,791 to $59,603 over the last month, signs of capitulation have become more evident.

Analyst Predicts Further Crash To $47,000","Although Bitcoin has reclaimed the $56,000 price level in the past few hours, its sudden drop below $54,000 on July 5 has reminded investors of the intense volatility associated with the market. In the larger timeframe, Bitcoin has been down by 7% and 20.25% in the past seven and thirty days, respectively. While many crypto traders and analysts are still in the spirit of a bullish cycle in the long term, the sudden price drop wasn’t surprising to some. Notably, crypto trader @TheFlowHorse revealed that the drop to $53,000 resonated with his target of $52,000. Similarly, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, noted the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $47,000. Bitcoin Could Crash To $47,000 According to Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is still in a bull market in the larger timeframe, which will continue until early 2025. This school of thought resonates with many other price outlooks for Bitcoin, especially in the long term. Despite this bullish projection, market participants are currently struggling with short-term bearish conditions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins As Ki Young Ju noted, this uncertainty opens up the possibility of the world’s leading digital currency plummeting to a chilling $47,000 before finding its footing again. With the crypto market in a prolonged slump since the beginning of June, this bearish case scenario seems increasingly plausible. Bitcoin, in particular, has shed billions in value, and investor confidence is wavering. $112K at the peak of the cycle.https://t.co/beKpUVkNXL pic.twitter.com/Esj02BYms4 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 5, 2024 Young Ju admonishes traders not to open high-leverage long or short positions based on his long-term bullish projections due to the prevailing uncertainty. When asked what his long-term price target for Bitcoin was, he noted a rise to $112,000 at the peak of the cycle. This prediction is based on the BTC realized market cap since July 2010. Bearish Case For Bitcoin At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $56,520 and has rebounded by 4.67% since its recent fall below $54,000. However, despite this price recovery, the crypto faces a significant risk of falling further amid whale selloffs, which have amounted to over $1.7 billion in BTC in the past 30 days. Defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox is also starting to repay its creditors in BTC after 10 years of inactivity. This is anticipated to unleash a $2.71 billion supply of Bitcoin onto the market, perhaps intensifying selling pressure.

30544483,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628230,1720299629,LayerZero On The Rise: ZRO Bullish Momentum Points To New Highs,"LayerZero (ZRO) is currently experiencing strong bullish momentum, positioning itself for potential new highs in the future. This sustained upward trend indicates growing investor confidence and increased market interest in the platform’s capabilities. As ZRO continues to gain traction, technical indicators suggest that this momentum could drive the price to unprecedented levels. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this movement, anticipating further gains and strategic opportunities as LayerZero pushes toward new market peaks. This article delves into providing an in-depth analysis of ZRO’s current bullish momentum and its potential to reach new highs. By examining current price performance and technical indicators, this article seeks to provide strategic advice for investors looking to capitalize on ZRO’s potential growth. ZRO was trading at around $4.15 and was up by 36.66% with a market capitalization of over $456 million and a trading volume of over $816 million as of the time of writing. There has been a 24-hour increase of 36.62% and 152.75% in ZRO’s market capitalization and trading volume respectively. Analyzing The Current Bullish Trend Of ZRO A technical analysis of ZRO’s price action on the 1-hour chart reveals that the crypto asset is actively bullish and trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Since facing rejection at the $2.69 support level, ZRO has been consistently bullish and is currently attempting to break above the $4.28 resistance level. The formation of the 1-hour William alligator signals that the price of ZRO may continue to extend its bullish trend as both the alligator lip and teeth are currently trending above the jaw after a successful cross above it. On the 4-hour chart, it can be observed that ZRO is actively bullish. Although the price is attempting a short-term pullback by dropping a bearish candlestick, the crypto asset may extend its bullishness in the long run. Additionally, the 4-hour William alligator indicates more bearishness for ZRO as both the alligator lip and teeth are actively trending above the jaw after moving above it. ZRO Price Forecast Analyzing potential future possibilities of ZRO’s price movement reveals that if the digital asset breaks above the $4.28 resistance level, it may move higher to challenge its all-time high of $5.62. If this level is breached, ZRO might move on to create a new all-time high.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge Meme Coin Mania Meets Market Mayhem WIF, the token powering Dogwifhat, saw its price plummet 15% in just 24 hours. This dramatic drop erased all the gains from a recent rebound rally. The sell-off wasn’t isolated to Dogwifhat; the entire crypto market experienced a double-digit tumble, with major altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano feeling the heat. Analysts point to a combination of factors behind the downturn, including renewed concerns about inflation and a recent sell-off by the German government and Mt. Gox, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange. The price of $WIF dropped 15% as the market fell. A whale deposited 900K $WIF($1.64M) to #Bybit 10 hours ago, leaving 974K $WIF($1.76M).https://t.co/qJwlxcWy15 pic.twitter.com/amIkvwKfNG — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2024 The pain for Dogwifhat was further amplified by a whale of a different kind: a large investor. LookOnChain, a blockchain whale tracking agency, identified a major Solana whale dumping 900,000 WIF tokens in a series of transactions. This fire sale, amounting to roughly $1.64 million, undoubtedly contributed to the downward spiral. Dogfight On Derivatives: Bulls Trampled, Bears Feast While the Spot market witnessed a bloodbath, the WIF derivatives market displayed a curious mix of activity. Trading volume surged by a surprising 25%, propelling Dogwifhat to the coveted title of third most-demanded meme coin behind Dogecoin and Pepe Token. This surge in volume might suggest increased interest, but a closer look reveals a different story. Lurking beneath the surface was a brutal battle between bullish and bearish investors. More than $3 million in WIF positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. This liquidation primarily targeted long positions, meaning investors who bet on the price going up were forced to sell at a loss as the price plummeted. While some might see the increased volume as a sign of potential revival, the liquidation figures paint a starker picture – many bulls got trampled by the bears feasting on the market downturn. A Buying Opportunity Or A Boneheaded Move? Despite the carnage, not everyone has lost faith in Dogwifhat. The plummeting price has attracted some opportunistic “Solana whales” who view the current price as an attractive entry point. This glimmer of hope hinges on the possibility that Dogwifhat can recapture its past glory. Related Reading: Buy The Dip? XRP Whales Doing Exactly That – Is A Price Rally Next? In Q1 2024, Dogwifhat was a meme coin darling, riding the wave of the meme coin craze to a $4 billion market cap and a place in the top 30 global crypto rankings. However, the recent downturn serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility of meme coins, which often lack the utility or strong fundamentals of established cryptocurrencies. The future of Dogwifhat remains uncertain. Whether it can claw its way back from the doghouse or fade into obscurity depends on several factors, including broader market trends, community support, and potential developments within the Dogwifhat ecosystem.

The financial expert has maintained a strong bullish position for the future of the industry, outlining several reasons why he believes the market will jump 44X from its current market capitalization. Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge Crypto Market To Hit $100 Trillion Market Cap In a recent YouTube interview on the Blockworks Macro channel, Pal predicted that the total market capitalization of the crypto industry could jump from $2.5 trillion to $100 trillion in less than a decade. The financial expert disclosed that if the market maintains a steady growth rate and continues to evolve at a rapid pace, then it could see its market capitalization surging by up to 44X. In an earlier post on X (formerly Twitter), Pal disclosed that assets like cryptocurrency and technology perform extremely well during secular trends based on adoption. He highlighted that this growth rate was twice the speed of the internet’s adoption when comparing active wallets and IP addresses. The analyst has based his $100 trillion crypto market capitalization on the rate of adoption of the crypto industry, highlighting that the increasing number of cryptocurrency users will have a massive impact on the market’s value. Additionally, in the interview, Pal advised against taking unnecessary investment risks when engaging in cryptocurrencies. He disclosed that the goal should be to maximize investment opportunities without getting caught up in tribal or philosophical debates. He emphasized that with the cryptocurrency market potentially reaching a $100 trillion market capitalization, it’s unnecessary to take excessive investment risks. Instead, investors should balance risk and opportunity, utilizing the right portfolio management strategies to effectively capture the majority of the market gains. Market Liquidity May Continue Into 2025 During the YouTube interview, Pal forecasted that the current market liquidity cycle could extend into 2025. The Real Vision CEO disclosed that since 2008, there has been a notable cyclicality in global liquidity. Diving into the nuances of what he calls “The Everything Code,” Pal revealed that the current market cycle is significantly driven by the growth of market assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency and technology. He noted that the market was shifting towards a “Macro Summer,” marked by liquidity growth and often associated with the “Banana Zone.” According to Pal, the banana zone is a period of significant upward price movements where market indicators turn bullish signaling the start of a new bull run.

The financial expert emphasized that the global liquidity cycle tends to have a predictable pattern which influences economic activities.

His analysis has provided reassurance that the flagship crypto is still far from a market top despite its recent decline to new lows this week. Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge When Will Bitcoin Peak In This Bull Run Rekt Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could peak in this cycle sometime in mid-September or mid-October 2025 if history were to repeat itself. The analyst noted that Bitcoin peaked 518 days after the halving event during the 2017 bull run and 546 days after the halving event during the 2021 bull run. Based on this, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin’s market top in this bull could occur between 518 and 546 days after the halving event, which happened earlier in April. This timeline puts the projected peak for Bitcoin sometime in September or October next year. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital again alluded to the fact that Bitcoin was accelerating in this cycle by 260 days earlier this year. However, that is no longer the case thanks to the over three-month consolidation period the flagship crypto has experienced since the halving event. Rekt Capital claimed that the rate of acceleration has “drastically dropped and is now approximately 150 days.” He added that Bitcoin will likely resynchronize with the traditional halving cycle the longer it consolidates. The crypto analyst has also refused to be deterred by Bitcoin’s current price action, which some claim suggests that the bull run is over. However, Rekt Capital has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin will retrace deep enough to convince anyone that the bull run is over, and then it will continue its uptrend. In another X post, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin’s downtrend, which began last month, is one to watch for a major trend shift. The analyst remarked that a break of the “multi-week downtrend would result in the beginning of at least a multi-week uptrend” for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin is now trading at $56,693. Chart: TradingView ‘This Is Not The Cycle Top Vibes’ Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also believes that the cycle top isn’t in yet despite Bitcoin’s recent decline, stating that this price action “is not the cycle top vibes.” The analyst also said that Bitcoin’s current sell-off bottom might be closer than everyone thinks and noted that this scenario played out in the third quarter of 2023 when most people thought it was over. Related Reading: Buy The Dip? XRP Whales Doing Exactly That – Is A Price Rally Next? The analyst previously mentioned that the cycle top isn’t in yet and simply classified this market downtrend as the “final shakeout” before Bitcoin reaches its peak in this bull run. Mikybull Crypto also claimed that Bitcoin has a cycle top price target of $171,000, meaning that the flagship crypto will still hit new all-time highs (ATHs) before the bull run was considered as being over.

According to numbers compiled by Farside Investors, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs saw $143.1 million in net inflows on Friday, the highest level of inflows in at least two weeks.  Leading the way was Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which took in $117.4 million of net new money.

That's down 6% from the week-ago levels and roughly 23% from its all-time high above $73,500 set in mid-March.

Chainlink (LINK), a key player in the decentralized oracle network space, has been especially hard-hit, dropping 25% since the beginning of June. But is this a buying opportunity, or the precipice of a steeper decline? Related Reading: Polkadot Under Fire: 20% Price Drop Follows $87 Million Spending Outrage This Chart Pattern Looms Large Technical analysts are scrutinizing Chainlink’s chart, with a particular focus on the dreaded “Head and Shoulders” pattern. This formation, characterized by a central peak flanked by two smaller ones, often signals a trend reversal from bullish to bearish. Analyst Ali Martinez believes a breach of the neckline, the support level currently hovering around $12.70, could trigger a significant downturn. #Chainlink $LINK faces a potential 45% price correction if it falls below $12.70! pic.twitter.com/8NGwMzEIhR — Ali (@ali_charts) July 4, 2024 If LINK falls below $12.70, we could see a cascading sell-off, warns Martinez. This could push the price down to $6.80, a staggering 45% drop. Fibonacci retracement levels, a technical tool used to identify potential support and resistance zones, further bolster this bearish outlook. The 0.786 Fibonacci level aligns perfectly with Martinez’s target of $6.80, lending credence to his prediction. Bearish Sentiment Grips The Market Adding fuel to the fire is the overall bearish sentiment gripping the crypto market. The Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, currently sits at a chilling 26, firmly in “Fear” territory. This fear is reflected in LINK’s trading activity. The price is struggling to stay above the critical $12.70 mark, and any decisive break below could accelerate the sell-off. A Glimmer Of Hope: Oversold Territory And Price Prediction However, a glimmer of hope remains. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), another technical indicator, suggests LINK might be oversold. The RSI is currently at 28, dipping into “oversold” territory. This could signal a potential short-term bounce, as oversold assets often experience temporary price corrections. Interestingly, some analysts contradict the prevailing bearish sentiment. Price for LINK is seen increasing 52.73% by August 5th, pushing the price to a healthy $18.97. While technical analysis paints a bleak picture, this prediction offers a counterpoint, highlighting the inherent uncertainty within the crypto market. Related Reading: Buy The Dip?

30522081,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628170,1720267230,Time To Buy The Dip? These Are The Large-Cap Crypto Assets To Watch,"After a turbulent week for the crypto market, the drop in prices has left an opportunity for investors to enter new or double down on their various positions. Fortunately, the blockchain intelligence firm Santiment has identified some of the large-cap cryptocurrencies to consider. These Cryptocurrencies Are In The Opportunity Zone: Santiment Santiment revealed via a post on the X platform has provided an interesting outlook on the crypto market, stating that some digital assets are showing “buy the dip” opportunities. This is based on their Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios, which measure the average profit/loss of all coins in circulation according to the current price. An MVRV ratio value greater than 1 indicates that the investors of a coin are holding a net amount of profits at the time. On the other hand, when the value of the metric is less than 1, it means that most investors of the particular crypto are carrying losses. Meanwhile, an MVRV ratio of 1 means that the unrealized profit on a blockchain is equal to the unrealized profit. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Vs. PEPE: Comparing The Profitability Of The Top Meme Coins Typically, corrections are believed to be more likely when profits are high, as investors are more inclined to sell as their gains grow. On the flip side, crypto holders are likely to refrain from dumping assets when they are in the red, leading to the formation of price bottoms. This forms the rationale behind Santiment’s Opportunity and Danger Zone investment analysis. In its recent post on X, Santiment mentioned that all notable large-cap crypto assets (except Toncoin) are in the buying opportunity in the short term. As shown in the chart below, the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio of these assets is deep in the negative, implying there is less risk attached to investing in them at the moment. According to Santiment’s data, Dogecoin (DOGE) — with an MVRV ratio of –19.7% — has the best “buy the dip” potential. It is followed by Uniswap’s governance token UNI, with a Market Value to Realized Value ratio of –16.3%. To round up the top three is Litecoin (LTC), which bears an MVRV ratio of –15%. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is amongst the mentioned assets within the opportunity zone. Having undergone a steep correction in the past week, the MVRV indicator is signaling that the premier cryptocurrency might have bottomed out and could be preparing for a move to the upside. Crypto Market On A Downturn The crypto market suffered a massive decline over the past week, with the total market capitalization falling by nearly 8%. This market downturn seems even deeper on bigger timeframes. For instance, in the last 30 days, the digital market has shed more than 21.5% of its value.

While the prominent altcoin has made a minor recovery since then, its price slip has revealed some vital information on the holdings of Tron founder and key crypto figure Justin Sun. Related Reading: Doomsday for Ethereum? ‘A Crash Down To $1,500 Is Coming,’ Says Skeptic, Here’s Why Justin Sun $66 Million Loss, Motive For Massive Bitcoin Buy Offer? Amidst the market mayhem on Friday, blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain shared an intriguing report on Justin Sun’s investments in Ethereum. In an X post, Spot on Chain stated that Sun has allegedly acquired 361,000 ETH (worth $1.1 billion) over the last five months. The Tron founder reportedly made this investment using three different wallet addresses purchasing 169,604 ETH with “0x7a9” in February at an average price of $2,870, 176,118 ETH with “0x435” in April at $3,177, and 15,416 ETH with “0xdbf” in June at $3,474. Spot on Chain noted that the aforementioned addresses always received ETH deposits from Binance following Sun’s stablecoin deposits on the exchange thus leading to suspicions that the Tron founder served as owner of these wallets. Following the repayment of creditors by defunct exchange Mt. Gox, coupled with a consistent massive Bitcoin sell-off by the US and German governments, the price of Bitcoin has plummeted by 10% over the last two days falling as low as $53,717. Unsurprisingly, this decline soon extended across the crypto market, with Ethereum crashing by a similar percentage to trade at $2810, marking its lowest price in the last five months. At that point, Justin Sun’s alleged ETH investments reached a $66 million loss. Interestingly, the Tron founder had reached out to the German government on Thursday to negotiate the sale of their remaining BTC holdings valued at $2.3 billion in a private transaction order. However, it remains unknown if the German government will take up this offer as Sun attempts to reduce the impact of their constant BTC sell-offs on his personal investments and the general crypto market. At the time of writing, Ethereum has shown resilience since its earlier slump rising by about 5% to currently trade at $2,975. In tandem, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 47.33% and valued at $30.47 billion.

30509875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628164,1720249217,"Bitcoin Price Collapse: Analyst Forecasts $44,000 Plunge On 200 Daily EMA Breakdown","The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant setback as the Bitcoin price plummeted below the $58,000 level. This downward move has raised concerns among bullish investors, suggesting a potential continuation of the downtrend toward the $44,000 support level. Bitcoin’s failure to consolidate above and retest its all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, reached in March, has resulted in a retracement of over 20% on the monthly time frame. Bitcoin Price At Risk Crypto analyst “Blockchaineddbb” has provided a noteworthy assessment of the situation. According to the analysis, a daily close below the 200 daily exponential-moving average (EMA), currently positioned at $58,000, indicates a strong likelihood of Bitcoin’s price dropping to $44,000. The analyst cautions against waiting for a bounce after the daily close below the 200 daily EMA, emphasizing the historical significance of such a breach. Related Reading: XRP Holds Bullish 2014-2017 Pattern Unless This Happens: Analyst Blockchaineddbb’s analysis reveals the historical impact of losing the 200 daily EMA. Each time Bitcoin experienced this loss, its price declined by an average of 30%, with losses ranging from 8% to 50%. The breach of the 200 daily EMA signifies Bitcoin entering an unsafe territory, heightening investor concerns. To mitigate potential losses, the analyst suggests considering an exit point before the expected further decline to $50,000, which is the next significant support level. Navigating The Bearish Storm Blockchaineddbb provides average support levels to consider during the bearish sentiment for those who choose to hold their positions. These levels are estimated at $50,000, $48,000, and $44,000, with the latter being the worst-case scenario. Long-term holders are advised to adhere to their planned averaging strategy, which involves accumulating positions on specific dates such as June 22, September 22, and December 22. According to the analyst, the target exit price remains at $75,000, with expectations of achieving this milestone by December. Considering various factors, such as a predicted September dump, the Mt. Gox settlement deadline, and upcoming elections, the analyst suggested that the prevailing bearish sentiment will persist until December. Related Reading: Is This Bad For Solana? $180 Million Transfer Raises Eyebrows Ultimately, if the current bearish sentiment continues, altcoins are expected to suffer losses until the year’s end. It is worth noting that a potential shift in this scenario would only occur if Bitcoin manages to close above the 200 Daily EMA. However, the probability of that happening appears low. Currently, the Bitcoin price stands at $56,435, just below the critical $58,000 EMA, after falling as low as $53,500 in the early hours of Friday trading.

30507558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628153,1720245629,"LayerZero Bounces Amid Market Retrace, ZRO Soars 20%","LayerZero (ZRO) has become one of the first altcoins to bounce amid the market retrace. The token has registered green numbers despite its controversial token airdrop last month. As a result, investors and market watchers remain bullish on ZRO’s long-term performance. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Founder Claps Back At ‘Dead Coin’ Comments, Issues Reminder To The Community From ZRO To Market Hero In late June, the omnichain interoperability protocol LayerZero launched its long-awaited ZRO token. The launch, which included a token airdrop for the protocol users, received a negative response from the crypto community. Users found the airdrop’s claim mechanism to be a slap in the face for the community. Minutes before the launch, the LayerZero Foundation announced that a new ‘Proof-of-Donation’ claim mechanism would be used for those who wanted to receive their token allocation. The mechanism required users to donate $0.1 in USDC, USDT, or ETH, per token allocated. The donations would go directly to the Protocol Guild, a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum developers. LayerZero received backlash for this measure. Many community members found that the project was “milking” their supporters and lacked proper communication. As a result, the token saw a 38% drop following the launch. ZRO went from trading at its $4.57 all-time high (ATH) to trading as low as $2.83. The retrace continued as it reached its all-time low (ATL) of $2.48 a week after its launch. The token has since recovered by 53%. ZRO’s upward trajectory started last week as Bitcoin (BTC) regained its $60,000 support zone. The token moved from its ATL to a biweekly high of $4.2. However, LayerZero’s token followed the rest of the market in the retrace. BTC’s performance dragged ZRO back to the $2.75 level earlier today, but it has bounced over 20% in the last few hours. As of this writing, ZRO is one of the few altcoins registering green numbers in multiple timeframes. Moreover, the protocol’s token displays double-digit gains in the weekly and biweekly timeframes, with 40.2% and 22.1% price increases. Investors Bullish On LayerZero Following this performance, investors and market watchers expressed bullish sentiment regarding the token. Some traders assert that ZRO “held relatively well during the dump” and is now “recovering pretty hard.” Crypto trader CryptoKnight highlighted ZRO’s bounce and suggested that the token could reach $5 in the short-term timeframe. Similarly, SpiderCrypto believes that ZRO will hit $10 by the end of the year. To the market watcher, LayerZero is the “best infra company for those who believe in a multichain future.” Seemingly, users remain confident in the protocol despite the launch mishap. Some investors consider it one of the “cleanest brands around” with a token that “is not difficult to sell to people with a bit of FOMO.” Related Reading: Gala Games Announces Partnership With Animoca Brands, GALA Token Plunges 6.7% LayerZero Labs recently announced its integration with Flare, a data-focused blockchain, to enable Flare developers to connect with 75 other networks. Per the post, the integration will connect the blockchain with 50,000 dApps and offer access to a “vast quantity of new users and sources of liquidity.” At the time of writing, ZRO is trading at $3.81, representing a 21% increase in the last 24 hours.

30505179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628141,1720242030,"Bitcoin Reclaims $56k But Still Faces Potential Drop to $47K, Analyst Reveals Why","Bitcoin has recently exhibited resilience that has surprised many market spectators. Following a dismal drop to a 24-hour low of $53,898, Bitcoin clawed its way back above the $56,000 mark, up 1.6% in the past hour. This rebound has been catalyzed by the latest US NFP report revealing a surge in the unemployment rate, which has sparked a surge in buying activity, momentarily easing the bearish pressure. However, this recovery may not signal a sustained upward trend, as experts hint at potential further declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $54,000: Top-5 Reasons Analyst Bitcoin Predictions: A Potential Drop To $47k A prominent crypto analyst, Ali, has expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s current market positioning. Despite the recent price recovery, he suggests that Bitcoin could significantly drop to around $47,000. This prediction stems from his analysis of Bitcoin’s support levels, which he believes are insufficient to sustain a long-term bullish momentum. According to Ali, for Bitcoin to resume its bull run, it would need to “close and hold above $61,000″—a scenario that seems increasingly speculative given the current market condition. #Bitcoin currently lacks significant support. The main key demand wall is around $47,000, and for the bull run to resume, $BTC must close and hold above $61,000. pic.twitter.com/9cD2otd4ZK — Ali (@ali_charts) July 5, 2024 Amid these turbulent market conditions, other financial experts remain cautiously optimistic. Samson Mow, a notable figure in the cryptocurrency space, argues that the current price levels of Bitcoin are the result of artificial market manipulation. He particularly labels the drastic price movements as “artificial price suppression,” influenced by significant Bitcoin transfers by government entities during periods of low market liquidity. Mow’s assertion suggests that external market forces are at play, potentially skewing the natural price discovery process of Bitcoin. Surge In Volatility Ahead Meanwhile, Greek Live highlighted emerging volatility in the cryptocurrency market earlier today, focusing on the imminent expiration of many Bitcoin and Ethereum options. The report detailed that 18,000 BTC options and 164,000 Ethereum options are set to expire soon, representing notional values of $1 billion and $470 million, respectively. This situation is particularly notable due to the skewed Put Call Ratios and defined Maxpain points, suggesting potential price pivots at $61,500 for Bitcoin and $3,350 for Ethereum. The onset of July brought significant market downturns, hitting new monthly lows across major cryptocurrencies. The end of the quarterly cycle triggered enhanced market volatility, providing a strategic window for institutional players to establish positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Bottom?

30502841,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628142,1720238453,"Bitcoin Crashed Below $55,000 But Traders Are Not Fearful, Why?","As Bitcoin faces strong headwinds, breaching two critical support levels at $60,000 and $56,500 in quick succession, it may, on the surface, appear that fear is gripping the market. There are reasons to be afraid, especially for coin holders leveraging BTC in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, looking to take out loans using the asset as their collateral. Fear Is Yet To Grip The Bitcoin Market Even as prices plunge, one on-chain analyst, taking to X, argues that the market is relatively composed and fear and panic haven’t fully gripped it yet. Pointing to the Bitcoin Daily Realized Profit Loss ratio, the analyst said that unless there is an uptick in the number of addresses in red, pointing to panic selling, the market can withstand more losses. Per the analyst’s assessment, the absence of “panic selling” bars suggests that investors are still processing the current events. Even as prices crater below $56,500, the market, the analyst added, can fall to as low as $47,000, a level that “doesn’t look as terrible as it did three weeks ago when we were at 70,000.” Related Reading: Is This Bad For Solana? $180 Million Transfer Raises Eyebrows Nonetheless, amid this necessary correction, the analyst added that the shakeout should be slower. In this way, there will be a more orderly market correction. As of July 5, Bitcoin fell nearly 30% from all-time highs and is under immense selling pressure. Following the drop below $56,500 earlier today, it is evident that the coin is now within a bear breakout formation. The sell-off forced prices from the March to May 2024 range. This signals a new phase after expansions in Q1 2024 when the coin roared to $73,800. Analysts expect more losses with sellers in the driving seat and Bitcoin within a bear breakout formation. Thus far, the immediate support is at $50,000 and $45,000, marking January 2024 highs. Best Time To Buy Bitcoin? Wait For This Signal While the drop is forcing investors to seek refuge in stablecoins, another analyst thinks this could be the best time to scoop more BTC at a discount. Taking to X, the analyst pointed out several fundamental factors that paint a long-term bullish picture. Related Reading: This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Holding $6.8 Million BTC Just Reactivated, Are They Selling? Some of these tailwinds include the availability of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There’s also regulatory clarity in the United States ahead of the highly contested presidential election. At the same time, the analyst is convinced the upcoming $16 billion payout by FTX trustees would be a net positive for optimistic BTC bulls. Even so, before there is stability and this week’s sell-off countered, there must be an uptick in new addresses. Once this is observed, it would mean that new investors are pouring in, creating demand for the coin. For now, prices are plunging, and fewer addresses are being created.

30500381,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628137,1720234847,"Colossal Buying Pressure For Bitcoin And Solana As FTX Plans $16B Distribution, Expert","In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, FTX, the exchange that collapsed in November 2022 under the leadership of convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, is preparing to distribute a staggering $16 billion in cash to its customers, which could lead to significant gains for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) prices. Crypto researcher Xremlin has predicted that a considerable portion of this cash will flow back into the crypto market, serving as a catalyst for growth towards the end of the year. FTX $16 Billion Cash Injection In a recent social media post, Xremlin highlighted the significance of the distribution, emphasizing that it involves returning $16 billion in cash to individuals already involved in the crypto space. Xremlin believes that a significant portion of this money will be reinvested in the market, specifically in purchasing various tokens, including Bitcoin and Solana, creating significant buying pressure and price growth for both cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Is This Bad For Solana? $180 Million Transfer Raises Eyebrows The source of this massive cash injection can be traced back to FTX’s agreement with US government agencies, where assets acquired with misappropriated customer funds were sold. These assets encompassed investments in cryptocurrencies, tech companies, venture funds, and real estate. Following the sale of shares in AI startup Anthropic, where FTX had previously invested $500 million, the distressed exchange found $6.4 billion in cash. It is important to note that the amount also includes assets controlled by debtors and liquidators. However, the distribution has faced dissatisfaction among some clients due to settling customer claims based on lower cryptocurrency prices from November 2022, when FTX filed for bankruptcy. For instance, clients holding 10 Ethereum’s native token ETH in their accounts will receive approximately $12,000 in cash, significantly lower than the asset’s current worth of around $29,000 as ETH trades at $2,900. Despite objections, the court has approved creditor voting on the liquidation plan, and if passed by the necessary number of votes, the plan will be implemented after final court approval. Buying Frenzy For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana? Key dates to watch for further developments include August 16, 2024, which marks the deadline for FTX customers to vote on the bankruptcy wind-down payments, and October 7, 2024, when Judge John Dorsey will consider approving the FTX bankruptcy plan. If the current plan is approved, clients can expect payouts to begin by the end of Q3, potentially providing much-needed liquidity for token purchases. This timing coincides with the US elections, which could contribute to increased market volatility. Consequently, FTX payouts could serve as an additional factor fueling a bullish trend in the crypto market as it finds itself in significant price declines. Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge Bitcoin has fallen over 21% in the past month at one end of the market, from a high of $71,000 to a current trading price of $56,400. Meanwhile, Solana surpasses BTC’s losses with a 22% drop in the same time frame, currently trading at $134. Furthermore, it is expected that the ongoing selling pressure from the US and German governments witnessed over the past month could continue for the rest of the year, and the cash injection from FTX to crypto investors could help mitigate the expected selling pressure. The researcher points out that since most affected FTX customers are retail crypto investors, a significant portion of the money is expected to flow back into cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are likely to receive the most liquidity.

Amid this negative price performance, Peter Schiff, a well-known economist and a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, has chosen to add salt to the wounds by projecting a stark prediction for ETH. According to Schiff, Ethereum could plummet to as low as $1,500, marking a substantial decline from its current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Dives Below $3K: What’s Next For The Crypto? Shiff’s Bearish Outlook And Community Reaction Schiff’s prediction comes when Ethereum is trading below the previous crucial support of $3,000 mark, a sharp 30% fall from its peak above $4,500 in March. This decline coincides with heightened speculation surrounding the potential launch of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), which seems to have triggered a premature sell-off among investors instead of propelling the price. Schiff’s commentary suggests that the market’s response to the ETF rumors has been to liquidate positions rather than hold, adding further downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. He expressed his view on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, stating, “It looks like those buying the Ethereum ETF rumors couldn’t wait for the fact to sell,” indicating a market driven by speculation rather than sustained investment confidence. While Schiff’s bearish outlook has garnered attention, it has also sparked a mix of skepticism and agreement within the crypto community. Users have expressed varying opinions on social media platforms, with some questioning the technical basis of Schiff’s $1,500 target. Others humorously noted that Schiff’s pessimistic predictions often come at market bottoms, suggesting his views might inadvertently signal a buying opportunity. For instance, one user remarked on the irony of Schiff’s timing, indicating that his bearish predictions could contradict market sentiment indicators. thx for your inputs you do realize you only become relevant on this side of twitter as a bottom signal lol youre like those acoustic wif kids who had a stroke on stage the wif party as a top signal — agent pretzel (@agent_pretzel) July 5, 2024 Ethereum Faces Critical Juncture Ethereum is experiencing a significant downturn, trading at $2,975—a 4.2% drop over the past day. This decline and Bitcoin’s similar trajectory have led to a 4.1% reduction in the global cryptocurrency market cap, erasing more than $200 billion in value. According to Coinglass, this downturn has triggered substantial losses for traders, with 207,020 liquidations in the past day, totaling $576.53 million. Ethereum-related liquidations account for $134.58 million, predominantly from long positions. While Peter Schiff’s outlook may seem too pessimistic amid these market conditions, another voice in the crypto analysis sphere, Inspo Crypto, offers a slightly more moderate view. He notes that Ethereum’s price has fallen to early May levels and suggests that the next 8-hour trading window could be crucial in determining the market’s direction.

42417778,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZvUz,1720229174,Biden's Odds on Polymarket Little Changed After ABC TV Interview,"U.S. President Joe Biden may have seemed more coherent on Friday night's televised interview compared to the debate a week ago, but his odds of reelection did not substantially change, according to traders on crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket.  For the contract asking who will win the presidency in November, ""yes"" shares for Biden were trading at 11 cents shortly after the ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos aired, a penny lower than right before the broadcast. Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the dollar) if the prediction comes true, and zilch if it does not. Therefore, an 11-cent price means the market believes the incumbent has an 11% chance of winning.  A month ago, the shares were trading at 36 cents. They tanked after Biden's disastrous performance in the debate against former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Now, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.,) is rallying fellow Democrats to urge the president to drop out of the race, the Washington Post reported Friday.  The presidential winner contract is Polymarket's largest, with $229 million of bets placed.  For a separate contract concerning who will win the Democratic nomination, Biden's odds climbed just one percentage point after the broadcast to 42%. This contract has $89 million staked.  A third contract asks if Biden will drop out of the race, with $12 million riding on the outcome. Odds there inched up three points, to 65%.  Four-year-old Polymarket's volume has surged this year as the U.S. election in November fuels enthusiasm for political betting. June was the platform's first month with more than $100 million in volume. Polymarket also recently won accolades for signaling early on, through the trading levels on the ""Biden drops out?"" contract, that the president's cognitive health was a concern long before mainstream media outlets discussed the matter seriously.  ""Prediction markets have long been sought as a prime use case for blockchains,"" wrote Zack Pokorny, an analyst at Galaxy Digital, in a research note Friday. ""Their censor/tamper resistant, transparent, and global nature makes them well suited for the task, as they allow for the unfiltered casting of opinion on any topic from anyone, anywhere.""  However, on-chain prediction markets have limitations, Pokorny wrote. ""They solely reflect the opinions of individuals who are active on blockchains, which, today, is a small sect of people with possibly similar beliefs. With crypto becoming an increasingly partisan political issue, and Polymarket only able to be used with crypto, it's possible that Polymarket's political markets may be skewed by the pro-crypto biases of its participants.""

30494193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=628128,1720225834,Massive Sell-Off: Mt. Gox Bitcoin Payout Fears Wipes Out $170 Billion From Crypto Market,"The cryptocurrency market experienced a substantial downturn on Friday, compounding the selling pressure witnessed over the past two weeks. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), retraced over 20% from its highs in June and May, dropping as low as $53,500. The market decline was largely attributed to the long-awaited trustee overseeing the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, who announced the commencement of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash repayments to creditors affected by the infamous hack that resulted in billions in losses. As a result, the entire cryptocurrency market shed over $170 billion in combined market capitalization in just 24 hours. Bitcoin Repayments And German Government Sell-Off The trustee responsible for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, Nobuaki Kobayashi, stated that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash repayments had begun through designated crypto exchanges. While the amount transferred to these exchanges was not specified, data from market intelligence platform Arkham revealed that 47,229 BTC, valued at $2.71 billion, had been transferred to an unknown address. Related Reading: Polkadot Under Fire: 20% Price Drop Follows $87 Million Spending Outrage Kobayashi emphasized that the remaining funds would be returned to creditors once “specific conditions” were met, including verifying registered accounts and finalizing discussions with the designated exchanges. The decline in crypto prices led to substantial liquidations in the derivatives markets, with over 229,755 traders experiencing combined liquidations worth $639.58 million in the past 24 hours. Of this amount, $540.46 million represented long trades, indicating positions taken by investors expecting long-term asset appreciation. Additionally, the German government contributed to the market pressure by selling approximately 3,000 BTC, equivalent to around $175 million, from a seized stash of 50,000 BTC associated with the movie piracy operation Movie2k. Despite the sell-off, the government still holds over 40,000 BTC, valued at over $2 billion. What Historical Price Cycles Suggest Despite the ongoing bloodbath witnessed in crypto prices over the past month, industry insiders and analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s future performance. Despite the short-term selling pressure resulting from Mt. Gox repayments, experts anticipate a rebound towards the end of the year. Crypto data and research firm CCData suggested that Bitcoin’s current appreciation cycle has not yet peaked and will likely achieve a new all-time high. Historical market cycles indicate that Bitcoin’s Halving event, which reduces the supply of new BTC, typically precedes a period of price expansion between 12 and 18 months. The most recent Halving occurred in April, suggesting potential further growth into 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Decimated: $5 Million Liquidation Sparks 14% Price Plunge Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC that he predicts that Bitcoin will hit $150,000 despite the Mt. Gox overhang. The launch of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US and the approval of the first US spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year contribute to the overall positive sentiment in the market, indicating potential growth and further mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $55,680, reflecting a significant 21% drop in price over the past month. Bulls in the market are closely monitoring the $54,480 price level, representing substantial support for BTC. This level holds critical importance as it could prevent further price declines and the risk of breaking below the crucial $50,000 level.
