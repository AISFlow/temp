Following news that police in India had held OneCoin promoters in custody, and that they are brining charges against OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova for fraud, the Austrian Financial Market Authority, the country's financial regulator, released a warning on its website announcing that OneCoin has no license to perform any banking transactions.  ""(OneCoin) is not entitled to carry out banking transactions in Austria that require a license. The provider is therefore not permitted to conduct the issuance and administration of payment instruments such as credit cards, banker's drafts and traveller's cheques on a commercial basis, with no limitation applicable to the term of crediting in the case of credit cards,"" the warning reads.  This makes Austria the latest member of the growing list of countries that have either sent similar regulatory warnings, investigated the alleged scheme or taken steps to crack down on the service.  As reported, Vietnam's government has previously stated that OneCoin's license to operate domestically was fake, while European countries like Germany, the U.K. and Hungary are now involving law enforcement in an effort to investigate and shut down the firm's operations.

42379587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm3l,1499892946,Swiss Bank Launches Bitcoin Asset Management Service,"A private bank in Switzerland is offering its clients services to help them better manage their bitcoin holdings.  Falcon Group announced today that it is launching the product, one aimed specifically at allowing customers to buy and hold bitcoin with their traditional accounts. The services are being offered in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse AG, a bitcoin brokerage founded in 2013.  Arthur Vayloyan, global head of products and services for Falcon, said in a statement:  ""We are proud to be the first-mover in the Swiss private banking area to provide blockchain asset management for our clients. Falcon is convinced that the time is right to enter this nascent market and it is our firm belief that this new product will fulfill our clients' future needs.""  As part of the announcement, Falcon also revealed it has installed a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its Zurich headquarters that will be open for public use. The integration reportedly came about following discussion with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  While it's rare for a bank to openly embrace cryptocurrency, Switzerland has emerged as active in supporting blockchain-related initiatives in both the public and private sectors. Just yesterday, for example, the Swiss Federal Council revealed the regulator is ""swiftly"" moving toward a legal designation of digital currencies.  In addition, the city of Zug, which has openly expressed its intent to help move forward the adoption of blockchain technology, and which is backing an industry consortium called the Crypto Valley Association, recently revealed it intends to launch a digital identity service that utilizes the tech this fall.

Yellen appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to give remarks on the state of the US economy and field questions from committee members. As chief of the US central bank, Yellen also spoke about a recent semi-annual report delivered to Congress by the Fed.  And while Yellen made headlines by expressing her willingness to raise interest rates amidst a healthier economic climate (following years of near-zero rates instituted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis), it was one attendee who drew notice on social media after he held up a ""buy bitcoin"" sign two rows behind where Yellen was seated.  A screen grab of the moment was tweeted by CNBC staffer Steve Kopack, and later shared by others who have been watching Yellen's testimony before Congress.  The identity of the person who held up the sign isn't immediately clear.  Yet in a follow-up tweet, Wall Street Journal national economics correspondent Nick Timiraos reported that the individual, along with another, had left the room ""after a staffer made some instruction to them."" Video published by Bloomberg shows the two individuals being spoken to by a staffer.  Yellen – who told Congress in 2014 that the Fed ""doesn't have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way"" – remarked earlier this year that she believes blockchain is an ""important technology"".  Under her leadership, the Fed has also moved to publish some of its internal research into the technology, releasing its first report on the subject in December.

42379586,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Gm2V,1499875223,Why Brave's $35 Million ICO May Not Be Enough for a High-Tech Hiring Spree,"While ad-blocking browser startup Brave just raised millions of dollars in an initial coin offering (ICO), that doesn't mean the startup has been able to make all its goals actionable.  After attracting what was then valued at $35m by selling cryptographic assets aimed at monetizing online user behavior, the startup today posted the first of a series of job posts that would double the startup's size. However, after having privately been on the hunt for talent for weeks, Brave founder Brenden Eich is cautious about how quickly he'll be able to find the much-needed talent.  In the wake of a historic year of ICO fundraisers, the competition for talent has reached a tipping point.  ""We need ethereum talent and that's scarce right now,"" said Eich, who formerly co-founded Mozilla and Firefox, telling CoinDesk:  ""We have people who have learned it and we can keep going with our people cross-training in the company, but I'm also looking to hire an ethereum hacker or two even though they're in such demand.""  In a blog post published today, Eich revealed the first of what he said will be several ""batches"" of hires that will eventually increase the team by 20 people.  Aligned with the ""Mercury phase"" of Brave's development, in which the startup plans to integrate its ethereum-denominated basic attention token (BAT) wallet into the Brave Browser, the company has posted eight new jobs, including five engineers and two designers.  Of the skills required for the positions, Eich highlighted the need for increasingly proficient ethereum developers, along with skill sets related to machine learning and browser development that are crucial to analyzing users' behavior while still protecting their privacy.  Still, in spite of raising funds from almost 7,000 different addresses, the difficulty of finding new talent is forcing the startup to focus more of its efforts on cross-training existing staff who are already proficient in using bitcoin code and more.  Across the industry startups are increasingly finding that getting funded is no longer the hardest part. LinkedIn currently lists 367 job opportunities for blockchain specialists from a wide range of fields, while Indeed.com lists 381 full-time jobs, not even counting part-time roles and internships.  ""It's so competitive,"" Eich told CoinDesk.  Fight for talent  Nevertheless, planned hires through this phase also include pre-sales associates who would work with brands and ad agencies and on-boarding new publishers that may need help signing up to receive token payments from Brave users who choose to have their ads blocked.  Even before embarking on this multi-phase hiring spree funded by the ICO, the company had grown its staff to 26 people. But as other even larger ICOs continue to raise funds, Brave is pushing forward with its hiring plan aligned with the road map released in June.  Following the Mercury phase, which is expected to conclude in June, Brave's ""Gemini phase"" will begin to refine the platform's KYC process, while using the BAT token to grow its user pool and recruit vetted publishers. The Apollo phase in 2018 will see the company shift its attention to generating ""real ad revenue.""  Eich said:  ""We're managing carefully because it’s easy to over-hire; it’s also important for us to get to the point where we can bring in other attention apps to use the BAT. But we're not ready to do that until we've proven it in Brave first.""  Incentivizing users  Founded in 2015, the San Francisco-based Brave raised $7m from traditional venture capital firms before launching its ICO as part of a larger plan to pay its users for the ads they watch in more ways that with just bitcoin.  While the ICO was in part established to pay for these new hires and more, it was also intended to help incentivize new users interested in the business model that puts the power to monetize one's data in the hand of the individual.  To prime the initial pool of users, Brave set aside 300m BAT tokens to incentivize adoption. The total supply of 1.5bn BAT is now worth about $126m at around $0.089 per token, at the time of publication.  Armed with these resources, Eich remains optimistic about his rate of growth, even in a crowded market.  The CEO concluded:  ""We [already have] more publishers than I expected.""

According to a report from Reuters, Revolut's funding came from a group of backers including Index Ventures, which is an investor in industry startups BitPay and Xapo. Balderton Capital and Ribbit Capital also took part in the round, the startup said in a blog post.  The company, which reportedly has around 700,000 customers (including 400,000 based in the UK), offers a digital banking app as well as payment card services via MasterCard.  Those services are expanding to include bitcoin payment options, with integrations for litecoin and ether on the way. The startup told Reuters that demand for bitcoin among its user base had prompted the move.  Posts on Revolut's community forum indicate that requests for a bitcoin option date back to as early as last summer.  Though it has to date served a primarily European market, Revolut said that it is looking to advance its offerings abroad, with product pushes planned for Asia and North America.

42379577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYe5,1499864412,Explainer: What Is SegWit2x and What Does It Mean for Bitcoin?,"As two proposals for boosting bitcoin's transaction capacity approach key deadlines, one proposal, known as SegWit2x, has perhaps garnered the most attention.  The plan, first proposed in May, quickly won favor among many of bitcoin's startups and mining pools. Yet, it has also emerged as contentious in some quarters, owing to its specific goals and technical construction.  But, what's at the heart of the arguments for and against?  First, SegWit2x seeks to upgrade bitcoin in two ways:  It would enact the long-proposed code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit), which alters how some data is stored on the network.  It would set a timeline for increasing the network's block size to 2MB, up from 1MB today, to be triggered about three months after the SegWit activation.  Understanding the ins and outs of the proposal from here can be challenging. While technical, the proposal is also political and philosophical (and some would argue, personal).  Still, the specifics of the debate revolve around basic facts about current network design and performance.  These include:  Bitcoin is currently limited in the number of transactions it can process. Today, it can only process up to 1MB of transactions roughly every 10 minutes.  Owing to this limit, transactions take longer to approve during times of heavy use.  As all users pay a fee to miners to make transactions, this limitation on space has increased average fee costs.  Increasing the block size makes network nodes more costly, as node operators must store the entire copy of the blockchain as computer files.  The basics  To begin, SegWit2x is not the first proposal for scaling bitcoin's transaction capacity.  SegWit2x, though, differs in some key ways.  These include:  It was not put forward by, nor has it been endorsed by, Bitcoin Core, the network's main open-source developer team.  It doesn't introduce new ideas so much as combine those previously proposed by various developers in a new way.  As outlined above, these ideas include:  SegWit: An optimization proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille at the end of 2015, SegWit increases the volume of transactions that fit into each block without raising the block size parameter. Specifically, it also removes transaction malleability, an issue that once resolved could lead to a number of network improvements. You can read more about the technical specifics here and here.  A block size increase: The change, long-proposed as a scaling solution, simply involves updating the software rules to allow for 2MB blocks. A few alternative bitcoin implementations (Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited) emerged with the goal of increasing bitcoin's block size parameter. But none have yet reached the necessary threshold of support.  SegWit was officially released last November, giving network users the option to run it. But, for technical reasons, it required mining pools to activate the change, and they have been hesitant to adopt the change for a variety of reasons.  SegWit2x is being deployed in its testnet to all working group members on July 14, and the period for live adoption starts on July 21, with an August 1 deadline for necessary support to avoid issues.  Who supports it? Who opposes it?  In favor of SegWit2x are a significant number of high-profile bitcoin businesses and individuals, most of whom are more closely affiliated with the ecosystem's startup and investment community.  These include:  Most of the network's larger mining pools  Bitcoin startups like Coinbase, BitPay and Blockchain  Notable developers, including former lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core, Gavin Andresen.  A full list of supporters can be found in the original SegWit2x agreement announcement.  Still, others oppose the plan, including:  A few businesses (including Bitrated and Bitonic)  Many node operators and bitcoin users  Nearly all Bitcoin Core developers responsible for maintaining the software.  The actively updated Bitcoin Wiki page offers a longer list of those who support, oppose and are undecided.  What's at stake?  Looking ahead, the outcome of SegWit2x will depend on how many users ultimately adopt the proposal.  Several different outcomes could emerge, including:  The mining pools that pledged support for SegWit2x follow through by the end of July, and the SegWit portion of the proposal is activated on the network.  The proposal doesn't get that support, and the change triggers a domino effect that, worst case, leads to a network split into two competing bitcoin assets.  As is to be expected from such a large ecosystem, different users have different opinions on the best course of action, perhaps owing to the competing ideologies underlying their participation in bitcoin to begin with. As such, SegWit2x is not the only scaling proposal receiving attention today. Several alternative proposals have been introduced that could be enacted on the network in the coming month.  SegWit2x is competing with another proposal: BIP 148.  Developers have worked to make these two compatible, so, if enough mining pools support SegWit2x before August 1, bitcoin should avoid a split. Yet, without the necessary support for SegWit2x, and an activation of BIP148, the network could fork.  And a split is what many bitcoin users are most concerned about, leading them to worry about the SegWit2x proposal in general. In light of these anxieties, one of two things could happen to user's bitcoin directly:  With enough support, bitcoin upgraded to SegWit2x will work normally, and users will not likely experience any service disruptions.  Without support, a bitcoin split puts users at risk of losing their bitcoin. Cryptocurrency experts propose not making bitcoin transactions during the uncertain time period around August 1.  Another longer term issue is that all users will need to upgrade their software in support of the 2MB hard fork component of SegWit2x, or bitcoin could split into two competing assets with different users.  A more detailed version of the SegWit2x scaling timeline, and the potential ramifications, can be found on Bitcoin Magazine.  How you can follow SegWit2x's progress?  As the SegWit2x code gets deployed on the testnet on July 14, and the period for adoption starts on July 21, many will be keeping a close eye on the evolving situation.  There are various places to track the project's development.  The SegWit2x mailing list can be found here (while public, only members who are invited can post to the list). Further, the SegWit2x code implementation, known as ""BTC1"", can be found here.  Community members can follow how many nodes are running SegWit2x software here and how many mining pools support the proposal here, as a means of keeping an eye on whether it achieves enough support.

42379583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYld,1499860803,JPMorgan Denies Involvement with Blockchain Startup DIT Financial,"JPMorgan Chase has shot down claims of its involvement in a blockchain project publicized last week.  A company called DIT Financial stated in a press release published on July 6, that it was working with JPMorgan on a project called DIT Wealth Chain. The headline of the press release states that the two companies are ""[co-operating] to develop a new blockchain project."" Further, the release contained a picture of an event with both firm's names on a presentation screen.  Yet, when contacted for comment, a representative for JPMorgan said they had no involvement with, or knowledge of, the project.  DIT Financial published a second press release on July 11, which, while this time making no reference to a relationship with JPMorgan, refers to ""a new report from JPM."" Yet the passage it quotes is actually sourced from a report published in July 2016, co-written with consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.  At the time of publishing, DIT Financial had not responded to a request for comment on the matter.  The press release isn't the first time that JPMorgan's famous name and brand have been used in this way.

42379578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYgb,1499857207,Gambling on a Hard Fork: Will Roger Ver Take up a High-Stakes Bitcoin Wager?,"Suppose you wanted to bet on the outcome of a future bitcoin hard fork, how would you go about doing that?  That very question came up last spring on BitcoinTalk when Roger Ver, the controversial investor and proponent of a particular brand of bitcoin scaling, gave a nod to a challenge from another investor. The wager? Which of two blockchains would be more valuable if bitcoin were to split.  The challenge sought to speculate on the future of Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), a proposal for removing the bitcoin block size limit. (This was before SegWit2x came into play, although both protocol upgrades propose bigger blocks and require a hard fork to implement.)  Intrigued by the bet, and the amount of money Ver was willing to put on the table ($120m-worth of bitcoin at the time), researchers Patrick McCorry at University College London and Ethan Heilman at Boston University, along with Andrew Miller, assistant professor at University of Illinois, put their heads together to figure out a solution.  And to that end, they have released a paperhttp://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/patrick.mc-corry/atomically-trading-roger.pdf outlining the technical details needed to carry through with the wager.  The wager  Before explaining how that protocol works, though, let's go back to the bet.  Back in March, ""Loaded,"" a pseudonymous investor who holds a substantial bag of bitcoins, put forth a challenge to Ver, who, at the time was pushing hard for BU.  ""@RogerVer let's make a deal, 1 for 1 trade. At least 60k, possibly up to 130k, my BTU for your BTC,"" Loaded wrote  ""The offer is open to [Bitmain CEO] Jihan Wu as well,"" he followed, noting the mining magnate Ver was said to be working closely with at the time. ""Consider it primarily as a vote of no confidence in the Bitcoin Unlimited software and development team as it currently stands.""  While Wu remained silent, two days later, to the surprise of many in the bitcoin community, Ver responded:  ""This sounds like a great deal for both of us. I look forward to ironing out the exact details and terms.""  And, since then, the developer community has been kicking around ideas on how exactly to handle the technical details of the swap.  Adding to the urgency is an increasing likelihood that a hard fork could occur. Currently, 85% and 42% of miners are signaling their readiness for SegWit2x and Bitcoin Unlimited, respectively.  As in any hard fork, if the bitcoin blockchain splits into two competing networks, the result will be two types of digital assets, as well. So, in the case of a BU hard fork, a person holding bitcoin on the original chain would end up with an equal amount of BU bitcoin, or BTU, on the alternate chain.  Over time, those coins would develop different market values, depending on the chain more users gravitated to. The situation would be similar to the aftermath of ethereum's DAO hard fork, which resulted in two assets: ether and ether classic.  Technical challenge  To better understand the problem that McCorry, Heilman and Miller were striving to solve, it helps to take a closer look at how the deal between Loaded and Ver would unfold.  First, each party would need to put aside 60,000 BTC prior to the split. Once the split into two chains occurs, both parties will end up with coins on both blockchains, leaving each with 60,000 BTC and 60,000 BTU.  At that point, Loaded would trade 60,000 of his BTC on one chain with 60,000 of Roger's BTU on the other. Once the trade was completed, Loaded would walk away with 120,000 BTC and Roger with 120,000 BTU.  And, the gamble is, who will be the richer man as a result?  The scheme is a tough one to pull off, however. Although atomic cross-chain swaps are the most obvious way to handle the trade, that solution would only work after the hard fork when there would be two chains. Before the hard fork, there will only be one chain.  So, the trick is finding a way for both parties to commit to the trade prior the fork and then swap after the fork. And, because bitcoin has not yet activated the SegWit upgrade, the solution also needs to account for transaction malleability, a problem that adds several extra steps to the setup.  But Heilman and McCorry, who spoke to CoinDesk about their paper, said they've had a good time trying to arrive at a solution and see malleability as bringing more to the party.  ""It's way more complicated, but it’s also more fun,"" said Heilman.  How it works  The solution set forth by the researchers is a modified version of an atomic swap protocol that relies on two bitcoin transaction encumbrances: CheckTimeLockVerify (CTLV) and hashlocks. CTLV sets transactions at a future point in time, while hashlocks require a ""secret"" (pre-image of a hash) to unlock a transaction output.  It's also worth noting that the protocol will work not just on a BU hard fork, but any hard fork that has what's called ""replay protection,"" a way of ensuring that a transaction occurring on one blockchain after a split does not get repeated on the other.  Explaining the swap as it relates to Ver ('Alice') and Loaded ('Bob'), the setup goes something like this:  First, Alice computes a ""secret"" (pre-image) and hashes it. After that, three transactions (see below) need to be created and signed by both parties prior to the fork. This way, when the blockchain splits, Alice and Bob only have to broadcast their transactions to get their deposits.  Funding transaction  To commit to the trade, Alice and Bob each deposit 60,000 BTC into a ""funding transaction."" That transaction has three outputs.  One output is linked to Alice's coins, the other to Bob's coins, and a third acts as a fail-safe, allowing Bob to cancel if Alice neglects to sign any of the off-chain transactions required to set up the entire trade. To ensure the money is held safely until after the fork, each output has a time lock.  Now, with the money safely set aside, both parties can move on to add their digital signatures to two more transactions. These will determine how the money in the funding transaction will be spent after the fork.  Swap transaction  The ""swap transaction"" is actually a pair of transactions. When triggered, one transaction takes 120,000 BTU from the BU fork and sends it to Alice, while the other takes 120,000 BTC from the BTC fork and sends it to Bob.  And, to ensure each transaction only works in its intended chain, the protocol calls on the replay protection already included in the hard fork protocol upgrade. This way, for instance, Alice cannot claim coins on both chains.  When the time comes, it will be up to Alice to trigger the swap. To claim her funds on the BU fork, she has to reveal the secret created at the beginning of the setup. And, with that secret, Bob is able to automatically (and atomically) grab all of his funds on the BTC fork.  But, there is a catch. Alice (who, once again, represents Ver) may decide to wait and see what the market is doing first. If the BU chain looks like it's not doing so well, she may renege, and not want go through with the trade after all. And, to guard against that, there is one more transaction to make.  Forfeit transaction  To give Alice an added incentive to ""push the button,"" so to speak, a third ""forfeit transaction"" is also set up in advance. By signing the forfeit transaction, Alice grants all the coins to Bob in the event she does not trigger a swap.  So, essentially, the question posed at that theoretical point is: ""What will it be, Alice? Do you want the lesser valued coins, or none of the coins?""  If Alice does not sign that transaction in advance, Bob will use the fail-safe set up in the funding transaction to cancel the entire deal, as Alice is not acting in good faith.  But once again, all of these transactions need to be setup and signed before the fork.  Place your bets  In the event of a BU hard fork, Ver, who has been pushing for bigger blocks for some time now, likely thinks the BU chain would come out on top. But, is he ready to stand by the deal he made with Loaded?  If so, McCorry and Heilman say they will be more than happy to set up the transaction. And, they feel confident other developers will pitch in to help out as well. So, with the stage set, all the players ready, what’s next looks like a wait-and-see game for now.  ""Loaded asked the community for an atomic trade protocol suitable for the bet, and we have provided him with it,"" said McCorry.  Heilman added:    ""I'm not hoping for a bitcoin hard fork, but now, at least if it happens, we will have something to look forward to.""

42379570,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYU1,1499853600,US Accounting Standards Body Weighs New Digital Currency Rules,"The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a financial accounting standards body in the US, is reportedly considering whether to undertake a new initiative on digital currencies.  According to Reuters, the FASB – which sets accounting standards for publicly traded US firms – hasn't yet decided if it will develop new guidelines for companies dealing with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the non-profit is apparently assessing whether it should begin that process following a request from the Washington, DC-based Chamber of Digital Commerce – a trade organization for companies and groups working in the digital currency and blockchain space.  In a letter to the board, dated June 8, CDC founder and president Perianne Boring argued that the lack of standards is creating a barrier for both investors and entrepreneurs:  ""The absence of accounting standards for digital currencies is a mission critical issue for companies seeking to invest and innovate in this exciting technology frontier and may hold back economic growth in the United States.""  If it does undertake the initiative, the FASB would not be alone among the world's accounting standards groups who have begun developing new frameworks. Among those is the Australian Accounting Standards Board, which in November argued for global action in this area.  Further, a group of accounting firms including PwC, Deloitte and EY, among others, formed a new coalition last year aimed at promoting new standards for digital currency. The CDC, too, has previously launched an advocacy effort, dubbed the Digital Assets Accounting Coalition.

According to Nikkei, Bic Camera, which began accepting bitcoin at several locations in April, is expanding the option after seeing unexpected levels of demand from spenders. The company is taking payments in the digital currency through a partnership with domestic bitcoin exchange bitFlyer, which it uses to convert bitcoin into yen upon acceptance.  Bic Camera sells a range of products, including cameras, personal computers and home appliances like dishwashers.  News that Bic Camera was taking bitcoin in a limited capacity came shortly after the Japanese government put in place new regulations around digital currencies and the exchange services that handle them. Among those was a legal definition for bitcoin as a kind of payment instrument.  Those rules came into being after the failure of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that collapsed in early 2014. Mt Gox's CEO, Mark Karpeles, appeared in court yesterday and pleaded not guilty to embezzlement.  As for when the nationwide roll-out is happening, Nikkei reports that it could play out as early as this month. Kojima, a subsidiary brand of Bic Camera's, is also expected to begin accepting bitcoin in the near future.
