42400691,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQQf,1511539202,Brain Freeze? Parity Bug Continues With No Easy Solution in Sight,"Three weeks and counting ...  That's how long it's been since a mishap by ethereum wallet provider Parity saw $160 million in cryptocurrency code frozen, and still no solution has been pursued to free up the funds. But that's not to say discussions aren't ongoing on how to return the cryptocurrency to its rightful owners.  At times heated, an escalating debate is developing on public chat channels about how to best correct the issue, and more notably, how to avoid resetting the history of the entire ethereum blockchain in what amounts to a network-wide software update to do so.  Hosted on GitHub, one public channel that has seen notable activity was created by ethereum's developer team to discuss proposals for reviving ether stuck in smart contracts. (Lost assets of this type occur with some frequency, such as when users send funds to non-existent wallets.)  But the conversation around Parity is evolving differently, in part due to the scope of the fund loss and the politics inherent in the decision-making.  As occurred after last year's infamous DAO hack, the incident has helped revive the debate about whether ethereum's development is too centralized and its blockchain really immutable, meaning all transactions are final and cannot be rearranged to correct human error.  This is largely because, in response to the DAO, new software was written and approved by the network's stakeholders to effectively rewrite its blockchain history. The move sparked contention and critique, even spawning an alternative blockchain, ethereum classic, now valued at $1.7 billion.  And though the Parity hack is jumpstarting the difficult conversation again, there's been a change in sentiment regarding whether this is indeed the best way to resolve massive hacks.  As one particularly vocal participant wrote on the recovery channel:  ""If Ethereum Foundation needs to do a hard fork every three months to 12 months in order to move funds around, we're using Bank of Ethereum.""  Not quite another DAO  However, while the political tensions are reminiscent of The DAO, there are some key differences between the two attacks. For one, while the DAO funds were stolen, Parity's funds have been made inaccessible due to an exploit that forced the wallets to self-destruct.  And although there's some conspiracy circulating as to whether the Parity hacker was acting maliciously – accidentally deleting the code library in the process of stealing funds – the fact that the affected ETH has not been gathered into a wallet changes the nature of the technical fix.  In particular, it reduces the need for ethereum to reset its blockchain.  As ethereum developer Nick Johnston, responding to infighting on the channel, wrote: ""Why do you think recovering lost funds has to require 'going back in time?' I once had my bike stolen; it was recovered and returned to me. No time travel was involved.""  Instead, ethereum updates are being proposed that involve changes to existing ethereum improvement protocols (EIPs) that could more broadly protect against cases of frozen ETH. In short, developers are attempting to take a wider-scope approach to problem-solving.  But while developers are focused on introducing changes that could improve the security of the network at large, none of the solutions discussed to date appear to be gathering consensus.  Imperfect options  For example, changes could be made to an existing ethereum improvement protocol, EIP156, that would refund some of the Parity losses by adding a new rule to the software.  Created by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in October last year, the EIP is named ""Reclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts."" But while the title is promising, developers don't believe it's perfectly matched to the Parity problem at hand.  EIP 156 allows funds to be restored providing owners of lost ETH can mathematically prove they are the rightful owner. However, it only works with funds that are stuck in codeless or empty smart contracts and cannot rescue the dead Parity wallets, which still have code associated with them.  And although it may be possible to extend EIP 156 to address the current problem, the fix is currently imperfect.  According to ethereum security lead Martin Holst Swende, Parity refundscould be hardcoded into EIP 156, which would facilitate a one-off return of funds. However, the refund would not be applicable to the ICO tokens that have been impacted by the hack.  And due to a quirk in the code, the wallets, once retrieved, would not be returned to their original owners – instead, they would automatically be in the hands of the ""creator"" of the tech.  Heralded as one of the more ""elegant"" solutions discussed on the recovery thread is the idea to tokenize lost assets, akin to Bitfinex's ""hack credit"" token which was issued to those who suffered in the $60 million hack last year.  The idea is inspired by EIP 156 itself, which works by creating a token by which owners of lost funds can prove their ownership. This would allow traders to speculate on the release of the funds, and, according to Holst Swende, could have the advantage of allowing those affected by the Parity hack to win back funds before any potential code fix.  Similarly, Holst Swende speculated that perhaps a token of this kind could be used as a voting mechanism to discover whether a core software upgrade is actually desired by the community.  Parity's proposal  But while it may be down to U.K.-based Parity Technologies to format a proposal regarding the lost funds, its attendance on the channel has been sparse. However, this may not be reflect the firm's behind-the-scenes work.  In response to inquiries, a representative said that discussions are likely to advance soon.  It's unclear at this point whether the conversation among other ethereum community members will impact Parity's proposal, but writing on the channel yesterday, representative Afri Schoedon asked for a summary of the discussion, stating:  ""Parity will be discussing proposals this week probably. But I want to be aware of any other proposals.""  According to rumors on the thread, one Parity member is working on a fix that would entail changes to the ethereum virtual machine (EVM) to order the lost wallets to ""un-self-destruct.""  Although unconfirmed, the proposal has been a point of contention for Johnston, who told CoinDesk it would ""change an important invariant"" in the EVM, leading to ""unexpected bugs, even in already-deployed contracts.""  However, Afri Schoedon assured that going forward, Parity intends to offer ""not one proposal, but multiple,"" deferring to the community to decide ""what's acceptable or desired.""  He told CoinDesk: ""We will probably add two or three own proposals to the stack.""

The Bitcoin Active Certificate works by moving investor's holdings between bitcoin and U.S. dollars with the help of a machine learning algorithm that forecasts short-term market movements using technical indicators, buy/sell pressure and analysis of social media sentiment.  Swissquote said in a statement: ""Our strategy is focused on reducing volatility by increasing the amount of cash held during periods of uncertainty and downturns. This lower-volatility strategy is intended to decrease volatility to help create more consistent potential returns in the long run.""  The bank explained it will hold from 60–100 percent of the portfolio in bitcoin, depending on the level of confidence its bitcoin price prediction, while the remainder is held in U.S. dollars. Trading will be carried on the SIX Swiss Exchange, it added.  According to a Bloomberg report, Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at the bank, said:  ""Investors are excited about the cryptocurrency but are unnerved by its volatility. So we tried to build a trading algorithm that’s a protection against downside risks.""  Notably, the new certificate isn't the bank's first foray into the cryptocurrency space.  Back in July, Swissquote announced a new bitcoin trading feature in partnership with digital currency exchange Bitstamp.

Soon before press time, the ether-U.S. dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate had reached a fresh all-time high of $444. As per CoinMarketCap, the world's second largest cryptocurrency has appreciated by 11 percent in the last 24 hours.  Total trading volume  jumped to $1.845 billion yesterday – the highest since Sept. 15. A high volume rally indicates strong hands are at play and more records could be set over the weekend.  Again, South Korean desks are firing on all cylinders. Volumes in the ETH/KRW pair offered by Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, have gone up by 13.57 percent today.  The price action analysis indicates scope for a rally to $460-$470 levels in the short-term.  1-hour chart        The above chart shows a bull flag breakout, which is a continuation pattern – i.e. an upside break of the flag as seen above signals continuation of the rally.  As per the measured-height method, a bull flag breakout has opened the doors for $480 levels (flag height added to the breakout level).  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  The next major resistance is seen at $465.90 (127.2% Fibonacci extension).  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions.  Weekly chart  The above chart shows:  A bullish symmetrical triangle breakout. This is a continuation pattern – i.e. an upside break indicating the bull run has resumed. In ether's case, it signifies that the rally from the lows near $10 has resumed.  The RSI is close to the overbought territory, however, it is well short of the extreme overbought levels seen in June. Thus, there is plenty scope for a further rally in prices.  View  Ether looks set to test resistance levels of $465.90-$480 and could extend the rally to $500 levels in short-term.  Technical pullbacks, if any, are likely to be short-lived.

Overstock's tZERO to Build Services Into Security Token,"Overstock subsidiary tZERO is adding several new business verticals as part of its forthcoming initial token offering (ICO).  Specifically, the tZERO token holders are now being offered the ability to buy blockchain-enabled digital locate receipts, along with newly revealed robo-advising services, online retail brokerage services, insurance products and education services dispersed in an app store-like environment.  ""Crypto is very new, ICOs are new – at least let's provide an educational store if you want to go in and learn about these, and use your tZERO tokens to do that,"" said tZERO president Joseph Cammarata.  In addition to the newly revealed verticals the token will be able to be used for the company's traditional routing and execution services made available through a previously revealed alternative trading system (ATS).  While blockchain-based token offerings have largely been portrayed as either traditional tokens or so-called ""utility tokens,"" tZERO's assets are being designed to function as a hybrid, giving investors elements of both functionalities.  Speaking to this new hybrid model, Cammarata told CoinDesk:  ""We see ICOs as the new IPO – Wall Street 2.0. And we're looking to lead the charge in a regulated environment.""  The platform is now scheduled to begin accepting accredited investors for its ICO on Dec. 18.  Investors and beyond  Since tZERO's launch in August 2015, the company has largely focused on building a regulated means for instantly buying and selling stock-like products on a blockchain. But since the company revealed its plans to host this ICO, Camarata said, the company has seen renewed interest.  For example, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne revealed in an investor call earlier this month that tZERO has sold a warrant – a security that gives the owner the right to buy stock at the agreed price – to a fund affiliated with John Burbank's Passport Capital LLC for $2.6 million, and another to George Soros' Quantum Partners LP for $4 million.  Cammarata said those investors view the warrants as a proxy investment in tZERO, which is 81 percent owned by Overstock.com. He added, however, that they will not likely buy the tZERO token itself. He declined to comment further on details about that possible correlation.  In addition to investors contacting tZERO since news of the ICO emerged, other companies have reached out wondering how they might replicate the model for token issuance, Cammarata indicated.

A drop below $8,000 during the Asian day was quickly undone and the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value once again approached record highs, hitting $8,333 this morning.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,228, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  As per CoinMarketCap, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate has appreciated by 1.13 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the total trading volume in the last 24 hours was $5 billion, the highest since Nov. 16.  The price action analysis indicates the failed breakdown below $8,000 may be costly for the bears.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows:  Failed breakdown: BTC witnessed a solid rebound from the upward sloping 50-MA and is back in the rising channel.  The relative strength index (RSI) holds above 50.00 (bullish territory).  1-hour chart  View  The charts suggest a rally to new all-time highs around $8,600 (rising channel ceiling) is possible. The 10-day moving average (MA) is sloping upwards, suggesting dips below the same could be short-lived. Currently, the 10-day MA stands at $7,949 levels.  However, multiple 4-hour closes below $7,900 levels would warrant caution on the part of the bulls. In such a case, a deeper pullback to sub-$7,600 could be seen.
