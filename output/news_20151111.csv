Data from the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) indicates the most rapid declines started at roughly 1:30 UTC, with the price falling to a daily low of $298.75 by 3:00 UTC.  Overall, the decrease marked the second consecutive day in which the price of bitcoin has lost gains created at the beginning of the month, when it climbed to year highs.  Year-over-year, the price of bitcoin was down roughly $50, as the price closed at roughly $366.99 on 12th November.  Prices movements were similar on the CoinDesk CNY BPI, which at press time had fallen roughly 7% from the day’s open ¥2,144.84 to ¥2,001.89. Further, the CNY BPI hit a low of ¥1,879.61 at 3:00 UTC.  There were signs that traders are starting to turn bearing on their outlook for the bitcoin price, however, as data from BFXdata revealed the number of short positions (BTC/USD) opened on margin trading exchanges was on the rise.  BTC swaps (shorts) represented 18.3% of market positions opened at press time, up from 12.6% on 6th November.

42378376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1pL,1447276839,Meet the 5 Blockchain Startups in Boost VC’s Tribe 6,"California startup incubator Boost VC took a markedly different approach to its latest batch of early-stage companies, known in its own internal parlance as Tribe 6.  While Boost VC's Tribe 5 was dominated by bitcoin and blockchain startups – accounting for 90% of the 25 assembled companies, Tribe 6 was primarily focused on another emerging technology, virtual reality (VR).  But with their latest batch, CEO Adam Draper and co-founder Brayton Williams didn’t abandon their long-standing commitment to bitcoin, so much as take a step back. Tribe 6 still featured five blockchain startups, all of whom presented their product pitches at a Demo Day event in early October.  This time around, rather than hold its product showcase at the end of the program, Boost planned the event some weeks prior in an effort to offer greater help to its entrepreneurs as they sought to secure investments.  Draper told CoinDesk in October that the decrease in bitcoin startups in Tribe 6 was primarily due to the increased regulatory burden placed on bitcoin blockchain startups. The funding environment for startups, he said, was not a factor, citing data that indicates six of the 22 startups in Boost’s last class had so far secured follow-on investments.  Overall, Draper remains optimistic about the industry, adding that he hopes to see the number of blockchain startups equal the number of VR firms as part of its Tribe 7 batch, which is now accepting applications.  Draper added:  ”We've never been more excited about bitcoin and the blockchain.”  Joystream  An effort to improve the incentive schemes featured on the peer-to-peer file sharing network BitTorrent, Joystream is the product of founder and developer Bedeho Mender.  According to Mender, Joystream aims to use bitcoin as a way to allow BitTorrent users to compensate others for their work in bringing content to the distributed network.  ""BitTorrent is organized into small communities. To be part of these groups you have to leave your computer on for a certain amount of time, or upload a certain amount of content in exchange for how much you want to download,"" Mender explained.  JoyStream instead would allow users to compensate those who want to perform these tasks with bitcoin, in exchange for benefits such as faster download speeds and increased content access, sending payments in real-time alongside downloads.  Mender said a ""very, very early"" version of the product was released last month on the bitcoin testnet, meaning it currently does not exchange real bitcoins.  Currently, the platform has just “a few hundred” users, though it hopes to attract more as its nears a formal launch of services supported on the bitcoin blockchain.  CoinUT  Representing the international bitcoin community in the latest class was Singapore-based bitcoin options exchange CoinUT.  Launched in beta in October 2014, CoinUT offers both vanilla and binary options, products that give users the right to sell assets at a certain price at a later date, or enable users to speculate on the future movement of the bitcoin market for financial gain, respectively.  The startup believes vanilla options will appeal to risk-averse bitcoin traders looking to hedge against volatility in its price, while binary options will appeal to those with a more aggressive risk appetite.  Currently, CoinUT options are denominated in bitcoin only, with minimum trades set at 0.001 BTC (roughly $0.30) and a 40% margin set as the threshold users need to meet to maintain positions. Users can hedge bitcoin positions for up to two months.  The startup is currently operating in an area of the industry that features startups including LedgerX, Nadex and TeraExchange, each of which has entered the regulatory approval process due to their use of fiat currencies in their product offerings.  CoinUT’s creators have suggested that they are now working to create a socialized loss system and considering whether to add support for alternative digital currencies.  Unocoin  One of India’s longest-running bitcoin exchanges, Unocoin has seen both pros and cons from its early market entrance, so far attracting equal amounts of venture capital from avid industry investors including Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, and regulatory scrutiny from domestic lawmakers.  According to Unocoin president Sunny Ray, the platform has seen a 23% increase in users over the past month as bitcoin’s price climbed to its highest levels seen so far in 2015.  Ray said Unocoin now has 30,000 registered users, with 3,000 of these new customers joining within the last three days. Further, he is optimistic this user growth will continue due to what he called the need for bitcoin in a part of the world where access to banking services remains limited.  Ray told CoinDesk:  ""I truly believe that bitcoin is somewhat of a novelty, a rich person's plaything in developed countries. In places like India, it’s a necessity.""  As for its application to Boost, Ray said this was borne out of a desire to work with bitcoin believers like Adam Draper and his father and Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Tim Draper.  ""To build a bitcoin business, you need the most wealthy and successful people in the world on your side,"" Ray concluded.  Epiphyte  One of the longest-operating stealth projects in the industry, Epiphyte has been building blockchain solutions for the enterprise financial community since 2013.  Epiphyte can be viewed as one of the earliest attempts by the technology’s entrepreneurs to tap this now growing market, as the startup won a $50,000 prize as part of the Sibos 2014 trade show, where it was named ""Fintech startup of the year"".  Led by former Zynga senior product manager Edan Yago, Epiphyte touts ""instant settlement for trades and transactions"" but few details are public about its partners and offerings.  Still, Epiphyte does offer insight into its ambitions on its website, which reads:  ""Imagine receiving payment at the same instant as performing an intuitional trade. With Epiphyte’s settlement system this now possible. Traders use our system to eliminate counterparty risk.""  Wealthcoin  Another startup focused on investments, Wealthcoin is an app that allows users to speculate on stocks and bonds with bitcoin.  As the global bitcoin market becomes more stable, Wealthcoin offers a way for investors to leverage their bitcoin holdings to seek new types of financial gains. So far, the startup has attracted 200 users and has $10,700 in bitcoin under management to its closed beta.  There, users select investments by identifying their risk preference, whether conservative, moderate or aggressive.  ""We work with advisors to build our portfolios using modern portfolio theory,"" Wealthcoin co-founder Simon Burns told CoinDesk, explaining that such portfolios then mirror indexes such as Nikkei or the S&P 500.  Burns continued:  ""If you wanted to buy into the S&P in local currency, say you want to buy in South African rand, there are products that enable you to track the S&P, so if it goes up 2%, your fund goes up 2% in local currency. We’ve done the same thing but bitcoin is the denomination.""  Burns indicated users can opt out of investments at any time, and that there are no minimums on investment amounts. The startup charges a fee equal to 1% of its assets under management annually, though installments are paid on a monthly basis.  Wealthcoin said that it is currently navigating the ""regulatory approval process"" and that a larger public beta is expected to be available soon.

42378364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1hn,1447269703,Santander and UBS Discuss Blockchain at Bank of England Event,"Swiss investment bank UBS and Spanish megabank Santander discussed blockchain technology at the Bank of England's Open Forum conference in London today.  Jose Maria Fuster, global head of innovation at Santander, commented on the potential of the blockchain to overhaul the financial industry during a panel discussion which aimed to decipher how financial innovation and technology could support the economy.  Fuster said:  ""Blockchain technology is very much related with the bitcoin concept ... this technology is allowing us to create a completely new space of infrastructure to transfer money, to store money and to create smart contracts and to do a lot of things that could fundamentally change the landscape of the financial industry.""  ""This is not something that is going to happen tomorrow,"" he cautioned.  Although bitcoin and blockchain technology went largely unnoticed during the panel, Fuster urged his contemporaries to not lose sight of innovation, acknowledging its significance for the wider financial industry.  ""Innovation is a new concept, but now innovation is a must,"" he said, adding ""If you don't innovate, someone will replace your business model ... Innovation is a strategic tool.""  His remarks come after Santander InnoVentures – the bank's $100 venture capital arm – launched a global blockchain competition in an attempt to support early stage startups working with the technology and its participation in Ripple's Series A $32m funding round.  UBS weighs in on the debate  Bitcoin and the blockchain also featured in a panel discussion about the role of central banks in financial markets, which featured Digital Assets Holdings CEO Blythe Masters and Alex Weber, chairman of investment bank UBS, which announced the launch of its blockchain research laboratory in April.  According to  City.AM, Weber was positive about the benefits of blockchain technology but largely dismissive of digital currencies such as bitcoin, noting that private currencies would fail to succeed ""because there is no lender of last resort – there will always be boom and bust"".  With their comments, Fuster and Weber became the latests additions to a growing number of mainstream financial figures who have publicly lauded the potential of distributed ledger technology and the ways in which it could potentially reshape the finance world.

42378360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1Yz,1447257373,Nobel Prize Committee to 'Discuss' Bitcoin Creator's Nomination,"The prize committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel – known more commonly as the Nobel Prize in Economics – is set to discuss the nomination of bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  The move comes days after UCLA finance professor Bhagwan Chowdhry penned an op-ed in The Huffington Post stating his intention to nominate Nakamoto for the prize. In his widely-covered article, Chowdhry wrote that Nakamoto deserves the prize because his invention, bitcoin, is ""nothing short of revolutionary"".  Following its publication, however, some observers raised the question of whether Chowdhry violated nomination rules by publicly disclosing his intention to back Nakamoto.  When reached for comment, Göran K. Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences – the organization that awards the Nobel Prizes – indicated that the potential rule violation will be discussed.  Hansson told CoinDesk:  ""The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences requests that nominations for the Economics Prize are kept secret. This is clearly stated in the invitation letters sent to nominators. The Prize Committee will now discuss the specific issue.""  Maria von Konow, communications manager for Nobel Media, had previously told CoinDesk that the following rule applies to the nomination process:  “The statutes of the Nobel Foundation restrict disclosure of information about the nominations, whether publicly or privately, for 50 years. The restriction concerns the nominees and nominators, as well as investigations and opinions related to the award of a prize.”  Hansson did not offer specifics on the nature of the forthcoming discussion, and did not immediately respond to further inquiry into possible outcomes.

42378370,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1lZ,1447252235,George Osborne: Digital Currencies Could 'Play Big Part' in Finance,"George Osborne, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, has issued new remarks about digital currencies.  Speaking at the Bank of England's Open Forum conference earlier this morning, Osborne re-emphasised his desire for London to be a world leader in both FinTech and digital currencies.  According to Bloomberg, Osborne commented on the potential of the ""once dismissed"" alternative currencies, saying:  ""[Digital currencies] may now well play a big part in our financial future.""  During his opening remarks, the Chancellor also touched upon the topic of innovation, noting that the UK was committed to ensuring that regulation is not too burdensome.  This is not the first time that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has spoken about digital currencies in public.  In August last year, Osborne announced a new scheme that set out to assess the potential role of cryptocurrencies in Britain's economy, commissioning the UK Treasury to produce a programme relating to cryptocurrencies to weigh both the technology's benefits and risks.  The Chancellor also made headlines last year, after he withdrew £20 worth of bitcoin from an ATM at the London offices of FinTech accelerator Level 39, which is home to Swiss investment bank UBS' blockchain research lab.

42378367,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1fH,1447240738,DDoS Extortionists Demand Bitcoin from Email Providers,"A number of privacy-oriented email service providers have been targeted by distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortionists demanding payment in bitcoin.  Hushmail, ProtonMail and Runbox, among other services, were targeted by an entity calling itself the Armada Collective. The group was the subject of a warning from earlier this fall by the Swiss Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team, a national agency dedicated to cybersecurity issues.  Blog posts from the email providers indicate that the attacks took place between 3rd and 6th November. In the case of ProtonMail, the service paid the demanded ransom after being contacted on 3rd November, but despite the payment it was still targeted with DDoS attacks.  In a new blog post, ProtonMail said that it has ""largely mitigated the DDoS attacks"". Forbes reported yesterday that some of those funds have since been returned to ProtonMail’s bitcoin address, and that it believes the follow-up attacks may have been from a different party.  Hushmail  said that it experienced downtime on 5th and 6th November, and that it was refusing to pay the demanded payment. According to Runbox, an extortion demand was received on the 4th, with the downtime continuing through the 6th.  Affected email providers say they are working with law enforcement agencies, and at least one believes those behind it are starting to regret the action. ProtonMail founder Andy Yen told Forbes in an interview that the extortionists ""know they are being hunted"".
