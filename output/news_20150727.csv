42426431,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxTh,1438029930,Accenture Directors: Blockchains Must Move Beyond Bitcoin,"The idea that bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger technology can somehow be divorced from bitcoin's digital currency has been the subject of debate for some time, and was again the focus of a new article written by directors at technology consulting firm Accenture.  In a new post for CIO Journal, Accenture managing directors Owen Jeff and Sigrid Seibold offered their thoughts on how institutions can begin leveraging the technology in ""corporate environments"" and ""financial marketplaces"".  Jeff and Sigrid asserted that, due to the high cost of paying for transactions that require anonymous consensus, blockchains need to evolve beyond the need for a native token. The critique is notable in its similarity to arguments popularized by the industry's more critical thought leaders like Tim Swanson and Robert Sams that center on the cost of distributed mining.  Jeff and Sigrid wrote:  ""To be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus.""  The Accenture representatives suggested one solution could be permissioned distributed blockchains, of which Ripple may be the most notable example.  The piece goes on to ask a number of other questions that all hit upon a growing divide in the industry. Bitcoin proponents have long argued that bitcoin – or some cryptocurrency – is essential to the design of a blockchain, as blockchains require a mechanism to incentivize distributed recordkeeping, a process that on the bitcoin network is facilitated by largely anonymous miners.  Financial institutions, however, seem interested in exploring alternative private networks for such functionality, or solutions that allow for transaction validators to be known.  Accenture has previously made its interest in the technology public, most recently in its appeal for the UK government to more strongly regulate digital currency wallet providers.  Migrating to blockchain  Obstructing the growth of the technology, the writers said, will also be key decisions by people outside the technology ecosystem. This includes overcoming what they called the lack of regulation surrounding the industry and a lack of clarity as to whether smart contracts would be enforceable by law.  Of note given the recent interest by groups like Nasdaq is that the Accenture employees go on to raise the question of how traditional asset classes might be migrated to a blockchain-based network. Jeff and Sigrid, for example, asked how such assets could be given a clear title and when such a blockchain would begin its recordkeeping.  Still, the authors were, on the whole, optimistic about the idea of distributed ledgers, concluding that the technology presents an ""enormous opportunity"" for the world's banks and financial institutions should it overcome these challenges.  Ultimately, the writers went so far as to predict a future where those who did not investigate the technology early were ultimately unable to compete, concluding:  ""As seats at the table become fewer, only the companies and banks who embraced blockchain’s potential early will remain. Blockchains will bring disruption and displacement, but for the early movers, it will also bring opportunity and growth.""

42426440,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxlh,1438026771,Can Bitcoin Change Wi-Fi For the Better?,"It's certainly not unusual in the bitcoin and blockchain industry to see several companies coalesce around a new use case for the technology. However, what may be novel about the sudden focus on Wi-Fi is the size and ubiquity of the consumer pain point.  To date, startups such as the Boost VC-backed BitMesh and Wi-Fi services provider WIFI Metropolis are both developing concepts around the idea. The consensus? The popularity yet inaccessibility of Wi-Fi networks offers a compelling use case for bitcoin today, one that is more promising when compared to the costs consumers currently bear for data access at home and on-the-go.  ""Wi-Fi is virtually everywhere,"" explained WIFI Metropolis chief Wi-Fi explorer Reilly Smith. ""If you walk around a dense area there's going to be signals, none of which you can really connect to. I pay for data out of convenience because it's such a hassle to deal with Wi-Fi.""  At the heart of both the BitMesh and WIFI Metropolis initiatives is the idea that it could become profitable for businesses and consumers to begin opening their Wi-Fi networks to the public.  As Smith told CoinDesk:  ""For Wi-Fi, there's free and expensive. There's no micropayments middle ground.""  Adding merit to the idea is research from firms like Cisco, which has found that Wi-Fi is the ""predominant access technology for mobile devices"". Due to its cost, paid-for options such as 4G remain unpopular with consumers, Deloitte concurred. Its research found 30% of consumers feel that paid data options like 4G are too expensive.  The case for bitcoin, more specifically, is that it enables low-cost micropayments, which proponents argue are too expensive via traditional payment services. Chris Smith, co-founder of BitMesh, for example, noted that his company has created micropayments channel tech to allow for transactions of a fraction of a cent for Wi-Fi use.  When implemented, Chris Smith foresees a future where a coffee shop may offer its service as a way to better monetize its Internet offerings without forcing people to purchase food or drink.  ""A coffee shop sets up BitMesh, you try to connect to their Wi-Fi and they redirect you to BitMesh,"" he said. ""It turns on, asks you if the price is fair and you can pay by unit of time or per data unit, say 1¢ per megabyte. We create a micropayments channel so you can pay per megabyte, and you set the maximum amount you want to pay.""  First experiments  At present, both services are in the initial stages of rolling out the concepts.  WIFI Metropolis, which currently offers Wi-Fi services to enterprise partners such as St Pancras International station, recently added bitcoin to an app designed to serve as a crowdsourced resource for travelers looking for free Wi-Fi hotspots globally.  With the latter feature, it embarked on a campaign to incentivize new additions to the app while improving the quality of submissions. The success, Smith said, far outpaced a rewards initiative that leveraged Amazon rewards:  ""When we integrated bitcoin, we added 60,000 hotspots and gave away about $7,000 worth of bitcoin.""  Bitcoin allowed WiFi Metropolis users to earn points by adding new hotspots to the map or otherwise integrating them to its network. The tech provided the promise of a universal reward, one that Smith argues eliminated the need to deal with country-specific differences in Amazon rewards, such as striking deals with local Amazon affiliates and integrating the APIs.  Still, bitcoin wasn't a magic bullet solution. ""There was a small pool of hackers trying to find every which way to ... exploit and litter the app,"" he said.  He suggested the problem was so bad the team discovered that one user was simply tagging any hotspot he could find while on a bus trip to Sacramento.  ""About 30% of the hotspots that were being redeemed were just crap,"" he added.  Building a network  Though WIFI Metropolis is arguably looking at more enterprise use cases, BitMesh is pursuing a more grassroots version of the concept.  As Chris Smith explained, BitMesh is built on wireless mesh networking, a type of self-contained computer network that has gained popularity in times when traditional Internet services have failed or proved prone to outages.  [post-quote]  ""It was a technology developed by the military to make more robust, harder to take down computer networks,"" he said. ""In mesh networks, no one node is more important than the others, so if you take out a few nodes, you can't destroy the network.""  Smith's original idea was to create a network of local Internet users who would share the costs of service in an effort to be more economical. Still, he had trouble determining how he could incentivize the users in such a system. ""In retrospect, it's very obvious, you can incentivize it with it bitcoin,"" he recalled.  BitMesh remains focused on the peer-to-peer nature of the currency. In its current, pre-release version, BitMesh doesn't hold customer funds, but rather provides the technology that they can use to pay others in bitcoin for Wi-Fi services.  ""We're looking at it as a way to democratize Internet and get bitcoin in more people's hands. We can sell a Raspberry Pi with a special image on it and now you're collecting bitcoin from your neighbors in exchange for Internet,"" he continued.  To appeal to users who have bitcoin today, BitMesh said it remains focused on being as open-source as it can be, though he suggested the company is considering offering licensing to larger institutions as it develops a revenue model.  BitMesh soon plans to open a private alpha that will allow a limited number of Internet users to begin opening their service to other users with the goal of honing the offering for the public.  An Airbnb solution  Despite the rocky start, Reilly Smith believes it won't be difficult to get consumers to pay for Internet in smaller, known increments, thereby potentially removing the fear of a large unforeseen charge. This factor, he said, is leading WIFI Metropolis to continue to explore the idea of using bitcoin in its services.  ""People sometimes just buy coffee to get Internet,"" Smith explained. ""Businesses are already using captive portals, buy something and you get a code that gets you on the Internet.""  Smith suggested that the blockchain could facilitate an Airbnb or Uber-like marketplace that serves as a clearinghouse between Wi-Fi owners and smartphone users who want to similarly gain access to shared services. Right now, however, he suggests two barriers exist to this kind of service.  First, the tech is still being developed – he projects six-to-eight months before it can be applied to a marketplace. Though, more importantly, he argues it's currently not clear what consumers will want to pay for Wi-Fi, a service that has historically been expected for free.  Smith concluded:  ""Wi-Fi is treated like a cheapest-to-deliver amenity. It's just, can you connect or not? There's no incentive structure to improve your experience at Starbucks. First, we have to derive value and make it user driven.""

42426450,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcy3h,1438021566,8 Banking Giants Embracing Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech,"In its relative short history, bitcoin – and its underlying technology the blockchain – have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone was quick to see the potential.  Due in part to its initial billing as a threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism for the technology.  While major institutions found that bitcoin was perhaps problematic as a currency, they seem to increasingly believe that the blockchain, the protocol that manages and facilitates the exchange of bitcoin, offers benefits over their closed database systems.  With this in mind, big financial players have begun to come forward by discussing experiments with the bitcoin blockchain and other decentralized ledgers.  Though it remains to be seen how these experiments evolve, it's clear that some of the world's most famous banks are moving to leverage the technology.  Here are eight of the biggest institutions to go public with their interest so far:  1. BNP Paribas  French bank BNP Paribas is reportedly looking into the possibility of adding bitcoin to one of its currency funds, according to International Business Times.  The bank's possible involvement in the crypto space follows on from the publication of an article by one of its analysts, Johann Palychata. Writing for Quintessence, the bank's magazine, Palychata noted that the blockchain could either create ""total disruption"" or improve world trading.  CoinDesk reached out to the bank for comment but no reply had been received at the time of press.  2. Société Générale (SocGen)  Another one of France’s banks – the third largest in terms of assets – is looking to hire a bitcoin-focused developer.  Société Générale (SocGen) posted a job listing on 2nd July for an ""IT developer on bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies"".  According to the advertisement, the role would entail research and development involving both cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Although the advert failed to detail specifics and the bank did not immediately reply to a comment request from CoinDesk, it is believed to be looking to develop in-house software.  3. Citi Bank  CoinDesk first learned that Citi had told the UK government to consider creating its own digital currency through a Freedom of Information Request (FOI).  Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, later told International Business Times that the bank – the world's eight largest – had been exploring distributed ledger technology for the last few years.  Moore also revealed that the bank had built three blockchains and was testing its own cryptocurrency – Citicoin – across them.  A sponsor of Consensus, CoinDesk's first conference, Citi will be revealing additional information about its plans with regards to blockchain tech and digital currencies at the event in New York in September.  4. UBS  Swiss investment bank UBS announced it was opening a blockchain technology research lab in one of London's major financial districts earlier this year.  At the time, UBS said the work carried out at the innovation lab would seek to lessen the gap between banking and FinTech so as to determine how traditional banking could grow through innovation.  Oliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS, said in a statement:  “Our innovation Lab at Level39 will provide a unique platform to explore emerging technologies such as blockchain and crypto-currencies, and to understand the potential impact for the industry.”  The news followed the publication of of UBS’ extensive report in March 2014, which outlined the widespread benefits the adoption of bitcoin’s technology could achieve.  5. Barclays  Just last month, Barclays, the British multinational bank revealed plans to trial bitcoin technology.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the bank signed off on a proof-of-concept following an agreement with Safello, a Sweden-based bitcoin exchange.  The aim of the exercise, the bank said, was to investigate how blockchain tech could strengthen the financial services sector.  Barclays has also supported crypto companies in the past. In March this year, the bank accepted three startups working on blockchain-related projects on to its Accelerator.  A month later, Usama Fayyad, chief data officer at Barclays publicly praised blockchain tech, noting its “transformative” potential at SWIFT Business Forum in London.  He stated:  “Underneath [bitcoin] lies the technology of the blockchain and I think that will be transformative.""  6. Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs published a report on digital currencies last year which highlighted the potential of blockchain technology.  Although this report initially dismissed the idea of bitcoin as a currency and labelled it a commodity, a report produced by equity research analysts the following year noted that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were part of a ""megatrend"" which could transform the way in which transactions were carried out.  More recently, the American multinational investment banking firm, participated in Circle Inc's $50m investment round – its involvement in the funding sent the media into a reporting frenzy.  7. Banco Santander  The Spanish banking giant has been experimenting with blockchain technology.  Although its head of research and development is due to reveal more details about its application of the technology at Consensus, we already have some insight into the bank's opinion on blockchain technology.  A report produced by Santander InnoVentures – the bank's venture capital fund – Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group said blockchain technologies could decrease infrastructure costs $15-20bn a year by 2022.  In interview with CoinDesk  , Mariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, said:  ""We shouldn't be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner.""  8. Standard Chartered  Anju Patwardhan, chief innovation officer at Standard Chartered, recently took to LinkedIn to share her opinion on the bitcoin blockchain, noting how it could help reduce credit card, money transfers and remittance costs.  Like others before her, Patwardhan said bitcoin was a distraction from the distributed ledger's benefits and it will never become a viable alternative to fiat currencies.

SETL will use its blockchain, which is ""akin to proof-of-stake"", to let market participants cut out the web of intermediaries in the post-trade system, saving them time and money.  The current clearing and settlement process requires firms to operate across many different ledgers at a total cost of $65–80bn annually.

The list of Wall Street companies exploring how blockchain technologies can disrupt legacy infrastructure is growing longer by the day. However, reservations remain about bitcoin's processing time and pseudonymous nature in a heavily regulated, risk-averse industry.  Unlike bitcoin's blockchain, SETL operates using a 'permissioned' ledger that requires all participants to reveal their full identity to pass due diligence.

The man behind a Mike Tyson-branded bitcoin ATM in Las Vegas has defended the initiative after accusations it was a scam surfaced today.  This weekend, the ex-heavyweight champion of the world tweeted to his 4.89 million followers that the ATM would be ""Changing the way we get change"".  With a launch date of 30th August, the machine promised to offer cash-to-bitcoin services in under 20 seconds, 10 seconds faster than Iron Mike's knockout record.    Coming soon... http://t.co/Blf592VtUW... Changing the way we get change.        — Mike Tyson (@MikeTyson) July 25, 2015      While some hailed the news as good PR for bitcoin, questions about the legitimacy of the project soon surfaced following a closer look at the site's domain owner, Peter Klamka, and the project's partner, Bitcoin Direct LLC.  SiliconANGLE reporter Duncan Riley noted the patchy internet trail of Klamka's firm Bitcoin Brands Inc, an over-the-counter (OTC) stock with a market cap of just $6,780 and no visible product offerings.  Unlike stocks which appear on NASDAQ or the NYSE, OTC stocks – which involve small companies – are unlisted, which can make it difficult to find details about them.  For Riley, this suggested the ATM had the potential to be a scam at Tyson's expense.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Klamka strongly refuted these statements. Under the condition they would not be shared, he supplied three images of the branded ATMs, one showing the Vegas skyline, which he maintained were ready to be launched at any time. Additionally, he told CoinDesk that Tyson has an ""even split"" of equity due to the way the license is structured.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin Brands – which Klamka maintains is not affiliated with his work with Tyson – currently operates two ATMs, one in New York and another in Montreal.  ""Nothing happened yet other than we announced the product. We're not trying to raise any money, he's telling them 'I have an ATM coming' in the same way he says 'I have t-shirts coming', except nobody asks all these questions about the t-shirt maker.""  ""We are not seeking anything other than to get the word out about the coolest way to buy bitcoin,"" he added.  Celebrity connection  According to Nevada records, Bitcoin Direct LLC filed only four months ago, in April 2015. The company, which bills itself as a ""bitcoin transaction solutions provider"" in its press materials, owns two General Bytes ATMs in the Vegas area, Tyson's home, one in a mixed martial arts centrehttp://www.forexminute.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-direct-llc-to-install-bitcoin-atm-in-las-vegas-nevada-60807 and another in a cigar shop.  The company has links to another OTC traded company, beef supplier Conexus Cattle Corp, who bought a controlling stake in May. However, Klamka maintains that is where the relationship ends. ""They are a financing partner ... maybe tomorrow it will be a different entity, maybe not,"" he said.  The reason why the company has no online presence, Klamka said, was due to the fact it had been set up purely for ""celebrity bitcoin licensing"" opportunities. He pointed to various celebrity deals he had made in the past, including a KISS-branded visa card and a Hello Kitty pre-paid debit and credit card. The Tyson ATM, he said, would be the ex-champion's ""George Foreman grill"".",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/27/mike-tyson-bitcoin-atm-owner-hits-back-at-scam-accusations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4834061e723af033c1f97bf81dc71ddfc764ba0-1658x603.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
