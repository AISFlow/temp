42395030,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWmwk,1659998653,BitMEX Executive Pleads Guilty to Violating US Anti-Money Laundering Program,"A high-ranking employee at off-shore, crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX has pleaded guilty for violating a U.S. federal anti-money laundering law, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced Monday.  Gregory Dwyer, who formerly served as BitMEX’s head of business development, pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act for ""failing to establish, implement and maintain an anti-money laundering program” at BitMEX.  The U.S. Attorney previously secured judgments against the firm's three co-founders, Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed. Prosecutors have said that the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) requirements at BitMEX allowed the company to thrive as a hotbed for criminal activity, including money laundering and sanctions evasion.  “Today’s plea reflects that employees with management authority at cryptocurrency exchanges, no less than the founders of such exchanges, cannot willfully disregard their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a press release.  Two years ago, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) slapped BitMex with civil and criminal charges after the firm allowed U.S. residents to trade crypto derivatives on its platform without being registered in the states or having substandard KYC practices. Although the agencies later settled with BitMEX for $100 million last summer, the charges resulted in a change of leadership at the exchange.  According to the plea agreement’s terms, Dwyer agreed to pay a $150,000 fine. The maximum penalty for his crime is five years in prison.

42412233,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3P4s,1659998410,Crypto Options Trading on Solana Has Mostly Fizzled. A New DEX Has a Plan to Change That,"SALT LAKE CITY — Even for traditional finance pros, talk of “portfolio margining” is the kind of thing that’ll make most eyes glaze over.  And yet it’s vital plumbing that helps make conventional markets work. A decentralized finance (DeFi) project building here at the MtnDAO hacker house in Salt Lake City is bringing the concept to cryptocurrency options, hoping that’ll make trading the derivatives on the Solana blockchain more appealing.  Options trading on OptiFi went live Monday, allowing investors to speculate on the future prices of BTC and ETH (SOL is on the way). It’s the first decentralized options exchange on Solana that’s powered by an automated market maker (AMM), something its backers say is only possible because of portfolio margining.  The appeal is that it can make trading less capital intensive. In derivatives, it’s typical to make traders post collateral to back transactions, given the greater risk. With portfolio margining, holdings throughout their portfolio are taken into consideration when calculating how much margin they have to post, often significantly cutting collateral requirements. Money that would’ve otherwise been locked up as collateral can instead be deployed elsewhere.  On-chain trading  A handful of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols built on Solana already offer on-chain options trading, including PsyOptions and Zeta Markets. But there’s not enough liquidity to keep options markets moving smoothly in Solana DeFi, according to some experts.  OptiFi’s pseudonymous founder Pentameal told CoinDesk during an interview in Salt Lake City that the sorry state of on-chain options liquidity prompted him to rethink how to structure his market.  Portfolio margin makes OptiFi more “capital efficient” and thus appealing to market makers, he said. Plus, it increases liquidity on the exchange’s order book and keeps spreads – the gap between prices to buy and sell, and the main way AMMs make money – tight.  “More traders are willing to trade on OptiFi” as a result, Pentameal said.  Only 14 accounts had executed trades by press time Monday, trading a notional amount of around $120,000. Eight accounts had lent their crypto to the protocol’s AMM pools, where they can earn yields.  Still, Pentameal said OptiFi is targeting $20 million in total value locked (TVL) by the fourth quarter, at which point he thinks traders will be moving $1 million to $2 million a day on OptiFi. TVL is a popular metric for activity on DeFi protocols.  For now, Pentameal said OptiFi only takes the USDC stablecoin as collateral. Future updates will see the rollout of a market maker incentive program, too.  “We're increasing AMM liquidity by talking to investors and high net worth individuals,” he said.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/08/crypto-options-trading-on-solana-has-mostly-fizzled-a-new-dex-has-a-plan-to-change-that,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c040afb701178d2e80a11e7f7e535699747fab6c-4868x3651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421119,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUVh,1659998086,Justin Sun Says Proof-of-Work 'Essential' Part of Ethereum,"Always controversial, Tron founder Justin Sun said he thinks the proof-of-work way of operating is an ""essential"" component of Ethereum – just as the Ethereum community readies to transition to a different, proof-of-stake, system after a multi-year effort. Many billions of dollars are at stake.  The crypto entrepreneur still supports Ethereum’s Merge, the much anticipated event that will see Ethereum reborn as a faster and cheaper blockchain, if things go according to plan. But that might be because Sun has since vowed to back what he calls “EthereumPOW,” if the hard work succeeds.  Sun is angling to have the algorithmic stablecoin he designed, USDD, become the first stablecoin in the EthereumPOW ecosystem, he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” The exchange he owns, Poloniex, has already said it will be the first to support EthereumPOW’s native currency.  Sun added that, at least to his knowledge, no other stablecoin issuers have come out in support of EthereumPOW, the blockchain he said will be left behind after the Merge.  “We all want to be the first solution when everybody uses Ethereum proof-of-work post-Merge,” he said on CoinDesk TV.  “I think decentralized stablecoins, like [Tron stablecoin] USDD, [a] decentralized U.S. dollar, is still essential to our industry because, as we all know, all the components of [decentralized finance] today it's all decentralized … except stablecoins,” Sun said.  Sun backs PoW  Sun thinks a PoW version of Ethereum could be a viable competitor among blockchains, even after the vast majority of Ethereum applications and developers move to PoS.  “Proof-of-work actually provides a very good foundation for Ethereum infrastructure,” he said. Not only is it tried and true, he said, it’s probably “essential” for the “whole crypto industry” to have an alternative smart contract-friendly blockchain based on proof-of-work.  He noted that the field is crowded with proof-of-stake chains including Solana, Avalanche and the network he founded, Tron. Meanwhile, the majority of PoW chains – like Monero and Bitcoin – are not useful for building applications or supporting complicated economies like decentralized finance (DeFi).  Sun’s support for the Merge sidesteps criticisms that the forked ETHW chain will see the same problems that plague Ethereum, such as high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, which developers say will be adjusted once the Merge happens.  What’s more, he said ETHW would not be pre-mined, so all airdrop recipients will receive “equivalent” amounts of ETHW following the fork and no developers will be “making more ETHW than other people.”  Read more: Justin Sun Backs Ethereum Hard Fork as Merge Approaches",NEUTRAL,ETH | USDD,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDD | FORKS,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/08/justin-sun-says-proof-of-work-essential-part-of-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f24526e00d050641cfd5b2aab1587172539a50f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In June 2021, the company closed a $100 million Series B round at a $1 billion valuation.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler and edited by CoinDesk.

42411106,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC96c,1659993887,9 Survival Tips for Crypto Winter,"Since you rolled out of bed, how many times have you checked the price of bitcoin? How often have you checked your portfolio? How many podcasts, articles, YouTube videos, Reddit posts or Twitter threads have you devoured to learn about whether the bear market’s “bottom is in”?  If the answer is greater than zero, you might be doing it wrong.  “To mentally be able to survive, you need to tune it out,” says Scott Melker, aka The Wolf of All Streets. He’s telling you to ignore the price, the trading and the obsessive checking of your phone at three in the morning. “None of that is productive in a bear market. It’s literally just giving you an excuse to make a poor emotional decision.”  Other quick tips for surviving Crypto Winter:  Go running. Or swimming. Or hit the gym. Just do something physical  “Health is the real wealth, period,” says Dovey Wan, founder of Primitive Ventures. “The bear market is a great time to focus on self-improvement and get your body and mindset ready for the next run.”  Then you can go one step further and do the following …  Break up with your portfolio tracking app  Dan Clarke, a crypto consultant based in Singapore, says that during the bull run, he was hyper plugged in, spending time on “exotic trades” and “centralized yield farming.”  Then came the bear market. To preserve his sanity, Clarke put a halt to his trading and motorcycled across Indonesia, eventually moving to Bali for a “quieter and more relaxed life.”  Perhaps most important, Clarke deleted his portfolio tracking app. He would go cold turkey, as it’s depressing and deflating to get constant reminders of “how much you are down from your portfolio all-time high.”  Read more: Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget  Avoid the chop  Seasoned traders consider the current market conditions to be “choppy,” the bleakest environment for newbie traders. Or any trader, for that matter. “It’s bad for both short and long biases,” says Melker. He explains that when the price gets to the top of a certain range, “the shorts get liquidated,” and then when the price tumbles back to the bottom, “the longs get liquidated. Rinse and repeat. It’s benefiting no one.”  In other words, unless you’re somehow cranking out consistent winners, maybe quit with the intraday trading.  For God’s sake, avoid leveraged trading  As did Welker, Wan points out that prices tend to “range” in a bear market. She says that the ranges can lead to especially low EVs (expected values) for leveraged trades. “From the stats, we know most retail [traders] with leverage are just ending up in a net loss over time.""  A better option?  If inclined to invest, stick to dollar cost averaging.  Most financial experts – in both crypto and traditional finance – endorse the concept of dollar cost averaging, which is essentially the logic behind automatic payments into a 401(k) plan. It’s a way to passively and automatically invest without stress. And in a bear market, dollar cost averaging can be your hero.  “Dollar cost averaging is price agnostic and market agnostic,” says Melker, adding that it takes advantage of the tendency of markets – over the long run – to climb. Short-term trends are hard to predict. No one knows whether the price will go up or down in the next five minutes. But the next five or 15 years? “The more you zoom out, the more it’s almost guaranteed that the price will eventually rise, which has been the case with effectively any meaningful market in history,” says Melker.  Read more: In Crypto Winter, Jesse Powell’s Pirate-King Leadership Style Might Be the New Normal  There’s no guarantee that the price of bitcoin will eventually go up, of course – and this is not financial advice. But the point is that, if your thesis is that bitcoin is a good long-term investment, “to stop dollar cost averaging now when the price is down defeats the entire purpose,” Melker says.  If (*if*) you believe in the long-term future and price appreciation of bitcoin, you’re scooping it up on the cheap. Enjoy. (Obligatory disclaimer: I am not dollar cost averaging and scooping up bitcoin because I’m a writer who’s just trying to pay the bills, but I do own some bitcoin.)  Research  “I love bear markets,” Elizabeth Stark, the driving force behind Lightning Labs, once told me. “It’s a great time to build. It’s less distracting.”  Waves of crypto entrepreneurs and developers have said something similar, eager for the chance to actually do the work of building cool stuff as opposed to getting swept up in the euphoria of a price bubble.  Melker suggests that even if they’re not exactly building a crypto startup, investors can leverage the same mindset. He says this is the ideal time to “remove the FOMO and the concern about price and the urge to flip from one coin to another.” Instead, dive deeper into research. Which projects have a vibrant developer community? Who’s actually building something meaningful? How active is their GitHub? This is the time to research those questions, says Melker, “to put your head down and figure out where you want to allocate funds.”  On a related note … as for bitcoin itself?  Go even deeper  “The key is to invest in what you know. You should own things you know a lot about,” says Cory Klippsten, founder of Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin-only exchange. The price of bitcoin is volatile. Everyone knows that. If you just bought some bitcoin with the fuzzy hope that the price will go up, that volatility can cause heartburn.  Read more: The Case for Investing in Bitcoin During Crypto Winter  But if you’ve truly done your homework? “You can really only weather these storms with a sense of calm and stoicism if you actually believe in the reasons you hold it,” says Klippsten. “If you can actually contrast [bitcoin] with other forms of money and other asset forms, and actually believe in the strength of what bitcoin is and where it’s going, then it becomes easy.”  Take comfort in the misfortune of others  Melker points out that unlike the crypto bear market of 2018, at the moment, U.S. equities and especially tech stocks are stuck in reverse and that “everyone, everywhere, is feeling the burn.”  Or, if this advice strikes you as cynical, simply think of it as: “Know that you’re not alone.”  Focus on relationships  “Hug your kids and kiss your wife,” says Melker. Or your husband or boyfriend or girlfriend or buddy. The point is to remember that people-action is more important than price-action.

42395043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWnAW,1659993108,Bankrupt Lender Celsius’ Token Surges on Twitter-Driven Short Squeeze,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network’s CEL token jumped to $1.63 on Monday, and is now trading at a higher price than before Celsius encountered financial difficulties and halted user withdrawals.  The CEL token dropped to as low as 15 cents on June 12 when the embattled crypto lender announced that it was halting withdrawals. Its current price marks a tenfold rise in less than two months, and a 300% gain since July 13 when Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection, according to data on crypto intelligence platform Messari.  “It seems that a lot of speculative assets like CEL or even the meme stocks are surging as growth equities are trying to recover,” Brett Sifling, director at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, told CoinDesk.  A community-driven short squeeze organized on Twitter under the #CELShortSqueeze banner likely added to speculation about the token’s price.  Following Celsius’ troubles, many traders bet on a further drop in CEL’s price by shorting the coin on exchanges (listing sell orders). But a group of people spotted an opportunity for a move similar to last year’s GameStop (GME) short squeeze.  Short squeezes are sudden price spikes of embattled assets that force short sellers to buy back at a higher price to cover their positions. The bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Network’s VGX token offers the latest example of short squeezes.  Freezing Celsius’ transfers meant that a large part of the total supply of CEL tokens are locked on the platform, and only a fraction of the tokens trade on exchanges.  FTX hosts about 4.4 million CEL tokens, more than all other exchanges combined, according to a dashboard on crypto data analytics platform Dune. Meanwhile, the open short positions on the exchange amount to three million tokens, a data compilation shows.  The community attempts to pressure short sellers by buying CEL tokens on FTX, withdrawing the digital currency from the exchange to a private wallet and setting a sell order at a sky-high price (some traders promote a $100 price tag).  “Since the circulating supply is very small, it is technically possible to create a short squeeze, although the impact in the overall market could be very limited and hard to sustain over a longer period of time,” Samir Kerbage, crypto asset manager Hashdex’s chief product and technology officer, told CoinDesk.  As the price spiked Monday from $1.43 to as high as $1.63, about 300,000 CEL short positions were closed on FTX and liquidations surpassed $480,000 in the last 24 hours, according to data provided by Coinglass.  While some analysts are optimistic about CEL’s long-term recovery, Kerbage is skeptical about the coin’s future.  “There's limited upside for investors trying to create the squeeze other than activism or show support to Celsius, while there's a big downside: The token can go to zero or Celsius could dump more tokens in the market,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/08/bankrupt-lender-celsius-token-surges-on-twitter-driven-short-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb3df78431fd324954a5fb5b98ec69215f825f38-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411743,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgEj,1659992080,Crypto Credit Cards and Debit Cards: What You Need to Know,"If you already hold some form of cryptocurrency, you may be wondering how and where to spend your digital funds in the real world. From buying a cup of coffee to earning crypto rewards, crypto credit and debit cards can help create a seamless transaction experience holding, earning and spending crypto, and might be the right choice for those of us looking for an easier way to spend our funds.  Here’s how they work.  Crypto debit cards vs. crypto credit cards  The use of crypto credit and debit cards continues to grow, with Visa (V) customers making $2.5 billion in payments in crypto-linked cards in the first fiscal quarter of 2022. Both crypto credit cards and debit cards allow holders to pay for goods and services by converting cryptocurrency into fiat currency at the point of payment.  Crypto debit cards function like traditional debit cards in that they take funds from the account immediately, so the account needs to be topped off using cryptocurrency linked to an individual exchange account or crypto account. Traditionally, users would have to convert their crypto through centralized exchanges, which would then wire them funds that can be spent – a process that can take hours to days. Crypto debit cards allow you to spend your crypto without having to move money around first.  Both Visa and Mastercard (MA) offer crypto debit cards in partnership with well-known exchanges including:  Coinbase Card, a Visa debit card that allows users to earn crypto back on every purchase  BitPay Debit Card, a prepaid Mastercard that instantly reloads your balance with no conversion  Crypto.com Visa Card, a prepaid card that allows users to add funds using bank account transfers, other credit or debit cards, or cryptocurrency  Some crypto debit cards, like the Crypto.com Visa card, require users to stake tokens native to their platforms for a period of time in order to qualify for a card, while other cards, such as the Binance Visa Card, will provide cashback rewards depending on a user’s BNB monthly average balance.  Crypto credit cards are similar to traditional credit cards in that they require an application to be filled out and a credit check before the issuer can allow users to borrow money. In addition, the cards allow you to earn crypto rewards with every purchase, whether in the form of points or cashback.  Most popular crypto credit cards require at least good credit in order to apply. They include:  Gemini Credit Card, which allows users to earn rewards in over 60 cryptocurrencies with no annual fee  BlockFi Rewards Visa Signature Card, which has no annual fee or foreign transaction fees and offers 1.5% back in crypto on every purchase  Nexo Card, which deducts purchases from your available credit line, using digital assets as collateral.  Are crypto debit or credit cards worth getting?  Crypto credit and debit cards have come a long way since they were introduced several years ago. Visa announced last year that it had partnered with 50 of the leading crypto platforms on card programs that allow for the seamless conversion of digital currency to fiat currency worldwide, while Mastercard offers real-time use of digital currency across over 90 million acceptance locations.  Both crypto debit and credit cards allow ATM withdrawals and are widely accepted worldwide, though there are a few things to be aware of:  Volatility: Because most cryptocurrencies are volatile, the rewards you earn in crypto may change in value depending on market conditions, as opposed to rewards points or miles, which mostly stay at a fixed rate.  Taxes: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service classifies cryptocurrency as “property” for tax purposes. Each time you use a crypto debit card, it may be considered a taxable event. While rewards are not taxable, you may be required to report gains or losses from using your card on your tax return.  Cryptocurrency offerings: Each card offers a different portfolio of cryptocurrencies, so be sure to choose a card that supports the currency in which you’d like to invest.  Limitations: Different crypto cards may have regional restrictions depending on local laws, or may not be available in every jurisdiction.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to get a crypto credit or debit card comes down to your spending habits and financial portfolio. When choosing the right card, it’s important to consider the rewards rates, spending limits, regional restrictions and other requirements like staking, in addition to which platform the card is linked to and which cryptocurrencies you interact with the most.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-credit-cards-and-debit-cards-what-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae91c01970a98de564a00f67a0a13fe54a0a4715-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWnBV,1659991275,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Climbs Above $24K,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued its ascension on Monday, rising 3% on average volume. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surpassed $24,000 earlier in the day and remained above that threshold in the afternoon.  BTC’s hourly charts (below) show that the bulk of the push higher occurred between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. UTC time before the price steadied.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Bitcoin's gains have for the most part dovetailed with traditional markets. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, meanwhile, fell 0.10% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.12%. Correlations between BTC and the three indexes remain above 0.60, indicating a strong relationship between BTC price movements and stocks.  Correlations range between -1 and 1, with higher figures signaling a stronger relationship. Investors often consider those correlations when the price movement in one group of assets outpaces the price movement in another.  Because BTC’s spike occurred outside of U.S. trading hours, traders may be watching whether the cryptocurrency's price continues to align with equities.  Ether (ETH) was recently up 3.5%. Most of the increase also came during overnight hours in the U.S.  Altcoins rose, as well, with avalanche (AVAX) up 2% and chainlink (LINK), up 9%.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,929 +3.1%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,784 +4.1%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,140.06 −0.1%      ●Gold: $1,806 per troy ounce +1.9%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.77% −0.07       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin’s hourly chart moves into overbought territory, reverses course intraday  Investors continued to eye hourly and daily charts for signs of the crypto market’s future direction, which remains on tenterhooks amid mixed economic data. BTC’s hourly chart showed significant trading activity from 10 a.m. to noon (UTC) on above-average volume.  During that period, bitcoin rose about 3% with U.S. markets opening to bitcoin trading over $24,000. The 10-period relative strength index (RSI) rose to 83 as bitcoin’s price increased. RSI is a technical indicator that measures price momentum.  Readings below 30 imply that an asset is oversold, while a reading above 70 implies that an asset is overbought. BTC prices appear to have retreated following the RSI reading of 83 that occurred during the 4 a.m. candle. A candle is a visual image on charts to describe a price hike.  Bitcoin’s daily chart provides additional context to today’s move  BTC prices should continue to advance along a trendline noted in the Aug. 3 Market Wrap. BTC’s price could crack $28,000, although investors shouldn’t interpret that market as a price target.  Trendlines can be useful to traders in determining the direction and strength of a price move, particularly when used in conjunction with other technical indicators.  The trendline here is being used jointly with the RSI. The overbought reading (see chart above) showed an overbought reading of 70, but the daily chart shows a reading of 60, which falls below the overbought threshold.  BTC prices appear to have retraced from their sharp uptick in early morning trading, while maintaining what appears to be a general uptrend that began around July 13.  Derivatives markets also indicate a positive sentiment  BTC funding rates have turned positive again, following a brief turn negative on Aug. 3. Funding rates represent payments to traders who are long or short bitcoin. Those payments serve as a proxy for market sentiment.  A positive funding rate implies that traders who wish to be long BTC (have a positive view of the digital currency) are willing to pay traders who are short (have a negative view). Negative funding rates imply the reverse.  All told, positive funding rates often imply that crypto traders are bullish. BTC funding rates have been positive for all but five days since July 1.

42395028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWmvl,1659991041,Bitcoin Miner Marathon to Start Energizing Texas Rigs at Compute North Facility,"Marathon Digital (MARA), alongside disappointing Q2 results, said it's finally begun energizing its fleet at a Compute North facility in west Texas.  ""Energization delays, maintenance and weather issues in Montana, and an approximately 56% decline in the price of bitcoin during the quarter, severely impacted our bitcoin production and financial results,"" CEO Fred Thiel said in the company's Q2 earnings report, released Monday.  On the earnings call, Thiel spoke of the challenging conditions both for the mining industry in general and specifically for Marathon.  Among those challenges for Marathon have been about 40,000 mining rigs previously installed in a Compute North facility in Texas that have been sitting idly as the hosting firm was waiting for its energy provider to receive tax-exempt approval status.  Compute North has now energized 40 megawatts (MW) of a 280MW wind-powered facility in Upton County in West Texas, according to the Monday earnings release. Marathon will be the exclusive client of this site, which is Compute North’s fifth TIER 0™ site, said the statement. The rest of the 280MW will be coming online in phases, with ""full energization autumn 2022,"" Dave Perrill, CEO and co-founder of Compute North told CoinDesk.  There are currently 40,000 mining rigs at the Compute North facility, which will be coming online in 20MW chunks, with all expected to be energized by the end of September, Thiel said on Monday's call.  Mining at the TIER 0™ facility will be behind-the-meter, meaning the energy will not be transmitted through the grid, but the site will curtail its energy consumption when demand is peaking throughout the grid, Perrill added.  In June, a Montana storm and related power outage led to about 30,000 of Marathon’s miners, or 75% of its fleet, going offline.  Marathon reported mining revenue in Q2 of $24.9 million, which fell by 15% compared with the same period last year and missed the average analyst estimate of $38.8 million, according to FactSet data.  While operational issues in Texas and Montana took a bite out of revenues, the fall in the price of bitcoin led to a $127.6 million impairment charge on company holdings, which now stand at 10,055 bitcoin after production of 707 in Q2.  The firm noted a net loss of $191.6 million in the quarter, up from $108.9 million in the same period last year, mainly due to the decline in bitcoin prices and costs associated with exiting from Montana. The loss was mitigated by the sale of $87 million in equipment, Marathon Chief Financial Officer Hugh Gallagher said in the earnings call.  The miner reiterated guidance that it will reach 23.3EH/s (exahashes per second) in computing power by mid-2023, noting that it has signed enough hosting agreements to help reach that goal.  Shares were down modestly in after-hours action, and remain lower by about 60% year-to-date, in line with most bitcoin mining peers.  In December 2021, Compute North agreed to host 100,000 of Marathon’s mining rigs. MARA also signed a 200MW hosting agreement with Applied Blockchain in July.  Given these hosting deals and the state of the related facilities, deliveries of new machines will be a bigger determinant of growth rather than construction and energization, Thiel said on the call.

Respondents saw inflation running at 6.2% in 2023, down from June expectations that it would run at a 6.8% rate, according to the report, which was released Monday.  It's the largest one-month drop since the New York Fed first conducted the survey in 2013 and reflects the latest hopes that inflation could soon be under control.  Over the next three years, survey participants expect inflation to decrease to 3.2%, largely because of tumbling gas prices, which respondents see increasing by only 1.5% over the next year. Over a five-year period, Americans see inflation running at 2.3%, which would be slightly above the Fed’s target, or neutral rate, of 2%.  Crypto and other investors widely expect the Fed to raise the interest rate aggressively in September as part of an ongoing campaign to tame inflation, which has surged this year. Consumer assumptions typically move in tandem with inflation, which explains why the Fed monitors the survey closely.

Investors in the round included crypto venture-capital firms Coinbase Ventures and FBG Capital, as well as startup incubator YCombinator.  Cashmere is intended to help companies store their crypto assets securely, protecting the assets even if “hot” wallets like the Solana-based Phantom or Slope get compromised, according to a statement.  Cashmere allows firms to use multi-signature signing to jointly control their company wallets. In a multisig signing scheme, several wallets need to approve a transaction before the funds can be moved out of Cashmere. That removes a single point of failure, resulting in a safer self-custody option, according to the company.  The project’s latest fundraising comes as wallet security on Solana has become a major concern. Last week a hacker accessed more than 8,000 Solana wallets, draining over $5 million in funds.  Read More: Solana Wallets Targeted in Latest Multimillion-Dollar Hack  “We built Cashmere to offer Solana users institutional-grade security without having to rely on cold storage solutions,” said Cashmere co-founder Shashank Khanna. Cold storage means using an external drive. Although that can be safer than internet-based hot storage, it may be impractical for businesses or institutional treasuries that are typically managed by a team.  “Soon after our launch six months ago, we saw big name startups like [non-fungible token] marketplace OpenSea organically sign up for our product,"" Khanna said. He said Cashmere’s clients also include crypto hedge funds, NFT projects and gaming companies.  In November 2021, Cashmere raised a $650,000 pre-seed funding round that was led by Wonder Ventures and Notation Capital.  Other participants in the new funding round include Volt Capital, Project Serum, Global Founders Capital, CreditEase and Soma Capital.  Cashmere co-founder Charlotte McGinn told CoinDesk the company plans to use the funds to hire more engineers and launch a premium product for institutions later this year.  “Crypto began as a space of highly technical people who are comfortable with encryption and hardware wallets,” McGinn. “However, as it’s gained more mainstream adoption, we’re seeing a hugely unmet need for secure solutions for less technical people.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/08/cashmere-raises-3m-seed-at-30m-valuation-to-build-solana-enterprise-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d54f7c485397f93da185aebd16ac89c1a9de9e79-4160x3120.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411427,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNei2,1659987455,"Ethereum Is Getting Cheaper to Use, Even Before the Merge","Ethereum fees are at their lowest level in two years. This has happened ahead of a much-anticipated event known as the Merge, which is widely seen to be driving up the price of its cryptocurrency, ether (ETH).  The average cost for a transaction is under 12.5 gwei, a unit of account that represents a fraction of an ETH used to measure the gas (or transaction fees) needed to run Ethereum. That’s less than half the gwei needed to use Ethereum at the end of July.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This is good news for Ethereum users, who have long and rightfully complained about the network’s fees. However, there are fewer users around to benefit. Costs are down because demand is, too.  Despite declining use, Ethereum itself is increasingly seen as a bullish bet. Developers have formalized a timeline to transition the network to proof-of-stake (PoS) next month, which will radically change its cost structure – making it theoretically more efficient and cheaper to use.  See also: The 'Merge Trade' Has Begun, Experts Say  There are some who also anticipate Ethereum’s transition could make the network deflationary – in that it might eventually burn more tokens than it prints, thereby increasing the value of any ETH you hold. Right now, no one knows Ethereum’s total supply, which is not fixed like Bitcoin’s.  But there’s a wrinkle, as The Defiant’s Samual Haig noted. Declining on-chain use means the network is burning fewer tokens. He brings this up to cast doubt on the “deflationary narrative” that might, in part, be influencing buyers.  Indeed, there’s a large contingent of Ethereum boosters who say that ether is “ultra-sound money.” Not only is it the currency to power the “world computer,” but also an investment to rival BTC’s “digital gold.” Others, like the CoinList exchange, are less kool-aidy, but still think the Merge is “a fundamental, structural change” that will likely make Ethereum deflationary.  Last year, to lower network costs, Ethereum developers released EIP-1559 (those letters stand for Ethereum Improvement Proposal), which introduced a burning mechanism to take ether out of circulation. This operates by burning a portion of transaction fees, and adjusts based on block space and on-chain activity.  See also: EIP 1559 Hasn’t Affected Ethereum Miner Revenue  Since EIP-1559, Ethereum indeed has recorded deflationary days and even weeks. This is usually correlated with market rallies, or sometimes bizarrely successful non-fungible token (NFT) mints. Some 58,000 ETH (worth about $160 million at the time) were burned after Yuga Labs’ Otherdeeds sale, the most active NFT launch to date, Haig noted.  But Ethereum has burned only about 7,500 ETH over the past week – the lowest level yet – due to declining on-chain use. Haig reported that if this trend continues, the network would not be deflationary post-Merge. (Estimates vary, but it's expected that 1,649 ETH will come into circulation under PoS.)  “Demand for block space must increase by roughly one-third from current levels in order for the burn rate to keep pace with post-merge ether issuance,” Haig wrote Aug. 8.  That’s not to say Ethereum will never be deflationary, but if you zoom out on the chart today’s low fees/usage appear to be the steady state of a blockchain running outside of a bull run. From the network’s founding in 2017 to the middle of 2020, network fees generally kept below 20 gwei.  That was until Compound kick-started the yield-farming palooza that was known as “DeFi Summer.” Average transaction fees spiked to over 700 gwei then, the highest ever, and have been trending down ever since. Curiously, the 2017-2018 bull run – which accelerated PoS development on Ethereum after CryptoKitties clogged the chain – is hardly represented.  Historic network fees are not a perfect proxy for actual use, especially considering how many changes have been implemented to Ethereum’s issuance and cost structures over the years. Further, it’s entirely unknown how the network’s transition will influence demand. Costs will come down, but as we see today that’s not enough for people to rush to perform transactions.  Perhaps the network will flood with people who were curious about crypto but did not want to use it due to concerns over its carbon footprint.  See also: Is the Ethereum 'Merge' Driving This Rally? | Opinion  For now, all we can note is that the cost to use Ethereum today is approaching the average price during bear markets. If that means post-Merge Ethereum will be as deflationary as it is today (that’s to say, sporadically, based on demand), then so be it.

42411754,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgfB,1659986653,Can You Buy NFTs Without Owning Crypto?,"You probably closely associate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with crypto. They are, after all, a type of crypto token themselves. But if you’re a little wary of cryptocurrency, don’t let that shut you out of the NFT market: You can now buy NFTs with dollars or any other fiat currency. Here’s how.  How to buy NFTs with U.S. dollars  Let’s take two of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces as examples.  On OpenSea, you click to buy the asset you want, then select the option to use a card at checkout. Next, you'll be asked to check out using the crypto-payment platform Moonpay, which – behind the scenes – buys cryptocurrency via your fiat and uses that crypto to pay the seller.  On Rarible, you click to buy the asset. It will give the Ethereum price at that point, but don’t worry – the next step is to select ""Add funds with VISA"" or another card. At that point, it will tell you the full price in dollars and Rarible’s payments partner Wert deals with the exchange.  You will still need to connect a crypto wallet to the NFT marketplace beforehand in order to receive the NFT once you’ve purchased it.  What are the barriers to buying NFT without crypto?  There are still big limitations for those who want to purchase NFTs without owning crypto: You can only use dollars in certain places, under certain conditions, for certain NFTs.  OpenSea’s debit or credit card option is not available in all U.S. states or countries in the world. New York and Texas are two big blind spots, with the peculiar caveat that you can use a card in Texas if the payment is in Polygon (MATIC) rather than Ethereum. It’s not available if you’re in Japan, China, Hong Kong or a number of other places either.  Rarible does let you use your regular bank card in almost every country in the world. But you can employ it only to buy NFTs for a fixed price, not to take part in auctions.  You also have to jump through additional know-your-customer security hoops. On OpenSea, you will need to verify your identity with Moonpay directly before you can pay as described above. The payments firm is a completely separate entity from the marketplace. You have to do the same with Wert on Rarible. This is a result of the marketplaces avoiding doing the currency conversion themselves.  And if you do push through those other barriers, you’ll find you have to pay extra fees to buy NFTs with dollars. Moonpay charges its own fees on top of your credit card fees. If the crypto in question is Ethereum, you will find yourself paying Ethereum gas fees too. On Rarible, there is a fixed 2.5% service fee and 4% Wert fee on top of potential credit card and gas fees.  Recent developments in the ways people can buy NFTs  The use of regular bank cards on NFT marketplaces only began in earnest in late 2021.  It was in September 2021 that Rarible announced it had partnered with Visa, Mastercard and Wert to support payments with conventional debit and credit cards. OpenSea partnered with Moonpay in 2022.  That same year, Coinbase announced a partnership with Mastercard in the same vein. At the time of this writing, it does not appear to have been implemented; Coinbase’s NFT marketplace still says you need Ethereum to buy NFTs.  But things are moving behind the scenes.  In June 2022, Mastercard itself said it was working with a whole range of crypto firms to allow its cardholders to buy NFTs on a range of marketplaces. One of its collaborators is Moonpay. Mastercard says that it's found 45% of survey respondents across 40 countries had either bought an NFT or would consider doing so.  The potential impact on demand for NFTs is easy to see. The population interested in NFTs does not necessarily overlap exactly with the population comfortable holding cryptocurrencies. This is likely to be especially true now that the applications of NFTs are spreading rapidly through the economy. The possibility of buying the assets without first converting your currency could significantly reduce barriers to participation for many.

Source- Tradingview CAKE Technical Analysis Earlier this week, the CAKE price witnessed a rise in buying pressure undermining the sellers at $4.27. However, the breakout rally shows a higher price rejection in the daily candle teasing a retracement to retest $4.27. The fall of bearish opposition by the 100-day SMA remains a crucial buying signal as it unleashes the trapped bullish momentum. The RSI slope displays a gradual rising trend in the overbought zone with the support of the 14-day SMA line. Hence the technical indicator maintains a bullish outlook for the upcoming price trend.

Worthington pointed out that bullish catalysts involving more limited new contagion from May&apos;s meltdown of digital tokens TerraUST (UST-USD) and Luna (LUNA-USD) supported the upswings in major cryptos. While bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped 21% in July, ether (ETH-USD) soared nearly 59% as positive news surrounding Ether&apos;s transition to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-of-Work spread throughout the cryptoverse.

The opposite might happen at ETH&apos;s price current levels, the market could see a bear assault with new strength.

Fondo, who is now a partner at the law firm of Goodwin Procter, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover"" program Monday that although the bill could prove to be significant, “it’s still pretty vague.”  He said there are no clear boundaries between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on regulating digital assets.  “Do I think it will end the uncertainty? Not totally, at all,” Fondo said of the Senate's bill.  Fondo’s comments follow the push from key U.S. senators to give crypto market oversight to the CFTC, the commodities regulator. The bill, however, is vague on defining whether tokens are considered securities or commodities. Securities are overseen by the SEC.  The bill describes bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as commodities that would fall under the CFTC’s jurisdiction, and so it does provide some regulatory clarity, Fondo said.  “I think it helps to potentially, should it get enacted, provide some certainty as to bitcoin and ether,” he said. The two cryptocurrencies make up over 50% of the market’s volume, he added.  Should the bill move forward, boundaries setting which agency regulates what will still need to be created. As for defining who regulates other tokens besides BTC and ETH, Fondo said it would be wise for altcoin issuers to “assume the SEC will actively potentially police” them, should the SEC get that power.  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said his agency already has the power to regulate most tokens, which he says fit the legal definition of securities.  When it comes to non-fungible tokens (NFT), Fondo says those digital assets fall into a “different bucket,” noting the “SEC has made statements that they’re not securities.”  If NFTs begin to be offered as “traditional financial products” rather than as “pieces of art,” the CFTC could be prompted to step in, Fondo said.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised eyebrows Monday when he tweeted that the U.S. Treasury Department had ""sanctioned virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, which is a U.S.-sanctioned, [Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name] state-sponsored hacking group, used by the DPRK to launder money.""  One hour and three minutes later, the tweet had been deleted and replaced with what the Treasury Department actuallyalleged earlier that day: Tornado Cash was used by a North Korean hacking group to launder funds.

In particular, a senior Treasury official said Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking entity, had moved hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of crypto stolen from various exchange and bridge hacks through Tornado Cash.

42393798,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBLJV,1659978785,US Government Amps Up Inevitable Clash With Crypto Privacy in Tornado Cash Blacklisting,"The instant Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008, it was certain there'd be a clash between cryptocurrency's privacy ethos and conventional banking regulations designed to ensure money moving through the financial system isn't coming from, or going toward, something illegal.  Step by step, bank overseers have widened their enforcement territory to include digital assets. In one sense, crypto was their dream financial system, with the path of most transactions auditable on a public ledger, albeit with the identities of senders and receivers hidden behind alphanumeric addresses that looked like they’d been typed by a cat crawling on a keyboard. If the users bought or cashed out their crypto at regulated exchanges, governments could subpoena those companies for their real-world identities.  Crypto enthusiasts responded with new ways to obfuscate the origins and destinations of transactions. Tornado Cash, for instance, mixes its users' coins together so the actions of individuals are hard to track.  When the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted Tornado Cash on Monday, banning all Americans from using the service, regulators dramatically escalated that battle as they seek to squash the free-wheeling (if imperfect) anonymity of crypto. The U.S. said Tornado Cash has been used to launder more than $7 billion. That includes $455 million stolen by Lazarus Group, the North Korean hacking group, and at least $7.8 million from this month’s Nomad exploit.  ""The crypto space talks about wanting to go mainstream and be a new financial system,"" said Yaya Fanusie, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who also consults on crypto money-laundering safeguards and is a former CIA analyst. ""If you want to play in the big leagues, you're going to have to play with big regulation. Mixers are by themselves not illegal nor illicit. What's illicit is how a tool is used.""  Everyone from traditional finance knows the drill: Financial firms are required to figure out who their customers are and take steps to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Opening a bank or brokerage account? You've got to have an ID. Over in crypto, meanwhile, anonymity is a tent pole of the culture, so the drive to create something like Tornado Cash is no surprise.  Read more: What Is KYC and Why Does It Matter For Crypto?  A co-founder of Tornado Cash told CoinDesk earlier this year that the technology was basically unstoppable. The developers behind Tornado Cash had little control over what users did through it, Roman Semenov said in an interview published in January. ""There is not much we can do in terms of helping investigations because the team doesn't have much control over the protocol,"" he said.  But U.S. financial regulators are trying to prove Semenov wrong through the action announced Monday – though the code that runs the project is publicly available, so in theory someone else could start a clone or just use different Ethereum addresses than the ones the Treasury Department blacklisted. Tornado Cash was added to the Specially Designated Nationals list, meaning Americans face criminal penalties if they interact with Tornado Cash or Ethereum addresses tied to the protocol. Among other uses, the SDN list is one of the tools the U.S. government has used to punish Russia.  The crackdown does raise a question that's long swirled around crypto: Paper money is anonymous, just like crypto, so why are attempts to cover tracks in crypto being singled out? A natural retort is that money laundering and sanctions evasion are what's being targeted here, just as they would be with real U.S. dollar bills.  ""Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors on a regular basis and without basic measures to address its risks,"" Undersecretary of the Treasury Department's Terrorism and Financial Intelligence agency Brian E. Nelson said in a statement Monday.  But that's not likely to quiet the calls of crypto enthusiasts who want to retain user privacy. Coin Center, a crypto think tank, blasted the action taken against Tornado Coin.  ""It is not any specific bad actor who is being sanctioned, but instead it is all Americans who may wish to use this automated tool in order to protect their own privacy while transacting online who are having their liberty curtailed without the benefit of any due process,"" it wrote in the aftermath of the announcement.

42411408,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNdnp,1659978044,"How to Stop Forsage, Meta Force and Other Smart Contract Pyramid Schemes","Last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged 11 individuals with creating and marketing Forsage, the world’s largest and longest-running smart contract-based pyramid scheme.  Alas, Lado Okhotnikov, the ring leader of Forsage and rumored to be based in the Republic of Georgia, remains at large. And while the original Forsage smart contracts are nowhere near as popular as they once were, they continue to welcome new money, SEC be damned.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  Worse, Okhotnikov's new smartcontract pyramid, Meta Force, continues to grow. Over $42 million in DAI stablecoins have been deposited into Meta Force by unwitting investors since the alleged scam debuted a month ago.  Smart contract pyramid schemers like Okhotnikov prey on the weak and vulnerable. What can we do to better fight them?  A quick history of smart contract-based pyramids  A pyramid scheme is an illegal business model where returns to existing investors are generated from newly recruited investors' money or fees. They are ultimately unsustainable because the supply of new investors is finite.  Read more: SEC Slaps Founders, Promoters of Alleged Ponzi Scheme Forsage With Fraud Charges  Pyramid schemes have existed for centuries. But pyramid schemers quickly realized the benefits of blockchain technology. MMM Global, a pyramid that tore through Nigeria, India, China and other developing nations through 2014 to 2016, used bitcoin (BTC) for payments. A group of researchers who studied the pyramid found that, at its peak, MMM Global was processing $150 million per day.  The advantages of bitcoin are clear. While authorities can shut down a pyramid scheme by leaning on its payments processors or bank, the Bitcoin blockchain can't be turned off.  The rollout of Ethereum led to the next big innovation in pyramids: the smart contract pyramid scheme. In addition to relying on blockchains for payments, this type of alleged scam built its pyramid apparatus on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.  There are advantages to using a smart contract to run a pyramid. The entire back office structure can be automated using code, which makes administration easier for the scammer. It also allows the pyramid to be marketed as an ""honest"" Ponzi; that is, because it is implemented by code rather than by hand, it can be said to always run correctly.  Furthermore, because that code is public, it can – in theory, at least – be audited by users.  Smart contract pyramids are safer for the scammer to run than traditional pyramids because they afford a degree of anonymity. And while the authorities can shut down a traditional pyramid by visiting the office out of which it operates, building it on Ethereum makes it much harder to stop.  Smart contract pyramids soon became endemic to Ethereum. A 2019 study by a group of Italian researchers cataloged 184 smart contract pyramids in play at the time.  Most of these were quite small. It was Lado Okhotnikov's Forsage that broke the mold. Forsage's first Ethereum smart contract, x3/x4, would process almost $240 million in payments in 2020. At one point it was Ethereum's second busiest contract, after tether.  Ethereum gas fees would soon rise, forcing alleged pyramid alleged scammers like Okhotnikov to migrate to cheaper blockchains. Over the next few years Okhotnikov launched five other smart contract Ponzis on the Tron and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. Recently, scammers have begun to move back to Ethereum thanks to level 2, or subsidiary blockchain, systems that have lowered costs. In Okhotnikov's case, he has set up his newest pyramid, Meta Force, on the Polygon Network.  A forensic analysis of Forsage  Thanks to the transparency of blockchains, Sarah Meiklejohn and other researchers carried out a precise analysis of Forsage’s payouts and losses, focusing on the $240 million Ethereum x3/x4 contract.  Read more: JP Koning - The $10B Stablecoin Industry Has a Fraud Problem It's Not Addressing  While the founders boasted that the system was transparent and open source, it took the researchers weeks of effort to understand the code, which meant that almost no Forsage participants could have actually audited the smart contract. So much for transparency.  Meiklejohn et al. found that the system had been coded at the outset to benefit only a few people. For instance, participants had to buy slots that offered the right to get payments from new recruits. After recruiting three participants, a slot would be blocked and the recruiter had to pay fees to reopen it and receive payment. The organizers’ slots, however, were coded to be exempt from this rule.  The SEC found that Okhotnikov had coded one of his subsequent pyramids, Ethereum xGold, to divert a portion of investor funds to a wallet that was not associated with a Forsage ID. This contradicted Okhotnikov’s representation that all funds were paid out to investors. By 2022, that address had diverted over 1,000 ETH.  In the end, Meiklejohn et al. report that 1 million Forsage accounts lost money, a remarkable 88% failure rate. The top 1,000 users made 50% of all profits. Okhotnikov and his fellow cofounders capitalized by positioning themselves at the top of the pyramid. The SEC accuses them of owning the best five spots in the x3/x4 Forsage pyramid, the topmost of which earned 5409 ether (ETH), well over $1 million, according to Meiklejohn et al.  Okhotnikov and his colleagues aggressively marketed their scams on social media. Forsage's official YouTube channel, which is now dedicated to the new Meta Force pyramid, currently has over 47,000 subscribers. The most popular Forsage video, which is in Hindi, has been viewed 384,000 times. This is despite YouTube's terms of service having a blanket ban on marketing pyramid schemes.  In their paper, Meiklejohn and her colleagues traced the location of most of the victims of Forsage to developing nations, in particular Nigeria, Philippines and Venezuela. This reveals these alleged scams for what they are: a way for a few rich people to steal from the poor and vulnerable. They need to be stopped. But how?  What can be done?  Because smart contract pyramids are built on censorship-resistant blockchains, they can't be attacked at the root, nor can they be undermined indirectly by removing them from the payments system.  Writing on CoinDesk, Lex Sokolin has proposed that white hat hackers organize to find vulnerabilities in smart contract pyramids and bring them down. It's a nice idea, but so far white hat hackers haven't shown much interest in chasing after pyramids.  The SEC should also consider fighting like with like  Perhaps the most effective way to hurt smart contract Ponzis is by attacking their reputation. The SEC's charges will certainly help on this front. Now when a potential victim searches for Okhotnikov or one of his ""investment"" products, they'll have the opinion of the world's largest securities regulator to rely on.  The good news is that the SEC's actions seem to have had an effect. The rate of deposits to Okhotnikov's newest (alleged) scam, Meta Force, which has already attracted $42 million in deposits, began to decline the day after charges were announced. On YouTube, a nervous Lado Okhotnikov described the SEC’s charges as slander and defamation.  But we needed the SEC to begin its attack long ago. Publishing a cease and desist early on, like securities regulators in Montana and the Philippines did, would have helped tarnish Okhotnikov's reputation before his alleged scams could hurt more people.  Regulators like the SEC should try to harness the transparency of blockchains to their advantage. It's possible to see these things popping up and monitor how big they get, so regulators can very quickly mobilize resources to combat them.  The SEC should also consider fighting like with like. Smart contract Ponzi scams spread through garish videos on YouTube. Alas, the SEC didn't post its charges to its YouTube channel. A catchy video about Forsage would go much further than a terse tweet.  Finally, influential blockchain personalities like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao should step up and speak out against smart contract Ponzis when they crop up. They may not wish to do so, because admitting the problem may attract negative attention to the technology. But addressing these scams as early as possible will not only reduce damage to innocent people, it will also limit damage to the long-term reputation of blockchains.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/08/how-to-stop-forsage-meta-force-and-other-smart-contract-pyramid-schemes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a79af4a9e9139881e583e2e2eb5933b0c400a18c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency had been able to beat the $24,000 mark last week but had retraced downward not long after. However, this retracement has not had too much of a negative impact on the sentiment toward the digital asset. As bitcoin has started upwards once more, the market sentiment has been incredibly strong.

42395069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWq7W,1659972769,Ether's Deepest 'Backwardation' Since 2020 Crash Shows Traders Prepping for Ethereum PoW Split,"Ether's (ETH) futures market showed ""backwardation"" on Monday, with three-month contracts trading at the widest discount to the spot price since the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  Data provided by Skew showed Binance-listed three-month futures traded at a steep annualized discount of 6% to the spot price, while those on the OKEx and FTX exchanges changed hands at a discount of over 4%. The premium, or contango, evaporated early this month.  This so-called backwardation seemingly stemmed from traders taking short positions to protect their bullish spot market exposure from ""Merge""-induced price turbulence and safely earn free money from a potential hard fork. Futures markets are typically in ""contango,"" where contracts for future months draw a higher price than the spot level, representing the time value of money and cost of storage.  Ethereum's impending Merge – a supposedly ETH-bullish network upgrade that will combine the current proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain with the proof-of-stake (PoS) Beacon Chain that went live in December 2020 – is likely to happen in September. Last month, Ethereum founder Tim Beiko mentioned Sept. 19 as the tentative date for the Merge. Although ether is rallying ahead of the event, the upgrade may not be smooth.  Prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo is against the Merge and favors maintaining a PoW version of the network post-upgrade. If Guo's movement gathers traction, the chain could fork or split into two, with the new PoS chain retaining ETH as the native token and the old PoW chain launching its own ETH PoW token. In any case, ETH holders at the time of the fork will receive the ETH PoW tokens for free.  ""The ETH futures market has been digesting the possibility, as basis is currently negative, coalescing around the December 2022 expiry,"" said Ainsley To, a senior research analyst at Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  ""This reflects hedging demand from the popular trade of the moment –long ETH via the spot market to be eligible for the ETH PoW token in event of a potential fork, and hedging the exposure via ETH futures,"" To said.  Singapore-based crypto derivatives giant QCP Capital voiced a similar opinion last week, saying that ""holding spot ETH would gain an additional valuable ETH PoW token without taking any price risk on ETH as the long position is hedged by the short futures.""  QCP holds a large position in this so-called risk-free trade. Expecting the backwardation to deepen as the Merge nears, the firm announced on its Telegram-based channel that it intends to hold the position for some time.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin doesn't expect a potential hard fork to have a lasting impact on the post-Merge proof-of-stake chain. However, some exchanges, including BitMEX, Poloniex and OKEx, have declared support for the possible fork. Tron founder Justin Sun has come out in favor of a potential fork, promising support for developing the existing Ethereum network following the Merge.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/08/ethers-deepest-backwardation-since-2020-crash-shows-traders-prepping-for-ethereum-pow-split,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e04a94e7950de5007a255fc76d55c1dd213fc551-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company attributed the loss to the global tech stock sell-off and rapid fall of the yen, according to an earnings presentation.  The majority of the loss for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, or about $21.7 billion, was tied to the group of SoftBank Vision Fund investment vehicles and largely attributable to declines in publicly traded companies such as ride-share company Uber and home-selling platform Opendoor.

Zhao says Binance does not own WazirX, the target of a money laundering investigation launched by India's Directorate of Enforcement against Zanmai Labs, the Indian entity of WazirX's Singapore parent. That investigation included a raid last week against one of WazirX’s directors.  What started the ownership spat with Zhao? Shetty told CoinDesk he couldn’t comment for legal reasons.  Shetty, however, did rebut Zhao’s claims about not controlling the WazirX exchange. “WazirX is the technology which we sold to Binance,” he said. He has legal documents proving the sale but is unable to share them, again due to legal reasons. “What I really want is a solution,” Shetty said.     The WazirX/Binance relationship, as Shetty claims  The impression created by Zhao's initial tweet last week that Binance does not own WazirX is wrong, claimed Shetty. “The technology, the product, the domain, the brand and everything was sold by our Singapore entity Zettai to Binance,” Shetty said.  Shetty explained the history behind the sale, noting Binance wanted an operational crypto trading presence in India following the 2020 Supreme Court decision that lifted the banking ban on crypto exchanges.  “Post the deal, Binance asked the Indian entity of Zettai – Zanmai Labs – also owned by the same people who created and sold the WazirX tech to Binance, to start the INR [Indian rupee] crypto market in India under Zanmai Labs and gave a license,” Shetty said.  Again noting legal reasons, Shetty says his team cannot show the licensing document to CoinDesk.  Shetty: “Zanmai India has a license to operate the INR market from Binance. How can Binance give [the WazirX tech] as a license if you don't own it? How can I prove it without showing it? Every time an Indian authority comes to us, the license is what we submit and show to explain how we run the market, deposits and withdrawals. We show the license we've got from Binance.”  Shetty stated that Zanmai Labs controls just the crypto market in INR trading, but crypto-to-crypto trading is controlled by Binance.  Shetty’s solution to the ownership spat  Shetty said Binance and his team have “been having discussions for several months” to solve the ownership issue.  “It is absolutely necessary that we need to bring clarity that one party owns WazirX the platform,"" Shetty said. ""So it’s either us owning all of it or them owning all of it. The joint venture is not going to work for a long time. This episode has proven that a JV where an Indian entity does marketing and Binance owns crypto wallets doesn’t work. Our ask is simple, either you take all of it or give it to us.""  Many have remarked that the most unfortunate aspect of this online spat is how poorly it reflects on the environment for crypto in India.  “Whenever anything happens in crypto, there will always be fear. And you know, everyone will be worried,” Shetty told CoinDesk. “It's an obvious thing, which is why most of these discussions should always happen behind closed doors and this was happening.”",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/08/wazirx-co-founder-nischal-shetty-speaks-out-on-spat-with-binances-cz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac9526579030e7751d5cce1e734a3294e34b8dbf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the introduction of technologies like the blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to gaming, people now see the impressive earning potential that playing NFT games on the blockchain is providing. Even as gaming is practically done in a virtual environment, it now feels more physical/realistic. Players earn tokens and NFTs in exchange for the efforts and time they put into playing these games.

42411751,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfgbs,1659970237,What Are Privacy Coins and Are They Legal?,"Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that preserve anonymity by obscuring the flow of money across their networks. They make it difficult to work out who sent what to whom – which is useful if you don’t want anyone snooping on your financial activity.  On Aug. 8, 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department barred customers in the U.S. from using Tornado Cash, a decentralized mixer protocol that enables private transactions on Ethereum, sparking questions around privacy protocols and privacy coins generally. This guide will tackle the questions around privacy coins and how they work.  See Also: Decentralized Mixer Tornado Cash Makes Its User Interface Open-Source  How do privacy coins work?  Take away the privacy-preserving technology, and privacy coins appear pretty similar to coins like bitcoin. They run on blockchains – decentralized ledgers – and are maintained by a network of anonymous validators. But it is the advanced privacy techniques that distinguish privacy coins from the rest of the pack. The largest privacy coins by market capitalization are Zcash and Monero.  Dash originally started life as a privacy-focused coin named “Darkcoin,” but rebranded in 2015 and opted to focus on digital payments instead. Though the project boasts its own branded coin joining feature, CEO Ryan Taylor asserts Dash should not be construed as a privacy coin.  Monero is one of the only privacy coins that is private by default. Unlike Zcash, you can’t turn its privacy functions off. To hide transaction data, Monero uses one-time-use “stealth addresses” for each transaction; “ring signatures”, which group genuine transactions with old “decoy” transactions to make it difficult to work out which transaction is legitimate, and “ringCT”, which hides the amount of Monero sent in a transaction.  Zcash is a privacy coin that also allows for transparent transactions. Private transactions use zero-knowledge proofs: a type of mathematical calculation that signals to the network that something is definitely true – like the validity of a transaction – without publishing additional information about that transaction, like the addresses and the transaction amounts.  Are privacy coins legal?  Privacy coins have come under intense scrutiny from regulators around the world in a bid to crackdown on black markets fueled by privacy coins. Australia and South Korea have banned exchanges from offering privacy coins, while Japan has banned them entirely.  Tightening of “know your customer” laws imposed by anti-money laundering regulators may continue to make life difficult for users of privacy coins. These include the FATF Travel Rule and the AMLD-5 directive set by the European Union.  Is bitcoin a privacy coin?  You might have heard that one of the big advantages of using bitcoin is the anonymity it provides and is why a vast majority of bitcoin’s early years were spent fueling dark web marketplaces as the payment method of choice for criminals.  But the reality is quite the opposite. Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, meaning you can view all of the transactions ever made by any address on the network at any time on public blockchain explorers.  The Bitcoin protocol, like most blockchain networks, does not preserve anonymity. Instead, it preserves pseudonymity: Unless someone has claimed ownership over an address – which looks like a string of letters and numbers – you can’t tell who owns it.  That said, a number of blockchain analytics companies like Chainalysis have produced tools that can considerably narrow down the search. These tools look for relationships in transactions that help companies and law enforcement agencies trace criminals.  That being said, a recent upgrade has launched on Bitcoin’s protocol called Taproot that makes it possible to enhance the privacy of certain transactions by allowing complex smart contract transactions to look like “regular” transactions. However, until Taproot becomes widely adopted and integrated by developers, its effects are limited.  In the meantime, one way of enhancing the privacy of Bitcoin transactions is to use a mixer or tumbler. When you send bitcoin using a mixer, the mixing service jumbles your bitcoin with the bitcoin of other people who want to use the mixer at the same time.  After being sufficiently tumbled, the service will spit out an appropriate amount of random bitcoins to your intended recipient. Since your bitcoin is mixed up with everyone else’s, it is difficult to work out who sent what to whom. Popular examples of mixers include CoinJoin and CoinSwap.  Are privacy coins really private?  Because new analytical tools are being developed all the time, and computers may one day become powerful enough to crack modern encryption methods, it is difficult to label privacy coins truly private. That said, under current encryption methods, they have proven resilient.  Law enforcement agencies are keen to crack Monero transactions to uncover any criminals that use the network. In September 2020, the IRS offered $625,000 to anyone who could crack the network. A company called CipherTrace has filed a patent claiming it has cracked the network, but those within Monero’s community dispute its claims.

However, exchange trading volume data shows levels are not matching the rally, signaling a lack of any real institution-driven volumes.  Market Moves: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin played down the impact of any hard forks by third parties after the network’s Merge event in September. Speaking at the developer event ETHSeoul over the weekend, Buterin said “I don't expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork.”  Chart of The Day: Ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread at its highest since June 2021.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) had a positive weekend of trading, with BTC breaking the $24,000 mark on Monday, up 5% on the day. Ether followed suit, trading up 5.7% over the last 24 hours, at $1,774.  The uptick in price over the last 24 hours for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value was not accompanied by strong volume, as has often been the case in previous rallies.  Data from data.bitcoinity.org shows that the last time BTC climbed above $24,000, volume levels were around 570 million; today, they are at 310 million.  “This means BTC’s price movement can be attributed mostly to the market participants or market makers who are setting most of the trading channel based on liquidation wash outs,” said Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex.  In the short term the $22,000-$23,000 price level will be key to watch, according to Kssis. “A break above that level could see BTC moving higher though it could run out of breath and slip back.”  Altcoins also showed strength overnight, with Avalanche’s AVAX taking the lead, up 14%. Graph (GRT), token of an indexing protocol for networks like Ethereum, was up 20% overnight and now has a market cap of over $1 billion.  In the news, cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO) reported a second-quarter net loss of $554.7 million, more than triple the amount it reported for the same period last year.  On Friday, crypto-lender Voyager Digital said it plans to ""restore access"" to cash deposits on Aug. 11, the company's first step in returning up to $270 million in fiat currency to its customers.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin spoke to reporters during an exclusive event at ETHSeoul over the weekend. He played down the impact of any hard forks on Ethereum after the network’s Merge and said, “I don't expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork.” (More on this in Market Moves below).  Finally, WazirX founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk that Binance has restarted off-chain transfers. The world's largest crypto exchange by volume had removed off-chain transfers to WazirX following a disagreement on social media between Shetty and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao regarding the ownership of the platform.

Market Moves  Vitalik Buterin Plays Down Impact of Ethereum Forks After Merge  By Shaurya Malwa  SEOUL, South Korea — Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin played down the impact of any hard forks on Ethereum after the network’s Merge event in September.  Speaking at the developer event ETHSeoul over the weekend, Buterin said, “I don't expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork.”  The blockchain plans to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, through an event known as The Merge, next month in a move developers say will make it cheaper, faster and environmentally friendly.  However, the change from a proof-of-work (PoW) system will end an income stream for Ethereum miners, who are rewarded with ether tokens for their efforts. Miners produced over $620 million worth of ether in July alone, data show. Tron founder Justin Sun has emerged as one of the most prominent investors supporting a hard fork to keep the money flowing.  Buterin said supporters of the PoW consensus design shifted to Ethereum Classic when that network started in 2016 because it was known at the time that Ethereum would eventually shift to proof-of-stake while Ethereum Classic would not.  “I think Ethereum Classic already has a superior community and a superior product for people kind of with those pro-proof-of-work values and preferences,” he said. “Pretty much everyone” in the Ethereum ecosystem is supportive of the move to proof-of-stake validation and “quite united.""  Prominent Chinese miners like Chandler Guo have proposed a hard fork so even as Ethereum undergoes The Merge and becomes validated by stakers, miners could continue to support a newly separated PoW version of the chain. Sun committed a part of his million ether holdings towards the development of the so-called EthereumPoW network.  Sun’s Poloniex exchange has already listed ETHW futures, a product that allows traders to bet on prices of the token issued to ether holders after the EthereumPoW network comes into existence. Futures exchange BitMex on Monday also listed ETHW futures, nearly a week after it published a report on how traders could take advantage of the market reaction after the issuance of the tokens.  “A couple of outsiders basically have exchanges and mostly just want to make a quick buck,"" Buterin said about those proposing changes. ""So I'm not expecting [a fork] to have substantial, long-term adoption.”  ""I hope that whatever happens, doesn't lead to people losing money,"" he said.     Chart of the Day: Ether-Bitcoin Implied Volatility Spread at Highest Since June 2021  By Omkar Godbole  The spread between the annualized three-month implied volatilities for ether and bitcoin has jumped to 31%, the highest percentage since June 2021.  The data indicates the market focus is on the supposedly bullish Ethereum Merge, likely to happen in September. That explains the crypto market's resilience to Friday's blowout U.S. jobs report.  The market is enthusiastically pricing more significant price turbulence in ether in the coming months. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price volatility over a specific period.

42411414,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNe13,1659968132,"As Interest Rates Rise, a Silent Vampire Attack on Crypto","Crypto is facing a winter unlike any other, confronted with monetary tightening and a historically strong dollar. Analysts speculate that higher interest rates will diminish investors’ appetite for high yield, high risk assets. Stablecoins, they argue, linked to the newly powerful dollar, like tether and USDC, are likely to be the winners of this new environment. Banks providing services to crypto firms will also profit from the interest earned on those firms’ deposits.  Alex Fowler is CEO at Transparent Systems. Patrick Murck is president and chief legal officer at Transparent and an affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center.  However, analysts have stopped short of investigating the implications of newly empowered stablecoin providers and banks for the rest of the crypto community. In doing so, they’ve ignored the emergence of a new rentier economy in crypto. Or, to put it in crypto-native language, a silent vampire attack.  The original vampire attack was about siphoning off liquidity from one automated market maker (AMM) platform to another. Though the perpetrators of this attack are different, the consequences are much the same: Crypto firms are bleeding capital and liquidity.  How has this phenomenon emerged? It’s well known that crypto has become increasingly reliant on centrally operated, asset-backed stablecoins such as tether and USDC – they are integral to the operations of crypto firms, traders and the DeFi (decentralized finance) sector. As stablecoin operators hold assets in reserve to back their coins, they receive interest on those reserves. Higher interest rates mean their profits are set to climb.  Circle estimated in its latest SEC filing that a 100 basis-point increase in interest rates in the first quarter of the year would have increased its annual interest income by more than $150 million. These stablecoin operators, however, do not share their interest income with their users. Nor do they share the income generated from users’ economic activity, though those users pay fees to utlize these private forms of payment.  CeFi and DeFi have come to be in a parasitic relationship, with CeFi leeching value from DeFi  To be sure, these firms have positively contributed to the crypto ecosystem. Nonetheless, this arrangement means that crypto firms are missing out on interest income that could be a meaningful addition to their balance sheet – particularly in a bear market.  Likewise, crypto firms are not the only affected parties – DeFi is also entangled in this extractive relationship. Consider, for example, MakerDAO’s Dai, which is often touted as crypto’s largest decentralized stablecoin. MakerDAO relies heavily on USDC to collateralize Dai. This creates several issues.  On the one hand, MakerDAO is silently paying a large fee to USDC’s operators in float interest. On the other, by relying so significantly on USDC, Dai becomes entangled in its accompanying risks and relationships. This makes Dai both vulnerable to any issues with USDC’s reserves and an unwitting party to USDC’s business relationships.  For example, Circle and Coinbase – which jointly founded Centre, USDC’s operator – share the revenue generated from USDC reserves. In this way, CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi have come to be in a parasitic relationship, with CeFi leeching value from DeFi.  But stablecoin issuers aren’t the only entities behind this silent vampire attack. Just as crypto has come to rely on a few centralized stablecoins, crypto firms have increasingly relied on a small number of banks for fiat services. Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, which provide the lion’s share of banking services to major industry firms, also stand to profit from higher interest rates – and to keep those profits to themselves. For example, Silvergate Bank projects in a 2022 SEC filing that for every +25bps increase in interest rates, its net interest income would increase by around $23 million.  Why do banks stand to make these gains? Crypto firms rely on these banks’ proprietary payment rails to facilitate their businesses. They must deposit funds with these institutions to conduct their transactions, but the deposits are not interest-bearing so crypto firms are unable to maximize returns on these funds.  In a bull market, it was perhaps easy for crypto firms to overlook this silent vampire attack or to simply write it off as the cost of doing business. But in a bear market – and in the face of a potential recession – this is unlikely to remain tenable. Crypto firms can no longer afford to cede interest income to banks and stablecoin providers, nor should they when innovative alternatives are available to defend against this attack.  Applying the principles honed in the last bull market – collective ownership, decentralization, and shared financial benefits – to the fiat side of crypto businesses is one potential antidote. This isn’t simply wishful thinking – Xand, a software protocol and governance platform developed by our company, Transparent, enables businesses to deploy these ideas today. Other proposals are emerging for tokenizing deposits that may also provide more equitable arrangements in the future.  In a high interest-rate environment, where interest rates now stand at 2.25% to 2.5%, crypto firms need to look more critically at their payment providers and deploy new innovative tools that support users participating directly in the interest benefit, like Xand, to stop the bleeding.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,"Patrick Murck, Alex  Fowler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/08/as-interest-rates-rise-a-silent-vampire-attack-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aac41193167e03272ce1855d0411244aa8b4ac03-2902x2089.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395068,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWq6X,1659968033,Crypto-Mixing Service Tornado Cash Blacklisted by US Treasury,"The Treasury Department has banned all Americans from using decentralized crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a watchdog agency tasked with preventing sanctions violations, on Monday added Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals list, a running tally of blacklisted people, entities and cryptocurrency addresses. As a result, all U.S. persons and entities are prohibited from interacting with Tornado Cash or any of the Ethereum wallet addresses tied to the protocol. Those who do may face criminal penalties.  Tornado Cash has been a key tool for the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group tied to the $625 million March hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network, according to the Treasury Department. Blockchain analysis showed that tens of millions of dollars' worth of crypto stolen from Ronin flowed through Tornado Cash, which is designed to obfuscate the source of funds. OFAC previously sanctioned Blender.io, another mixing service that the Treasury Department alleged was used to launder proceeds from ransomware attacks, as well as about $20.5 million in crypto stolen from Ronin.  “Tornado Cash has been the go-to mixer for cybercriminals looking to launder the proceeds of crime, as well as helping to enable hackers, including those currently under U.S. sanctions, to launder the proceeds of their cybercrimes by covering up the origin and transfer of this illicit virtual currency,” a senior department official said. “Since its creation back in 2019, Tornado Cash has reportedly laundered more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency.”  Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at analytics firm TRM Labs, told CoinDesk that the move is the Treasury Department’s “largest, most impactful action” in crypto to date.  The Ronin hackers have repeatedly laundered Ronin proceeds through Tornado Cash, according to on-chain data analyses, even after OFAC sanctioned an Ethereum address tied to Lazarus Group it alleged was related to the hack.  According to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen, ether (ETH) deposits on Tornado Cash spiked after Ronin was hacked earlier this year.  The average amount of ETH deposited on Tornado Cash eclipsed 220,000 in May and June 2022, according to Nansen. This total was worth $220 billion to $660 billion during that range, data from CoinGecko shows.  Overall, some 18% of the total amount of ETH flowing through Tornado Cash in recent months – 167,400 ETH – came from the Ronin hack, according to Nansen.  Proceeds from other hacks have also traveled through Tornado Cash, according to blockchain analysis from groups like Elliptic: Roughly 4,600 ETH (worth around $15 million at the time) stolen from crypto-exchange Crypto.com was laundered through the mixing service earlier this year. Proceeds from the $100 million hack of the Harmony bridge were laundered through Tornado Cash, and even proceeds from this month’s $200 million hack of the Nomad bridge moved through the service.  National security  Redbord said the sanctioning of Blender.io, which is smaller than Tornado Cash, could be seen as a “preview” of Monday’s action, where OFAC may have hinted that entities allegedly laundering for criminals or such nations as North Korea may be in danger of violating sanctions.  “When you talk about North Korea in particular, Tornado Cash has been the go-to mixing service,” Redbord said. “What OFAC is saying is, ‘These hacks are more than hacks; they’re serious national security risks.’ It’s not just money laundering – it’s money laundering that’s going to be used for weapons proliferation.”  What makes the new sanction interesting is that Tornado Cash also has a significant amount of value that flows through it but is not associated with any illicit activities.  Adding the mixer to the sanctions list means all U.S. persons are responsible for ensuring they do not interact with crypto transacted through the service.  “I think what we’re seeing here from Treasury is, ‘If you are going to allow a lot of illicit activity, we are going to go after you even if there is a lot of legitimate activity,’” Redbord said.  Indeed, the U.S. government has spent years warning that crypto mixers may be illegal or aid in illegal activity. Earlier this year, Alessio Evangelista, former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) associate director for enforcement, told the industry that crypto-service providers should be proactive in blocking transactions from “problematic” wallets, rather than wait for an OFAC designation.  ‘Unstoppable’  Sanctions may not halt Tornado Cash itself from operating. Co-founder Roman Semenov previously told CoinDesk the privacy service was designed to operate without centralized control. While he and his team write and publish code, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has to approve any changes before they are made.  “The protocol was specifically designed this way to be unstoppable, because it wouldn't make much sense if some third party [such as a developer] would have control over it. This would be the same as if someone had control over Bitcoin or Ethereum,” he told CoinDesk at the time.  The developers went so far as to make open source its entire user interface, allowing anyone to weigh in on the code or the mixer’s design.  Depositing funds into Tornado Cash places them into a “pool” of other users’ tokens. From here, users can withdraw their funds to another address while concealing where they came from originally.  Tornado Cash says it is non-custodial, meaning users maintain complete control of their funds at all times – even if those funds are technically in one of Tornado’s pools.  Semenov previously told Bloomberg News that it would be “technically impossible” for sanctions to be applied to protocols like Tornado.  The senior Treasury Department official said during a press call that the agency would continue monitoring mixers, and could take further action if Tornado Cash continues as is.  “Since we sanctioned virtual currency mixer Blender.io, we have not seen evidence to suggest that it has remained active post that designation,” the official said. “We do believe that this action will send a really critical message to the private sector about the risks associated with mixers writ large, which obviously is designed to inhibit Tornado Cash or any sort of reconstituted versions of it to continue to operate.”  In Monday’s action OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash’s donation address, proxy address, a Gitcoin grants address and several others, including a few USDC addresses. More than 40 addresses in total were put on the sanctions list.  Circle blacklisted the sanctioned Tornado addresses, freezing over $75,000 worth of USDC, later Monday.  Tornado Cash's GitHub and website went offline as well. Tornado Cash developer Roman Semenov's GitHub was suspended.  UPDATE (Aug. 8, 2022, 15:00 UTC): Updated with additional context.

42393811,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBMDv,1659964570,"After Countless Bungles, Compass Mining Tries to Change Course","In its quest to make industry-grade crypto mining accessible to retail investors, Compass Mining may have overreached. After a couple of years of growing exponentially, the firm is slowing down and focusing on its core business.  On June 28, the CEO and chief financial officer of Compass resigned amid a series of “setbacks and disappointments,” including delays in deploying machines and several thousand rigs being stranded in Russia following sanctions on its hosting partner in that country. The new management then cut 15% of staff, mainly in marketing and business development, and is now trying to move away from a growth mindset to focus on the core parts of Compass’ business.  “In hindsight, you wish we had done certain things differently. But in the moment, you gotta be realistic about what information is available to you and make decisions accordingly,” said Thomas Heller, who will be leading the company.  The two new interim CEOs and co-founders are indicative of Compass’s new direction. Paul Gosker, formerly the chief technology officer, and Heller, who as head of mining spent more time in the nitty-gritty business of building mines, are more the back-office types than Whit Gibbs, the CEO and third co-founder who resigned and who was more of a charismatic executive.  Heller told CoinDesk that he is ""supportive"" of recruiting a more seasoned CEO to lead Compass and to “bring a new perspective” and experience, but the new leading duo is also open to staying on.  Compass is one of a handful of companies trying to bring bitcoin mining to the masses – despite the industry’s gravitational pull toward bigger firms, investors and mining sites. The company “does its part” to support the network’s decentralization by enabling individuals to mine, its website says.  It’s an ambitious, if not noble, goal. The company’s recent “setbacks” pose a serious question: Is the model, “everyone can mine bitcoin,” untenable or is it an indication of misfortunes and mishandlings particular to this one firm – and can Compass Mining set sail on a new course?  The model  Compass is essentially a middleman. It enables retail customers to buy machines and hosting services. For the mining rigs, it divides bulk orders to manufacturers into smaller pieces. Under the terms of service, retail customers will own the mining rigs without taking on the responsibility of plugging in or maintaining the computers.  For the most part, Compass doesn’t operate its own crypto mines. Instead, it works with hosting companies that take care of setting up and managing the infrastructure that the rigs operate in. It lists 39 such hosting facilities across the world on its website, mainly in the U.S. and Canada.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee, without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves.  Compass also operates a platform where suppliers and hosting firms can buy and sell machines and rack space. Heller wants the company to focus more attention on developing this platform, and on improving transparency through technology and real-time data.  The company was founded in 2020 and grew to serve 11,000 customers, according to Gibbs, the former CEO. Heller said later that Compass counted 7,000 customers and that this past spring before the layoffs, it employed 100 people, up from 12 in April 2021.  Two services companies that worked with Compass, one of them Sabre56, told CoinDesk that Compass was professional and that they had no issue working with Compass.  But the publicly facing image wasn’t the whole story. One former employee told CoinDesk that “lots of things are very poorly managed and executed on, which gives people the perception that they’re shady.” The employee didn’t want to be named because of nondisclosure agreements.  Heller said that internally, the company is fast paced and operates like a startup. It isn’t like a big, established corporation with standard practices and flowcharts. Heller said the company is now taking more time to make strategic decisions than it did before.  Compass’ operations have been plagued by delays in delivering its promises and by what many customers see as a lack of transparency and communication. At least four of Compass’ sites have suffered from downtime or delays in deployment, leading to losses for customers.  Those hiccups angered lots of customers. More than 500 customers have taken to a new Discord channel to voice their woes and organize so that they can better deal with difficulties. Customers who CoinDesk spoke to requested anonymity because some are contractually obligated not to talk about their dealings with Compass.  Growing too fast  Three industry insiders that CoinDesk spoke to said that the company grew too quickly for its own good and Compass’s new management agreed with that assessment in its blog post while announcing the layoffs.  Heller said the reason the company grew so quickly is that it was “filling a niche market that people had tried to fill before but have never evolved from a small-time brokerage into a platform where customers buy and sell [machines and rack space] on the website.”  “Along the way, there's definitely things that we could have done differently,” like focus more on “the real core of the business,” which is selling machines and keeping customers satisfied, Heller said.  Phil Harvey of Sabre56, a company that builds mines around the world, including about five for Compass, said that typically a hosting firm will deal only with Compass but that Compass as a middleman could be confronted with as many as 1,000 angry customers with 1,000 different machines.  Choosing partners  The promise back in 2020 was to allow the retail client to host at the “most respected facilities in the world.”  It turned out to be a tall order to find rack space for 30,000 machines. By contrast, a similar company, Mining Syndicate, which started selling mining rigs and hosting last October, has fewer than 600 clients, Chris Koerner, founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.  Heller admitted that Compass worked with some “new-ish” hosting providers that had built out only a few megawatts of mining sites.  “If not for the explosive growth, and if not for the rack space constraints, we would have most likely just stuck with more seasoned operators,” he said.  Harvey said that common problems such as machines overheating can spiral out of control very quickly when the parties involved aren’t experienced enough to solve them quickly.  Compass has sued at least two of its hosting providers for failing to deliver what they promised. The first lawsuit is against Xenon Management in Texas courts. The suit was filed last December. Details are scant in a court document that CoinDesk reviewed, and Xenon didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Heller said that Compass found some “red flags” while doing due diligence and stopped working with Xenon, but he refused to comment on the specifics of the ongoing litigation.  The second lawsuit is against Dynamics Mining, a company that was building a bitcoin mine for Compass in Maine. In the lawsuit, which attracted a lot of eyeballs on Twitter, Compass claims that Dynamics has failed to deliver on its contractual obligations and is holding its mining rigs hostage.  Compass gave Dynamics $1 million in loans to build out two facilities on top of hosting fees and deposits totaling $650,000, according to court documents seen by CoinDesk. Making such a loan to a hosting provider was very “uncommon” for Compass, Heller said.  On the other side, Dynamics claims that Compass hasn’t paid it $861,000 in hosting fees and electricity charges and accused Compass of trying to break into Dynamics' mining facilities in order to steal the mining rigs.  A court partly granted Compass’ request for a restraining order on Dynamics. That allowed Compass to retrieve all the machines as of July 29, Heller said. Customers could choose to have their machines shipped directly to them for a fee or hosted on a new site, after the rigs are serviced at a Colorado facility, according to an email seen by CoinDesk.  Despite the turn of events, Dynamics Mining gave a free bitcoin mining rig and hosted one of a handful of parties at the Mining Disrupt conference in Miami in late July.  Mining consultant Harvey also thinks that Compass gets a bad rep because it has so many retail customers and is outward facing. Delays in sites or unexpected downtime are common issues in the industry – even for giants like Marathon Digital – but “Compass has such a large and prominent PR presence” that such issues are “more widely publicized,” he said.  Koerner said that he has a lot of empathy for Compass, because mining is a very difficult business.  “It is really, really hard to run both a miner sales business and a hosting business” at the same time, he said. “It's especially difficult, and then you do it to retail clients that are brand new to this [industry]. It's just logistically challenging.”  For retail investors, the situation was stressful to say the least.  “People have their savings in there, and they are uncertain what will happen with the miners,” one customer said, adding that the more recent news about miners offloading their bitcoin and potentially having undercollateralized loans only heightened their concerns.  All that glitters  Compass has in the past flip-flopped on its statements.  When CoinDesk spoke to Gibbs, the former CEO, on June 24, he said that Compass had never had layoffs and that Compass was “in a good position” to continue to serve its customers and to focus on growth. That was before new management decided to lay off 15% of the workforce on July 7.  Serial numbers of the machines it sells is another issue. The terms of service from last September that CoinDesk reviewed said that Compass had to provide customers with the serial numbers of their machines within three days of their requests. But a newer version from March has scrapped the time limit for Compass to satisfy the request.  Several people on the Compass Discord channel complained that they were ignored when they asked for serial numbers. One said that he was waiting for around two weeks for the serial numbers, which would enable him to track the machine. Otherwise, Compass would send it after it was deployed, the customer said.  Asked about the change in the terms of service, Heller said; “Truthfully speaking, having a three-day window on providing serial numbers is just unrealistic.”  Given that there are limited resources when setting up the mines and that in some cases deployment has already been delayed by the time the machines have arrived at the site, the priority is to get the rigs running and then send the serial numbers to customers, he added.  The company mainly cut down on marketing and business development staff, which Heller said wasn’t exactly essential to deliver machines and hosting. Compass had poured resources into creating educational and marketing materials for its retail clients, publishing insights that CoinDesk frequently references.  In their July 7 blog post, Heller and Gosker promised to spend more time doing due diligence on content providers and working with those with ""high integrity."" Heller noted that that comment wasn’t directed at any one particular partner.  One customer, who chose to remain anonymous, said that he first heard of Compass through influencers like Peter McCormack and Anthony Pompliano. None of the influencers responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Some content creators have broken off with the company prior to this summer’s revelations. On June 27, before the announcement of the management changes, influencer Dennis Porter, who had signed on as executive producer with Compass on March 22, said the two ended their collaboration on Twitter Spaces. Mitch Klee, who was a mining analyst with Compass, also appears to have left the company based on his Twitter bio, as of July 7.  The Russia affair  But perhaps the biggest difference on what was advertised versus what happened had some element of force majeure; sanctions on Russia.  Compass had a big operation in Russia with $40 million worth of equipment, or 10% of the company’s total hashrate at the time, Gibbs told CoinDesk in an interview prior to his resignation. Soon after the war in Ukraine broke out, then-CEO Gibbs assured customers on the Compass Discord channel that it was “business as usual” and there was no reason for concern.  Gibbs gave customers the opportunity to move their rigs out of Russia at an additional cost. But Compass wouldn’t be able to host them at different facilities, meaning customers would be losing money on downtime.  On April 20, the U.S. Office for Foreign Assets Control added Compass’ hosting provider BitRiver to its list of specially designated nationals, barring U.S. companies from doing business with BitRiver. That development came as a surprise to many because it was the first time a bitcoin mining company had been sanctioned by the U.S. government.  Compass had been unable to access the machines and couldn’t communicate with BitRiver, Gibbs and Heller said.  A BitRiver representative, however, told CoinDesk that it was Compass that was refusing to communicate.  “Despite our numerous calls to resolve issues that Compass Mining customers have regarding equipment, we have found this company reluctant to deal with and solve this problem.” a BitRiver spokesman told CoinDesk. “Compass Mining refused to communicate with us and, unfortunately, refused to deal with the return of the equipment,” the spokesman added.  According to messages on the Discord channel, BitRiver told customers that Compass Mining didn’t give BitRiver a master list of which machines belong to whom, prior to the sanctions, and so the Russian firm couldn’t coordinate with individual customers to send back the machines. When asked by CoinDesk, BitRiver didn’t comment on the existence of such a list.  Later, Omar Todd, a customer who is organizing the response to the Russia debacle, told CoinDesk that Compass did send BitRiver a master list but that the Russian firm either never received it or didn’t act on it.  Dissatisfied by Compass’ handling of the Russia situation and seeing no light at the end of the tunnel, a group of customers have banded together to hire lawyers to get their machines back, at the cost of $100 per machine.  “We are hopeful that both sides are well intentioned, but soon actions will speak louder than words,” Todd told CoinDesk. “Being an unsanctioned party representing many Compass customers with miners stuck in Russia, we should be able to find the right solution without breaking any sanctions,” he said.  Veribi, a firm that bought $1.5 million worth of mining equipment to be hosted in Russia, has filed a lawsuit against Compass, claiming Compass failed to secure the miners when the war broke out.  According to lawsuit documents, BitRiver has refused to work directly with Compass customers because in its view, the equipment belongs to Compass. In its lawsuit, Veribi claims that the true relationship between Compass and BitRiver has been concealed: “In fact, it is far more plausible that Compass’ relationship with BitRiver is other than the simple agent-provider relationship represented to Compass’ customers,” the complaint filed in a California court reads.  The sanctions on Russia “do not prohibit the recapture or demand for return of property under the temporary control of a sanctioned entity,” as Veribi’s lawsuit writes, said Justin Newton, co-founder and CEO of Netki, a company that is working on digital identity products for anti-money-laundering and sanctions enforcement.  “If Compass was obligated to compensate BitRiver for the return of the mining rigs, that may be a different story, since sanctions prohibit U.S. companies from transferring value to sanctioned foreign entities,” but other than that, Newton said he couldn’t see “a good reason for Compass not to repossess their equipment, unless they are financially unable.”  On the other hand, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto compliance and risk management firm TRM Labs, said that “dealing with a sanctioned entity is complicated” and that Compass likely “would be looking for a license or at least a thumbs up from OFAC before engaging.”  The bundles  Last summer, after China banned crypto mining, Compass started selling bundles of mining rigs to customers, promising them future hashrate. The firm then used those deposits to buy the rigs and build the hosting sites.  Under this model, customers had to foot the bill for the sites’ buildouts, while Compass was managing the process.  One way that Compass did that was to sell bundles of rigs, averaging a predetermined amount of hashing power, which would be gradually going online over several months. The bundles cost anywhere from around $48,000 to $65,000 just for the machines, including $26,000 to $34,000 in upfront costs, according to marketing materials seen by CoinDesk.  “That was my biggest mistake,” one Compass customer told CoinDesk about buying a bundle, because the opportunity cost turned out to be much bigger than he initially thought it was. Most bundles promised that the machines would start going online as early as February of this year, when mining profits were almost double what they are now.  Heller said that Compass tried to procure backup rack space for the bundles, and even had backup on backup, but hosting providers didn’t deliver.  Customers said the first three machines out of six they were expecting were more than one month late each. Three customers told CoinDesk that they were told they would get refunds for their bundles.  In July, Compass offered miners who bought a hosting plan for a Texas site to opt to move their machines to a facility in Georgia due to low uptime, according to messages on the unofficial Discord channel. Later Compass said it wouldn't proceed with moving the miners that because ""a recent rise in the cost of energy in Georgia"" would increase hosting rates and because they want ""to honor Compass Miners who deployed in Texas for tax purposes,"" according to messages on the channel.  To Sabre56’s Harvey much of this is expected. “Like any company, they're gonna pass the risk on to their client base,” he said.  “Unfortunately, that's the story of the retail investor,” he said. They are “always the last ones to benefit.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/08/after-countless-bungles-compass-mining-tries-to-change-its-course,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25cd0c21f2ebc62b7d6de9b98ac72bbc6fffef5b-2472x1854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We have also decided to make a modification that gives a better indication of what’s happening in the market. Using data supplied from our friends at Kaiko, we’ve swapped out eight assets, the most changes the list has ever seen.  What’s out  First the obvious: Algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its “balancer” coin, luna (LUNC), imploded back in May, depleting nearly $60 billion in the process. Now that have those coins become shadows of their former selves, the successor coin, also called luna (LUNA), pales in comparison.  Another change we’ve made was to take out stablecoins entirely from the CoinDesk 20. That doesn’t mean stablecoins aren’t an important part of the crypto ecosystem – far from it. Rather, it has to do with the fact that stablecoin prices – with the obvious exception of the luna fiasco – tend to stay around $1 and don't give an indication of where money is going daily within crypto. If anything, it’s more of an indicator of the general market; the higher the increase in stablecoin market cap, the more money that’s going into crypto.  Yet once turned into stablecoins, those funds then get traded into other assets. Thus, in a way, including stablecoins would be a form of double counting. Therefore, two major stablecoins, tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), were removed from the CoinDesk 20.  Four other assets were also taken out of the CoinDesk 20 because their trading volumes over the past two quarters didn’t measure up to other coins. The tokens of layer 1 blockchains Polkadot (DOT) and Loopring (LRC) didn’t make the cut this round, nor did the tokens of metaverse darlings Gala (GALA) and Decentraland (MANA).  What’s in  The removal of stablecoins and luna meant that there were four available slots for new coins. The new entrants are old names familiar to those following the CoinDesk 20.  Litecoin (LTC) made a surprising return to the list. Privacy coins monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) are once again in the CoinDesk 20, as are tron (TRX), EOS (EOS), bitcoin cash (BCH) and algorand (ALGO).

With four years of price action erased in a matter of months, the risk versus reward setup is becoming once again too good to pass up. The crypto market had a necessary unwinding of leverage over the last several months, causing the price of many top altcoins to fall by 90%. Bitcoin dropped a full 75% from all-time highs, and the result was a crypto market in widespread panic. Inflation concerns, recession fears, and mounting tensions globally have led to an exceptionally bearish stretch in cryptocurrencies and the stock market. Tightened Fed policy was also a contributing factor. But with no recession yet in sight, the selloff served as little more than a reset for investors and traders to take advantage of.

Geeq's products aim to address problems such as security and transaction costs to encourage mass adoption of blockchain technology. It says its platform is designed for any blockchain application, allowing enterprise and individual users to integrate fintech, game tech, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and micropayments, among other uses.  The platform is designed to ensure data reliability between organizations. It maintains fully permissioned audit trails so that stakeholders can be sure everyone is working with the same information.  The capital commitment from GEM is designed to release the funds as performance milestones are met. It is reminiscent of the $200 million allocated to centralized-decentralized (CeDeFi) exchange Unizen, which was also a milestone-based and performance-related model.  GEM's commitments therefore differ from traditional funding rounds in the way capital is injected into companies.  With the crypto industry facing uncertain prospects in the short and medium terms, such capital commitments may become a more prevalent, less risky means of investing in digital asset firms.

The larger loss was mainly the result of the crypto market downturn and investments in Galaxy's trading business, the firm said on Monday. The firm reported a loss of $182.9 million for the second quarter of last year.  Shrugging off the backward-looking loss, Galaxy's Toronto-listed shares are surging over 20% in Monday's trading session after gains in cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Bitcoin (BTC) is up about 4.4% to over $24,000 while Ethereum (ETH) gains 5.6% to about $1,799.  As of June 30, the firm had a liquidity position of $1.5 billion, while partners capital at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 23% from $1.5 billion from the year-ago level.  The firm's reported preliminary assets under management stood at nearly $1.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, up modestly from a year ago, but down 40% from three months earlier.  Mining business revenue in Q2 was $10.9 million and the segment's comprehensive net income tripled from a year ago.  Investments stood at $753.9 million at of the end of June, a decrease of about 25% for the quarter alongside the general slump in cryptos.  Speaking on the earnings call CEO Michael Novogratz said ""I don't feel nearly as bad as I thought I would, and I hope it's the worst quarter this firm ever has.""  Over the last eight weeks, said Novogratz, Galaxy took a “really serious look” at all of its business units and costs as it looks to control spending.  On the employee front, Novogratz expects Galaxy to finish the year with over 400 people from about 375 right now. ""We are a growth company,"" Novogratz said. Galaxy is investing in people, products, and engineering teams not only for the near-term but for years to come, he added.  ""While the crypto landscape is less certain than it was, my confidence of where it's going in the medium-term hasn't waned a bit,"" Novogratz said.  The results helped alleviate investor concerns on the extent of Galaxy's losses on lending activity and its investment book, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer told clients in a note Monday.  ""As it turned out, the size of the losses that GLXY posted during 2Q22 were not nearly as severe as some had feared, even while the company marked down its principal investment book by ~$250mm to ~$750mm, that loss was unrealized and could be recouped as the markets recover,"" Palmer wrote.

With companies such as Bybit, Kraken, Binance and Crypto.com seeking to set up in the emerging crypto hubs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, some real estate developers in the country had announced they would start accepting payments in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Now the government is looking to clamp down, to ensure that any real estate transactions must be reported to money-laundering watchdogs if they use virtual assets, or funds derived from virtual assets, for even a fraction of the home's value.  The new rules will leave ""little or no room for manipulation or illegal practices that could negatively impact the work environment and the economy and investment"" in the real estate and legal sectors, UAE Minister for Economics Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri said in a statement.  They would also require brokers, agents and law firms to file reports to the Financial Intelligence Unit, which is responsible for tracking dirty money, and would also apply when the buyer attempts to pay in cash worth over AED 55,000 (around $15,000). The government did not specify any threshold for virtual assets, implying even the smallest bitcoin transactions will be caught.  Global anti-money laundering standard-setter the Financial Action Task Force is attempting to clamp down on using crypto to launder the proceeds of crime or fund terrorism, including via the ""travel rule,"" a controversial way of identifying and tracking payers.

In a blog post, Binance said it will halt the transfers as of 03:00 UTC on Thursday.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, and its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao have been involved in a surprising back and forth with WazirX and its founders. The disagreements started last week after Shetty and Zhao posted opposing views on social media regarding the ownership of the platform.  Last week, Indian authorities raided the properties of a WazirX director in connection to an alleged fraud involving crypto. Following the report, Zhao took to Twitter to claim that Binance did not own WazirX, prompting Shetty to fire back and say that it did.  Binance reportedly stopped off-chain transfers between the exchanges on Sunday. Shetty in an interview with CoinDesk earlier Monday said that the off-chain service had been restarted.

Zhao also advised WazirX users to move their funds to Binance and that the exchange could shut down WazirX, ""but we can't because it hurts users.""  WazirX users flooded the exchange's Telegram channel with concerns about whether their funds were safe and whether the platform's native coin WRX would be delisted by Binance.  When asked for comment WazirX only said that ""users can continue to use the on-chain deposits and withdrawals on WazirX.”  Binance also said it will support Indian regulators in the ongoing matters concerning WazirX.

42395049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWpsl,1659954745,Vitalik Buterin Plays Down Impact of Ethereum Forks After Merge,"SEOUL, South Korea – Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin played down the impact of any hard forks after the network’s Merge event in September.  Speaking at the developer event ETH Seoul over the weekend, Buterin said, “I don't expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork.”  The blockchain plans to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, an event known as the Merge, next month in a move developers say will make it cheaper, faster and more environmentally friendly. The change from a proof-of-work (PoW) system will end an income stream for Ethereum miners, who are rewarded with ether (ETH) tokens for their efforts. Miners produced $620 million in ether in July alone, data shows. Tron founder Justin Sun has emerged as one of the most prominent investors supporting a hard fork to keep the money flowing.  Buterin said supporters of the PoW consensus design shifted to Ethereum Classic when that network started in 2016 because it was known at the time that Ethereum would eventually shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) while Ethereum Classic would not.  “I think Ethereum Classic already has a superior community and a superior product for people kind of with those pro-proof-of-work values and preferences,” he said. “Pretty much everyone” in the Ethereum ecosystem is supportive of the move to proof-of-stake validation and “quite united.""  Prominent Chinese miners like Chandler Guo have proposed a hard fork, so even as Ethereum undergoes The Merge and becomes validated by stakers, miners could continue to support a newly separated PoW version of the chain. Sun committed a part of his million ether holdings toward the development of the so-called EthereumPoW network.  Sun’s Poloniex exchange has already listed ETHW futures, a product that allows traders to bet on prices of the token issued to ether holders after the EthereumPoW network comes into existence. Futures exchange BitMEX today also listed ETHW futures, nearly a week after it published a report on how traders could take advantage of the market reaction after the issuance of the tokens.  “A couple of outsiders basically have exchanges and mostly just want to make a quick buck,"" Buterin said. ""So I'm not expecting it to have substantial, long-term adoption.”  ""I hope that whatever happens doesn't lead to people losing money,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/08/vitalik-buterin-plays-down-impact-of-ethereum-forks-after-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51bc214ec05de45df8351a359ecaebde601007a8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Majithia took on the role Aug. 19, 2021, according to another filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In July, Mawson said it raised $10 million to provide balance sheet flexibility as crypto-lender Celsius, the parent company of Celsius Mining, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The two had signed a 200 megawatt (MW) colocation agreement in March, which included a $20 million loan to Mawson in exchange for 3.85 million warrants in the mining firm. Only 54MW of colocation were up and running as of the end of June, and Mawson expected another 67MW to be operational by end-July.  The firm has been raising money by selling secured promissory notes as well as offering stock. In the first quarter of the year, Mawson recorded an $11.6 million net loss, according to its quarterly earnings report.

However, after the cryptocurrency price crashes in 2022, users are looking for which meme coin to buy next. This guide looks at Tamadoge - one of the best upcoming cryptos and the best new crypto to buy in 2022. We will also discuss the meme coin price predictions and how to buy Tamadoge in 2022. 5 Key Reasons why Tamadoge is set to Overtake Floki Inu, Dogelon Mars and SafeMoon Inu in 2022 Which meme coin will explode next? While tokens like Floki Inu and SafeMoon Inu have performed well in the past, we recommend Tamadoge as one of the popular meme coins that will explode. Let&apos;s take a look at why this token can be a good investment: 1. Deflationary Asset One of the best features of Tamadoge is that it aims to be a deflationary asset. Firstly, TAMA is the native cryptocurrency &amp; utility token of the Tamaverse - a play-to-earn (P2E) virtual ecosystem that lets users participate to earn in-game rewards.

Zhao said Binance could, it it wanted to, shut down the Indian cryptocurrency platform, and has advised its users to transfers their funds to Binance.  Zhao was denying claims made by WazirX founder Nischal Shetty that the Indian exchange is owned by Binance following a probe by Indian government agencies.  ""Binance provides wallet services for WazirX. WazirX domain is transferred to our control. We were given a shared access to an AWS account. We could shut down WazirX. But we can't, because it hurts users,"" Zhao tweeted.  ""If you have funds on WazirX, you should transfer it to Binance. Simple as that.""  Users, in turn, flooded WazirX's Telegram channel asking if this was true, whether their funds were safe and whether the exchange's native coin, WRX, would be delisted by Binance. WRX is down over 12% since Friday currently priced at 25 cents, according to CoinMarketCap data.  ""In light of recent events about WazirX, we wanted to assure you that operations are being conducted as normal,"" WazirX responded on Telegram.  WazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon also tried to quell fears, stating, “We are the only large crypto exchange that allows complete withdrawals of cryptos in India and that shows how solvent we are and how sensible our business model is. Indian rupee (INR) withdrawals are working, and there is no issue in terms of the structural viability of the company. Users crypto is safe.”  Twitter spat  Zhao's comments came after India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the properties of WazirX director and co-founder Sammer Mhatre on Aug. 5. The properties were raided as part of an investigation over alleged fraud on instant loan apps that the crypto platform ""actively assisted,"" according to ED.  India's Ministry of Finance had also said that it was investigating WazirX, alleging the exchange used Binance to disguise transactions.  Binance was believed to be the owner of WazirX, but its CEO denied the claim on Twitter. ""Binance does not own any shares in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX and established by the original founders,"" Zhao said. Referring to a blog post announcing a proposed acquisition in November 2019, Zhao said the deal was never completed.  Nischal Shetty, however, suggested on Twitter that Zhao was muddying the situation by referring to Zanmai Labs.  ""WazirX was acquired by Binance. Zanmai Labs is an India entity owned by me & my co-founders Zanmai Labs has license frm Binance to operate INR-Crypto pairs in WazirX Binance operates crypto to crypto pairs, processes crypto withdrawal,"" he tweeted.  He said that Binance owns the WazirX domain name, root access to its servers, all its crypto assets and all profits.  ""Don't confuse Zanmai and WazirX,"" he added.  Shetty told CoinDesk in an interview that WazirX has the legal documentation in place to prove that Binance owns WazirX.

42395059,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWq0d,1659949221,pSTAKE Announces stkBNB to Unlock Liquidity on Staked BNB Token,"Liquid staking, which allows investors to generate extra yield on top of standard rewards for staking or locking coins in a network, is becoming increasingly popular outside of the Ethereum blockchain.  pSTAKE, the liquid staking protocol from the Tendermint-based layer-1 network Persistence, is rolling out a liquid staking functionality for binance coin (BNB), the native coin of the Ethereum rival BNB Chain, the platform announced Monday in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  At press time, BNB was the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of nearly $53 billion, and the BNB Chain was the world's second-largest smart contract blockchain. Staking, which refers to the process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet in return for rewards, is essential for decentralized, on-chain governance of the BNB Chain.  Users can stake their BNB via the pSTAKE app while receiving staked BNB or stkBNB, a liquid representative of the BNB deposits initially valued 1-to-1 with the native token. These stkBNB tokens will be directly minted as BEP-20 tokens. They will offer seamless integration with the BNB Chain-based decentralized finance applications, meaning the stkBNB tokens can be used elsewhere to earn additional yield. So, users will have two sources of income: yield generated from lending and borrowing stkBNB and rewards for staking BNB, which will come from transaction fees paid by users of the BNB Chain. There are more than 1,500 decentralized applications on the BNB Chain.  ""Even with the market sentiment not being the greatest, In Q2 2022, BNB Chain saw an increase in new addresses created on a daily basis. This shows that there are a lot of new participants entering the BNB ecosystem and there is no better place for them to start than by liquid staking their BNB to earn ~5.5-6% staking rewards and have the opportunity to utilize stkBNB in other yield generation avenues such as liquidity provisioning and borrowing against it,"" Mikhil Pandey, the pSTAKE project lead, told CoinDesk.  With traditional staking, investors lose liquidity of their coins and forego yield-generating opportunities. Liquid derivatives like stkBNB solve that problem by unlocking the value of staked BNB, which can be used elsewhere. Therefore, pSTAKE is confident that stkBNB will accelerate the growth of the BNB Chain ecosystem. The company already offers liquid staking products for the Cosmos, Persistence and Ethereum networks.  ""This [stkBNB] will incentivize both new and existing BNB holders/users to increase their participation in the broader BNB ecosystem, which means a higher staking ratio and a stronger network,"" pSTAKE said in the press release. The value of stkBNB will increase against BNB as the BNB staked through pSTAKE accrues staking rewards in the background.  pSTAKE will allow users to stake any non-zero amount of BNB and bypass the traditional seven-day ""unbonding"" period when unstaking BNB by trading their stkBNB for another asset at any time.

Bitcoin Holds Above $23K  By James Rubin  Bitcoin held its footing above $23,000 throughout the weekend as investors seemed mostly recovered from Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $23,300, up slightly over the last 24 hours and roughly where it started the weekend. Bitcoin fell below $23,000 early Friday following the U.S. Labor Department report – which doubled most analysts' expectations for July job growth – before regaining its previous perch above the threshold. The additional jobs countered previous indicators suggesting the economy was slowing enough to allow the U.S. central bank to soon scale back steep interest rate increases that many investors believe will cast the economy into a recession and send riskier assets spiraling.  Bitcoin has lost more than 50% of its value since the start of the year, plummeting with stocks. Investors fretted about the dual threats of inflation and economic contraction. Digital assets have rallied along with stocks over the past three weeks, however, amid hopeful signs, and held fast the past three days.  ""If bitcoin can hold onto the $23,000 level, that could be very promising for the medium-term outlook,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Americas Edward Moya wrote in an email, adding optimistically. ""Bitcoin has been stabilizing here and could see further bullish momentum on the break of the $25,000 level.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently trading hands at approximately $1,700, up roughly a percentage point and about where it stood when the weekend began. Other major cryptos were mixed, with THETA and ATOM rising over 7% and 6%, respectively at one point, but FIL dropping more than 5%.  Cryptos tracked major equity markets on Friday, which dropped following the jobs numbers before regaining ground in the afternoon to finish flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.5% on Friday while the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, was down 0.2%. Both indexes nevertheless advanced for a third consecutive week, buoyed not only by signs of slowing growth but upbeat forecasts by a number of global technology and financial services brands.  The 528,000 added jobs in July was more than double the consensus among analysts who study labor markets, and a clear sign that this one part of the economy remains strong.  ""The economic stats have suddenly taken on a bit brighter hue,"" Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi tweeted on Sunday. ""The July jobs report shows the economy’s resilience and why we are neither in recession nor is a near-term recession inevitable.""  Zandi added that these trends would ""become clearer"" with the release of July's consumer price index data on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, crypto markets digested a mix of good and bad news. On Monday, an exploit of cross-chain messaging protocol Nomad allowed $200 million to be siphoned off the platform.  But markets were encouraged by the latest initiatives involving large institutional investors. Asset manager Brevan Howard completed the largest crypto hedge fund launch ever, with more than $1 billion in assets under management, and BlackRock (BLK) formed a partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) to make crypto directly available to institutional investors. Coinbase's shares closed 10% higher on Thursday and jumped an additional 4.6% on Friday.  ""Traditional finance firms continue their crypto push,"" Arcane Research noted in its Friday newsletter.  Investors will be eyeing Coinbase's second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) will also be announcing earnings early in the week.

Korea — It’s blockchain megaweek in Seoul, with the BUIDL Asia, Eth Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week conferences stacked back-to-back over a 10-day period.  This being the first set of conferences in Asia post-coronavirus, there should be a certain energy in the air. There’s an excitement about the return of in-person conferences to the continent – masks and all – but the ghost of the Terra blockchain’s spectacular crash still looms large.  Prosecutors are on a warpath in Korea, raiding exchanges and the home of Terra’s founder while banning some current and former staff from leaving the country.  On stage at BUIDL Asia, the T word was not quite verboten but almost: CoinDesk heard that speakers were told not to mention Terra on stage. Of course, the Streisand effect was in full force and the word was used again and again to drive home a point.  But that’s not the first time there was a certain nervousness around the word.  Months ago, when LUNA was smoldering, CoinDesk reported that Korean VC Fund Hashed had taken a $3.5 billion hit on Terra’s LUNA token.  Almost immediately after the article was published, a public relations representative for Terraform Labs got in touch with CoinDesk – not to dispute the veracity of the story – the Hashed founder later confirmed the amount in an early August interview with Bloomberg – but rather to ask that language be toned down regarding Hashed’s participation in Terra’s funding rounds. Law enforcement was looking at anyone that touched the fundraise with the country’s largest magnifying glass.  Of course the question on everyone’s mind is, will someone get served a subpoena during Korea Blockchain week? So far there have been no reports of process servers gracing BUIDL Asia and Eth Seoul with their presence, but these were small events for what’s to come.  It was just last year when Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon confirmed he was served with a subpoena at Messari’s Mainnet crypto conference by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Stay tuned.  Important events  Korea Blockchain Week  ETHToronto  Marathon Digital Earnings  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  BlackRock and Coinbase Partner to Give Institutional Investors Greater Access to Crypto; Bank of England Rate Hike  ""First Mover"" examined the latest news affecting crypto markets. The Bank of England has raised interest rates by 50 basis points, its largest hike since 1995. In a bright spot amid challenging times for Coinbase, BlackRock plans to offer crypto to institutional investors through Coinbase Prime. Charles Allen, BTCS CEO, joined markets discussion. Also, Alex Zinder had a business update from Ledger Enterprises and Frances Coppola broke down proposals from the Bank of International Settlements.
