42399137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSZ7,1468014933,Bitcoin Prices Volatile in $600s As Traders Await Halving,"Bitcoin prices experienced moderate volatility during the week ending 8th July as market participants took action ahead of the upcoming halving of bitcoin rewards, scheduled to happen on or around 9th July.  As the decline in new bitcoins minted daily is programmed into the network, the broader bitcoin community has known about this event for years, and many are eagerly watching or even wagering on the outcome. Perhaps because of this, market momentum coming into the week was high.  After opening at $672.48 on 1st July, bitcoin prices quickly surpassed $700, breaching this level on 2nd July and reaching a weekly high of $704.42 at 12:00 UTC on 3rd July, according to CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  This rally represented ""a natural market response as eager buyers saw an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap before the halving,"" explained Peter Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  This situation ""fueled massively bullish market sentiment,"" a statement which he backed up using Whaleclub data. According to these figures, total position volume was 92% and 88% long on 1st and 2nd July, respectively.  In spite of this strong sentiment, bitcoin failed to stay above $700 for long, plunging to a low of $648.05 at 16:45 UTC on 3rd July, additional BPI data reveals.  The digital currency was unable to stay at $700 because once it reached this level, ""sellers come out of the woodwork"" to find buyers, according to investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.  Zivkovski provided similar insight into the digital currency’s decline, stating that its price ""failed to make new highs above $700 despite multiple attempts,"" a development that he said drove prices down and cleared ""weakly held and over leveraged longs.""  Market correction  The digital currency managed to recover from this sharp decline, rising to a high of $679.92 at 01:45 UTC on 7th July, before plunging roughly 10% to a low of $611.26 by 21:30 UTC that same day.  When explaining this sharp decline, market experts spoke to both uncertainty and profit taking ahead of the halving. For example, Lingham emphasized that there are a great deal of unknowns surrounding this event, and that ""no one really knows what the implications are going to be.""  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX, stated that amid this uncertainty, many market participants are choosing to take profits instead of leaving their bitcoin at risk.  Zivkovski told CoinDesk that leading up to the correction, Whaleclub registered a long-short ratio of 22-to-1, its highest on record, meaning that with all these bullish positions up, there was no buying power left.  ""No new money entered the system, and following a few days of low volume and failure to reach new highs, low entry buyers triggered a large sell off by taking profit,"" he stated.  Ether weakness  While the halving event has been generating substantial visibility, ether, the digital currency of platform ethereum, has been experiencing its own major events.  Ether prices repeatedly fell below $10 during the week, a sharp contrast to the all-time high of $21 the digital currency reached in mid-June, Poloniex figures reveal. In addition, the digital currency declined 18.5% week-over-week.  Ether has been suffering this consistent weakness as the ether community debated whether to implement a hard fork in a bid to bail out investors of the failed distributed organization The DAO.  Since this problem appeared in June, the ether community has been considering how to address the situation. Originally, many advocated a soft fork to solve the problem, but it has been since revealed that harnessing this approach would leave The DAO open to further attacks.  Now, many members of the Ethereum community are pushing for developers to implement a hard fork for The DAO, which would effectively kill the distributed organization. The situation will likely be a source of continued volatility in the coming weeks as the community seeks a conclusion.  Charles L.

Organized by consumer advocacy group Consumers’ Research, the event will be held from Sunday, 10th July through Wednesday, 13th July, with the goal for a final white paper to be released at payments industry conference Money2020 in October.  Confirmed attendees include members of government groups including the US Federal Trade Commission; US Department of Commerce; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as US Representatives Mick Mulvaney and David Schweikert and members of educational groups including Coin Center and MIT Media Lab.  In statements, Consumers’ Research executive director Joe Colangelo spoke broadly of the impact blockchains and distributed ledgers could have across industries, while suggesting regulatory concerns may be holding back the technology's wider use.  Colangelo said:  ""This collaboration will produce a model for bitcoin and blockchain-based companies that also addresses the concerns of regulatory entities.""

42399121,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSMK,1468008987,The CoinDesk Guide to Bitcoin Halving Parties,"Food, drink and incredibly dense visualizations of bitcoin data were on-hand last night at a New York bitcoin ""halving party"" co-hosted by investment firm Digital Currency Group and UK banking giant Barclays.  The otherwise rare combination of food, fun and geeky bitcoin trivia will likely be seen with increasing frequency at events popping up all over the world between the time of publication and sometime on Saturday (or maybe early Sunday), when the reward that miners are paid for transaction verification on the distributed network is cut in half.  While the prospect of a decreasing incentive to mine bitcoins and ensure the soundness of the network may seem like reason to be concerned, this is all part of a design to limit the amount of cryptocurrency in circulation and theoretically control inflation.  Still, the co-host of last night’s event said the events cropping up spontaneously around the world are evidence that bitcoin first caught on not because it was an exciting and intricate new technology, but because people found a common interest in the cryptocurrency's philosophy of decentralization.  Digital Currency Group director Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin was and still is a technological experiment and a social experiment. It started as a community of people who really felt passionate about the underlying philosophical principals of bitcoin and it still is.""  Likely, a search online wherever you live will turn up some small clan of bitcoiners gathering to mark the occasion, forecast by TheHalvening.com to occur on 9th July at 17:14:02 GMT.  But we’ve identified a few that stand out as notable for various reasons, regardless of where you live. (Hat tip to The Halvening for assembling this list of halving parties around the world).  Argentina  Earlier this week, we reported that Uber's Argentina subsidiary is now doing business with bitcoin wallet Xapo as a way to sidestep a crackdown by local authorities. On Saturday, Bitcoin Argentina is hosting a meetup with pizza, drinks and a ""show de fuegos artificiales,"" or fireworks.  Australia  There’s at least two halving parties in Australia, where blockchain news has been breaking regularly this year, from $16m worth of bitcoin being sold at an Australian auction to the nation’s government approaching a decision on bitcoin exchange regulation to the Australian Securities Exchange affirming its support of blockchain.  The Melbourne Bitcoin Technology Center gave away free bitcoin at its event last night, and on Sunday, Bitcoin Brisbane plans to gather.  ""Of course, there will be beers, chatting and trading on the night,"" according to the site.  Canada  Earlier today, we reported that Coinbase would no longer be able to service Canadian clients after the closure of its processing service, Vogogo, an event that should give those in Montreal plenty to talk about.  Since the halving won’t happen at a set time, but will change based on block processing times, the event hosted at Montreal’s Bitcoin Embassy, is scheduled to begin 25 blocks before block 420,000 (the block where the network change will be introduced).  France  Over in France, bitcoiners in Paris will have plenty to talk about in the wake of Britain’s departure from the European Union, of which the nation is a member, and French Presidential hopeful, Marin Le Pen’s call for a ban on bitcoin.  La Maison du Bitcoin is hosting an event in Paris on Saturday.  The Netherlands  Bitcoin Amsterdam is hosting an event in Café Fonteyn on Saturday.  For those who attend the party, the first round is being paid for by the Blockchain Education Network, which is helping groups around the world organize halving parties.  The US  Over in North Carolina in the US, the halving partiers will have plenty to discuss at the Asheville Food Park, now that the state’s governor, Pat McCrory signed House Bill 289 into law, which expands the state’s Money Transmitters Act to cover activities related to bitcoin.  In addition to a bar, this party is set to include a coffee house and two food trucks.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

42399117,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSIO,1468003855,Bitcoin Industry Seeking to Bridge Scaling Divide at July Meeting,"Members of the bitcoin industry, including major miners and developers, are set to meet in California this month, sources say.  Though details of the event are scarce, representatives from Blockstream, HaoBTC and F2Pool confirmed to CoinDesk they are planning to attend. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Jihan Wu, the CEO of bitcoin hardware firm Bitmain (which also operates the AntPool mining pool), indicated that he would be attending the gathering.  While the event's agenda is currently unknown, the Bloomberg interview suggested that the event will focus on the question of scaling, and that miners may seek a more proactive stance in the block size discussion.  Wu told the publication that he expects a resolution to the question of scaling the bitcoin network.  ""There’s no way we will be at this impasse forever,"" he remarked.  Bitcoin startup Blockstream is also participating in the event, though a representative said that the company wasn’t organizing it. The company declined to comment on the event’s agenda or its list of attendees.  The meeting comes months after a meeting in Hong Kong between miners and several members of the Bitcoin Core development community. That meeting resulted in an agreement to submit a 2MB block size increase to Core for open consideration, but recent reports suggest that work on that proposal has stalled, enflaming tensions in the process.  The past year has seen other gatherings, including the two-part Scaling Bitcoin event, which brought together the vast majority of the world's bitcoin miners as well as a number of developers, startups and other community members, for discussion on the issue.

42399118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSJN,1467997220,What to Expect When the Bitcoin Halving Happens,"It's an event that brings equal parts predictability and uncertainty.  For close to a year, bitcoin miners and investors have been preparing for a network change nicknamed 'the halving'. At approximately 18:00 UTC tomorrow, the subsidy the bitcoin network uses to compensate miners will drop from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, never to increase again.  Yet, despite its scheduled arrival, many in the industry remain unsure just how significant an impact it could have on bitcoin's still-volatile price and the health of the distributed payment network's transaction validators (aka miners).  A programmed feature in the code, the bitcoin subsidy controls the supply of new bitcoins that are released into the market with each new block. When bitcoin first launched, a miner could earn 50 BTC for sealing a block on the blockchain ledger. After 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years, however, the reward was cut in half to 25. And tomorrow, as block 420,000 is sealed, miners will be left with a reward of 12.5 bitcoin.  As currently set, only 21m BTC will ever be mined, a figure that would require the consensus of all or most bitcoin users to change.  Because the figure does not vary or become irregular, there is a steady, predictable supply of new bitcoins. To traders, this has quelled some uncertainty regarding how many new bitcoins could suddenly appear for sale, and to miners, it has provided a steady incentive for them to continue maintaining bitcoin's ledger.  Complicating matters, however, is that not all traders are altruistic and that mining costs money, and since bitcoin's price impacts other areas of the ecosystem, some believe this delicate balance could be altered by the halving.  Petar Zivkovski, the director of operations at WhaleClub, argues that the price of bitcoin will drop after halving, due to the fact it marks a likely exit event for speculative buyers.  Zivkovski said:  ""The halving’s impact on price has been felt since September of last year when price was hovering in the $200s. During that time, smart money began buying bitcoin in a market phase commonly known as accumulation.""  So, what impact will halving have on the network? What will happen to the price? What can the average bitcoin investor or user expect to happen – or not to happen – once the halving occurs?  CoinDesk surveyed a number of market experts to explore.  There won't be Armageddon  At one point, there were some miners who expressed concern that the halving could impact their profitability, enough so that some would be forced offline. Chandler Guo, the founder of Bitbank and its subsidiary, BW, was one of these community members.  He argued in the beginning of June that, ""if the price doesn’t go up very quickly, up two times, it means a lot of the older machines will be shut down. They must shut down"".  Further, he cautioned that 300 petahash of older machines could be forced off the network. But, since that interview, the price has increased from $530 to $650, meaning that this dynamic has changed.  Guo's thesis focused on the belief that if transactions took longer to verify, individuals would grow disenfranchised with the network, which could ultimately send the price down. If that happened, especially with the reward cutting in half, the profits for miners could degrade, making continuous mining more difficult.  Eric Lombrozo, founder of Ciphrex and a contributor to the open-source Bitcoin Core developer team, said in June that it was possible that such an event could occur, but that the extent of any impact was likely to be mitigated, based on historical analysis.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve already had a halving in the past…and we’ve also seen significant sudden drops in bitcoin price – both of these situations imply lower short-term miner revenue. In neither case did we see a significant drop in hashrate.""  The hashrate could decline  While Armageddon is not around the corner, there is agreement that hashrate on the network, which currently stands at 1.54 exahashes per second will experience a slight decline.  Marco Streng, CEO of hosted mining services firm, Genesis Mining, isn’t too concerned about this, however. ""I think due to the halving, a slight hashrate drop is realistic to assume,” he said.  Terrence Thurber, co-founder and CEO of hosted bitcoin miner Oregon Mines, echoed Streng's predictions about the network experiencing some drop in the total hashrate.  ""We continue to believe that total network hash rate will decrease by approximately 10% after halving as older equipment that is no longer economically viable will leave the network. Later generation machines ... will pick up some of the slack,"" he told CoinDesk.  Elsewhere, BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov expressed optimism about the halving, though admitted that his firm expects some drop in hashrate.  ""Some decline in the bitcoin network hashrate is expected (after the halving), and we believe it will be insignificant,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The most important thing is that even if the hashrate declines, it will not compromise the security of the bitcoin network.""  Mining costs won't be affected  But the drop in hashrate won’t be as significant primarily because the only real cost that miners have is electricity.  Eric Mu, the chief marketing officer at HaoBTC, a mining firm with approximately 5.5% of hashrate, explained that the effect of halving likely won’t be immediate.  ""The bulk of the cost is sunk in the form of mining equipment and infrastructure, at least that is our case,"" he said.  Litecoin’s halving event, which took place on 25th August, 2015, supports Mu and Lombrozo's belief that the effect won’t be significant.  When the halving happened, the hashrate was 1.19 TH/s. Over the following days, that dropped to 1.11 TH/s, which was only a 7% drop.  Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and director of engineering at Coinbase, explained why the drop was so small in a reddit post.      Because China-based hydro power plants generate too much electricity, he explained, they will sometimes give miners free electricity for a share of revenue. Miners may make half as much at halving, but with free electricity, he argued they're still profitable.  The price will drop  But, how the price will be affected remains to be seen.  As noted by Zivkovski, the smart money — institutions, professional traders and knowledgeable bitcoiners — were banking on the rumor and event cycle. It's arguable that yesterday's near-10% price correction was already a sign that this is starting to occur.  Zivkovski said to CoinDesk:    ""This is the classic 'buy the rumor, sell the event' cycle. In this case, the event is the halving. Smart (and patient) money, in the most part, is no longer looking to accumulate. Their holdings have more than tripled in value.""    And after halving, the accumulators will start looking to liquidate those holdings, Zivkovski explained.  ""Post-halving, however, the excitement will die down. Bitcoin, the network, has not changed fundamentally or significant in the past six months,” he said.  While he couldn’t offer a precise prediction on price, he did say that after accumulators take their profits, ""a higher support level will form and the cycle will slowly take shape again"".  Later, the price will rise  While the price could decline in the short term, it remains unclear how supply and demand will shift after the halving, if it will at all.  Miners are earning 25 BTC today, but it's not known whether they're selling at the same rate to maintain operations now that the price has increased. With prices rising, they could even be holding more bitcoin than they would normally.  Either way, the rate at which they could potentially sell new bitcoins into the market will undoubtedly fall, which could mean that, assuming demand does not decline, buyers will need to acquire bitcoin from the market, which would push the price up.  Where there is uncertainty is how much the price will rise.  ""The price of bitcoin after the halving would normally be expected to rise as decreasing supply meets increasing demand,"" Thurber explained. ""The unknown is how much price increase has already been baked into the current price.""  But when the halving dust settles, Thurber believes that the price will be even higher than this recent run-up.  He said:    ""Presuming the $445 value in May to be prior to a halving induced run-up, the project price after halving is fully absorbed should be approximately twice that level, around $900. Reaching this theoretical equilibrium is likely to take several months if it occurs.""    Progress will continue  Ultimately, no matter the outcome, bitcoin has been here before.  It halved, some people stopped mining, but then the dust settled and the network grew, a process that will continue to happen until all 21m BTC are mined.  And as the network continues to grow and solidify, it becomes clear that even an event as jarring as halving can only reassert bitcoin’s continued existence.

42399110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQlw,1467992585,US Exchange Regulator FINRA Cites Bitcoin in Annual Risk Assessment,"A self-regulatory organization tasked with overseeing brokerage firms and exchange markets is attempting to obtain more information about how its members may be using bitcoin or other virtual currencies.  The inquiry comes as part of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) 2016 Risk Control Assessment Survey, an optional poll that seeks to improve the organization’s understanding of member operations and the potential risks associated with those activities.  The survey was sent to members at the beginning of June, and comes amid a larger inquiry by many government and non-government regulators, both in the US and internationally, into uses of bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Among the roughly 200 questions, two were focused on virtual currencies. One required question sought to address whether member firms are engaged in business activities involving virtual currencies, while the other aimed to assess the nature of activities.  The questionnaire provides a number of possible answers for respondents including whether they issue virtual currencies or are affiliated with entities that trade or invest in the area, providing insight into how FINRA believes its members may be engaging with the emerging technology.  In statements to CoinDesk, FINRA sought to position the inquiry as just a small part of a larger examination process, one whose results would not be released more widely.  The organization said:  ""The information collected through the RCA is used for regulatory and examination purposes only.""  Elsewhere, Pillsbury Winthrop attorney Marco Santori said he believes FINRA may be seeking to learn more about its members virtual currency activities due to complexities relating to the how broker-dealers are regulated in the US.  More specifically, he posited that the reason for the questions may be that entities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are exempt from Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and state licensing requirements, agencies which have been more assertive in attempting to understand and regulate the industry.

42399106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQi0,1467983755,"At $400 Million a Year, Academic Argues Bitcoin Mining Worth the Cost","The University College London’s blockchain research center has found that bitcoin's current proof-of-work (PoW) mining costs are necessary to maintain the network's trustless and decentralized nature.  In a recent research note, Tomaso Aste, a professor of complexity sciences and director of the UCL's Centre for Blockchain Technologies, offers a rough measure for calculating the ""equilibrium fair cost"" of bitcoin’s PoW system, suggesting that this fair cost per block is roughly $10,000 – less than the current amount earned by discovering a block today.  The findings are notable given the longstanding debate over bitcoin's use of mining for transaction verification, one that has often found institutions and academics deeming the process either excessively wasteful or an unnecessary component of the system's architecture.  Still, in the note, Aste calls the amount of money spent per block justified when observed through the lens of maintaining a distributed transaction network.  He wrote:  ""I conclude that the current cost, although large, is of a justified order of magnitude for an anonymous systems[sic] operating between untrustful parties.""  At current bitcoin prices, a block reward of 25 BTC nets miners or the distributed members of mining pools roughly $15,600. An upcoming block reward halving, scheduled for this weekend, will see the subsidy fall to 12.5 BTC.  Assessing cost  Bitcoin mining has been compared in the past to a form of energy arbitrage, by which mine operators profit by generating more money than they spend on electricity. The cheaper your power – and the bigger your mine – the more bitcoins you can attempt to generate.  Aste estimates that as much as $50,000 is expended on electricity per hour by the world’s bitcoin miners.  Using a standard a transaction block roughly every 10 minutes (which, in practice, can fluctuate significantly), Aste suggests that it costs about $8,333 in power per block. This amount will fall by half imminently, he writes, ""leaving very small margins for profit accordingly with the above estimations"".  ""The overall mining electricity bill for a year of bitcoin mining sum up to over $400m which is a large amount and, somehow, a big waste,"" Aste writes, going on to say:  ""On the other hand, proof of work is the mechanism that keeps the blockchain pure making an entire community competing to verify validity of transactions and making attacks costly. The question I address in this note is whether this cost is justified.""  Attack scenario  Aste arrives at the estimate for the fair cost of proof-of-work by envisioning a double-spend attack, using a transaction block with a value of about $1m as an example.  He notes that in order to ensure a successful double-spend, the attacker would need to somehow guarantee that their transactions are confirmed at least six times on the network.  Accounting for the fact that a double-spend would likely go unnoticed – ""it is quite unrealistic to assume that nobody notices the propagating fork for such a long time,"" he writes – Aste posits that the equilibrium fair cost of bitcoin’s proof of work is equal to the duplicated fraction of a block’s value divided by the number of blocks required to settle, in this case six.  ""With the current values, and to make calculations clean, we can assume that the attacker duplicates 60% of the typical value of a block, double spending therefore $600,000,"" Aste writes. “Requiring six blocks for settlement this yields to the following estimate for what should be the fair cost of the proof of work per block at equilibrium….$100,000.""  Aste goes on to write that the actual fair cost, accounting for the notion that a double-spend would be spotted early on and that most double-spends would likely be attempted on a smaller scale, is likely 10% of that rough estimate.  ""This is indeed the order of magnitude of the present electricity cost for the proof of work in bitcoin,"" Aste notes, going on to conclude:  ""We can therefore conclude that the current cost for bitcoin proof of work is large, wasteful, but necessary.""

42399107,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQiz,1467936861,Bitcoin Exchanges Weigh Impact As Vogogo Moves to Shutter Payments Service,"Bitcoin services startup Vogogo is closing its cryptocurrency-focused payment processing service next month after it failed to gain traction, a move that comes amid the exits of several executives and reports that at least some bitcoin services will be affected in the near-term.  Announced  on 5th July, the move will see Vogogo shutting down its payments service after it completed selling its risk management business. Those two business lines were major elements of Vogogo, which raised $8.5m in venture funding in August 2014 before going public last year.  The closure is notable given the relatively small size of the country's bitcoin industry and Vogogo's position as a visible service provider in Canada.  One bitcoin exchange, Coinbase, which used Vogogo as a payments processor for the Canadian market, has been affected by the shutdown, telling customers in that country that it won't be able to offer support after the end of this month.  Other exchanges that operate in Canada, most notably Kraken and QuadrigaX, say they aren't affected by the closure.  Vogogo has been searching for new directions – and revenue – since April, public statements show, when the company announced that its board of directors was looking for alternatives. At the time, the company said it would downsize as part of a cost-cutting plan.  CFO Tom Wenz said in an interview that other assets, including an Electronic Money Institution license obtained last fall, are being looked at as revenue generators, though he said that the company wasn’t going out of business and that it has “plenty of cash in the bank”.  He said that the payment business wasn’t making enough money to keep it afloat, and that ultimately, the company opted, in a decision he said was made Monday, to close it down.  Wenz told CoinDesk:  “The payment business, there wasn’t a lot of interest in it. There wasn’t a lot of revenue or customers there. So, the simplest way to preserve cash value to the organization was just to shut that piece down.”  Impact on bitcoin services  In an email sent to Canada-based customers and later circulated via social media, exchange service Coinbase said that it wouldn’t be able to provide electronic funds transfers or Interac transfers for those clients, or store funds denominated in Canadian dollars.  Those funds need to be withdrawn by 29th July, the email said.  Coinbase later told CoinDesk that it was working to restore service to Canadian customers in light of the loss of access to Vogogo’s processing service.  “We will adjust to this change as quickly as possible and hope to promptly restore services to our Canadian customers,” the company said.  Bitcoin service Celery said that about 10% of its volume comes from Canada since its integration with Vogogo in 2015, and that it hadn’t yet spoken to customers about alternatives. Founder Ilya Subkhankulov suggested that alternatives within Canada for bitcoin companies might be few and far between given the existing financial climate.  “The Canadian payment processing market is especially hard to obtain access to for digital currency transaction processing because only a handful of banks have a tight grip on the payment networks,"" he said.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said that while Vogogo was the firm’s main processing service for Canadian dollars, he said the exchange had alternatives to turn to following the closure.  “At the moment, we don't expect our clients to be affected,” Powell told CoinDesk.  Multiple factors  Wenz framed the decision to close the processing unit, as well as the company’s broader strategic shift, as an effort to pivot away from a business model that wasn’t working.  The past several months has seen significant change within the company. In May, the board of directors created an internal group to consider new directions. Less than a month later, Vogogo announced that president and CEO Geoff Gordon would resign effective 24th June. He is set to resign from the company’s board on 10th July.  In 16th July, Vogogo announced that chief revenue officer Rodney Thompson resign as chief revenue officer. Wenz himself is set to shift to a part-time basis at the end of this month.  Beyond the revenue and market traction problems, Wenz pointed to the company’s public stock as a factor. Vogogo’s stock price traded at nearly C$2 last July, according to data from Bloomberg, before suffering a 12-month decline of more than 90% that has left it trading at around 12 Canadian cents.  “The current business model wasn’t being supported and that was reflected in the stock price,” he said. “Instead of burning more capital on a business that wasn’t getting support, we’re looking at other options.”  Image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/07/08/bitcoin-exchanges-weigh-impact-as-vogogo-moves-to-shutter-payments-service,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b74d6943be3739af9fce1d5041a0e9ce21649719-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
