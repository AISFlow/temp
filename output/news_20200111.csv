42383193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uODv,1578782177,Hardware Is Hard: Two Blockchain Devices Win Plaudits at CES 2020,"LAS VEGAS — In tech there's an old adage: ""hardware is hard."" It's much easier to prototype and test a product when a mistake can be fixed by deleting and rewriting a few lines of code.      At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, though, two crypto companies are leading with atoms rather than bits, and it seems to be working.      Their products won ""CES Innovation Awards"" and coveted spots at the gadget showcase, where hordes of people pour through the Sands Expo Center.      We first encountered Pundi X at CES when speaking MakerDAO in the ""Digital Money"" section. The MakerDAO Foundation was showing off its integration with the XPOS point-of-sale system, a device that Pundi X made to both sell crypto and also for merchants to accept crypto as payment.      XPOS isn't what earned Pundi X plaudits at CES, though. Instead, it was ""Blok On Blok"" (BOB), its blockchain phone, which got recognized in the trade show’s Mobile Devices & Accessories category.    Meet BOB    '""We want to offer the user an option to control their data,"" Pundi X’s Soohan Han told CoinDesk at the company’s booth.      Han said the point of the BOB phone is to give users confidence their communications really aren't being monitored. He also promised the phones’ ability to bypass censors. For example, the United Arab Emirates blocks VoIP, but Han said he was able to get past it with his BOB phone on a visit there.      The phone runs on Pundi X's own f(x) blockchain (the company is also, incidentally, planning to move XPOS to its own blockchain, though it was built for ethereum).      The BOB phone is able to switch back and forth between Android mode and an Android fork built for blockchain usage that's ready to support dapps. Similarly, the Sirin Labs phone supported dapps, but it did not run on an operating system designed around blockchain.      Han said the aim for Pundi X is to create a third operating system, one that other telephone companies will build phones for.      ""There isn't any decentralized operating system out there. We want to offer (f)x OS to give people a way to control their data if they want to,"" Han said.      Han said the company expects to target the tech-centric and security-conscious with this mobile device. Super-privacy-conscious users might be somewhat skeptical of an operating system built on Android, but there are few options out there.      One non-blockchain offering built on open source software is the Librem 5 by Purism, which runs PureOS, based on Linux. The Librem has physical switches that disconnect the device's camera and microphone so a user can really know they aren't working.      Pundi X raised $30.5 million in a 2017 ICO, according to Binance, which has been used to build and deploy XPOS. Its phone, BOB, is available now on Indiegogo for pre-order as low as $554. Han expects the phone to ship this year.    Ucam    Similarly, “Internet of Trusted Things” startup IoTeX was showing off its Ucam device, a home security camera that shares footage to the cloud, but it isn't actually branded as IoTeX.      ""Our company is a blockchain platform, and we are working with other IoT and hardware manufacturing companies to make private and secure IoT devices,"" IoTeX’s Dorothy Ko explained.      Instead, a company that's been building cameras for years, Tenvis, will build and offer the device. The product earned CES 2020's recognition in the Cybersecurity & Personal Privacy category.      ""This is a hyper-saturated market,"" IoTeX Head of Business Development Larry Pang told CoinDesk. “Tenvis came to us looking for the next feature, and that's privacy.”      Ucam footage will be viewable through a mobile app and that app will hold the private key for everything it captures. That way, even if the user decides to store the data in the cloud, the cloud service provider won't be able to view it.      The app can handle one or several cameras.      Video can be held on board the camera on an SD card, stored in the cloud or even on IPFS, though cloud storage of any kind is likely to incur a fee. IoTeX will offer that service but the price isn't set yet, Pang said. If the user just holds it locally there will be no additional charge.      ""We really want to give people the ability to have privacy and a great user experience,” Pang said. Ucam will retail at $50 when it comes out, he added.    Hardware ambivalence    Neither company wants to devote itself to making hardware.      ""The good thing about this is all the cameras you see on the [CES] floor today can ultimately be powered by IoTeX,"" Pang explained. His company is working from a platform-as-a-service model.      They'd like to see IoTeX running various indoor and outdoor cameras by various brands, all connected to one app and a private key controlled by the owner.      IoTeX was able to bypass the hardware execution process by partnering with an existing company that already had it down.      That said, Pundi X really is making a phone itself. In fact, the phone will come in a giant box and require some assembly by users in order to open up the option of modularity to the device. It will even be possible to print 3-D parts for the phone.      The showcased BOB in the image above isn't really the phone design. It's a heavily modded design, showing off how a phone could showcase personality.      Han offered that Pundi X was probably one of the first movers in crypto into hardware. ""Our business is not really just hardware,” he said. “The hardware is really just a byproduct of how we introduce the solution.”      That said, Pundi X doesn't expect this to be a big run of phones. Han said that someone had to go first but the company hopes to see more companies building on the f(x) operating system in the future.      “We are not a phone company,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MKR | BNB,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/11/hardware-is-hard-two-blockchain-devices-win-plaudits-at-ces-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/052ca01b81263cef68c1905db547e42c1dbd088d-2238x1678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9uOCf,1578738000,Is Bitcoin in 2020 Really Like the Early Internet?,"It’s a cliche at this point to compare bitcoin to the “early days of the internet” since they are both examples of emerging technologies.      But does the cliche actually hold true?      If we work with a vague definition of the World Wide Web going live in 1991, then within the first decade that ecosystem grew faster and had more demand for compliant use cases than bitcoin arguably has today, one decade in.      In 1994, the New York Times reported companies were “rushing” to set up shop via the World Wide Web, although the user experience was still “slow” and “crude.” Just like blockchain technologists, early internet companies ran into scaling issues. The 1994 Times report described the web as “already showing signs of suffering from its own success, as crowds compete for access to popular databases.” Yet, people were already starting to think about subscription paywalls for content distribution.      Industry insiders were so bullish on the commercial potential that in the December 1995 issue of Wired magazine, Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy predicted the rise of “disposable word processors and spreadsheets” priced per use and delivered via Java software.      Within the first decade it was clear the internet could be used for commerce, interpersonal communications, marketing and education. There were established companies using it to turn a modest profit.      Blockstream alumnus and founder of the Blockchain Commons, Christopher Allen, said he is “concerned” about the lack of bitcoin adoption at this stage, which is why he is so optimistic about scaling solutions like the lightning network.      “Lightning does have the potential to be where you buy your steak and bread,” Allen said. “Until you buy your bread or steak with bitcoin, you’re going to have to convert to some other currency, no matter how good it is as a censorship-resistant medium.”      To be fair, cryptocurrency has already proven its usefulness through cross-border collaboration. For example, the Decred treasury has distributed roughly $3.5 million worth of cryptocurrency to more than 60 contributors, according to the community’s press representative. Roughly 30 percent of these contributors hail from Latin America and 15 percent are from Africa, a more global distribution than comparable Silicon Valley startups.      Even so, such experiments are a far cry from the “mainstream adoption” many fans predict bitcoin will undergo in becoming a global, self-sustaining currency.    Community roots    Bitcoin may be behind the internet’s timeline in terms of commercial use cases, but it has already achieved comparable social functions.      By 2001, the New York Times was describing internet services like email as a platform for relationship-building with former coworkers and classmates, while startups pioneered video and music streaming services.      One such Yahoo group reportedly included 600 people “exchanging hundreds of messages a month about the bankruptcy proceedings, health insurance and the fate of their retirement plans.” This may be comparable to crypto communities today, which rely on forums, GitHub and social networking platforms like Twitter.      According to Allen, who focused earlier in his career on core internet protocols, the internet was also designed to offer more freedom of choice to the users – even though, through big-tech consolidation, the industry eventually failed to reach that vision.      Zcash co-creator and Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox agreed that the early software projects he worked on were supposed to offer “freedom” and “end wars,” because people would just talk things out over the internet.      Wilcox said, looking back at his time in the 1990s working on bitcoin’s predecessor, Digicash, that he idealistically underestimated the importance of economic incentives.      “What I would tell myself, if I could use a time machine, it just being compatible [with commercial use] isn’t good enough,” Wilcox said. “This was a fatal flaw in the overall design of the [open software] movement, that is relied on ongoing volunteers or donations. It didn’t have a built-in economic feedback loop.”      Listen to Leigh's full interview with Zooko Wilcox      In this regard, bitcoin has a great track record during this first decade. Yet, it remains to be seen if bitcoin’s ecosystem provides a self-sustaining model.    Similar risks    Some coders believe early advocacy for strong legal frameworks that protect freedom, coupled with forward-thinking precautions, could help the decentralized “Web3” avoid or minimize early mistakes.      “Protocols would have a lot of flexibility in terms of what types of security you need, etc., and along the way we ended up creating the central Certificate Authority (CAs) business … not quite realizing that 20 years later all the CAs all got consolidated,” Allen said. “We were supposed to be able to choose which CA we trusted. Centralization crops up in odd ways.”      Marco Peereboom, a Dell alumnus and Linux veteran who is also currently the Decred community’s New Systems Development Lead, agreed with Allen that the internet was built by idealistic young men who wanted to “uplift humanity.” (Not unlike crypto adherents today.)      “I’m extremely disappointed with where we are today,” Peereboom said. “The amount of snooping the government is doing, I didn’t anticipate. … More cryptography early on would have done the internet a lot of good, and more advocacy as well.”      Along these lines, Allen is focused on work related to user-friendly-yet-secure key management and blockchain identity standards. Meanwhile, Peereboom is working to refine Decred’s open source funding experiments, which is how he earns a salary today.      Much like the altcoin project Dash, Decred pays freelancers through public votes and grants collected from the network itself. Plus, Decred developers can earn money anonymously based on the merits of their contributions.      “Until the internet moves away from the ad-sponsored model, it will only get worse,” Peereboom said, referring to potential surveillance and corporate dominance via upcoming Web3 models.      “I think anonymous payments are a must-have feature for any cryptocurrency to be around,” he said. “I hope I’m not making the same mistake twice. But I really do believe cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the world.”    Beyond bitcoin    From the perspective of veteran bitcoiners like Peereboom, many of whom are now focused on altcoin projects, bitcoin’s weakness is how difficult it is to update the software.      He said there must be a middle ground between constant changes and nearly impossible changes.      “Writing bug-free software just doesn’t happen,” Peereboom said. “You need a mechanism to deal with consensus changes.      Plus, bitcoiners like Peereboom and Wilcox are both prioritizing the privacy-enhancing aspects of cryptocurrency. Is it possible for governance mechanisms to resist centralization over several decades? That’s what Wilcox is trying to figure out.      “It would be dishonest and overselling to tell people this is inevitable,” Wilcox said.      He added Linux failed, in his opinion, because the movement “redefined success” to match corporate adoption rather than broader social change. As larger institutions profit from or leverage bitcoin, just like with the internet, the risks to users’ personal freedoms increase.      “There’s going to be a lot of challenges along the way, and harm. I’d like to mitigate the harm as much as possible,” Allen concluded.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/11/is-bitcoin-in-2020-really-like-the-early-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bad86d7067b8145f30345340a3529b2be53a9bbe-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
