42431949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8Eph,1590096929,Iranian President Calls for National Crypto Mining Strategy,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the government to draw up a renewed national approach for the emerging crypto industry.      Chairing Iran's economic coordination headquarters – a seminar for the national economic strategy – earlier this week, Rouhani told officials from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), energy department and information and communication technology ministries they needed to devise a new national strategy for crypto mining, including regulation and mining revenue, Iranian news site ArzDigital reported Wednesday.      The news comes barely two days after the Iranian parliament published a bill proposing to apply the country's strict foreign exchange and currency smuggling regulation to cryptocurrencies. The new parliamentary law would also require crypto exchanges operating in the country to first register with the CBI – possibly in a move to try and prevent too much capital leaving the country.      Penalties for smuggling in Iran can include fines and imprisonment.      Just months ago, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised concerns that Iranians were using digital assets in order to circumvent sanctions.      See also: Iran Issues License for Nation’s Biggest Bitcoin Mining Operation      Iran was one of the first countries to officially recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry back in July 2019. The government now issues mining licenses, giving companies the right to mine and then sell off any digital assets produced. An industry report in January said Iran had issued over 1,000 such licenses in its first six months.      Iran currently has a 4% share in bitcoin's total hashrate, according to the Bitcoin Mining Map, more than double what it was at the beginning of September 2019.      It's unclear why Rouhani wants Iranian officials to revisit bitcoin mining regulation.

42431961,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8FDh,1590095664,"Market Wrap: Traders 'Buy the Dip' as Bitcoin Hovers at $9,000","Bitcoin fell for a second day, extending a downdraft triggered by Wednesday’s revelation that a member of the cryptocurrency community from the blockchain’s earliest days in 2009 had moved a long-dormant cache of coins.      As of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET), bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $9,044, a loss of 5.6% over 24 hours.      Bitcoin remains well below its 10-day and 50-day technical indicator moving averages — a signal of bearish sentiment.      At 14:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET) the world’s oldest cryptocurrency began experiencing high selling volume on exchanges including Coinbase, dropping bitcoin below $9,000 for the first time since May 13.      While the market appears to have turned bearish, Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at asset management firm Koine, said he planned to “‘buy the dip” — a popular phrase for accumulating an asset when prices drop in the belief that they’ll soon start going up again.      “In a way I was hoping for this,” Douglas said in an email. “I'm a buyer at $9,000, as this is shaking out the weak longs before taking it higher.”      Read more: What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars      Volatility in the notoriously fickle bitcoin market has declined since collapsing in March, when the devastating economic toll from the coronavirus started to become clear.      “I wouldn’t call this a dump,” Darius Sit, managing partner at crypto quantitative fund QCP Capital, told CoinDesk via a Telegram message. “It’s nowhere near statistically significant.”      The price drop could take a toll on the profitability of bitcoin miners, already hurting from a revenue cut following last week’s rewards halving. The miners have had to rely more on transaction fees to maintain revenue.      Fortunately, fees are up post-halving, said Marc Fleury, CEO of digital asset brokerage Two Prime.      “Transaction fees associated with moving bitcoin around have increased from 60 cents to upwards of $5, providing some income for the miners,” he said.      Read More:Why Kyber Network Tokens Tripled to $100M Despite Coronavirus      Fleury said many bitcoin miners are counting on a price increase to stay profitable. ""This has historically happened in the past two halvings, within a span of 18 months,“ said Fluery. “It will take some time for the market to adjust.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are in the red Thursday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), lost 5.6% in 24 hours as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET).      The biggest losers in 24-hour trading were cardano (ADA) slipping 7.6%, iota (IOTA) losing 6.5% and neo (NEO) down by 6.1%. All price changes were as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Thursday.      In the commodities sector, oil is trading up 1.4%, with the price of a barrel of crude at $33 at press time. Oil has experienced a wild ride in 2020, up 101% the past month yet still down 44% for the year to date.

42431954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8Ezh,1590089704,Chinese Government Advisers Propose Regional Stablecoin for 4 Asian Countries,"Top Chinese political advisers have proposed a regional digital currency that would be backed by four major Asian currencies including the Japanese yen, Korean won, Hong Kong dollar and the yuan.      The proposal unveiled Thursday describes the currency as a “stablecoin,” a term for cryptocurrencies designed to hold their value and backed by a reserve currency, although it does not explicitly mention crypto or blockchains.      The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would lead the proposed effort. The basket of underlying collateral would follow the special drawing rights (SDR) model of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where each country’s currency is assigned a different weight based on its economy.      As such, the proposal resembles the original vision for libra, before that Facebook-spawned project watered down its plans and pivoted to developing digital versions of individual fiat currencies. (The Libra Association recently welcomed Singapore investment company Temasek as its first state-owned entity member.)      The proposed stablecoin would help facilitate trade among the four countries, which is key to economic recovery in the region after coronavirus, its proponents said. It would do so by improving cross-border settlement and clearing services with a new payment network and digital wallet for enterprises.      Read more: Chinese City Known for Bitcoin Mining Seeks Blockchain Firms to Burn Excess Hydropower      Neil Shen, founding and managing partner of Sequoia China and a member of China's upper house, presented the proposal to Chinese legislators during the Two Sessions, the country’s largest annual political gathering.      Nine other advisers who are also upper house members, including Kennedy Wong, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, former chief secretary of Hong Kong Henry Tang and Hong Kong-based Chinese billionaire Songqiao Zhang, co-signed the proposal.      Shen attended the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (PCC) on Thursday. The PCC is essentially an advisory upper house where a range of organizations and independent members help the government make national-level decisions. This meeting will be followed by plenary sessions of the National People’s Congress (NPC) starting Friday and lasting for about two weeks.      Proposals out of the PCC do not tend to have the same level of influence as the more concrete bills discussed in the NPC because the bills will yield significant changes in laws and regulations. However, in this case the proposal might have some sticking power.      California-based Sequoia Capital, Sequoia China's parent, is one of the few big-name VC firms that have ventured into crypto. It invested in $10 million in one of the largest global crypto exchanges by volume, Huobi Group, when it was based in China in 2014. (Huobi Group is now based in Singapore.)      It also invested in Nervos and Conflux via private token sales. Both these startups have collaborated with China's state-owned entities to develop blockchain technologies.

Enterprise users would be able to store the coins in a digital wallet and deposit cash at a custodian as reserves to back their stablecoins, according to the proposal.      The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and PBOC can create a framework to regulate the stablecoin’s cross-border transactions, manage risks and discourage money laundering, the proposal said.            The stablecoin could be launched ahead of China’s national digital currency and pave the way for its rollout by testing use cases to identify potential risks and technical problems. If launched, the stablecoin could be “seamlessly” connected with the digital yuan, the proposal said.      The proposal stresses Hong Kong is one of the most important financial gateways that connect mainland China to the other Asian countries, with over 70% of cross-border renminbi payment processed in the city.      Hong Kong could be the most favorable jurisdiction for such a regional stablecoin. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission created a licensing system to regulate virtual assets transactions and trading platforms in November.      Among the first 12 entities awarded with the license are Tencent’s WeBank; Alibaba’s fintech arm Ant Financial; Infinium Limited, a joint venture that includes Tencent, Industrial and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC) and other two Hong Kong-based institutional investors; and SC Digital Solutions Limited, whose 65 percent stake is owned by Standard & Chartered Bank.

42431957,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8F3h,1590088176,Kin Foundation Publishes First Transparency Report Amid SEC Court Fight,"The Kin Foundation is offering a peek under the hood.      The group published a transparency report Thursday, laying out its structure and operations, in a partnership with Messari and its disclosure database.      According to the report, the Kin Foundation plans its budget a year in advance, with funds going to app developers, node incentives, user grants and marketing and operations. There are 1.45 trillion kin tokens currently circulating, out of 10 trillion created in all.      The foundation is currently run by a board of directors that consists of two members: Kik Interactive CEO Ted Livingston and William Mougayar, author of “The Business Blockchain” and one of the founders of the Token Summit annual conference. Kik created kin in 2017.      “The Board of Directors is appointed annually by the members,” the report said. There is also a Kin Representative, which the report says acts as “a conduit between the Kin Foundation and the community of developers and holders.”      Read more: Judge Approved Blockchain Association’s Brief in Kik Case Despite SEC Objections      Matt Hannam, who took the post last month, is the only representative at present, but the foundation plans to add another two or three over the next year. Kin also has an ""informal"" community of 10 delegates who oversee kin rewards and disagreements.      The foundation's tokens are vested at a rate of 20% per year, though the report noted that the first year is only a partial year (kin was created midway through 2017).      The report claims that more than 28 million users have acquired kin in the last three years, using more than 50 different active apps. Active apps are defined as those with at least one user spending kin in the past 30 days.      According to the report, nearly 300 million kin were spent per day earlier this year.    Legal fight      The report comes amid Kik’s ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued the company last year on allegations the kin token sale was an unregistered securities offering.      Earlier this month, both parties filed their reply memos as part of the motions for summary judgement each party sought.      Kik maintains that “the SEC cannot meet its burden to prove that Kin purchasers were primarily led to expect profits from the managerial efforts of others,” pointing to the terms of use kin purchasers agreed to as one piece of evidence.      For its part, the SEC says Kik’s marketing of the kin token would have led purchasers to expect a profit, highlighting various online posts and a roadshow the company underwent.      In a statement, Kik General Counsel Eileen Lyon said, ""Our take on the SEC's opposition is that it relies heavily on the recent Telegram case, which we think was poorly reasoned and wrongly decided,” referring to the granting of a preliminary injunction against Telegram.      Read more: With Kik and Telegram Cases, the SEC Tries to Kill the SAFT      The Telegram case decision “is not binding precedent,” she said, “so it will be interesting to see what impact it might have, in light of the many other authorities we have cited and the significant factual differences in the two token offerings.”      Kik also felt that the SEC’s arguments about the “integration” issue “were conclusory and circular,"" she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/21/kin-foundation-publishes-first-transparency-report-amid-sec-court-fight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fea707384f5c6236a86cfb8140d2633dc78a43c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8F7h,1590081743,Blockchain Bites: Satoshi's Sword of Damocles,"Top Shelf    Yesterday, some of the earliest mined bitcoin moved after more than a decade of dormancy.      Whale Alert – a popular, mostly-automated Twitter account that tracks major crypto transactions – broadcast the message across the cryptoverse, saying 40 coins mined in the first month of the network’s operation had transferred from a ""possible #Satoshi owned wallet,” referring to bitcoin’s long silent creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.      This unfounded connection – based on the age of the bitcoin, and the fact they had not been moved for 11 years – caused a minor market stir.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      Since then, blockchain archeologists and bitcoin sleuths have poked holes in the theory the coins are Nakamoto’s, who, as far as we can tell, has never moved a single satoshi from the hoard of bitcoin he mined in the network’s early days. (Except for a test transaction sent to Hal Finney.)      Determining the sender of these coins is impossible, for now. But the occurrence is a moment to reflect on some important insights about the bitcoin community, infrastructure and market.      Of the approximately 18.5 million coins already mined, about 2 million are dormant – either unspent because the keys have been lost, or for other personal or technological reasons. Estimates on the higher side assume as many as 4 million bitcoin are ""lost forever."" Nakamoto once referred to lost coins as a “donation” to the network. The bitcoin protocol hardcaps the total supply of bitcoin at 21 million coins, but knowing that some coins have been “donated” has led some researchers to develop a new metric: Realized Capitalization. This measure discounts Bitcoin’s total supply to account for lost or otherwise inaccessible coins.      When previously inert coins move – be they Nakamoto’s or not – this should challenge the assumption that coins in deep storage are out of circulation. Unless they've been tossed in the bin. Therefore, a price adjustment is logical.      A partial cause for yesterday’s price movements were fears Nakamoto has returned and could potentially dump billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on the market. Nakamoto’s seemingly altruistic, or at the very least mysterious, “donation” to the bitcoin community hangs over the market like the sword of Damocles.      Like Nakamoto’s motivations, it’s an open question as to how many coins he holds. In 2013, Sergio Lerner wrote a blog post estimating the Satoshi stockpile to be around 1 million bitcoin. Years later, derivatives exchange BitMEX recounted and found the hoard to be in the neighborhood of 700,000 coins.      Both estimates look at a technical detail called the nonce value to determine what blocks Nakamoto was likely to have mined. It’s analysis of this same block feature that leads many to assume yesterday’s transaction did not belong to Nakamoto, but one of the dozens of other miners assumed to be live on the network at the time.      Curiously, when these bitcoin were mined, bitcoin itself had no market value. The block reward is now worth just shy of half a million dollars. There were also no CoinJoins or SegWit code updates, modern wallet features yesterday's transaction utilized, nor a host of blockchain analyzers watching where these coins will jump to next.      How far bitcoin has come!      Castle Island Venture’s Nic Carter, in conversation with Moneymail developer Lawson Baker, said the biggest clue into the identity of the owner of the coins could come in a couple of days. Just look at the OP_RETURN field, a place to encode permanent messages on the Bitcoin blockchain, Carter said. We'll be watching.    Media Diet    Red Flags: Citizen, the mobile application that alerts its more than 2 million users to crime and disaster around them, has launched a contact tracing functionality, called SafeTrace, in the fight against the coronavirus. The application, which makes use of GPS and Bluetooth proximity tracking and stores data in a centralized manner, has raised alarms among privacy experts and technologists. “GPS data tracking a person’s movements is very revealing, and difficult to effectively anonymize,” said Ángel Díaz, counsel at the Liberty and National Security Program of The Brennan Center for Justice in New York.      Brazil Banks Investigated: On Wednesday, Brazil’s antitrust watchdog, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), voted to continue its investigation of banks who denied financial services to crypto brokers in alleged violation of Brazilian competition law. CADE’s nearly two-year-old inquiry into Itaú Unibanco, Banco do Brasil, Santander, Inter, Bradesco and Sicredi now returns to the General Superintendency for further review. Those six banks, which comprise nearly 80% of Brazil’s deposit market share, could face eventual sanctions and even be forced to provide financial services to crypto brokers.      Geographic Details: Block.one, a primary EOS developer wielding about 9% of the total token supply, is about to begin voting in the ecosystem, after years of holding back its influence. In a note last Friday, the Cayman Island-based company outlined criteria it would use to decide on which block producer candidates to support and vote for, including information pertaining to the public disclosure of the “location of the node.” While Block.one representatives downplay the significance of this geographic information, other stakeholders believe it could lead to favoring specific countries.      New Shareholder: IBM has become a shareholder in we.trade, the trade finance platform jointly owned by 12 European banks, signaling further consolidation across the enterprise blockchain space. While IBM has been a technology partner since the beginning, we.trade has always intended ween itself off the Hyperledger-based IBM Blockchain Platform and take its tech stack in-house. Ciaran McGowan, we.trade’s CEO, said this financial relationship with Big Blue will help the platform in its next phase of global expansion.      Digital Dividend: Online retailer Overstock has finally distributed its digital dividend to shareholders after a series of delays including an investor class action suit against the company and the ousting of the dividend’s brainchild former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. The digital security, called OSKTO, can now be freely traded on Overstock subsidiary tZERO’s blockchain-underpinned platform. Shareholders need to open a brokerage account with a broker-dealer that subscribes to the tZERO ATS to trade the securities, the firm said.      Genesis Brokerage: Genesis Global Trading is moving toward full-service prime brokerage – covering lending, trading and custody – with the acquisition of crypto custodian Vo1t. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. “We’re coming at this after having a successful business on the trading and lending side,” said Genesis CEO Michael Moro. “The goal is for clients to be able to do any and all activities with Genesis.” Genesis is owned by CoinDesk's parent, DCG.      Blockchain Strategy: A U.S. lawmaker introduced a bill calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to survey how blockchain technology is being used by other nations as well as outline a comprehensive blockchain strategy for the United States.      ""Bloodbath"": Highly leveraged crypto hedge funds are struggling to recover from recent volatility, reports the Financial Times.      Digital Euros: Societe Generale issued €40 million worth of covered bonds as security tokens that were then settled by the Banque de France, the nation’s central bank, in blockchain-based digital euros. (The Block)      Synthetic, Priceless Token Model: The UMA Project community approved contracts that allowed creating its first token: ETHBTC. This is also the first experiment with UMA’s priceless token model, which minimizes the need for oracles, allowing for the synthetic ETHBTC token to track the relative value of ETH to BTC, without requiring users to stake either of the two cryptos.      Staking Services: Coinbase Custody now offers staking services for Cosmos and Algorand tokens. Last year the firm added staking support for Tezos tokens. (The Block)    Market Intel    Buyers Exhausted? Bitcoin prices look to be struggling with buyer exhaustion, having put in a negative performance in the last 24 hours despite positive developments on both the macro and technical fronts. Despite intimations from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs calling upon the Federal Reserve to step up its inflationary bond purchase programs, analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, expect bitcoin to consolidate in the range of $8,000–$10,000 for some time.

42383788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybdZ,1590081314,Crypto Custodian Anchorage Teases Growth Plan With 2 Executive Hires,"Anchorage now has six executives in its C-suite, hiring a head of finance and head of sales with experience in both tech and Wall Street.      Julie Veltman, who’s joining the crypto custodian as head of finance, has issued new asset-backed securitizations for Merrill Lynch’s Structured Product Capital Markets group. She also built out a broker-dealer, debt issuance platform and fixed-income trading business for financial services firm Cohen & Company. Most recently, Veltman drove financial planning, reporting, and efficiency at Salesforce.      Geoff Clauss, who’s joining Anchorage as head of sales, has more than two decades of experience in private equity, wealth management and fintech. Before Anchorage, Clauss spent seven years overseeing sales at wealth management platform Addepar. He also spent 15 years at investment software company Advent.      Veltman will oversee operational finance, day-to-day operations and the firm’s prime brokerage products. The fact that Veltman’s experience extends far beyond Anchorage’s current products is a sign of where the firm wants to go, said co-founder and President Diogo Mónica.      “It’s pretty obvious that Anchorage has larger ambitions than its current set of services,” he said. “I think you can start following the breadcrumbs and seeing where the direction of the company is going – Julie’s background is absolutely perfect for where we want to go with the company.”      Read more: Anchorage Moves Into Crypto Trading With New Brokerage Service      With the new hires, this will be the first time the custodian has employees with “this deep of a bench” running the sales and finance sides of the business, Mónica said. While the company won’t be hiring any more executives in the near future, it does continue to hire more employees throughout the current economic crisis.      “We're rounding out our executive team and it really feels internally like we’re getting to the next step of execution of the company and maturity of the company,” he said.      Sometime in the near future, Anchorage is going to announce new products related to quantitative analysis and risk modeling from its Merkle Data acquisition in January, Mónica added.      “We’ve already integrated a lot of the work that they’ve done, and we’re going to be launching some products that actually rely heavily on their work pretty soon,” Mónica said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/21/crypto-custodian-anchorage-teases-growth-plan-with-2-executive-hires,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51258c76d4b544bf939b8e71747497d2f14fe12e-1600x1068.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybYX,1590079187,What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars,"Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 17 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities.      “Did you look both ways?”      I recently took my 7-year-old son out for a bike ride and he started to cross the street without looking. I grabbed his handlebars and shouted, “Did you look both ways?,” and he responded, “Oh, I forgot.” Fortunately, there was no traffic that day and I was right next to him, but I explained to him that remembering to look both ways is not a luxury you can afford to forget. Looking back, I realized I failed to remind him of that before we set out. Foolishly, I was only focused on the rewarding experience of a family bike ride in perfect weather, and momentarily lost sight of the downside risks.      When managing outside capital, the downside risks have to be top of mind. Even in a space like crypto with asymmetric upside potential, the investing mindset has to shift away from “How high can it go?” to “How low can it go?” Just like my conversation with my son, risk management is not something you can ever afford to forget.    The first time I lost a million    I was a corporate bond trader at Merrill Lynch prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Times were good on Wall Street pre-crisis. There weren’t any limits to the size of my trading book as long as I made money and nothing showed up in my risk reports that would raise red flags. The upside was a huge bonus, while the downside was simply losing my job. Trading on Wall Street was like a call option – known downside, unlimited upside.      I worked hard to understand the financials of the companies I traded, and I built a reputation in the corporate bond world as a smart credit trader. Over the course of my trading career, I made way more good investments than bad ones. Unfortunately, as a 27-year-old working in a loosely managed system, I was terrible at risk management.      The first time I lost $1 million actually happened in the same week that I made $1 million for the first time. I was long the bonds of Trump Entertainment, a well-known Atlantic City. N.J., casino chain owned by Donald Trump. Trump was looking to sell one of the three casinos he owned and it was rumored there was significant interest. Selling this asset would have been a credit positive for bondholders because the cash generated from the sale would have led to a refinancing of the bonds at a price greater than where the bonds were trading. However, revenues were deteriorating rapidly in Atlantic City, especially at Trump properties. The bonds were rated “CCC,” and any standalone analysis of the Trump credit, future revenue and cash flows would have led most people to short the bonds, not own them (which many smart hedge funds did). This was the ultimate “event-driven” investment with binary outcomes.      See also: Jeff Dorman - Crypto Needs a Rational Value Investing Model      I woke up one morning to a report in The Wall Street Journal that the Trump Marina Hotel & Casino was going to be sold and there was a buyer willing to pay a high enough price to validate my long thesis. The bonds I owned jumped 5 points that day to 104% of par value. I was long $32 million in bonds and had just made more than $1.4 million of paper profits.      Remember when I said the only thing that drew attention on the Merrill trading desk were red flags? Well, “green flags” drew just as much attention, and suddenly people were interested in what I was trading because I had booked a large gain that day. The thing I remember most about that day, though, besides some high fives, was that a very smart, senior trader with 20-plus years of experience leaned over to me and said, “The question isn’t ‘Were you right or wrong?’ the question is ‘Should you have owned that many bonds in the first place?’”      I didn’t think much about that statement at the time because I had just made $1.4 million in my trading book, but I think about it every day since. And while I did sell some of the bonds I owned that day, I didn’t sell enough. Sure enough, later in the week, the news broke that the Trump Casino asset sale fell through, and my bonds fell ~10 points. I lost almost $2 million that day.      In total, over the course of the week, I only lost a marginal amount of money in my trading book. But I raised a lot of green and red flags, willingly accepted a ton of unnecessary volatility, and lost a lot of sleep…for no reason.    Risk management in digital assets    When I first entered the digital assets industry in 2017, I met a lot of apparently intelligent people who boasted loudly about their investments. It seemed many people in blockchain figured out how to buy and sell, but it wasn’t evident that many had figured out how to manage risk. The common theme was large allocations to one or two digital assets, then sit back and watch them go up in a bull market. Many of these people even launched funds based on these phantom “track records.”      In March 2020, many young crypto investors learned hard lessons about risk management, discovering that managing risk is more than just downside price protection, and managing outside capital is more than just generating returns. Risk management includes operational due diligence on the venues you trade on, discipline with regard to who can trade, and independent oversight via risk committees designed to challenge position sizing.      There are no winners when crypto funds shut down but there are important takeaways. A strategy built around trading one asset (BTC), on one exchange (Bitmex), with high leverage may not be the most appropriate way to bring investors into this asset class. And those without formal training or experience may be better off learning from those who do as there is no shame in being an apprentice when it comes to managing other people’s money.      See also: Jeff Dorman - Never Mind Hodlers, Crypto Needs More Opportunist Investors      Fortunately, I learned my lesson the hard way over a decade ago; a lesson that would have helped many in today’s crypto environment. I hear that senior trader’s advice from 2008 in my head every day, and apply it to every risk management decision I make. In the aftermath of that 2008 day, I even built a proprietary risk management system that was subsequently used at three hedge funds where I worked, and we still use today at Arca. This tool is designed specifically to make sure all positions are sized according to reasonable quantitative and qualitative factors. The goal of this tool isn’t to make money, but to avoid large and unnecessary losses.      The ability to stay disciplined with risk management changed my career. I always knew I had the tools required to be a successful investor, and I’ve always been convinced I can make smart investments, but it took years to realize the difference between good asset managers and bad ones comes down to more than just picking good investments.      Looking back, it’s clear there are a ton of very smart, motivated, talented traders and investors in the world, and that is very true in crypto as well. But there just aren’t that many talented risk managers. It may only take 20 days to learn how to trade and 20 months to learn how to analyze investments, but it takes 20 years and counting to learn how to manage risk.      Crypto likes to disrupt, but you just can't disrupt experience. There is no shortcut to that.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/21/what-i-learned-the-first-time-i-lost-a-million-dollars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/559ce97514dad012536fe0cb8f1c9ae3702ee23c-1780x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybcJ,1590076724,Russia Considering Draconian Rules for Illegal Crypto Operations,"Harsh new rules making many uses of digital assets punishable with fines or prison might soon become law in Russia.      New draft bills setting out how Russia should regulate cryptocurrencies were sent to the country’s parliament, the State Duma, earlier this week. Although the official website for the planned legislation hasn’t been updated yet, the two documents have been published in the OrderCom Telegram channel and were confirmed as genuine by sources of Russian news outlet RBK.      The legislative proposals were introduced by the author of the main bill, lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, and sent to two think tanks by the Ministry of Economic Development for comment. They seek a new version of the bill on digital assets, which has been stuck in the Duma for more two years now, as well as crypto-focused additions to the country's criminal code.      The first draft bill would regulate digital currencies in Russia. Or, to be more clear, prohibit the issuance of, and operations with, digital currencies in the nation. Even distributing information about such activities would be banned.      Read more: Bank of Russia Says New Digital Assets Bill Will Outlaw Crypto Trading, Issuance      Individuals and companies would not be permitted to accept digital currencies as payment, except if they are inherited, distributed to the debtors of a bankrupt company or confiscated as a result of a court decision. People owning cryptocurrency should declare it at the tax agency, as well as provide information on how it was purchased.      The second draft would introduce a new article into the criminal code bringing sanctions for illegal operations with digital assets.      If passed, issuing digital assets in Russia without being approved for listing on a yet-to-be created register at the country’s central bank would see a company fined for up to two million rubles (nearly $28,000). The same level of penalty is suggested for organizing operations with digital assets and cryptocurrencies without approval, while individuals would face a fine of up to $2,800.      Buying crypto for cash or via a bank transfer from a Russian bank would be subject to a fine up to one million Russian rubles ($14,000) or up to seven years in prison, depending on the scale of the deal. Similar punishment would be in store for those who accept crypto for goods and services.

Richie Lai, co-founder of the U.S.-based crypto exchange, posted an announcement late on Wednesday saying his firm would return – reluctantly, it seems – million of dollars worth of disputed cryptocurrency back to a Steem wallet no one knows who controls.      After the 23.6 million steem tokens were confiscated from community dissenters in a tit-for-tat Steem hard fork Wednesday, they were quickly diverted to Bittrex by an unknown individual (or individuals) in the hope they would be returned to their original 64 owners – currently all persona non grata at the blockchain project.      The controversial hoard is worth a little over $5 million at press time and was worth approximately $6.3 million at the time of the fork.      ""We wish the entire Steem community could have addressed legitimate concerns in a manner which was viewed as fair by everyone,"" said Lai. ""The fact is, we only interpret the data on the blockchain, and in this case the consensus of the blockchain, regardless of how it was reached, agreed that the funds from those 64 accounts be moved to the 'community321' account.""      ""We believe in the sanctity of blockchain, and as an industry we need to adhere to the consensus rules of the blockchain without interjecting whatever our personal opinions might be,"" he continued. ""If we want blockchain to succeed, we must live by the rules of the blockchain.""      ""While I am among those frustrated by the outcome, my own personal feelings do not matter,"" Lai said.      See also: Tron’s Takeover of Steemit Is Internet History Repeating Itself      Wednesday's Steem hard fork was the culmination of months of bitter infighting between those for and against the Tron Foundation's takeover of Steemit – the largest application on Steem – earlier this year.      After the anti-Tron faction forked the network to create HIVE – a near-identical copy of Steem that copied over and then confiscated tokens linked to Tron founder Justin Sun – the pro-Tron team retaliated by forking Steem to seize tokens belonging to 64 of the former witnesses – blockchain validators – and stakeholders involved in creating the HIVE splinter group.      The tokens were sent to the mysterious wallet known as community321 but, as CoinDesk reported, were almost immediately sent to Bittrex's platform. A note on the transaction said the funds had been ""stolen by the Steem witnesses,"" and asked Bittrex to ""please return them to their original owners prior to the fork.""      No one knows who carried out the transaction (publicly, at least), but it was evidently someone from the anti-Tron lobby.      A former Steem witness told CoinDesk he believes this community member – whoever they may be – had access to an app and were able to cling on to the keys linked to the community321 wallet.      ""There is a service run by an original community witness called AnonSteem, it allows users to make anonymous accounts,"" they said. ""They [the community321 wallet creator] used this service, and my initial guess is [a community member] saved the keys generated. Then used them to send the funds to Bittrex to rescue them.""      See also: Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun’s Steem Drama      In an interesting twist to the whole saga, Bittrex's procedure for returning hacked tokens is to first receive proof of ownership from the victim. ""We must review the facts of this transfer in order to return these funds to the original wallet owner provided the owner or owners of the wallet can prove the funds belong to them,"" Lai said in his notice.      In other words, whoever is sitting behind the community321 wallet may have to declare themselves, at least to Bittrex. It could be interesting to see who does, eventually, break cover.

42383797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybl7,1590066000,Why Kyber Network Tokens Tripled to $100M Despite the Coronavirus Recession,"Kyber may be the Great Lockdown’s hottest token project.      According to the analytics firm Flipside Crypto, the Kyber Network is one of the fastest-growing token projects so far during the coronavirus-led recession (in terms of developer contributions, social media chatter, blockchain records, wallet addresses and corresponding apps).      This decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol is associated with the token KNC, which jumped up in price since 2019, from roughly $0.18 in December 2019 to $0.64 by early May 2020, according to Messari. Traders don’t need to use KNC but in the near future they’ll be able to use it for staking rewards and to vote on development decisions.      In the meantime, the Kyber Network protocol is essentially the third-most-popular DEX, with nearly $5.4 million worth of reserves in its decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, ranked behind Uniswap and IDEX. It’s estimated the protocol handled $200 million worth of volume in March alone. It was utilized by 13,000 crypto wallet addresses in March out of 62,264 active addresses tallied since January 2019.      Plus, this Asian DEX startup with team members in Vietnam and Singapore is now also part of the first batch of participants in Chicago's DeFi Alliance (CDA), joined by DeFi startups like IDEX, dYdx, Synthetix, Set Protocol, Opyn and 0x.      Read more: Ethereum’s Top DEX Is Rebooting With New Scaling Features      CDA co-founder Imran Khan of Volt Capital said over 100 teams applied to join the CDA, but only seven startups were chosen.      “Market makers and liquidity providers all need different options based on their trading strategies,” Khan said. “Kyber’s competitive advantage is that it’s a decentralized exchange, they can play regulatory arbitrage and grow quickly.”    Liquidity    So far, the Kyber Network’s liquidity appears relatively healthy. In January 2020, Binance Research estimated the project had 35,000 active users.      The network survived its first true stress-test in March, when the protocol supported $33 million worth of trading in a single day without any significant glitches despite cataclysmic volatility in broader markets. Khan added the CDA aims to grow the value of assets locked in DeFi systems from roughly $1 billion to $8 billion by 2021.      “For the space to get real liquidity, we need professional market making,” said Kyber Network CEO Loi Luu.      Most DEXs saw significant gains during the start of the coronavirus crisis, so this doesn’t make Kyber unique. For example, fellow CDA member 0x reached a new all-time high in March with over $100 million worth of volume. What makes Kyber different from startups like 0x is that the former is primarily a liquidity protocol, not just a DEX.      Read more: Chicago’s Trading Firms Look to DeFi With New ‘Alliance’      The Kyber Network DEX is merely a proof-of-concept, to show the protocol can allow on-chain trading functionality. Many wallets and DeFi platforms, like Uniswap and Trust Wallet, are also connected to the Kyber protocol on the backend.      “On-chain market making is very different from off-chain market making, because you are actually using the blockchain to run all your operations,” said Kyber Network advisor Ming Ng. “Smart contracts can only talk to other smart contracts.”      In short, in order for ethereum to become a global financial platform, something like Kyber Network (although not limited to it) would have to translate smart-contract functionality throughout all the layers of a trade.    Chains    Even if trades are settled on-chain, usually order books are off-chain, which is precisely the gap the Kyber Network wants to bridge.      Stepping back, liquidity generally means the ability to move money around and actually use it, while a “smart contract” is just software that automatically triggers business activity. So, for example, if a trader wanted to build a tool that queried for the price of a specific asset across integrated order books, he could use the Kyber Network to do it. Then his smart contract could execute a trade or change the amount or price.      “They are providing a different way to trade and some of the market makers will be more comfortable working with them,” Luu said of fellow CDA members IDEX and 0x. “You can have the full-fleshed decentralized stack [with Kyber], from the domain name and code to the smart contract as well.”      Getting more professional market makers to experiment with on-chain trading will be a challenge, but Luu’s staff of 55 still has more than half of its original token sale funds, Luu said. The KNC initial coin offering (ICO) reportedly raised 200,000 ether (ETH) in 2017. Plus, the team has been dogfooding their protocol by using it for market making and the above-mentioned DEX, turning a modest profit so far.      “Market makers should be able to make a profit using Kyber,” Ng said. “We’re building a fully sustainable ecosystem where all the players in the ecosystem can make money.”      A new protocol upgrade coming in late June, called Katalyst, will allow KNC token holders to participate in a proof-of-stake system to earn rewards for helping maintain this DeFi network.      Read more: Kyber to Offer Delegated Token Staking After Coming Network Upgrade      When the token sale proceeds run dry, the namesake startup could also use this mechanism to earn money, just like other stakeholders. For now, demand for the token is surging across exchanges as more teams use the Kyber protocol for unique trading strategies related to stablecoins like dai, USDC and tether.      Some traders may prefer a more familiar exchange and settlement model. For those who want to experiment with quasi-decentralized models, the CDA now offers the old guard a structure for getting hands-on experience working on-chain. Likewise, Volt Capital’s Khan said his fund plans to participate in staking on the Kyber Network.      “The goal for Kyber Network as a DEX is that assets being traded should not exit the protocol,” Khan said. “Deeper liquidity enables more efficient markets and new ways to onboard retail traders.”",POSITIVE,KNC,BLOCKCHAIN | KNC | MARKET | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/21/why-kyber-network-tokens-tripled-to-100m-despite-the-coronavirus-recession,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d7562577a3e883806596ad83010d1b977a26143-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The New York-based trading firm, which is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent firm Digital Currency Group, acquired Vo1t to begin developing a full suite of prime brokerage services under one roof including lending, trading and custody. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.      “We’re coming at this after having a successful business on the trading and lending side,” said Genesis CEO Michael Moro. “The goal is for clients to be able to do any and all activities with Genesis.”      In traditional finance, prime brokerage refers to a bundle of specialized services offered by investment banks and securities dealers to their hedge fund clients. This is the first time Genesis has disclosed its strategy to become a prime brokerage.      There are a few prime brokers in the crypto space, including New York-based Tagomi, which joined Facebook’s Libra Association in February. Digital asset services firm Bequant also announced a full suite of prime brokerage services and 18 sources of liquidity earlier this month.      Moro wouldn’t put a figure on the number of liquidity providers Genesis is aiming to plug into.      “The answer is as many as we can that we feel good about,” he said. “We’re trading roughly $1 billion of crypto a month, and clearly we have enough liquidity venues for us to trade that much.”      Read more: Genesis CEO Details ‘Black Thursday’ Chaos in Q1 Lending Report      Genesis also announced plans to soon offer a derivatives trading desk, which would start with over-the-counter bitcoin options. It’s also interested in providing capital introduction for family offices that are looking for crypto hedge funds that have the strategies, fee structure and asset exposure to fit their investing needs.      “We’re curating the hedge funds worth talking to, based on the criteria you’re looking for,” Moro said.      Vo1t will also be Genesis’ first London office. The firm, whose name is supposed to remind customers of a bank vault, provides custody, lending, staking and trading products for 35 digital assets. Since 2017, Vo1t has been offering cold storage to firms listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange, trust companies and other financial institutions around the world. It advertises a 45-minute withdrawal time for assets held in cold storage.      Read more: Custody Provider Vo1t Partners With IBM to Offer Customers More Secure Transactions      Moro began to pursue a deal with Vo1t last autumn after seeing how many services the startup’s team had produced with few resources. The companies are now in the middle of integrating products.      “We’re going to keep working on the acquisition integration,” he said. “There's quite a bit of work to be done to absorb this platform and their technology.”      Genesis is also expanding into Singapore after registering with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and will send employees from New York to the new office once it is safe to do so. With 30% to 40% of the firm’s lending business coming out of Asia, the office will give Genesis more flexibility to serve customers in the region.      “Having New York, London and Singapore helps for different time zones,” Moro said. “Especially since crypto trades 24 hours a day … and our clientele is diverse across Europe, Asia and the U.S.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/21/genesis-trading-buys-crypto-custodian-vo1t-in-bid-to-become-prime-broker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/670ecb7a44e3e862455607bed3e3849023ed2ae9-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybnd,1590061179,First Mover: Bitcoin Rattled by Transfer of Satoshi Coins That Might Not Be Satoshi's,"Even idle speculation that mysterious bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto might be moving around a small batch of the cryptocurrency appeared sufficient to spook the market on Wednesday.      Bitcoin slid 2.3% on the day, retreating after a four-day rally and pushing the price down to about $9,500.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      But earlier in the day, bitcoin plunged as low as $9,100 after the Twitter account “Whale Alert” sent a message indicating a recent transfer of 40 bitcoins, worth some $391,055, might be from a ""possible #Satoshi owned wallet"" that had lain dormant since the first few months of 2009 - soon after bitcoin itself had launched.      Shortly afterward, on Wednesday, the same address transferred 10 more coins over the blockchain.      Satoshi wrote the white paper that mapped out the framework and rules for the bitcoin blockchain, but disappeared soon after the protocol launched, and their identity has never officially been confirmed. Many believe the name was a pseudonym.      The reason it matters to digital-asset traders is that Satoshi — whoever he, she or they may be — is assumed to have amassed a large amount of bitcoins from mining shortly after the protocol’s launch in early 2009.      Of course, a bitcoin transfer doesn't necessarily indicate anything has been sold, and there are strong indications the address might not even be connected to the enigmatic founder.      But one fear could be that if Satoshi — or whoever it is behind the account — starts selling in large amounts, it could theoretically put downward pressure on the price.      ""No matter who moved the coins, it did cause a mean ol' nasty spike on the charts,"" wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of foreign exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, in an e-mail to clients.      According to the cryptocurrency security researcher Sergio Demian Lerner, Satoshi's untouched hoard might include as many as one million bitcoins, though BitMEX Research has estimated the number could be closer to 700,000.      Movement from old, inactive bitcoins is notable since such events rarely happen.      In fact, the 50 coins at the focus of Wednesday's speculation — from data block 3,654, versus more than 631,000 now — were the first inactive coins mined in early 2009 to move since August 2017, according to data shared on Twitter by Coin Metrics engineer Antoine Le Calvez.      The bitcoin market sold off more than 7% almost instantly, as Whale Alert's tweet quickly went viral, according to Bitstamp market data. As the rumor spread, something like $40 million worth of bitcoin futures contracts were liquidated on BitMEX, according to Skew.      “This occurrence highlights the importance of ‘address watching,'"" Jose Llisterri, co-founder of crypto trading platform Interdax, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey. That includes ""monitoring the addresses of whales/early miners and the so-called ‘Satoshi coins’ mined in the first months of bitcoin.""      But there are strong indications the coins might not actually belong to Satoshi.      The primary evidence linking them to bitcoin’s creator are that the coins were mined in 2009, when few people were involved in the network, and that they've been inactive ever since.      But Lerner, the cryptocurrency security researcher, identified a unique “Patoshi pattern” in April 2019 that appears in the hash rate of a single, early miner. The assumption is the miner was likely Satoshi.      Lerner has identified all of those data blocks, and the 50 coins moved on Wednesday weren't among them.      Some bitcoiners immediately panned the Whale Alert's suggestion.      “Y'all need to up your analysis game,” Jameson Lopp, chief technology officer at bitcoin custody provider Casa, tweeted at the Whale Alert account.      In response to questions sent via Twitter, Whale Alert tweeted back that the ""chance that this wallet is associated with Satoshi himself given its age and the transactions itself was interesting enough to post.""      ""We are aware of the Patoshi research, but unlike what some are saying, we do not feel it excludes the possibility that Satoshi was the owner of those coins,"" Whale Alert wrote via a direct message.      Another angle is the vintage bitcoins might have been transferred by an early bitcoiner who has been active all along — just buying and selling newer bitcoins. So the fact the earliest coins were transferred might not mean the owner is suddenly doing anything differently.      Gregory Maxwell, prominent Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder, took to Reddit on Wednesday to explain that certain characteristics of the bitcoin protocol could cause coins like these to be left inactive in an otherwise active wallet owned by the same entity.      “It's possible that the author of this transaction has been frequently active all along, and their wallet just got around to spending this particular coin,” said Maxwell. From his perspective, he said, “nothing connects these coins to Satoshi.”      The takeaway for traders is to be on the lookout for vintage bitcoins — whether they're Satoshi Nakamoto's or not.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,349 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,795 | 24-Hr Low: $9,235      Trend: Bitcoin is facing selling pressure on Thursday amid bearish developments on short-duration technical charts.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,360, representing a 1.7% decline on the day, having spent the first half of the week battling selling pressure near $10,000.      Prices fell by over $600 to $9,100 on Wednesday, confirming an ascending triangle breakdown on the hourly chart. The pattern indicates the rally from the low of $8,100 observed ahead of bitcoin's May 11 halving has ended, and the bears have regained control.      The bearish view has been reinforced by rejection at $9,600 (lower high) seen during the Asian trading hours and the subsequent drop to levels below $9,400. Further, the MACD histogram is again producing deeper bars below the zero line, indicating strengthening of bearish momentum.      As a result, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside. Some observers may suggest otherwise, as the daily chart is reporting a golden crossover - a bull cross of the 50- and 200-day averages. However, the so-called long-term bull market indicator is based on historical data and often traps buyers on the wrong side of the market. ""The last time the 50 DMA crossed above the 200 DMA, there was a 60%+ drop in price over the next month,"" tweeted popular analyst Josh Rager.      The immediate support is seen at $9,000, which, if breached, would open the doors to the four-hour chart 200-candle average at $8,590. On the higher side, key resistances are located at $9,600 (the Asian session high) and $10,000, which has proved a tough nut to crack over the past few days.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Zack Voell, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/21/first-mover-bitcoin-rattled-by-transfer-of-satoshi-coins-that-might-not-be-satoshis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78a779210d67a403d036a227e34aa5bcad01326a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383794,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybib,1590055696,Bitcoin Drops Over 3% Despite Golden Cross and Bank Calls for More US Stimulus,"Bitcoin prices look to be struggling with buyer exhaustion, having put in a negative performance in the last 24 hours despite positive developments on both the macro and technical fronts.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell from $9,760 to $9,100 during Wednesday’s U.S. trading hours, even though major investment banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs called for an increase in the size of the inflation-boosting government bond purchase programs run by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. Bitcoin is increasingly eyed as an investment alternative that isn't prone to inflation.      “The level of the expected increase in supply this year – about $2.1 trillion – is offsetting the $1.9 trillion demand for bonds to the tune of $200 billion,” JPMorgan said.      The bank is essentially predicting a rise in bond yields and a fall in prices due to the shortage of demand in the bond markets. An uptick in yields or borrowing costs may discourage investors and corporations from borrowing and investing, prolonging the coronavirus-led economic downturn.      As a result, analysts at JPMorgan think the central banks would have to ramp up their bond purchase programs in order to keep yields depressed. Goldman Sachs strategists echoed similar sentiments last week.      Even so, bitcoin, which is widely touted as ""digital gold"" due to its limited supply and programmed supply cut at regular four-yearly intervals, fell on Wednesday and remains under pressure near $9,390 at press time, representing a 3.8% decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The decline looks more surprising considerin technical studies have been biased bullish from the start of the week. For instance, last week’s candle penetrated an 11-month falling trendline, confirming a bullish breakout. Further, the 50- and 200-day averages produced a “golden crossover” earlier Thursday, signaling long-term bullish conditions (as technical theory suggests, anyway).      With buyers unwilling to step in despite the bullish signals, the cryptocurrency looks vulnerable to deeper pullbacks.      Some observers have suggested that on-chain movements of bitcoins caused a decline in prices on Wednesday. Selling pressure strengthened after a dormant address moved some of the earliest mined coins for the first time in 11 years.      The subsequent recovery was shallow, and prices faced rejection at $9,600 early on Thursday before falling back to lows under $9,400. While Wednesday’s price dip was an opportunity for investors to snap up bitcoin amid bullish macro developments, the weak bounce suggests most chose to remain on the sidelines.      Signs of buyer exhaustion is not surprising because the cryptocurrency has rallied by over 150% in the past two months. The rally was likely fueled by the bullish narrative surrounding the reward halving, which took place on May 11, and due to the unprecedented amounts of liquidity injected by major central banks into the traditional markets. The G7 central banks purchased more than $1.3 billion worth of bonds in April, as tweeted by Jeroen Blokland, a portfolio manager for the Robeco Multi-Asset funds.      Analysts at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, expect bitcoin to consolidate in the range of $8,000–$10,000 for some time.      From a technical analysis standpoint, immediate support is seen near $8,970 at a trendline rising from March lows.    Daily chart    Acceptance under the ascending trendline support would expose the 200-day moving average located near $8,000.      So far, the confirmation of the golden cross has failed to invite stronger chart-driven buying. The indicator tends to lag prices and trapped traders on the wrong side of the market earlier this year, as warned by Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director at Singapore-based QCP Capital.      On the higher side, $10,000 is the level to beat for buyers.

42383781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybXH,1590053270,"Block.one Will Now Vote for EOS Candidates, but Wants Their Locations First","Block.one is about to begin wielding its juggernaut EOS allocation in the ecosystem's governance, but the multi-billion dollar developer house has some pre-requisites.      In a note last Friday, the Cayman Island-based company, which controls 100 million EOS tokens, just under 10% of the current total supply, outlined the criteria it would use to decide on which block producer (BP) candidates to support and vote for.      There are just three requirements. Numbers two and three are: the BP candidates' node has to be running version 2 or higher EOS software and has to be independently operating as a publicly queryable node.      But it's the first requirement that's perhaps most interesting: ""The general location of the node has been disclosed publicly through the BP JSON file."" A JSON file is like a BP's public declaration, which includes crucial information such as names and contact information. So, in other words, Block.one wants a BP candidate to disclose where it's based before it will lend it its hefty support.      In an email to CoinDesk, Kevin Rose, who used to be head of BP EOS New York and now manages the relations between Block.one and the EOS community, played down the location requirement, saying it was just a factor to be taken into consideration when deciding for whom to vote.      CoinDesk asked Rose why Block.one wanted to have BPs' location in the first place. ""As with any public decentralized blockchain, understanding the general geographic distribution of block producing nodes is helpful information for self-evident reasons,"" he said.      See also: On EOS Blockchain, Vote Buying Is Business as Usual      Back in June 2019, Brock Pierce, Block.one's former chief strategy officer, notoriously claimed that changes to the EOS governance system – which effectively enabled vote-buying – meant the network had been taken over by a cabal of block producers based in China: a ""Chinese oligarchy,"" he called it.      But Rose denied the location disclosure had anything to do with favoring specific countries. It was ""not a regulatory or other formal requirement,"" but merely a factor to be considered when voting for a BP candidate.      ""While we do not value one jurisdiction over another, this voluntary location disclosure is something that has been organically championed by the general EOS community, so we chose to embrace it as we begin voting for the first time,"" he said.      Instead Block.one's location requirement is only to ensure that, as a ""globally focused organization we embrace inclusivity and diversity among block producer node,"" according to Rose. At the end of the day, a location disclosure has been proposed as voting criteria since August 2019, so Block.one, he said, is just ""embracing that community desire."".      But Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk that location disclosure would do little to ensure Block.one voted for eligible BPs. Most run node infrastructure on clouds, and it takes ""literally seconds to set any geographic location for nodes,"" he said. ""So nobody can verify geographic parameters set in BP JSON and it can't become [a] strong criteria by far.""      ""The geographical locations of nodes can be easily gamed – it doesn't make much sense to me,"" Melikhov added.      See also: Everyone’s Worst Fears About EOS Are Proving True      Block.one's share of the token supply has declined as new EOS enters the system. Its share was down to roughly 9.5%, by November 2019, which still makes it one of the largest token holders. The firm said in Friday's post it plans to vote for BP candidates ""in a rotational manner with no cap on how many total candidates we vote for over time.""      Block.one stayed out of EOS governance for a long time, saying, at the time of the mainnet launch, that its sizable token allocation gave it an outsized voice in the still-nascent community. As EOS's creator, the firm retains an influential role in the ecosystem, thus receiving support from Block.one would be a substantial and valedictory development for any BP.      But Block.one is rigorously defending its right to change its voting criteria at will. ""We maintain the ability to adjust voting criteria at any time,"" Rose said. ""As we engage with community members, our voting approach will evolve, and criteria will be added to ensure that the recipients of our votes adhere to the standards we wish to see network-wide.""      CoinDesk asked if the EOS community has any say over how Block.one determines for whom it votes.      Rose said BP candidates can send summaries and recommendations to Block.one to ""help inform our vote and future voting criteria.""      But, he added, ""we maintain the ability to adjust the criteria at any time.""      See also: Block.one Failed to Decentralize EOS, Argues New Securities Fraud Lawsuit      Block.one previously said it was committed to playing a ""proportional role"" in the ecosystem and their post last week said they would only use 10% of its token allocation to vote in the ecosystem. But that could also change over time.

The digital security was issued as Series A-1 shares on a 1:10 basis to all Overstock shareholders with a record date of April 27, 2020, according to a press release Tuesday. Called OSKTO, the dividend can now be freely traded, but only on Overstock subsidiary tZERO’s blockchain-underpinned platform. Shareholders will need to open a brokerage account with a broker-dealer that subscribes to the tZERO ATS to trade the securities, the firm said.      “I’m pleased we have paid this innovative dividend to our shareholders,” said Overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson. “These preferred shares have real value, and have been paid a cash dividend in each of the last three years.""      The concept of the digital dividend was the brainchild of former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who has long been a fan of crypto and blockchain, and started accepting bitcoin for retail sales as far back as January 2014. Byrne had apparently seen OSKTO as a way to both bolster tZERO and to flick sand in the face of short sellers to whose trading strategies he had long objected.      In Tuesday's announcement, Johnson said, ""We believe [the digital dividend] will increase participation and long-term liquidity on the tZERO ATS platform. I appreciate the support and cooperation of the investment community and regulators in our efforts to innovate in the capital markets through new technology.”      Also read: Tokensoft Distributes $4M in Equity to Investors Using Ethereum Blockchain      OSKTO had first been announced in July 2019, with the firm expecting a record date of Sept. 23, 2019.      After the departure of Byrne, though, Overstock put the effort on hold as it sought to restructure the dividend, making the stock freely tradable and doing away with a six-month lockup that had previously been planned. A report at the time suggested Byrne had structured the digital dividend specifically to block short selling.      That didn't sit well with some investors, who launched a class-action lawsuit against Overstock in September, alleging the firm violated securities rules by making false statements to manipulate the firm’s stock price. Last week, Overstock filed to dismiss the ""meritless"" lawsuit, saying, in effect, the short-seller lead plaintiff had not actually provided any evidence of wrongdoing.

42383787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ybb3,1590033600,IBM Takes 7% Stake in Trade Finance Blockchain Network We.Trade,"IBM has become a shareholder in we.trade, the trade finance platform jointly owned by 12 European banks, signaling further consolidation across the enterprise blockchain space.      Ciaran McGowan, we.trade’s CEO, said the deepening relationship with Big Blue will help the platform in its next phase of global expansion.      “Now we’ve got a very strong partnership with IBM for scaling globally, and we are working closely together on Asia, Africa and Latin America,” McGowan said.      We.trade has the distinction of being the first enterprise blockchain consortium to go live, which happened back in early 2018. The platform was formed by a group of banks to help European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) get better access to trade finance. IBM has been the project’s technology partner from inception.      Read more: Staying Alive: Why the World of Enterprise Blockchain Has Turned to Collaborations      However, the plan at we.trade was always to take its technology in-house and rely less on IBM, as stated by McGowan at last October’s Sibos event in London.      “It’s all about getting the right balance,” McGowan said this week regarding IBM’s new role as part-owner of the platform as well as the sole technology provider. “Back then [in 2019], we had seven staff at the company and it wasn’t realistic for seven staff to make all the decisions, to collate all the different requirements, to prioritize and manage everything.”      The move also raises the question of intellectual property (IP) ownership, something that has caused problems for IBM in the past with blockchain consortia.      Part of we.trade’s success was down to the fact no single entity had more say than another. The platform’s previous CEO, Roberto Mancone, pointed to a “clear distinction” between IBM’s IP, which was the components used to build the platform, and the IP of the platform itself.      Read more: IBM and Maersk Struggle to Sign Partners to Shipping Blockchain      These lines appear to be blurring now. In addition to owning the Hyperledger-based IBM Blockchain Platform that we.trade is built on, IBM would own 7% of the platform’s IP, McGowan confirmed.      A concession being promoted by we.trade (and IBM) involves a new multi-cloud approach so customers can use Microsoft Azure or AWS, instead of having to use IBM Cloud.      IBM joins we.trade’s existing 12 shareholder banks: CaixaBank, Deutsche Bank, Erste Group, HSBC, KBC, Nordea, Rabobank, Santander, Société Générale, UBS and UniCredit.      McGowan said some European banks are “playing wait and see” with enterprise blockchain, especially in the busy trade finance space.      “I think that because there are quite a number of players in the space, and quite a number of banks on those platforms, the European banks have been kind of sitting back and are maybe afraid to join one platform in case another does better.”      Read more: Banking Giant UBS Goes Live on We.Trade Blockchain for Trade Finance      Still, McGowan said we.trade plans to interoperate with Hong Kong’s eTradeConnect, a blockchain-based trade finance platform formed by 12 Asian banks. An investment round planned for September will see the platform onboarding some insurance companies as well as more banks, he added.      Asked if IBM is getting its hooks into a platform that previously had a semblance of independence, Parm Sangha, the global trade finance leader at IBM, said: “Hyperledger is open source; IBM has opened up to have a multi-cloud approach. The only thing we are collaborating smarter on is where does this all go, and that is the pursuit of market share and market size.”      A source involved in the enterprise blockchain space who wished to remain anonymous said we can expect to see IBM begin rolling together its big blockchain services such as TradeLens and Food Trust, in an attempt to get critical network mass.      “I’m not sure that strategy will work – the cost of transition may be higher than the cost of integrating those services together,” they said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/21/ibm-takes-7-stake-in-trade-finance-blockchain-network-wetrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1feb9dcd5538a9d19de028cbd08874cb581d1d5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
