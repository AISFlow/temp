42419242,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE6Bh,1698879687,Sam Bankman-Fried on Verge of Tears as His Lawyer Concludes Defense,"NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried appeared to be on the verge of tears late Wednesday at the end of his attorney Mark S. Cohen's closing remarks, the former FTX CEO's last, best hope for acquittal, or at least a hung jury.  Bankman-Fried spent these final few moments of his team's closing arguments almost ramrod-still, without his usual jitters. He stared at his parents, blinking heavily and drinking big gulps of water.  ""Sam did his best to start and operate two multi-billion-dollar businesses in a new market,"" Cohen said at the conclusion of his emotionally charged remarks to jurors.  ""Some decisions turned out well,"" he added. ""Some decisions turned out poorly.""  Read the latest: Sam Bankman-Fried Lambasted by Prosecutor Right Before Jurors Begin Deciding His Fate: SBF Thought 'He Could Fool the World'  At the end of the proceeding, which stretched past 6 p.m. in the Manhattan courtroom, he offered an appeal for the jury to find Bankman-Fried acted in ""good faith"" throughout his time running FTX and Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm, and therefore could not be convicted of fraud.  Cohen offered what he called an ""alternative history"" than the prosecutors regarding the events and decisions that ended in FTX’s bankruptcy last November, as well as the revelation that Alameda had spent billions of dollars of the exchange’s customer funds.  In Cohen's telling, it was ""real-world miscommunications,"" ""mistakes"" and ""delays"" that imperiled FTX and the rest of Bankman-Fried's crypto empire – not fraud by his client.  Sitting a few rows back in the gallery, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried appeared similarly taken by the proceedings. As Bankman-Fried walked out of the courtroom on Wednesday evening, his mother – sullen and steely eyed throughout the trial – uncrossed her crossed arms, palmed her heart and then sunk her face into her hands.  Emotional closing  Cohen clutched the lectern as he addressed the jury in a soft, nearly pleading voice. He relied on submissive language (literally: ""I submit to you"" x, y and z), underscoring the power these 12 New Yorkers will soon hold over his client, who if convicted could face what amounts to a life sentence.  The former federal prosecutor's closing style differed in every way from that of his opposing counterpart, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos. Roos, physically the largest member of the government's team, used his imposing frame to telegraph the gravity of the criminal fraud allegations.  When he pointed at the defendant he wagged his entire arm with each part of the name: Sam. Bankman. Fried. It was among the most vivid moments of this five-week trial, alongside Caroline Ellison’s tears on the witness stand – and Sam's display of emotion at the close.  Rhetorically, Roos leaned in, too. He resurrected a passive-voice turn of phrase his team had invoked repeatedly in opening arguments – FTX's collapse meant ""billions of dollars from thousands of people, gone"" – and reversed it, making it active: ""thousands of people lost billions of dollars."" The changeup raised the stakes just as the trial entered its final phase.  The jury listened most attentively to Roos, who, going first in the day (and acting with what Cohen described, not in a complimentary way, as ""cinematic"" flair) had the performative upper hand. By the afternoon and Cohen’s testimony they started to fade, yawning and glancing at the clock at the back of the gallery.  Judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision to extend an already long and sometimes plodding day only compounded their tiredness. Even so, a handful of jurors remained alert and engaged for Cohen, taking notes throughout.  It takes only one to cause a hung jury.

19699974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558626,1698879634,"Bitcoin Ends October On A High Note, What To Expect For BTC Price In November","The month of October just drew to a close and Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has ushered in the new month of November. With October proving to be an incredibly bullish month for Bitcoin with a green monthly close, eyes are now on the new month and what possibilities it could hold for the digital asset. October Was A Good Month For Bitcoin Looking back to the month of October, it has been one of the best months so far for 2023. The price of BTC started out at around $28,000 and closed out the month above $34,000. In total, the return for Bitcoin in the month of October was 28.5%. Related Reading: Cardano Bearish Signal: Dormant ADA Whales Are On The Move In comparison to the previous months, only one month has surpassed October and that was the month of January. Bitcoin also benefited from a green price close in the month of September, albeit with meager gains of 3.99%. 2023 has also turned out to be a year of good returns with six months out of the last 10 months closing in the green. The months of August, May, and July were the only months with significant losses of 11.2%, 7.1%, and 4.04%, respectively. While February closes out with small losses of -0.01%. BTC retraces after flash surge | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com How November Is Looking For BTC Price The first day of November is already starting out with losses for the price of BTC but it is still early for the digital asset to pick back up. Historically though, especially over the last five years, Bitcoin has recorded poor performance in the month of November. In 2022, the infamous FTX crash took the Bitcoin price from above $21,400 to below $16,000, and the month ended with 16.1% losses. The same was the case for the previous year in 2021 when the crypto bull market began to wind down. That month ended up with a red close of -7.12%. 2020 was different in the fact that Bitcoin saw a 42.9% increase in November, which was the year the bull market began. But 2023 is more closely similar to the year 2019 because they’re both the year before the Bitcoin halving takes place and November suffered losses in 2019. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Nosedives Following 7,700% Jump, What Happened? If Bitcoin keeps to the November trend similar to 2019, then it is possible that the digital asset will reverse its October gains this month. A 17% decline would mean a fall back to the $28,000 level, which would wipe around $6,000 off its current value. However, Bitcoin has been known to buck historical trends in various cases, so there could be a change in the trend. For example, in 2015, the year before the 2016 Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin price saw a 19.8% increase by the time November was over. This shows that nothing is set in stone when it comes to Bitcoin.

The U.S. regulator's denial of KalshiEx LLC's request to use event contracts – transactions in which a party is paid if they accurately bet on the outcome of an event – ""exceeds its statutory authority,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The company argued that such contracts are a classic way of hedging against risk.  ""Political events carry enormous financial implications for businesses and individuals,"" Kalshi contended in the suit. ""Uncertainty surrounding these events poses economic risk, no less than uncertainty over hurricanes, pandemics, or oil supply.""  Kalsi is asking the court to vacate the CFTC's decision, which determined that the company was pursuing unlawful gaming ""contrary to the public interest.""  Last year, an appeals court ruled that another prediction market that the CFTC sought to shut down, PredictIt, should be able to keep operating until a final ruling from the courts.  While PredictIt has operated under a no-action letter from the CFTC, Kalshi went through the process of registering as a designated contract market with the agency, meaning the company has to certify compliance or seek approval for every single contract it lists. Polymarket, an unregistered, crypto-based prediction market that bills itself as the world's largest, is barred from doing business in the U.S. under a settlement with the CFTC.  Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington group advocating for strong financial regulations, called Kalshi's effort a ""backdoor attempt to unleash gambling on U.S. elections through so-called event contracts.""  ""At a time when there are already historically high concerns about the integrity of our elections, the CFTC properly evaluated the multiple fatal flaws in Kalshi’s self-certified contract and decided that it was a clear violation of public policy as well,"" Kelleher said in a Wednesday statement.  When the CFTC denied the application earlier this year, Commissioner Summer Mersinger dissented, arguing, ""It is important for the commission to make this determination the right way – by undertaking a public rulemaking process."" However, she added, ""my dissent should not be taken as an endorsement of Kalshi’s Congressional Control Contracts.""

19698878,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558655,1698876046,BNB Chain Q3 Revenue Takes A Hit: Fees Plummet By 40%,"In a recent report by Messari, the analysis sheds light on the developments and challenges faced by Binance Chain (BNB), the blockchain created by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange regarding trading volume. The report highlights the separation of BNB Chain from Binance and various events and allegations that have impacted Binance and its associated entities throughout the third quarter of 2023. Binance Chain Separation And Challenges The Messari report emphasizes that BNB Chain has distinguished itself as an independent entity separate from Binance despite its origins as a product of the largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. However, the market has not fully recognized this separation, leading to a lack of distinction between BNB Chain and Binance. During the third quarter, Binance encountered numerous challenges, including losing partnerships, shutting down lines of business, conducting layoffs, and facing accusations of violating sanctions. These events coincided with a downward pressure on the value of BNB, which experienced a 25% decline compared to the previous quarter. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market dropped by 9% during the same period. Related Reading: Solana Bull Run Could Smash Through $40 Barrier This Week – Here’s How The Messari report mentions that Binance, including its subsidiary Binance.US, was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of engaging in unregistered offers and sales of “crypto securities”, including BNB. These allegations further added to the challenges faced by Binance and its associated entities during the third quarter. BNB Chain Performance And On-chain Activity Despite the challenges, BNB maintained its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market cap of $35.3 billion. The circulating supply of BNB decreased by 1.3% in the third quarter due to the token-burning mechanism employed by BNB Chain. The report also highlights the impact of adverse events on BNB Chain’s on-chain activity. BNB Smart Chain’s revenue, measured in BNB, fell in line with the decline in BNB’s market cap, indicating a decrease in activity on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Daily transactions (-14%) and average fees (-12) in BNB also experienced declines during this period. BNB Chain offers staking opportunities for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), BNB, Cardano (ADA), and others. The report notes that the total stake and eligible supply declined by 3% and 2%, respectively, while the average annualized staking yield decreased from 2.6% to 2.1% during the third quarter. The DeFi sector on the BNB Chain demonstrated strength compared to other sectors. The NFT space experienced increased secondary sales volume, unique buyers, and sellers. However, stablecoin transfers and GameFi experienced declines in volume. The report suggests that newer applications on BSC may have influenced the growth of unique buyers and sellers in the NFT sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Ramp Up Selling, BTC To Decline Below $32,000? Ultimately, the Messari report provides insights into the separation of BNB Chain from Binance and the challenges faced by Binance and its associated entities during the third quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, BNB Chain maintained its market capitalization and continued to launch new products and implement technical upgrades. The report highlights the need for market recognition of the separation between BNB Chain and Binance and the impact of adverse events on BNB Chain’s on-chain activity. On the other hand, BNB has experienced a prolonged downtrend since reaching its annual peak of $350 in April. Subsequently, the token plummeted to $202 on October 9. However, recent developments have resulted in a positive trend, with BNB recording a profit of 5.2% in the past 14 days and 1.8% in the last 30 days. As a result, the current trading price of BNB stands at $223.

42419240,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE6Af,1698873835,Bitcoin Retakes $35K After FOMC as Solana's SOL Leads Sharp Altcoin Rally,"Led by solana's [SOL] 16% surge, altcoins rallied sharply throughout the session Wednesday, while a late move higher in bitcoin [BTC] pushed its price to a new 17-year high above $35,500.  Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at around $35,400, ahead 1.7% over the past 24 hours and firmly breaking above the $35,000 level which has capped its upward move over the last two weeks.  Solana [SOL] continued its remarkable rise, soaring 16% over the past 24 hours to a 14-month high. Native tokens of layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche's [AVAX], Polkadot's [DOT] and Near Protocol's [NEAR] rose 6% to 10%.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens – which were laggards during October – also popped, with uniswap [UNI] and aave [AAVE] advancing 15% and 10%, respectively.  Ether [ETH], the second largest crypto by market cap, was up nearly 2%, outperforming bitcoin by a few basis points.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a proxy for a broad basket of digital assets, was up 2% over the past 24 hours.  Checking the downside, SafeMoon's token [SFM] plummeted over 50% today as the Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested the project's executives for fraud and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed unregistered security offering charges.  FOMC Meeting  The U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left its benchmark fed funds rate range steady at 5.25%-5.50% on Wednesday, which was widely anticipated.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the post-FOMC press conference that a run-up in U.S. Treasury yields have contributed to tightening financial conditions, but left the option open for an additional rate hike if necessary.  ""Fed's likely done after back-to-back holds kept rates at a 22-year high,"" Edward Moya, market analyst at OANDA, noted in a newsletter. ""The Fed did not rule out a rate increase in the coming months, but swap contracts showed traders weren't convinced.""  Market participants now see 74% probability that the Fed will leave rates at the current level in January, up from 59%, and could start cutting at rates around mid-2024, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Equities concluded the day sharply higher, with the S&P 500 index up 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 gaining 1.5%. 10-year U.S. Treasury yields buckled to 4.73%, down from near 5% earlier this week, pricing in the lower odds of further hikes.  ""​​BTC is a hedge against loose monetary policies and so lower yields would strengthen that value proposition and investors' willingness to buy and hold crypto,"" Justin d'Anethan, head of business development at crypto market maker Keyrock, said in an email.

These unlocks are anticipated to release more than $320 million worth of tokens, contributing to the overall $450 million set to enter circulating supplies in the crypto market this month. It is worth noting that such substantial releases could have immediate and long-term effects on both the price and availability of these digital assets. Related Reading: Aptos TVL Soars To A Record $74 Million, Reflecting Growing Investor Confidence Aptos And Top Players In November’s Token Release Token unlocks are events where previously locked tokens become available for trading, often increasing a project’s circulating supply. These events are critical moments for projects, as they can signal maturation and a new phase of market dynamics. Aptos, a Layer 1 blockchain created by former Meta executives, is expected to have the most significant token unlock by value, releasing 24.8 million APT tokens, currently representing about $165.6 million at today’s price. Aptos’s upcoming unlock on November 12 is not just substantial in value but also notable for its distribution, with core contributors, investors, the community, and the Aptos Foundation all set to receive portions of the release. Meanwhile, Avalanche, another Layer 1 blockchain, is preparing for its considerable token unlock later in the month on November 24, which will see 9.54 million AVAX tokens (valued at approximately $99.3 million at today’s price) released, marking 2.7% of its circulating supply. Hashflow, a multi-chain decentralized exchange, is slated to have the largest token release by circulating supply percentage. It is poised to unlock 160.38 million HFT tokens, approximately 73.9% of its circulating supply, on November 7, injecting roughly $42 million into the market. The distribution of these tokens will span early investors, ecosystem development, the core team, and community rewards, adding another layer to the economic activities of the project. Other Notable November Token Unlocks Other projects like Optimism (OP), ApeCoin (APE), and Sui (SUI) are also scheduled for significant token unlocks this November. However, they pale in comparison to the top three in terms of value. Optimism is set to unlock 24.16 million OP tokens worth $32.4 million. Apecoin (APE) is poised for an unlock of 15.60 million APE tokens worth $19.5 million, and SUI is to unlock 34.62 million tokens valued at $14.6 million at today’s market prices.

Furthermore, out of these six tokens above set to unlock this month, Aptos and Avalanche are the top gainers. Currently, both assets are up 38% and 22%, respectively, in the past 14 days. APT trades at $6.82, down by 2% over the past 24 hours, while AVAX trades at $11.02, down by 2.7% over the same period, at the time of writing.

Take a look at a close-up of the price action and see if the stampede by bulls is sustainable. Say Goodbye To Single-Digit SOL Forever Less than one year ago, Solana hit a low of under $10. Single-digit SOL proved to be too enticing for investors to pass up and it could potentially serve as a long-term bottom. The altcoin fended off a fierce selloff in June this year, but held above double digits. The higher low instilled confidence in the market, possibly considering it a valid retest of support. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breaks Multi-Month Trend As Firedancer Hits Testnet Price then pushed higher, but failed to breach resistance at $26. That is until about two weeks ago when the Ethereum-competitor took out the resistance level and has been on a tear since. As today, it smashed above $40 and set an intraday high around $46. The latest over 10% gains today cap off a nearly 100% rally in three weeks, and a full 400% off the lows. Anyone who was bold enough to buy SOL at under $10 has now made more than 4x on their investment. Solana smashes above $40 | SOLUSD on TradingView.com What’s Next For Solana After Smashing Above $40? Solana has now erased all bearish price action from the FX collapse and beyond. The latest rally touched price levels not seen since August 2022. The altcoin broke out from a potential ascending triangle pattern three weeks ago and has climbed over 100% since. Objectives based on the measure rule of this pattern put the next target for SOL at around $90. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond Above that level, it is possible that Solana could revisit former all-time highs above $260. This level was last reached in November 2021, a full two years ago. Comparisons with Ethereum put SOL upwards closer to $1,000 if it follows the same previous bull market pathways. Solana’s stand out crypto market performance could be partially responsible for Ether’s muted rally thus far. But with Solana possibly meeting more resistance at this level, prices could take a pause for the time being, prompting impatient profits to roll back into ETH and other altcoins.

42419251,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE6Jx,1698870579,Solana Surges to 14-Month High; Sell Pressure Lingers as FTX Unstakes $67M Tokens,"Solana [SOL] continued its remarkable rally Wednesday and hit a 14-month high price, but sell pressure may soon hit the market as FTX unstaked another $65 million of tokens after moving millions of SOL to crypto exchanges over the past few days.  The seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 17% over the past 24 hours, topping at $46, its highest since August 2022, before giving up some of its gains. The token widely outperformed the mostly range-bound crypto market, with the CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks a basket of digital assets, up 0.6% over the past 24 hours.  Solana's resurgence as one of the best-performing assets – up nearly 350% this year – has come as a surprise to many observers, defying concerns about its future after the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX crypto exchange and Alameda Research, big investors in the Solana ecosystem.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Started Buying Solana's SOL at 20 Cents Using 'Alameda Profits,' He Says at His Trial  Rising blockchain activity, a massive influx into SOL-focused digital asset funds and a recent tech upgrade helped the price recover, analysts said. Simultaneously, concerns about the FTX estate – now under bankruptcy protection – selling tokens en masse have proven so far to be overblown.  However, a recent uptick in activity of FTX-owned crypto wallets over the last few days suggest that some selling pressure could hit the market soon.

Analysts have developed pricing models that put the value of XRP way higher than its current price of $0.5853, possibly even surpassing Bitcoin. According to the research paper from Valhil Capital, which evaluated six distinct pricing models, XRP’s price should not be trading for less than a dollar but somewhere between $9.81 and $513,000. Research on XRP’s Fair Value It’s been well established that the XRP price has been held back over the past few years in large part due to the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs, the company behind the cryptocurrency, and the SEC. This legal uncertainty made many crypto exchanges and investors hesitant to buy and trade XRP, leading to the cryptocurrency being left behind during the 2021 crypto market bull run. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital and Invesco Bitcoin Spot ETF Join BlackRock On The DTCC Unlike most cryptocurrencies, which aim to replace the traditional method of banking, XRP was designed by Ripple to help banks move money quicker and cheaper than current methods. Using this transaction function of XRP and its use as a store of value, Valhil Capital created six different valuation models to determine XRP’s fair market value. The first model, called the Pipeline Flow Model, considered XRP’s function as a mode of transaction as well as a store of value, putting its fair value in this case at $3,541. The second model called the Athey and Mitchnick Model, also used the transaction and store of value function to put XRP’s current fair price at $4,813. The next two models looked at the transaction function alone. These models, named the 99-Year Golden Eagle Model and the Discounted Cash Flow Model, determined XRP’s fair market price to be $13,368 and $18,036, respectively. Using XRP’s function as a store of value, the last two models, called the Collaterization Model and Quantum Liquidity Model, determined XRP’s current fair market price to be far above the price of Bitcoin, putting it at $122,580 and $513,518 respectively. Current State Of The XRP Price XRP trading has since resumed on US-based crypto exchanges, as the cryptocurrency has been deemed not to be a security by a federal judge. Despite its challenges with the SEC since 2020, the cryptocurrency has grown to become the 5th-largest in terms of market cap. Related Reading: Top 5 Bitcoin-Like Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In The Crypto Bull Run Some of XRP’s fair market prices determined by Valhil Capital might seem extravagant, but some of them resonate with current predictions and sentiment in the XRP community. On-chain data has shown that whale and shark investors have increased their holdings in the past few days. On the other hand, Ripple’s latest periodic release of 1 billion XRP tokens from escrow could potentially reduce this ongoing buying pressure.

19695216,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558639,1698865245,XRP Ledger Market Cap Soars On Regulatory Success: 59% YTD Growth Achieved,"The XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized public blockchain developed by David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple Labs, has continued to evolve and show growth in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023, as highlighted in a recent report by Messari. The XRPL, facilitating cross-currency and cross-border payments for over a decade, has witnessed significant milestones, including a surge in market capitalization and advancements in network features. XRP Ledger Shows Strong Development In Q3 As of Q3 2023, XRP, the native token of the XRPL, has secured its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at an impressive $27.8 billion. Notably, the token’s market cap experienced remarkable growth, increasing by 59.9% year-to-date (YTD) and recording an 11.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) surge. According to Messari, one unique aspect of the XRPL is the deflationary pressure applied to its total supply of 100 billion XRP. Transaction fees on the network are burned, reducing the supply over time. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital and Invesco Bitcoin Spot ETF Join BlackRock On The DTCC Since the inception of the XRP Ledger, approximately 10 million XRP have been burned. However, to counterbalance the burn rate, 1 billion XRP vests to Ripple each month. Unspent or undistributed XRP returns to escrow. This process will continue until the remaining ~48 billion XRP becomes liquid, making burned fees the sole factor influencing supply. Unlike many other cryptocurrency networks, the XRPL does not provide rewards or transaction fees to its validators. Instead, validators are incentivized by supporting network decentralization, similar to full nodes on Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC). The Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm relies on trust between nodes, organized through unique node lists (UNLs). This approach contributed to the network’s resilience and security through 2023. NFTs Thrive On XRPL With Notable Growth In Q3 In Q2 2023, XRPL experienced declining network activity metrics, including average daily transactions and active addresses. However, Q3 witnessed a resurgence, with average daily transactions reaching 1.06 million and active addresses totaling 44,000. In particular, NFT transactions showed significant growth, with average daily NFT transactions increasing 7.3% QoQ to 16,700. NFTs are built into the core protocol and do not require smart contracts for creation or transfers. Standardization of NFTs through XLS-20 2in October 2022 brought benefits such as royalties and anti-spam features. The XRPL ecosystem has grown steadily, with 3 million NFTs minted using the XLS-20 standard. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Breaks Multi-Month Trend As Firedancer Hits Testnet Overall, the XRP Ledger has demonstrated significant growth and development throughout Q3 2023, driven by market capitalization gains, regulatory victories, and advancements in network features. With a strong focus on deflationary dynamics, unique consensus algorithms, and the rise of NFT transactions, the XRPL continues to position itself as a prominent player in the world of cross-currency and cross-border payments, according to Messari. Conversely, XRP has demonstrated consistent gains across various time frames. Currently, the token is trading at $0.6073, which has not been reached since August 2023, resulting in a modest 0.4% profit within the 24 hours. Notably, XRP has maintained an upward trend, delivering substantial returns of 10%, 24%, and 16% in the past seven, fourteen, and thirty-day time frames, respectively. Particularly noteworthy is the exceptional performance within the one-year time frame, where XRP has surged by 32%.

42419252,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE6M1,1698862770,The Protocol: Celestia Airdrop Gets Crypto Users Asking About Starknet Despite No Similar Plans,"For the editor of a blockchain tech newsletter, it's always nice (for readership) when there's a smart explainer-y angle to a token airdrop that's hotly tracked by the crypto degens. That's the gist of our feature article, on the blockchain project Celestia, which this week airdropped its new TIA tokens to early contributors and crypto users, creating some $300 million-plus of market capitalization literally overnight. The backstory is that the ""data availability"" network originated with a research paper by a Ph.D. student at University College London; now it claims to have touched off a new ""modular era"" of blockchain development, especially in the Ethereum ecosystem.  We're also covering:  The layer-2 project Starknet's allocation of the not-even-trading-yet STRK tokens to early community members.  Trustees of Sam Bankman-Fried's bankrupt FTX exchange moving tokens around on blockchains, ostensibly in a bid to maximize value.  Arbitrum's go-live moment for its ""Orbit"" program, used to spin up new layer-3 networks.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  WEN STARKNET? This week's airdrop by the data-availability network Celestia of its TIA tokens elicited a congratulatory post on X from the official account for Starknet, one of the leading Ethereum layer-2 networks. In response, one quick-witted X user posted, ""Your turn soon."" The snarky retort referred to Starknet's own STRK tokens, which have been minted and are being awarded to early project contributors – even though they are locked up from trading at least until next April. Starknet confirmed in July 2022 that a token was needed ""to operate the ecosystem, maintain and secure it, decide on its values and strategic goals, and direct its evolution."" And then in November of that year the STRK tokens were deployed on the Ethereum main network. The news this week was that the Starknet Foundation allocated some 50 million STRK tokens to a new Early Community Member Program, or ECMP for short. The Starknet Foundation's tokens come from its original grant of 50.1% of the initial minted supply of 10 billion STRK, so that works out to a hoard of about 5 billion STRK. Since the tokens aren't trading, there's no easy way to estimate the value – especially with any potential payday still many months away. But the awards could help Starknet grow and retain its community, especially during the current ""crypto winter"" where resources are tight – and as rival projects including Arbitrum, the biggest layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum, move forward with their own incentive programs. Starknet officials have not confirmed any plans for an airdrop.  WINDOW ON FTX WORKOUT: In the crypto era, anyone with access to a blockchain era can watch in real time as lawyers and financiers try to maximize the holdings of a company in bankruptcy. The estate of Sam Bankman-Fried's bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX, appears to be moving millions of dollars worth of crypto assets around on blockchains after winning court approval in September to sell, stake and hedge crypto holdings worth more than $3.4 billion. In the past 24 hours, more than $13 million worth of various crypto tokens were moved to exchange platforms Binance and Coinbase, from wallets linked to FTX and its trading firm, Alameda, according to the analysis firm Spotonchain. The tokens moved include (DYDX), (AAVE) and Axie Infinity’s (AXS). Last week, cold wallets linked to FTX moved more than $19 million of assorted tokens to crypto-exchange addresses, blockchain data showed, including Ethereum's ETH and Solana's SOL. Last year, CoinDesk reported exclusively on the bankrupt crypto lender's Celsius's on-chain movements, as it repaid hundreds of millions of dollars of borrowings on DeFi platforms like Aave to reclaim collateral.

It's been widely reported that bitcoin (BTC) had a strong month, buoyed by optimism that one or several new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds or ETFs might soon win approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Among smart-contract platforms, Ethereum's native token, ETH, was up for the month, but the gains were much more subdued, and analysts at Coinbase Institutional cited ""the lack of a strong fundamental narrative."" Much more powerful were the gains for INJ, the native token of Injective, a layer-1 blockchain built for finance, as well as the SOL token from Solana, which is having its Breakpoint conference this week in Amsterdam. (The analysis firm Messari recently noted that the Solana blockchain, once the butt of jokes for frequent outages, has now gone 234 days without one, its second-longest streak.)

""The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.""

Bitcoin [BTC] was little changed in the moments following the news, trading just above $34,500, CoinDesk data shows.

Origin Of Ripple Customary 1 Billion XRP Routine Today, the firm has unlocked yet another 1 billion tokens, performed in three separate transactions. Crypto tracker Whale Alert took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the alert with the crypto community, as each whale transaction was made one after the other. Related Reading: Ripples Returns 80% Of Unlocked XRP For August Back To Escrow According to data from Whale Alert, the first transaction performed with the escrow account unlatched a significant 100 million XRP tokens, valued at approximately $59.98 million. The second transaction made by the escrow account was 400 million XRP, valued at around $239.92 million. Meanwhile, the last transaction saw a total of 500 million XRP valued at approximately $299.9 million, making it a whopping 1 billion XRP valued at around $599.8 million. The price of XRP temporarily dropped in reaction to this announcement, which saw the token falling by about 3% that same day. But this decline was soon overcome, and as of right now, the digital assets are trading at a slight discount of 0.8% to its closing price from the previous day, according to CoinmarketCap. However, it is noteworthy that XRP had a strong day before the day before the unlocking, rising as high as 10.5% at one point and finishing the day with a 3.74% price increase. Currently, it is roughly trading at $0.6, presenting its highest price since August. Related Reading: XRP Whale Transactions Spike To 3-Month High As Smart Money Buys So far, the company has yet to announce its initial plan for the recently released 1 billion XRP. In light of last’s month 1 billion XRP release, Ripple immediately removed 800 million (80%) of the total XRP tokens unlocked. Notably, the crypto firm spent approximately 205 million tokens ($112.75 million) from its primary address, “Ripple 1,” in October, even though it reserved about 200 million XRP. Due to this, Ripple used about five million XRP in its balance from earlier this month. Recent Partnership Set To Boost XRP The company’s recent partnership with the web3 platform is expected to elevate the XRP holdings on Uphold, thereby boosting the token’s price. This is because Uphold has asserted that it will utilize its expertise to buttress XRP on the market while leaving its current customers’ XRP holdings untouched. In addition, the platform will also give Ripple the liquidity it needs to handle cross-border transactions. Ripple’s partnership with Uphold indicates increased interest from the web3 financial platform in the XRPL ecosystem and its utility token XRP, which powers transactions on Ripple Payments.

42419233,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE65V,1698859537,SBF vs. ETF: Get Rich Quick vs. Get Rich Slowly,"It’s been interesting attending the Sam Bankman-Fried trial at the same time that the industry is gearing up to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.  Roughly a year ago, the collapse of FTX was the capstone to a brutal year for the crypto markets. It was like a nuclear bomb going off in the industry. General entrepreneurial activity as well as prices were depressed in the months after.  Laura Shin is the founder of crypto media company Unchained, a former Forbes senior editor and author of ""The Cryptopians."" This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  However, Sam Bankman-Fried was never a true crypto person. He told multiple interviewers that he was an effective altruist, whose main goal was to earn as much money as he could in order to give it away. (Now it seems, through this trial, at least the government alleges that his goal appears to have been slightly different: to take as much money as he could in order to invest it, wield influence and power, and buy real estate.)  He told both Forbes and Michael Lewis that the way in which he earned the money did not matter. He said that if he felt that he could make more money in a different industry, then he would do that, that he did not truly care about crypto.  Looking back, it seems he was what the industry calls “a mercenary.” As numerous decentralized projects have found over and over again, while it’s important to incentivize people to provide liquidity or other functions on DeFi protocols, they need to do so in a way that attracts people that have a long-term vision, not short-term takers — in short, missionaries over mercenaries.  It becomes evident when you look at the infamous Odd Lots interview he did, in which he talked about how he was in the business of Ponzi schemes. It also was starting to show shortly before the collapse of FTX, when the community realized that the crypto legislation he was promoting in Congress would have thrown DeFi under the bus.  While the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-trade funds isn’t necessarily the pinnacle of idealistic decentralized building, it does mark the adoption of bitcoin by a different class of investor: not the get-rich-quick-schemer who wants to make as much money as quickly as possible for other means, but long-term investors who plan to hold bitcoin as part of a broader investment mix.  While having bitcoin investment products with traditional, staid financial advisors and investment firms may seem less exciting then having a crypto company‘s name on a basketball stadium or a conference in the Bahamas featuring Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Katy Perry, it leaves a more solid foundation for the future growth of the industry.  Once the industry gets the validation of spot bitcoin ETFs, may it no longer need validation from flashy gestures by those using crypto for their own ends.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Laura Shin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/01/sbf-vs-etf-get-rich-quick-vs-get-rich-slowly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cf564f793bb626fed6d10acfa69589133c302de-1632x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17143724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550156,1698858141,"Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: 2023, 2024, 2025 and Beyond","Solana is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrency platforms thanks to its high speed and low costs. Launched in 2020, its native SOL token has seen massive appreciation. Here we analyze Solana’s price outlook for the future using technical analysis to provide an evidence-based Solana price prediction guide. What is Solana (SOL)? Solana is a highly scalable decentralized blockchain created by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017. It uses a unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism to achieve high transaction speeds and low fees while maintaining security. The native cryptocurrency of the Solana network is SOL. It is used to pay for executing transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and staking on the blockchain. Some key aspects of Solana include: Speed Solana can process over 50,000 transactions per second, significantly faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Low fees With high speed, Solana offers transaction costs as low as $0.00025 making it ideal for DeFi. Proof-of-History This novel consensus mechanism coordinates timeline between nodes without slowing things down. Programming Solana supports programming languages like Rust and C++ to develop dApps. Staking SOL holders can stake tokens to help validate transactions while earning staking rewards. Solana’s powerful performance makes it a leading choice for developing fast, scalable DeFi applications and services. Factors Influencing Solana Price Several core factors determine the price movement and growth potential of SOL: Cryptocurrency Market Conditions Like most altcoins, Solana’s price depends significantly on Bitcoin and overall crypto market trends. A rising market lifts SOL. Adoption by Developers As more projects build DEXs, NFT marketplaces, Web3 applications etc on Solana, demand for SOL increases. Competition From Rival Networks Alternative scalability solutions like Avalanche, Polkadot or Cardano could fragment developer interest and diminish Solana’s growth potential if they gain traction. Network Upgrades and Innovation Upgrades to further boost Solana’s speed and capabilities can augment developer demand, boosting SOL’s value. Staking Trends Higher staking activity reduces available SOL supply which may lead to appreciation in token price. Security and Reliability Network outages or vulnerabilities could damage confidence in Solana and depress SOL price. Smooth performance boosts its reputation. Major Historical Price Developments SOL’s price has seen huge growth since launching, but also periods of instability. Let’s look at key highlights: 2020 – Minimal Trading After Launch Solana launched the mainnet in March 2020 with SOL starting off around $0.50 initially with minimal exchange availability and trading. By December 2020, it reached $1.52 as trading volumes gradually picked up. 2021 – Massive Breakout The 2021 crypto bull run catapulted Solana into the limelight with SOL surging exponentially from $3 in January 2021 to a peak of $260 by November 2021 – an unbelievable 8700% return within 10 months! Driving this were: Explosive growth of DeFi and NFT activity on Solana, riding the hot trends. Attracting developers due to faster speeds and lower costs than Ethereum. Major protocol improvements and ecosystem funding. Listing on Coinbase and Binance centralized exchanges. This established Solana as a leading Ethereum competitor. But lack of maturity showed… 2022 – Crash and Outages In 2022, the crypto downturn brought SOL back down below $40 from its highs. More damaging were network outages in 2022 that dented confidence in Solana’s stability. The final days surrounding the FTX collapse, Solana also suffered, taking the cryptocurrency to a 2022 low of $8. While still early days for such a nascent project, Solana needs to improve reliability to gain institutional trust. But its developer momentum continues unabated, with over 4000 projects built on Solana so far. Recent SOL Price Analysis Solana has been recovering throughout 2023, but the US SEC hasn’t made it easy, attacking altcoins around every turn. Each time altcoins like SOL attempt to gain momentum, the SEC files another case against a crypto exchange. Past filings include naming Solana as a possible unregistered security. Recently Solana has transitioned to a potentially bullish market, rising more than 100% in three weeks. Solana also surpassed $40 price level on November 1, 2023. Short-Term Solana Price Prediction for 2023 The latest bullish news that VISA is using Solana for its stable coin payments could propel SOL higher and reach the target of this inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a target of $75 per token. Medium-Term Solana Price Prediction for 2024-2025 Solana very closely mimics the price action of 2016 through 2020 Ethereum. If another similar rally follows in Solana like it did in Ethereum, SOL could approach upwards of $1,000 per token. Related Reading: Read our Ethereum Price Prediction Long-Term Solana Price Prediction for 2030 In the longest term outlook, it becomes much more challenging to properly predict what SOL might do. It very much depends on adoption of the SOL token, the Solana blockchain, and crypto itself. If SOL can maintain its current mean trajectory, then it is possible Solana could be priced around $3,000 to $4,000 by the year 2030 or beyond. Conclusion: Solana Price Outlook Solana has demonstrated immense potential with its blazing fast speeds at low costs. But it still has much to prove regarding stability and institutional-grade security. If Solana can build on its developer momentum and rapidly evolving ecosystem while improving reliability, its long-term growth upside is immense. But execution risks remain for this ambitious project aiming to reshape decentralized finance. Solana Price Prediction FAQs Let’s look at some common questions crypto investors have about SOL price analysis: What was Solana’s lowest ever price? SOL sank to as low as $0.50 in the early days after its mainnet launch in 2020. Its 2022 low was around $8 amidst broader crypto market weakness. What was the highest price for Solana? Solana’s all-time high price stands at $260 reached in November 2021 during strong bullish momentum carrying crypto markets higher. Is $500 realistic for Solana? SOL reaching $500 is achievable this decade if Solana fulfills its technological promise and sees high adoption as the leading DeFi blockchain. Can Solana crash to zero? A complete collapse is unlikely given Solana’s strong fundamentals unless critical flaws emerge in its core protocol. But extended weakness could sink SOL below $10 until a recovery. Why is SOL price volatile? As a relatively new asset with limited liquidity, Solana experiences high volatility from speculative trading and sentiment shifts. As adoption increases, volatility should stabilize. When will Solana’s price stabilize? Solana price swings may start normalizing once it builds a large user base and matures technically. But as a crypto asset, some volatility will always remain. Investment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

42419239,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE69d,1698858090,"SafeMoon Execs Arrested by DOJ in Fraud Investigation, Charged by SEC","The Department of Justice has the CEO and CTO of SafeMoon in custody but is still looking for creator Kyle Nagy in its securities fraud case against the executives.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is also pursuing a case that the company offered unregistered securities.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has arrested and charged SafeMoon's executive team with perpetrating a massive fraud on its investors in a case also targeted Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  SafeMoon CEO John Karony and Chief Technology Officer Thomas Smith were arrested, and creator Kyle Nagy remains at large, according to the DOJ. The SafeMoon executive team withdrew more than $200 million from the project, as detailed in the SEC’s complaint, and they misappropriated investors funds for personal use, authorities said.  ""As alleged, the defendants deliberately misled investors and diverted millions of dollars to fuel their greedy scheme and enrich themselves by purchasing a custom Porsche sports car, other luxury vehicles and real estate,” said Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement.  Nagy, known as ""Safemoon Dev,"" 35; Karony, ""CPT_HODL_T_MUN,"" 27; and Smith, known as ""papa,"" 35, were charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. In one example, the DOJ said Smith diverted tokens to buy himself a Porsche 911.  The token SFM fell more than 30% on Wednesday.  CoinDesk's attempts to reach the three through the company website and through their social media accounts have been unsuccessful.  While facing criminal charges, the defendants were also charged for securities violations by the SEC.  ""Unregistered offerings lack the disclosures and accountability that the law demands, and they attract scammers like Kyle Nagy, who use these vulnerabilities to enrich themselves at the expense of others,” said David Hirsch, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU). The agency also accused all three of ""perpetrating a massive fraudulent scheme through the unregistered sale of the crypto asset security.""  SafeMoon (SFM) was a meme coin that rolled out in 2021 during the height of the previous bull market. Its team promised users that staked funds would be ""locked"" in a liquidity pool, but the SEC said that ""large portions of the liquidity pool were never locked"" and that executives used funds to buy homes, travel and high-end cars.  At one point in April of 2021, Smith assured investors that he personally held no SFM ""because I'm a software engineer,"" he's quoted as saying in the indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. ""I don't want to create a situation where my decisions as a CTO are affected by the monetary gain of those actions, and that's why I've made that separation for myself.""  The SafeMoon team also allegedly used locked assets to make large purchases of SafeMoon to prop up its price and manipulate the market, the SEC said.  Though the executives had denied they personally held SFM, they repeatedly traded the tokens for their own benefit, generating millions in profits while masking their proceeds through private, unhosted wallets and pseudonymous exchange accounts, according to the DOJ.

19692392,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558594,1698858035,Bull Season: Analyst Outlines Breakout That Could Send Solana To $100,"Solana has performed exceptionally well in the October crypto market rally. But crypto analyst FieryTrading believes that this might just be the beginning for the SOL price. According to the analyst, once Solana breaks the resistance at $38, then it is headed for another 150% increase. Pushing Solana To Past Glory Solana already made its way through to $39 over the last day before losing some of its gains. But this has not eliminated the bullish trajectory of the altcoin. In fact, SOL’s continued uptrend plays into FieryTrading’s prediction for the asset which puts it at $100. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital and Invesco Bitcoin Spot ETF Join BlackRock On The DTCC As the crypto analyst points out, there is heavy resistance for Solana just around the $38 level and this has been proven by the coin’s performance so far. Its initial move above this level was met with resistance that pushed it back down toward $37 before resuming its rally once again. FieryTrading refers to this as an “important area of resistance” at which he expects investors to begin some profit-taking. But a break above this level holds a lot of promise for SOL. The analyst expects an initial bounce above $40, a slight retrace, and then a surge to $100. Source: Tradingview.com Returning to this $100 level would mean a return to the 2021 bull market levels, essentially signaling the start of the bull market for Solana. However, there are still some obstacles to face as the Bitcoin slowdown is having a near market-wide effect. FTX Stash Threatens SOL Price By now, it is no longer a secret that the bankrupt FTX exchange is one of the largest holders of SOL. And recently, the estate got the green light from the courts to start selling off some of its crypto holdings and Solana is a prominent asset in its stash. As NewsBTC reported, the FTX estate recently unseated a soul of 1.6 million SOL tokens worth over $42 million. Now, there hasn’t been any indication of what FTX plans to do with these tokens but the likely outcome is that the estate will start selling the tokens on the open market. Related Reading: Top 5 Bitcoin-Like Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In The Crypto Bull Run If this happens, then investors should expect significant selling pressure on the SOL price which could send it back down toward $30. This FTX stash remains one of the most bearish indicators for the altcoin that could stop its rally dead in its tracks. Nevertheless, Solana is still seeing a lot of interest from large institutional investors. CoinShares reported that Solana inflows from last week came out to $23.9 million, bringing the total SOL assets under management (AuM) to $214 million.

42419235,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE64T,1698857149,It’s Time for Web3 Games to Embrace Play AND Earn,"Web3 gaming has skyrocketed in popularity over the last three years and is predicted to reach approximately $65.7 billion by 2027, up from $4.6 billion in 2022. While the Web3 games that initially gained international attention were play-to-earn like Axie Infinity, gamers across the world don’t just game for passive income.  Instead, many gamers play because they enjoy it as a way to release stress and pass the time with friends and family. In short: games should be fun.  While play-to-earn has largely disrupted the blockchain industry and onboarded many users into the Web3 space, Web3 games need to transition away from this model and embrace a play and earn ethos that focuses on user experience first.  Kelsey McGuire is chief growth officer at Shardeum. She previously served as chief marketing officer at crypto investment firm CoinFund, managed partner marketing at Celo and worked in marketing leadership roles at ConsenSys.  Why some gamers hate Web3  Web3 gaming turned a lot of traditional gamers and developers off of Web3 because of poor user experience and lack of in-game creativity. In other words, often the perception of Web3 games is that they are simply not fun. The payment rails can be difficult to navigate and gas fees are added on top of the price of non-fungible tokens (NFT) or in-game assets.  See also: Play-to-Earn Games Miss the Point of Gaming | Opinion  Adding to the hassle and expense, any on-chain action requires gas fees to be recorded — an expense that traditional gamers are not accustomed to having to pay.  Though some Web3 games may have not made the greatest first impression on gamers, there is plenty of room for hope.  'Play and earn'  As a first step to getting traditional gamers interested in exploring Web3, games need to move away from the play-to-earn model to a vision that more fully embraces the original gaming ethos: fun! This means that before Web3 games can offer players ownership of in-game assets, game developers need to focus on the elements that draw players to games in the first place: evocative worlds, great storytelling, frictionless game-play experience, a sense of community and the ability to hone in-game skills.  If Web3 games are fun first and foremost, then they have the freedom to add novel experiences like ownership of in-game assets that provides the true differentiation between Web2 and Web3 games.  Gaming already has a long tradition of in-game assets with games like ""World of Warcraft and Eve Online"" introducing tokens and in-game currencies as early as 2008. The opportunity within Web3 is offering in-game assets that have value both in and outside the game world.  This is one of the original use cases for non-fungible tokens (NFTs): turning in-game skins and weapons into digital assets that can be bought and sold on secondary trading platforms, potentially rewarding the asset creators with royalties on each sale as well.  See also: Decentralization on a Spectrum: How Fully On-Chain Games Are the Future | Opinion  Empowering players with a greater voice in the development process through governance is another point of differentiation that could attract traditional gamers to the space. Gamers can offer creators valuable feedback about the utility of a certain tool or weapon in the game.  By taking discussion forums to the next level and granting players the ability to impact decisions through decentralized governance participation, Web3 games could attract many more players. There's also value in fostering a vibrant and engaging community outside of the game itself that is inviting to traditional gamers, developers, and those new to the space entirely.  The good news is that a focus on user experience is already underway with major mobile game developer Zynga's launch of ""Sugartown"" whose world involves three animals who unlock a wormhole to another dimension — now we're starting to see the creation of fun game lore.  DappRadar's State of Blockchain Gaming in Q3 2023 report shows other positive indicators of growth for the Web3 gaming vertical, including a 12% increase in unique wallets since Q2 2023 and $600 million from venture capitalists pouring into Web3 games.  Taking gaming to a new place  The objective for Web3 games shouldn't be to replace traditional gaming with decentralized gaming. After all, traditional games are not going anywhere. They have their avid fanbase and generate $281.77 billion worldwide. The goal should be to create a space that is wholly new and exciting with its own ethos backed by user asset ownership and a voice in the ecosystems with which they participate.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING,Kelsey McGuire,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/01/its-time-for-web3-games-to-embrace-play-and-earn,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d6458ca5ab31314a626141ef7c1924a7a06563a-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419237,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE67Z,1698855628,FTX and the Case for Web3 YIMBYism,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was the latest in a long and storied line of personalities whose compelling elevator pitches papered over their poor management practices.  Though it purported to raze the walled gardens of traditional finance, FTX was probably just garden variety fraud. In the aftermath of the exchange’s collapse, Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) urged his colleagues “to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created by an industry and innovation.”  Alex Tapscott is a portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners and the author of the new book ""Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier"" (Harper Collins), available now.  Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) called it “a failure of centralization, a failure of business ethics, and a crime. It is not a failure of technology.” As the trial unfolds and as more evidence comes to light, these early insights appear prescient and true.  Web3’s Chernobyl  Still, is it possible the collapse of FTX derails Web3's growth?  Throughout history, promising innovations and even groundbreaking technologies have been sidelined by disasters, which change public perception. Chernobyl put a halt to new nuclear power projects which could have otherwise supplied the planet with abundant green energy. When the South Sea Company’s bubble burst in 1720, critics blamed its joint-stock structure as a high-risk legal invention; and governments banned their formation for a century.  Stung by those calamitous failures, people became NIMBYists [not in my backyard], choosing to halt all innovation rather than learn from their mistakes. These examples teach us that early failures and the response from governments can bend the arcs of technological adoption and diffusion, shortening their development horizons by years —or extending them by decades.  Is FTX Web3's Chernobyl?  FTX punctuated an era. It’s time to forge anew  “Some people in crypto have acted for too long as if Web3 was a given, as if it would follow the same trajectory as the Web in the 1990s,” Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures told me in an interview for my new book “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier.” “There was no sales tax on the iternet. There was the safe harbor of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, the safe harbor of the Communication Decency Act, that famous Section 230. We had all these regulatory tailwinds.”  By contrast, “Web3 has regulatory headwinds everywhere in the world, especially in the United States,” he said.  Wenger’s prescription for scaling Web3 starts with regulatory clarity about what’s a security and what’s not. The uncertainty around how to classify tokens has pushed innovation offshore.  FTX operated offshore in part because of a lack of clarity in the U.S. By pushing capital formation offshore the U.S. risks losing oversight and transparency into their doings (and in this case wrongdoings).Nuclear power is a useful analogy here too. Where would you rather develop nuclear power and harness its awesome power in America – with strong laws and oversight – or offshore and risk meltdown?  A growing chorus of academics, economists and businesspeople agree that we need a workable long-term framework. In a 2023 speech, Hester Peirce of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) observed: “If we continued with our regulation-by-enforcement approach at our current pace, we would approach 400 years before we got through the tokens that are allegedly securities.”  Enterprises, financial institutions and other large players will also be reluctant to invest long-term until there are clear rules of the road.  Strong policies can amplify the positive effects of clear regulations.  In ”The Innovators,” Walter Isaacson reminds us that “innovation occurs when ripe seeds fall on fertile ground.” Like the earth beneath our feet, we stand on stratums of innovation with markers of their age. Government can help to sow the seeds of innovation too and the solution can be bipartisan.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Needs Better Answers on the Stand | Opinion  Legislators can unleash the power of the private sector by turning barriers to entering traditional financial markets into guardrails for innovation. Rather than reshoring only legacy businesses of legacy industries, the Biden administration can also reshore Web3 firms and create good paying jobs in the U.S. in next era of the internet.

This was a warning in an October 31 X post by prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital to his nearly 400,000 followers. According to the analyst, despite its notable rally last week, DOGE failed to break its diagonal resistance, which resisted its ascent for several months. As a result of this failure, DogeCoin’s price might decline significantly soon. Rekt Capital Analysis: DogeCoin’s Complex Weekly Close Below Resistance From Rekt Capital’s analytic chart, Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a tricky week. It recorded notable upswings but closed below a significant resistance level at the price channel top. The analyst marked the meme coin’s closing price with a circle, as seen on the chart below. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital and Invesco Bitcoin Spot ETF Join BlackRock On The DTCC This setup suggests that DOGE’s anticipated big upswing might encounter delays, the analyst said in the Twitter post. He added that, in the past, when this has happened, DogeCoin’s price declined significantly. This means that the DOGE breakout is postponed. Previous weekly closes like this -> downside, Rekt Capital remarked. However, despite the high likelihood of a decline, the analyst believes there’s hope for DOGE. Rekt said, “If DOGE can hold the highs and reclaim the channel top as support – there may still be a chance.” Based on Rekt’s chart, to confirm a bullish trend, the DOGE $0.07 resistance needs to change to a support level on the weekly timeframe. Ali Martinez’s Bullish Analysis: Dogecoin’s Promising Breakout Recently, another crypto expert, Ali Martinez, made an optimistic prediction about Dogecoin. The analyst shared a chart on the X platform showing that the meme coin has broken out of a long-term pattern. According to Martinez, this happened when the overall cryptocurrency market trend shifted upwards. Also, Martinez highlighted that a special TD Sequential indicator gives a BUY signal on DOGE. According to the analyst, this signal strengthens the positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. In context, this indicator helps traders figure out if an asset’s price might change direction. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has formed two consecutive bullish higher-high candles on the weekly chart. The setup confirms that DOGE indeed broke free from the previous pattern. Related Reading: XRP Whale Transactions Spike To 3-Month High As Smart Money Buys In line with Rekt’s analysis, if the market keeps up this pace, the price could increase significantly. As of the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.0665; the coin is down by almost 4% in the past 24 hours. However, over the last seven days, Dogecoin has gained more than 1%, with a 12% 14-day increase.

Citing ""suspected market manipulation"" and ""malicious control of liquidity"" on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Bitget on Tuesday announced it would be delisting TokenFi [TOKEN] just days after it went live. Bitget further alleged that Floki added just $2,000 in tokens to liquidity pools.  Floki responded with a post on X, formerly Twitter, in which it says Bitget listed the token without permission and ultimately listed a fake version of TOKEN twelve minutes before it had been issued. Floki also said that Bitget facilitated tens of millions of dollars of trading volume without having a single token in their wallet. As the value of TOKEN went up, Floki claimed, Bitget created a $10 million hole as it didn't hold the underlying asset.  ""This is like opening an eight-figure short position on $TOKEN and expecting it to crash so they can buy lower to cover their hole,"" the post said.  In a follow-up tweet, Floki warned users to ""withdraw their tokens"" from Bitget as soon as possible, citing the $10 million deficit as indicating potentially deeper liquidity concerns.  In its announcement, Bitget said will buy back tokens from users holding TOKEN on the exchange for $0.00605002 each, which is the highest closing price between Oct. 27 and Oct. 31.

Within this article, I will explore some of the spaces which we at Pantera are keeping an eye on.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  1. Social and Consumer Use Cases  Whereas Web2 has progressed from social to finance, Web3 is moving from finance to social. From Friend.tech to on-chain loyalty, recently there has been more attention on the social element of Web3, seeking to use tokenization to transform social behavior. As consumer transactions may become more frequent on-chain, we believe stablecoins playing an increasingly important role as an on-ramp and off-ramp settlement solution between DeFi and TradFi use-cases.  Moreover, recent advancements in generative AI potentially promise a far more abstracted, personalized, and simplified user experience. With increased AI-enabled abstraction, we hope that this can reduce the onboarding and educational barrier to Web3, making blockchain data more accessible to those with non-technical backgrounds.  2. ZK-Enabled Modularity and Composability  We believe zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will continue to mature, both with new theoretical advancements in recursive proving and the gradual specialization of companies within the vertical to specific roles, such as co-processing, prove executions, zkDevOps, privacy layers, and so on. With this we are beginning to use ZKPs as a way of establishing a common interface between different layers of a modular tech stack.  Modularity is where different layers of the blockchain stack (consensus, execution, data availability etc.) are operated by different providers. This idea allows for increased composability in the form of lego-like “plug-and-play” blockchain architectures. This means that projects can customize their blockchain tech stack according to the specific demands of a consumer-facing application. Furthermore, increased smart-contract composability using general-purpose languages such as Rust allows for increased developer familiarity, reducing the barriers to entry for Web3 developers.  3. Bitcoin Ecosystem  We believe a third space to potentially look out for within the next year or so is the overall Bitcoin ecosystem, which has seen a flurry of renewed interest ahead of the anticipated 2024 halving. This includes possible SEC approval of ETFs from major TradFi funds, as well as a modularized Bitcoin blockchain that allows for more composable smart contracts.  Rise of Ordinals Inscriptions.

42419276,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE7w5,1698853500,Why Momentum Trading Works In Crypto,"Cryptocurrency markets have emerged as a highly dynamic, global financial market offering unparalleled opportunities for both active traders and investors alike. With the introduction of our CoinDesk Trend Indicator suite of signals, we hope to assist crypto investors in identifying new opportunities and managing risk in this emergent and volatile asset class.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  (Source: CoinDesk Indices Research)  In this post, we'll delve into the reasons why price trends exist and tend to persist in digital asset markets.  Why Does Momentum Trading Work Well in Cryptocurrency Markets?  While it is difficult to determine the exact rationale why a specific market price can exhibit persistent price changes and trending phenomena, there are a few that come to mind when considering the cryptocurrency market:  Limited Attention of Investors  One of the key reasons momentum trading thrives in cryptocurrency markets is the constant availability of trading opportunities. Unlike traditional stock markets that have set trading hours, cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7, 365 days a year. This continuous trading environment means investors may miss important developments, and their portfolios and trading activities may lag to market news headlines or price changes.  On top of the human limitations of trading a market that never closes, many participants within the crypto markets are non-professional retail investors, who have a lot of other daily responsibilities besides crypto markets and newsflow. The net effect of these constraints on attention to the market creates opportunities for rules-based momentum traders to capitalize on the delayed reactions of market participants.  Mechanical Feedback Trading  Leveraged trading and stop-loss orders often lead to mechanical feedback trading in cryptocurrency markets. When prices move in a sustained direction, stop-loss orders can be triggered and leveraged traders can be forced out of their losing positions, which adds to marginal buys or sells in the direction of the price move. This technical phenomenon can support and reinforce trending behavior, making momentum trading strategies particularly effective.  Network Effects  Cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, ether and native blockchain tokens, are supported and driven by network effects – which is to say the value and utility of these token assets increase as more users and developers join the ecosystem. This compounded growth inherently promotes momentum. As the network effect strengthens, more investors are attracted, and prices tend to follow a continuous upward trajectory.  Delay in Updating Views  Investor behavior is often characterized by a delay in updating views and an inclination to stick to strongly held prior beliefs. And for better or for worse, the cryptocurrency asset class is significantly more polarizing than existing and more established markets. This psychological bias can lead to investors holding outdated market views, despite contradictory market price developments.  For example, Trader A might stubbornly hold the belief that the market is still in a bull market cycle while the price trends lower. Conversely, Trader B might insist they are in the midst of a Crypto Winter, even as ether and bitcoin rally. Does this sound like anyone’s experience between 2022 into 2023?  For the reasons listed above, we should expect trending prices to persist in digital asset markets, making momentum indicators a useful strategy tool for any manager of crypto assets.  For the most current signals, the Bitcoin Trend Indicator and Ether Trend Indicator publish every day at 4 p.m. ET.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  BITCOIN TURNS 15: Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever that is) released the Bitcoin white paper on Oct. 31, 2008. That means this little crypto experiment just celebrated a nice round number anniversary: 15 years. To note the milestone, I decided to write about something I find ironic: Bitcoin debuted into a financial world that was burning (remember the financial crisis?!) and the idea was quickly picked up by people who wanted to get rid of conventional ways of doing financial things, thus undermining the conventional firms that did those things. Today, though, the story of bitcoin and crypto more broadly is increasingly dominated by conventional financial firms. BlackRock and its peers seem to have a good shot at winning approvals for bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, which could lure a flood of new investment money. Optimism around that has fueled the recent BTC price rally. Is this a full takeover of crypto by traditional finance? Of course not. But are the firms that peer-to-peer blockchains were supposed to undermine now ascendent in crypto? They sure are. What does it mean? You tell me!  SBF TRIAL: This newsletter is geared toward professionals in the financial space, so, at this point, Sam Bankman-Fried is pretty much in the rear-view mirror as far as pros are concerned. He can't lobby for crypto regulations in Washington anymore, for instance, and FTX's perpetual futures didn't turn out to be so perpetual. His criminal trial has provided some good reading, however. (Keep up with our excellent SBF trial newsletter!) One thing just became clear: The media blitz he went on after FTX blew up was a bad idea. That was obvious, really, at the time, but now we see exactly why. While SBF was on the witness stand Monday, a prosecutor kept using his year-old words against him. We got a hint of that possibility last November when journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin publicly asked if his attorneys were ""suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking."" SBF replied: ""No, they're very much not.""  CME VS. BINANCE: Here's a trend that fits with the first bullet point above: CME, the giant Chicago-based exchange with roots in the 19th century, is close to overtaking Binance, the giant crypto exchange with roots in the 2000s, in terms of the notional value of bitcoin derivatives positions. CME is one of the key markets in all of traditional finance, so this fits with the idea that crypto and TradFi are converging.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/01/why-momentum-trading-works-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c3e2a94e36857fcffe1ed462ed829a8696b0fc4-5400x5400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Their interpretations differed, of course.  Bankman-Fried ""told a story, and he lied to you,"" a federal prosecutor told jurors about the FTX founder.  Bankman-Fried's lawyer, Mark Cohen, disagreed, replying that the government spun a Hollywood tale about FTX that strayed from reality. ""Any good movie needs a villain,"" he said. ""A nerdy high school math guy"" like Bankman-Fried doesn't make a good villain, he added, so prosecutors manufactured one.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried on Verge of Tears as His Lawyer Concludes Defense  The lawyers spent Wednesday walking the jury through about a month of testimony and hundreds of pieces of evidence. Bankman-Fried faces two counts of wire fraud and five counts of conspiracy tied to the operation and collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and Alameda Research, the trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried that is alleged to have stolen a huge amount of money from FTX customers. Jurors could begin deliberating Bankman-Fried's fate as soon as Thursday.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos, who is presenting the U.S. Department of Justice's denouement, opened by noting that there was ""no dispute"" that billions of dollars worth of FTX customer funds was gone.  ""This is a pyramid of deceit by the defendant built on lies and false promises,"" he said.  Bankman-Fried's lawyer disputed this characterization early in his own closing statement. The government's movie-villain depiction of Bankman-Fried was built on the ""false premise"" that the FTX crypto empire was fraudulent ""from the jump,"" he said.  ""We've got evidence of [Bankman-Fried's] hair, his clothes … his sex life,"" Cohen said, but these things have ""nothing to do with how his exchange worked"" or whether he committed crimes.  While ""FTX sure should've had a better-built-out risk management system,"" Cohen said, his client acted ""in good faith,"" and he reminded jurors that this is ""a complete defense to all the charges in this case.""  'The defendant is responsible'  Roos, the prosecutor, asked the jury to keep three questions in mind as they review the evidence: where the money went, what happened and who was responsible, repeating these questions several times.  ""Now that you've seen all the evidence and heard all testimonies, you know the answer,"" Roos said, pointing to Bankman-Fried. ""This man,"" the prosecutor said. ""The defendant is responsible.""  Bankman-Fried's former employees quit when they learned about the missing money, and his fellow executives testified that they didn't know customer funds were being misused until it was too late, Roos said.  ""Their understanding was, customer funds were not allowed to be used by FTX or anyone else,"" he said. ""Customer funds belonged to customers.""  Roos pointed to witness testimony and Bankman-Fried's own turn on the stand, saying the defendant morphed into a ""different person"" when answering the DOJ's questions as opposed to defense attorney Mark Cohen's.  ""He came up with a tale,"" Roos said, asking the jury if they noticed how during cross-examination, Bankman-Fried couldn't remember details, whereas during the direct examination, he frequently described situations from his life. ""You'd have to ignore the evidence to believe his story.""  Later, Roos also pointed out another seemingly obvious explanation for why Bankman-Fried was solely responsible: He was the only person who was involved in and controlled both FTX and Alameda and, thus, was the only one who had access to both companies.  Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, he said, never worked for FTX, while Gary Wang and Nishad Singh were only ever employees at FTX, and never Alameda. ""So it couldn't have been them alone,"" Roos argued.  ""It was one person,"" he said, pointing his finger yet again in Bankman-Fried's direction. ""The defendant.""  Digging the hole deeper  After pointing out the ""special privileges"" on FTX that let Alameda allegedly take FTX customer funds, Roos walked the jury through six times when Bankman-Fried ""chose to double-down"" and dig ""the hole deeper"" at FTX and Alameda. The government's whirlwind review of the month-long criminal trial kicked off in 2021, when Bankman-Fried, according to analysis from a data expert's testimony, used over a billion dollars of FTX users' money to repurchase stock from investor-turned-rival, Binance.  He then moved to a second key moment later that year, when Bankman-Fried continued to spend billions on new investments at a time when the prosecutor said it should've been clear Alameda, which had already borrowed billions from FTX users, had less assets than liabilities. ""You don't have to go to MIT to know that if you have more debts than money, and you want to spend more money, then you're going to be more in debt,"" he quipped to the jury.  Roos used the next two moments – Bankman-Fried's instruction to Alameda to pay back third-party loans following a June 2022 market crash, and his alleged involvment in creating ""fake"" Alameda balance sheets for lenders – to point out specific gaps in Bankman-Fried's testimony.  Roos alleged that Bankman-Fried ""lied on the stand"" when he claimed he wasn't aware, for example, that Alameda was already verging on insolvency by this point (a fact Ellison testified she discussed with him at the time). The prosecutor pulled up Google metadata showing that Bankman-Fried created a spreadsheet showing Alameda owed a large amount to FTX and then set up a meeting to discuss it with several deputies. The spreadsheet and meeting were present in the testimony of other witnesses, but went unaddressed by Bankman-Fried, Roos noted.  The prosecutor wrapped up by moving to late 2022, when Bankman-Fried continued to make investments in companies like Modulo and SkyBridge Capital despite testimony from other witnesses, like senior FTX executive Nishad Singh, that Bankman-Fried knew this would mean drawing on user deposits.  Roos then pointed out the final key moment: Bankman-Fried's public ""assets are fine"" tweet on Nov. 7, 2022, a day after he wrote in a private memo that ""we have enough to process 1/3 of remaining client money.""  The defense's emotional closing argument  Bankman-Fried appeared to be on the verge of tears late Wednesday at the end of his attorney's closing remarks, the former FTX CEO's last, best hope for acquittal, or at least a hung jury.  Cohen spent several hours poking holes in the government's depiction of Bankman-Fried, and he placed special focus on sowing doubt in the credibility of key government witnesses Ellison, Singh and Wang – all of whom took government plea agreements that could drastically reduce their sentences in exchange for their cooperation. ""In a three-and-a-half-hour summation the government didn't mention their cooperation agreements at all,"" Cohen remarked.  He also reminded the jury that Bankman-Fried had at one point pondered shutting down Alameda. Bankman-Fried ultimately reasoned in a memo that the firm would be too difficult to unwind – evidence, according to Roos' argument earlier in the day, that the firm had borrowed too much money from FTX customer funds that it was unable to repay. Cohen took an alternate view: ""If Sam is a criminal mastermind and Alameda is the key to the fraud to stealing customer money, why would he be the one proposing to close it in the first place?""  ""Sam did his best to start and operate two multi-billion-dollar businesses in a new market,"" Cohen said at the conclusion of his emotionally charged remarks to jurors.  ""Some decisions turned out well,"" he added. ""Some decisions turned out poorly.""  At the end of the proceeding, which stretched past 6 p.m., he offered an appeal for the jury to find Bankman-Fried acted in ""good faith"" throughout his time running FTX and Alameda, and therefore could not be convicted of fraud.  Cohen asked the jury to consider the real world when they begin their deliberations. In Cohen's telling, it was ""real world miscommunications,"" ""mistakes,"" and ""delays"" that imperiled FTX and the rest of Bankman-Fried's crypto empire – not intentional acts of fraud.  Bankman-Fried spent these final few moments of his team's closing arguments, a ramrod stillness replacing his usual jitters.

Traders in both traditional and crypto markets will be focused on the rate decision's accompanying policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference for clues about the future direction of monetary policy.  Fed speakers over the past few weeks have suggested the central bank is likely to hike interest rates one more time (timing undecided) before concluding what's been a historic rate hike cycle that's taken the fed funds rate from 0% in March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50%. Recent wobbles in financial markets, some softening economic indicators and a new leg higher in geopolitical tensions, however, could give the Fed an opening to back away from the idea of any more rate hikes.  Bitcoin's strong October breakout from the $27,000 area has been stalled in the $34,000-$35,000 area for the past week, perhaps awaiting fresh fuel. While any dovish signal from the Fed could provide a push out of that range, few are expecting it. “We still see another U.S. rate increase as unlikely in the current cycle,” Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, told CNBC.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Spiked Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the price of Bitcoin could correct towards the $31,000 to $32,000 range from the current whale selling pressure. The relevant indicator here is the “exchange whale ratio,” which measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 transfers to exchanges and the total exchange inflow. The 10 largest transactions going towards these platforms generally come from the whales, so this ratio can tell us about how the inflow activity of the whales currently compares against the rest of the market. Related Reading: Can PEPE Build On Its 60% Rise? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says These humongous investors may transfer their coins to these central entities for a variety of purposes, one of which could be for selling. Thus, whenever the whales occupy a large part of the total exchange inflows, it’s a potential sign that the selling pressure being mounted by this cohort is rising. Historically, the indicator crossing the 0.90 mark has particularly been bearish for the cryptocurrency. At this level, 90% of the total inflows are coming from the wallets of the whales. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 72-hour moving average (MA) Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the past few months: The 72-hour MA value of the metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the quant has marked the 0.90 level in red and has highlighted the points in the Bitcoin price corresponding to the instances where the 72-hour MA exchange whale ratio crossed this line. The analyst notes that in all of these occurrences, the cryptocurrency first registered some volatility and then observed a decline in the short term, leading toward a local bottom formation. Given the close timings, it would appear possible that the higher inflows from the whales during these instances were at least partially made for selling purposes. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has once again risen above the 0.90 level recently, suggesting that the whales have considerably ramped up their inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone Naturally, these high values of the metrics don’t necessarily have to be bearish for the asset, as it’s possible that this cohort is simply opening up positions on the derivatives market this time (and to some extent, it has to be true in either case, as the futures open interest has seen an increase in the last few days). Given the pattern that has followed in the last few instances, though, the quant says, “I expect increased volatility in Bitcoin and anticipate a new local bottom with a drop to the 31,000 to 32,000 dollar range, which previously acted as resistance.” BTC Price Bitcoin hasn’t been able to find any direction in the last few days as the coin has been consolidating above $34,000. If the exchange whale ratio is anything to go by, though, things might change soon for the asset.

The partnership will provide privacy to all traffic on Near’s blockchain, allowing users to access NFTs, DeFi and dApps in private, according to the press release.  “The open, transparent nature of public permissionless blockchains means that transaction data is visible to anyone who cares to look, and even off-chain information like IP addresses and geolocation data can be vulnerable to being exposed,” said the press release.  The statement added that through the collaboration, Nym will mask off-chain metadata traffic, protect transaction data in transit, and make it much more difficult for adversaries to ""de-anonymise"" users via their public IP addresses.

How XRP Price Could Rise To $0.9 In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, the crypto analyst highlighted that while analyzing the XRP/USD chart, the fact that XRP is currently enjoying an upward trend, but that could soon come to an end as it faces a resistance level at around the price range of $0.63. Related Reading: Ripple Partner’s Staggering XRP Holdings Revealed, Do They Know Something You Don’t? He was, however, quick to alleviate any fear of a potential dump as he noted that the rejection doesn’t necessarily translate to a massive dump down but could simply mean a consolidation around that price range. He also sounded optimistic when he stated that there is a “decent chance” that the XRP price breaks that resistance level, which, if it does, could see the token rise to as high as $0.9. He didn’t, however, provide a timeframe for when this could happen, as he mentioned that XRP holders might have to be patient. On the bright side, XRP’s fundamentals are looking stronger, especially with Ripple’s latest win against the SEC, with the Commission dismissing its case against the company’s founders. Ripple is also actively building to expand its services, which could see XRP’s utility increase as a result of the company’s efforts. What Could Hinder XRP’s Rise? CrediBULL Crypto also mentioned the factor that was hindering a massive rally from the XRP price. According to him, the token is simply facing the same problem that other altcoins are encountering, which is a lack of liquidity in the market. He stated that this was what ultimately affected XRP’s decline in the months leading up to now, as he had predicted that XRP was going to rise above $1 following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple in its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Trader Who Bought Dogecoin In 2017 Maps Out Meteoric 37500% Rise To $26 Another factor that could see the XRP price decline in the short term is the projected parabolic rise of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. While analyzing the XRP/BTC chart, CrediBULL Crypto hinted that XRP could experience as much as a 30% decline against BTC. This decline doesn’t only apply to XRP, as he expects that other altcoins will bleed against the foremost cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst, however, does not doubt XRP’s potential, as he stated that the token would be one of the biggest benefactors once, there is an “influx of new money” in the market, which is likely to happen as Bitcoin continues to rise.

42419271,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE7sz,1698847200,How a Ph.D. Student's Research Paper Turned Celestia Into $345M Blockchain Project Overnight,"Mustafa Al-Bassam was a Ph.D. student in computer science in 2019 at University College London when he published a paper titled ""LazyLedger.""  Not meant for a lazy reader, the paper went on to describe, in excruciatingly complex terms and Greek mathematical characters, what was then a radical rethinking of how blockchains could work: separating out the various functions of a distributed ledger – especially the way users query the network for data – into distinct ""application layers."" A key benefit would be to minimize the total resources needed to run the main blockchain.  Al-Bassam now serves as CEO of Celestia Labs, the primary developer behind the Celestia project, which launched this week as a new ""data availability"" network, and in various pronouncements heralded the accomplishment as the start of a new ""modular era"" in blockchain architecture.  It's presumed that a primary use case for Celestia will be to relieve the Ethereum blockchain of the burden of storing and transmitting reams of data produced by the fast-growing ecosystem of ""layer-2"" networks known as ""rollups,"" where users can make cheaper and faster transactions.  ""The theory is that Celestia can become the backbone for a highly scalable and interoperable network of rollups and, most importantly, achieve this modular vision without sacrificing decentralization or security,"" Christine Kim, a vice president of research at the crypto firm Galaxy, wrote in an Oct. 19 report.  Of course, this being crypto, the primary focus of most news coverage (and social-media posts) was on the project's buzzy airdrop Tuesday of some 60 million of its native TIA tokens, or roughly 6% of the supply, with a final tally of some 191,391 claims. Another 140 million tokens will be allocated to future initiatives.  Read More: Celestia Airdrops TIA Token as Network Goes Live, Claims Start of 'Modular Era'  The airdrop was so highly anticipated that, in the lead-up to the giveaway, traders were speculating on the price using pre-launch futures contracts. According to the website CoinMarketCap, the TIA token has already been listed on a host of crypto exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, Bybit and MEXC.  As of late Tuesday, CoinMarketCap listed the project's circulating supply of TIA tokens around 141 million, and price of $2.44 each, for a market capitalization of $344 million.  The airdropped tokens represent a portion of a total of 1 billion tokens minted, and this being crypto, just over half of those are getting allocated to early investors and initial contributors. Many of those are locked up for now: Seed investors will receive their tokens evenly between October 2024 and October 2025, with initial core contributors receiving their tokens until October 2026.  The TIA airdrop is one of the biggest in the crypto industry over the past year, and of course a big airdrop is no guarantee of a project's ultimate success.  Two mammoth projects, Sui and Aptos, both layer 1 blockchains staffed by former Meta employees, have similarities with Celestia in that they airdropped tokens to developers and test network users, but they have struggled to wrangle market share from the likes of Ethereum.  Aptos rose to a market cap of $2.9 billion on the release of its main network while Sui debuted at $750 million. Yet in spite of inflated token values, the total amount of capital locked on either blockchain has failed to surpass $100 million.  What does Celestia do?  On Tuesday, X (formerly Twitter) was filled with go-go posts – ""$10 soon,"" wrote one user in reference to TIA's price. Another poster asked where they could dump the airdropped tokens. Jesse Pollak, who oversees Coinbase's new Base layer-2 blockchain atop Ethereum, offered congratulations.  Such euphoria may have served to gloss over the reality of just how hard the project is to understand.  ""Data availability"" is such an arcane term that even Dankrad Feist, an Ethereum Foundation researcher who's the namesake for the equally arcane blockchain concept of ""danksharding,"" said recently that he found it too confusing.  Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStat, simplified it for investors in a note on Tuesday: Data availability ""allows network nodes to download, store, and make transaction information accessible for verification.""  The big idea is that Celestia aims to help solve scalability and stability issues that have plagued monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Solana – partly by creating a new venue for hosting and accessing the reams of data created by the rapidly proliferating ecosystems of ""layer 2"" networks working atop primary ""layer 1"" blockchains.  Data availability is considered so crucial to alleviating the load on Ethereum that two rival projects, Avail and EigenDA, are working on it in addition to Celestia. Avail is headed by a former Polygon co-founder, Anurag Arjun, while EigenDA is a project of EigenLayer, headed by Sreeram Kannan, an associate professor at the University of Washington.  The push to erect these new networks reflects this year's push by developers toward a ""modular blockchain"" architecture that separates the core functions of a blockchain – consensus, settlement, data availability, and execution – and then segment them into layers that ensure efficiency.  ""It's the start of a new era,"" the Celestia Foundation, which supports development on the network, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. ""The modular era.""  Read More: What Is Ethereum’s ‘Data Availability' Problem, and Why Does It Matter?  How does Celestia work?  According to the Celestia’s project documentation, the TIA tokens represent ""an essential part of how developers build on the first modular blockchain network.""  To use Celestia for data availability, rollup developers submit a type of transaction known as ""PayForBlobs"" on the network for a fee, denominated in TIA.  Modular blockchains are designed with a focus on using specific channels for speed and execution, unlike monolithic blockchains that can only scale at the expense of decentralization or security.  ""Instead of one blockchain doing everything, modular blockchains specialize and optimize to perform a given function,"" Celestia spokesperson Ekram Ahmed told CoinDesk.  Al-Bassam, the former Ph.D. student who went on to found Celestia, co-authored three academic books with the Ethereum's famous founder. Vitalik Buterin. In a talk earlier this year, Buterin touted Celestia as a scaling solution for Ethereum rollups.  On Tuesday, the official Celestia account on X posted: ""What was once considered a wild moonshot is now a reality four years after the LazyLedger white paper was published.""  What sets Celestia apart from other blockchains?  ""Data availability sampling answers the question,"" Ahmed replied before highlighting the importance of verifying data on a blockchain. ""Users of a monolithic blockchain usually download all the data to check that it is available.""  Currently, this problem isn't necessarily in the forefront of the mind of Ethereum or Solana users, but that may be because neither blockchain has scaled to the masses. Ethereum averages around 1 million transactions per day, according to ycharts, with Solana racking up a fraction of that.  Last week, fund manager VanEck modeled a scenario that would see Solana reach 100 million users. If blockchains manage to scale to this level, projects like Celestia aim to ensure that the data for every blockchain node is verified and validated.  ""Modular chains solve this problem by making it possible for users to verify very large blocks using a technology called data availability sampling,"" Ahmed said.  The flagship feature of Celestia is data availability sampling (DAS) – a way of verifying all data that is available on a blockchain.  Intended users include those running so-called light nodes – able to be run on small computers that don't need massive amounts of computational power or data-storage capacity – who could then verify data availability without having to download all data for a block. These light nodes conduct several rounds of random sampling of block data, as more rounds are completed it increases its confidence that the data is available.  ""Once the light node successfully reaches a predetermined confidence level, for example 99%, it will consider the block data as available,"" Ahmed concluded.  Eventually, if Al-Bassam's vision takes hold, day-to-day crypto users might interact with Celestia without knowing it. And understanding it all? Seems a lot less likely.",POSITIVE,TIA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH | TIA | AIRDROP,"Oliver Knight, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/01/how-a-phd-students-research-paper-turned-celestia-into-345m-blockchain-project-overnight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52a1ee9d2c253d2c259f03cc515bc734bda9de07-1920x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Some of the world's largest market-making firms are in the mix to potentially provide liquidity for BlackRock's eagerly awaited bitcoin ETF if regulators approve the product, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Trading giants Jane Street, Virtu Financial, Jump Trading and Hudson River Trading have held talks with BlackRock about a market-making role, according to a BlackRock slide deck reviewed by the person. BlackRock, Jane Street, Virtu and Jump declined to comment. Hudson River Trading, also known as HRT, didn't respond to a request for comment.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates derivatives markets in the U.S., has paid out $16 million to whistleblowers this year, and most of the 1,530 tips involved crypto, Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said on Tuesday. ""The majority of the tips received this year involved crypto – an area that continues to have pervasive fraud and other illegality,"" Romero said in a statement published on the CFTC website. ""With the rise of crypto, more retail customers have come under the CFTC’s jurisdiction, making even more critical the efforts of the CFTC’s Whistleblower Program and the Office of Customer Education and Outreach.""  Etherfuse, a platform attempting to improve decentralized blockchain infrastructure, unveiled ""Stablebond"" at Solana’s breakpoint conference in Amsterdam, a tokenized bond offering, to retail investors in Mexico. The firm is targeting Mexico because it is the second-largest bond market in Latin America, after Brazil, according to the company's research. The market is also one of the most liquid in Latin America, with $623 billion in outstanding debt and an average daily trading volume of $200 million, the research added. The majority of trading volume in Mexico comes from institutions, governments and foreign investors, according to a press release from Etherfuse, meaning there's a lack of retail investors or individuals investing in bonds.  Chart of the Day  The Bitcoin blockchain settled more than 40 million transactions in the July quarter, the highest on record.

19686486,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558568,1698843625,Solana Bull Run Could Smash Through $40 Barrier This Week – Here’s How,"Solana (SOL) remains on a relentless upward trajectory, defying even recent reports of the embattled crypto exchange FTX moving millions of funds in SOL and other tokens. The cryptocurrency is now hovering close to a critical resistance point at $40, showcasing remarkable resilience and determination. As of the latest data from CoinGecko, the current SOL price stands at $37.96, reflecting a 5% increase in the past 24 hours and a seven-day surge of 21.3%. The journey toward $40 has been an exciting one, with SOL appreciating by approximately 80% from its intramonth low of around $21.07, a level it touched near October 12, as per CoinMarketCap figures. While SOL has demonstrated its potential, the looming question on everyone’s mind is whether it can indeed break through the $40 resistance and continue its bullish run. Related Reading: THORChain Beats Rivals In Top 100 Coin Rankings With 34% Rally – How RUNE Did It Solana Bullish Momentum And Technical Indicators Last week, there were ominous signs of a reversal when SOL dipped below the $30 mark. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) proved to be a strong support as it bounced off at 70, reinforcing the bullish sentiment among traders. This key technical indicator suggested that the cryptocurrency had more room to grow, encouraging traders to keep their buy positions open. An important turning point in SOL’s chart was an accumulation drive at the $30 mark. This price level allowed bulls to build the necessary momentum for the resumption of the uptrend. The subsequent surge catapulted Solana’s price above $35, bringing it closer to the elusive $40 milestone. Related Reading: Cardano Experiences Decline In Q3 Network Activity – Unraveling The Root Cause SOLUSD currently trading at $38.48 on the daily chart: TradingView.com The Path To $40 – Key Metrics To Watch As Solana inches closer to the $40 resistance, several key metrics and indicators are worth monitoring to gauge the cryptocurrency’s likelihood of breaking through this crucial barrier. Increasing trading volume often accompanies strong price movements. Traders should keep an eye on SOL’s trading volume as a surge in buying interest can indicate a potential breakout. Sentiment analysis across social media platforms, forums, and news sources can provide valuable insights into market sentiment. Positive sentiment may fuel the bullish drive, while negative sentiment could signal potential headwinds. The Solana ecosystem is dynamic and continuously evolving. Any significant developments, partnerships, or platform upgrades can influence SOL’s price trajectory. Solana’s journey to $40 is characterized by a combination of technical strength, market sentiment, and ecosystem developments. While it has shown remarkable resilience, achieving this milestone will depend on a confluence of factors. Traders and enthusiasts are eagerly watching for signs of a potential breakout, and the coming days will reveal whether SOL can maintain its bullish momentum and breach the $40 resistance.

That's the message from bitcoin's 14-week relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator used to measure the speed and change of price movements.  The indicator has crossed above 70, a threshold that marked the FOMO (fear of missing out) phases of the mid-2019 and late 2020 bull runs. These FOMO phases are characterized by both retail and savvy traders pouring money into an already-trending asset in fear of missing out on a significant opportunity.  Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and oscillates between zero and 100. The default period for calculating RSI is 14 days, but traders use 14-week and 14-month RSIs to gauge long-term momentum.  A reading above 70 is often erroneously taken to represent overbought conditions and a sign of an impending bearish reversal. However, per technical analysis textbooks, an above-70 RSI, especially on longer duration charts, suggests bullish momentum is strong and the asset could continue to rally in the weeks ahead, similar to what happened in 2019 and 2020.  To paraphrase a Wall Street saying, indicators can stay overbought longer than bears can stay solvent.

19684931,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558586,1698840049,Solana (SOL) Breaks Multi-Month Trend As Firedancer Hits Testnet,"The Solana price is currently experiencing a breathtaking rally. Since marking a bottom below $8 on December 29, the SOL price has risen more than 395%. And news from the Solana Breakpoint conference, which is currently being held in Amsterdam from October 30 to November 3, 2023, further fueled the price yesterday. In the last 24 hours, the price has risen 7.5%, and a whopping 23% in the last seven days. Firedancer Launched On Solana Testnet Central to the current excitement is the launch of Firedancer on Solana’s testnet. This new validator client, designed for the Solana blockchain, promises to significantly improve the scalability of the network, diminish latency times, and overall enhance network performance. The brain behind Firedancer Solana is Jump Crypto, a division of the Jump Trading Group, dedicated to pioneering solutions in the blockchain space. Their vision for Firedancer is comprehensive. It is designed to refine the Solana network across all tiers, starting from its foundational consensus mechanism to its broadest performance metrics. Ultimately, Firedancer aims to scale Solana to one million transactions per second (TPS). Related Reading: Solana Flying, Bulls Reverse Post-FTX Collapse Losses But SOL Analysts Cautious Highlighting the criticality of Firedancer to the future roadmap of Solana, Dan Albert, Executive Director of the Solana Foundation, proclaimed during his live stage appearance at the conference, “These guys have been hustling hard. Really did a lot of work, working around the clock in the last couple of weeks and I am really excited to announce that right now the first version of Firedancer is live on testnet.” 🔥💃 The first version of @jump_firedancer 🔥💃 Live on testnet. 🔥💃 Right now. Watch @DanPaul000 share the news live on the @SolanaConf stage. Only at #Breakpoint2023. Watch the livestream: https://t.co/51G659GtUO pic.twitter.com/llaHoiendH — Solana (@solana) October 31, 2023 Validating this enthusiasm, Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group and former Goldman Sachs executive, expressed his bullish outlook, stating: Firedancer is a VERY big deal, not just for Solana but for blockchain technology overall. It is a quantum leap in speed (10x faster than the fastest blockchain today) whilst increasing security and robustness of the Solana Virtual Machine [SVM]. We’re eagerly awaiting its migration to Mainnet in the summer of 2024. Pal further encapsulated the potential of Solana and Firedancer in a recent conversation with Scott Melker. He opined, “I’ve been observing the charts, particularly Solana versus ETH (SOL/ETH) and Solana versus Bitcoin (SOL/BTC), and it unmistakably resembles a rocket ship in its ascent. It’s truly astonishing.” Related Reading: FTX Transfers $150M In Assets, Including Ethereum And Solana, Amid Bankruptcy SOL Price Breaks Multi-Month Trend However, in the midst of this euphoria, some analysts urge caution. With SOL’s price surging to touch a 1-year high of $39.88 yesterday, analyst Pentoshi offered a sobering perspective, noting, “SOL takes out these equal highs at the top of the range and in the next couple weeks likely a chance to refuel at the mid-range at $32.xx.” In addition, the 1-day chart shows that SOL broke out of an ascending trend channel (black) in a very bullish manner. SOL rose yesterday above the late October high of $38.78, which the price marked just before it plummeted in the wake of FTX’s collapse, losing more than 68% in four days. The next few days will be all about closing above $38.78 for the SOL bulls. If this succeeds, the Fibonacci extension level of 1.618 at $57.85 could be the next major target. Otherwise, a correction toward the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $32.18 could be in the cards.

42419263,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE7kj,1698836560,Upcoming UK Rules for Crypto Ad Approvers Spell Uncertainty for Industry,"Unregistered crypto firms looking to serve U.K. clients have to rely on other companies to approve local communications.  These ad approvers are facing heavy regulatory scrutiny and will soon have to apply for new permissions.  The U.K.’s tough new rules for advertising crypto have firms rushing – and even struggling – to comply. More rules planned for ad approvers augur further trouble for companies looking to draw local customers.  Local regulators require firms to be admitted to the country’s crypto register to be able to approve their own communications or – failing that – have their ads approved by authorized firms.  It sounds pretty straightforward, but in reality, firms with the right powers aren’t easy to come by. Binance exchange, for instance, teamed up with a U.K. firm called Rebuildingsociety.com to have its promos approved, but the country’s financial watchdog slapped the local firm with new restrictions in October limiting its ability to approve crypto-related communications. As a result, Binance announced it won’t be taking on any new U.K. clients until it finds an authorized ad approver.  Now, as much as 10 crypto businesses including Coinbase and OKX are relying on exchange platform Archax to approve their ads in the U.K. But even Archax’s future as a crypto promotions approver is not guaranteed.  Archax can only temporarily approve crypto ads for other companies while it applies for the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) permission to continue approving. It can apply for this authorization within three months starting Nov. 6. Should the regulator reject Archax's application, companies that are relying on it for ad approvals will be forced to find alternative means of complying.  “Everyone is in the same state as us. We're all applying and we're all allowed to provide the service while we apply,” said Simon Barnby, Archax’s chief marketing officer, in an interview with CoinDesk. “If at the end of it, someone passes then that's all well and good and if someone doesn't, then they would have to stop providing the service.”  Authorization not enough  Archax was one of the first companies to get on the FCA crypto register in 2020 and it received authorization from the regulator as an exchange, broker and custodian for tokenized and traditional assets.  Although the FCA has previously said authorized entities can approve crypto ads, this didn’t prove enough in the case of Binance’s ad approver. Rebuildingsociety.com was told in October that it could not approve crypto ads despite the company being an FCA-authorized entity. The FCA said at the time that the decision was made to ensure consumer protection.  The confusion over which entities have the right powers to help crypto firms communicate to U.K. clients is only part of the struggle for unregulated platforms that have historically – and quite liberally – accessed customers across jurisdictions. The FCA is monitoring compliance carefully, and has added around 221 crypto platforms to its warnings list since the ad rules took effect on Oct. 8.  The regulator is also putting pressure on ad approvers. In a recent notice, it told approvers to expect enforcement action should they fail to notice “common issues” like illegible or insufficient risk warnings.  Read more: Binance to Stop Accepting New U.K. Users to Comply With Ad Rules  New permissions  Firms approving crypto ads for other companies must apply for new permissions with the FCA. To get the greenlight, firms have to prove they have the appropriate expertise to approve promotions for crypto companies and demonstrate they have the resources to do so, the regulator said.  “​​It's a resource-intensive area, but we have been growing the team appropriately to match client demand,” Nick Donovan, chief revenue officer at Archax said, adding that the firm is preparing its application.  Firms that have been approving other companies’ communications can continue doing so after they apply for the new permissions, and only keep going if they get a positive decision from the FCA.  “If we refuse [a firm's] application or the permission granted does not cover approvals for certain types of product for which they have applied for permission, the firm will need to cease the relevant S21 approval activity once we have determined their application,” the FCA said in September.

BTCO Joins IBTC On DTCC Website The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF under the ticker ‘BTCO’ recently appeared on the DTCC website, joining BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which goes under the ticker ‘IBTC’ as uncertainty around a possible approval of these funds continues to heighten. Related Reading: Top 5 Bitcoin-Like Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In The Crypto Bull Run Source: DTCC website Many had speculated an approval was imminent when BlackRock’s IBTC was earlier listed. However, the optimism has sort of cooled off following a recent revelation by a spokesperson for the financial services company. The representative clarified that the listing of these ETFs was simply “Standard Practice” and that it doesn’t indicate any potential approval by the SEC. An ETF expert had also weighed in and stated that DTCC’s listing didn’t mean anything in the grand scheme of things regarding a possible approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Going by this, the DTCC listing only suggests that these asset managers are preparing just in case they get approved by the SEC. Such preparations also include asset managers BlackRock and VanEck recently revealing their plans to begin seeding for their respective funds. While such a move doesn’t guarantee that the SEC is likely to approve these funds anytime soon, it, however, shows the optimism of these firms that their Spot Bitcoin ETF will launch sooner or later. Valkyrie Joins The Spot Bitcoin ETF Amendment Train In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that the asset management firm Valkyrie had joined the “prospectus amendment train” with the latest filing of their revised Spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus. Valkyrie joins the likes of ARK Invest, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, who have also filed amendments to their prospectus. Related Reading: Ripple Partner’s Staggering XRP Holdings Revealed, Do They Know Something You Don’t? Seyffart happens to be one of those who believe that these amendments could mean something. ARK Invest was the first asset manager to amend its prospectus, which led Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas to predict that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a fund as early as next year. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the SEC has so far not said anything regarding Grayscale’s application despite the Commission opting not to file an appeal. But that could change soon as ETF enthusiast and prominent financial lawyer Scott Johnsson said that the Commission is set to have a closed meeting on November 2; its first since the Grayscale deadline expired, and one of the agenda for the meeting includes resolving litigation claims.

42419258,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE7hd,1698832800,Sam Bankman-Fried Survived His Testimony. Next Up: The Jury,"More than 60 people lined up to watch Sam Bankman-Fried's fourth day of testimony, filling the single overflow room to the point extra chairs were set against the walls for some of the audience members.  After all that, Tuesday was a much quieter day than Monday. Bankman-Fried seems to have worked a bit on his responses, providing slightly tighter answers than he had on Monday when responding to Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon. Still, he maintained roughly the same tone he had earlier in the week, giving the impression that he did not want to be there (which, okay fair enough).  His problems resurfaced Tuesday with the second question, when Sassoon asked if he had hoped he could regain control of FTX immediately after it filed for bankruptcy, the once-highflying crypto exchange he founded that collapsed nearly a year ago. Bankman-Fried said regaining control wasn't a priority, leading to both Sassoon and the judge pointing out that wasn't the question.  However, when his own defense attorney Mark Cohen took over for a redirect examination, Bankman-Fried visibly relaxed. He was smiling when responding to Cohen's questions, made a joke at one point (about how a photo of him sleeping on a private jet wasn't the most flattering) and laughed at his attorney's jokes. It was a pretty stark contrast.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Cohen – as he has been doing – tried to contextualize some of Bankman-Fried's responses to Sassoon in an effort to provide alternative, more innocuous explanations for some of the problems the AUSA brought up.  There were two major gaps here: One was the fact that Bankman-Fried still hasn't addressed some of the more bewildering back-and-forths from Monday. And on Tuesday, Sassoon asked Bankman-Fried if he asked his lieutenants any questions about the $8 billion hole in the books of his Alameda Research hedge fund after he learned about it.  ""Just to be clear, it's your testimony that while you were Alameda's CEO, your employees were spending millions and then billions of customer funds without you knowing it?""  As with some of his responses on Monday, Bankman-Fried didn't really have a coherent response.  After lunch, the defense rested, prosecutors decided against bringing a rebuttal case and the court began its transition to phase three of the FTX founder's trial. Now there was room to spare. The courtroom looked empty. The overflow room had maybe a dozen people. The presentation of evidence is completed; the Department of Justice and defense have both called their final witnesses and as I write this, are preparing their closing arguments for the jury on Wednesday.  But first, we had a jury charge conference. I recapped it here but the short version: Judge Lewis Kaplan had a draft set of jury instructions, which he'll read out to the people who will try to decide if Bankman-Fried committed wire fraud or conspired to commit various other kinds of fraud. Attorneys with the DOJ and defense debated specific verbiage and precedents.  — Nikhilesh De  Courtroom scenes  Just over 60 people showed up by 9:00 a.m. ET Tuesday, down from 50ish on Monday and 100+ on Friday. Attendance figures will probably continue dropping now as it's unlikely that tourists or casual passers-by will want to sit and wait for the jury to reach a verdict.  Whoever's running the court's CCTV system, thank you for giving us that expanded view of the lawyers' tables. For everyone else: The monitors in the overflow room have a triple split view – the left half shows court exhibits, while the right half is usually split between two camera views showing us the witness stand and the lawyers/defendant.  A green alien exited the courthouse around lunchtime (check yesterday's date).  Robert De Niro apparently walked right by me and I didn't notice – though I can confirm he was indeed in the courthouse at 500 Pearl Street.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  The judge won't read the jury instructions out until Thursday at the earliest – both the DOJ and defense estimate they'll need around two or three hours to make their closing arguments (and the DOJ will have another rebuttal, which should take under an hour). Though the court day is technically seven hours long, almost two hours of that usually go toward breaks and lunch, so it's an open question whether everyone will finish their presentations Wednesday.  Accounting for that, it seems likely the jury won't begin deliberating the case until Thursday afternoon at the earliest. The parties are contemplating whether or not to ask the jury to show up Friday (right now scheduled as a day off from the trial), but it seems like we'll instead break until Monday after court wraps up tomorrow. This means that the six-week estimate for the trial may have been remarkably accurate.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/01/sam-bankman-fried-survived-his-testimony-next-up-the-jury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A safe haven asset is expected to retain or increase in value during periods of economic and political uncertainty. For decades, investors have treated government bonds, particularly those issued by the U.S. Treasury, as safe havens.  Recently, however, the Treasury bonds have failed to live up to their reputation.  At 4.9%, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note is at least ten basis points higher than where it was a day before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. In other words, the price of the 10-year note has declined, a sign of investors seeking safety in other assets. Bitcoin has risen 23% to $34,460 since Oct. 7.  “We haven’t seen the flight to quality of flight to safety that you would expect given what’s happening in the world,” El-Erian said, noting the uptick in the 10-year yield since the outbreak of tensions in the Middle East.  The Treasury bond market has seen higher volatility this year, with yields charting sharp two-way moves in recent weeks due to uncertain government bond auctions, concerns about the economy, federal debt and the Fed’s policy path.

19679578,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558553,1698827446,XRP Whale Transactions Spike To 3-Month High As Smart Money Buys,"XRP has witnessed a remarkable surge of over 29% in its value over the last 12 days. The price has risen from $0.4771 to a two and a half month high of $0.6209 yesterday. Sharks And Whales Make A Splash This impressive price hike coincides with an increase in whale transactions as well as the number of wallets holding more than 10,000 XRP (worth approx. $5,930), indicating heightened interest from retail investors as well as large investors, commonly referred to as “whales” in the crypto community. On-chain analytic firm Santiment shared via X (formerly known as Twitter), “XRP revisited a $0.60 market value for the first time since its tumble back on August 16th. Along this road back, we have seen whales get gradually more involved. Additionally, there are now an alltime high 277.62K wallets holding at least 10,000 XRP.” Santiment presented the below chart and stated that the ledger has shown a noticeable increase in the number of wallets holding 10,000 coins or more, with the current number exceeding 277.6K. Moreover, there has been a significant uptick in the volume of whale transactions, with those exceeding $1 million in value spiking to a 3-month high. To be precise, October 31, 2023, saw a total of 255 such high-value transactions. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Breakout Above Multi-Month Resistance: Next Targets The data by Santiment provides a clear visual representation of the increasing trend in XRP’s price, which is further underscored by the corresponding rise in large transactions and whale wallet count. With an evident increase in the activity of both ‘sharks’ and ‘whales’, the market seems to be attracting significant attention from big players. Remarkably, the most popular whale tracker on X has reported quite a few whale transactions in the last 24 hours. First of all, as usual for the 1st of the month, Ripple has released 1 billion XRP from the escrow account. Whale Alert reported 3 transactions of 500 million, 400 million and 100 million XRP. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction – A Strengthening Case For Rally Above $0.62 In addition, there were also other interesting transactions. Thus, Ripple transferred 50 million XRP (about $29.87 million) to an unknown wallet. 24.9 million tokens (about $14.9 million) were transferred from an unknown wallet to Bitstamp. Moreover, 30 million XRP (about $17.2 million) were transferred from Bybit to an unknown wallet. Smart Money Is Buying XRP Analyst Jaydee has turned his focus to the XRP/BTC chart, suggesting that discerning investors find more than just price ticks and candlesticks. He noted, “I’m paying more attention to the XRP/BTC chart. Smart money is respecting the multi-year trendline.” The multi-year trendline in the 1-week chart, accentuated by four touchpoints, has acted as a crucial support for the altcoin when paired against BTC. Every touch on this line has resulted in a significant price surge, emphasizing its role as a robust line of defense against bearish pressures. The chart further showcases dramatic price increases. At one point, a bullish rally catapulted the price by a staggering 415%. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Subsequent surges of 230%, 101%, and 60% followed, painting a picture of resilience and bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency against its Bitcoin counterpart. Yesterday, Jaydee drew attention to the recent bounce on the chart. He elaborated, “Look at that bounce on XRP/BTC chart! Looks like SMART MONEY are buying now while DUMB MONEY were buying the lawsuit narratives.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.5983.

Elmaani, 31, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, was also sentenced to one year of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $5.5 million, the estimated tax loss. Elmaani pleaded guilty in April 2023. He had initially been charged in 2020 separately by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Elmaani used a coin mixer to conceal the true destination of cryptocurrencies on the blockchain before transferring funds to family members and friends and then to himself, according to the DOJ.  The origins of the case go back to 2017 when Elmaani made “millions of dollars” from an initial coin offering of its pearl (PRL) cryptocurrency, but instead of reporting the income from sales, he falsified his tax return and then used $10 million in proceeds to buy multiple yachts (where he stored gold bars), real estate and home renovations.  “I stated in public forums that after the ICO, the supply of PRL would not increase, and that the smart contract that created PRL would be “locked,” Elmaani admitted in the plea agreement, according to the announcement. ""Contrary to these statements, on or about October 29, 2018, I used the smart contract to mint new PRL, without telling anyone, including others who worked on the Oyster Protocol project.”  “Amir Elmaani violated the duty he owed to pay taxes on millions of dollars of cryptocurrency profits, and he also violated the trust of investors in the cryptocurrency he founded,"" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.

Notably, THORChain has emerged as the standout performer, demonstrating significant strength by surging over 5% in value within the last day, and an impressive 34% increase over the course of the week. Related Reading: Cardano Experiences Decline In Q3 Network Activity – Unraveling The Root Cause RUNE Soars Over 270%: A Thrilling Journey Of Value Surge Recently, the RUNE token on THORChain has seen a tremendous ascent. It started off on a fantastic trajectory, rising from a low of just under $0.80 on June 14 to a solid high of $2.90 today—a phenomenal 270% gain. A reversal from a descending triangle, which gained significant traction around August 15, was the catalyst for this advance. Despite some ups and downs coming up to October 20th, the token managed to gain another 80%. This surge in value stands as a testament to the robustness of THORChain’s RUNE token, buoyed not only by the impressive price momentum but also by an evident surge in trading volume. RUNE has advanced from its lowest level this year, making the token among the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the world.

Chart: TradingView.com THORChain: Impending Breakout And The $10 Target This increased trading activity not only substantiates the upward trend but also underscores a burgeoning confidence among buyers, emphasizing a collective belief in driving the coin towards even greater heights. Captain Faibik, a well-known analyst in the cryptocurrency space with an impressive following of almost 68,000 on the X platform, recently made an observation that caught our attention: there may be an impending breakout in the price of RUNE, indicating the possibility of substantial movement in the near future. $RUNE is approaching Major Trendline and Horizontal Resistance. If it Successfully Breaks out, we might Expect a Significant Bullish Rally in the Midterm.#Crypto #RUNE #RUNEUSDT pic.twitter.com/efZR6e0rcM — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) October 31, 2023 Based on the analyst’s possible breakout scenario, a big bullish upswing could happen if the RUNE price breaks through its current horizontal support level. The possible rise in price of THORChain could push it toward a major milestone, with a goal of reaching $10 during the rush. RUNE: Breaking Resistance And The $3 Billion Milestone Breaking through this resistance level is a key turning point that could cause prices to rise by a huge amount, indicating a bullish trend that could push THORChain’s price close to a major threshold. The achievement of $3 billion in on-chain trade volume on major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is one noteworthy milestone that is contributing to the price increase, along with several other basic variables. This significant growth raises questions about the rally’s sustainability. Could the price go through $3 and rise even farther, or is it already at its breaking point? Congrats @THORChain October is officially the first $3b on chain trading volume & it entered the top 5 DEX list Streaming swaps was the catalyst needed for adoption Here’s a few observations 🔽 pic.twitter.com/WGCOLNVLgD — TCB (@THORmaximalist) October 30, 2023 Meanwhile, the network processed over $3 billion in on-chain transactions this month, setting new records. This holds significance due to the network’s substantial volume of $2.3 billion only in the third quarter. During this period, it generated a total of $3.38 million in fees. This indicates that THORChain is experiencing an increasing level of popularity and adoption among its user base.

The FATF’s ""gray list” is seen as a reprimand to address strategic deficiencies in regimes to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.

Options are derivative contracts, offering the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call or a bullish bet gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.  The demand for higher strike price call options has recently increased, with bitcoin rallying nearly 27% in the past four weeks. That has left market makers with a significant net short gamma exposure above $36,000, according to data tracked by Amberdata and Galaxy Digital. Options gamma is the rate that delta will change based on a $1 change in bitcoin’s price. Delta measures the sensitivity of options prices to the change in bitcoin's price.  When market makers or dealers are net short gamma, they buy the underlying asset in the spot market as its value increases to stick to their mandate of maintaining an overall delta or market-neutral exposure. The hedging activity often accelerates the rally, often called a “gamma squeeze,” and likely played a role in BTC’s recent quick ascent from $30,000 to $35,000.  “If BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-$36,000, options dealers will need to buy $20 million in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levels,” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, said on X.  Dealers or market makers are entities tasked with creating order book liquidity and are always on the opposite side of investors’ trades. They make money through the bid-ask spread and always strive to maintain a direction-neutral portfolio.  The present positioning of market makers and its expected impact on the spot price contrasts the situation early this year when market makers were net long gamma and bought low and sold high in the spot/futures market to keep their books neutral.

While certain metrics presented a less-than-stellar picture, there are emerging indicators that suggest the potential for a positive turnaround. In this article, we look into Cardano’s Q3 performance, examining stagnant metrics, the impact they have had, and the potential price direction that could shape its future. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Big Leap? ‘Promising’ Indicators To Watch The Impact Of Stagnant Metrics In the realm of cryptocurrencies, metrics play a crucial role in determining the health and vitality of a blockchain network. Cardano’s performance in Q3, as shown in Messari’s analysis, revealed some concerning trends, albeit not entirely bleak. The average transaction fee on the Cardano network, denominated in US dollars, saw a 29.9% decrease, dropping from $0.13 to $0.10, suggesting a reduction in the cost of network usage. Source: Messari One of the more significant concerns was the decline in daily active addresses. Between July and September, the average count of daily active addresses plummeted by 29%, from the 58,000 recorded during the year’s second quarter to 41,137. This decline raises questions about the network’s ability to maintain user engagement and activity levels. Fees denominated in Cardano’s native token, ADA, also fell by 3% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), indicating that users may have been transacting with smaller amounts of ADA due to lower fees. Furthermore, the network’s revenue took a hit, falling by a substantial 30%, which could raise concerns about its overall financial stability. Related Reading: Artificial Intelligence Crypto Boom: What’s Behind The Double-Digit Surge? ADA market cap currently at $10.161 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Cardano’s Chart Signals Optimism Amidst the stagnant metrics and challenges faced in Q3, Cardano’s chart on TradingView paints a different narrative, hinting at the potential for an upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Cardano is on an upward trajectory, approaching the overbought territory. While this might typically be seen as a signal for a potential pullback, it should be considered in the context of Cardano’s recent price performance and external factors. The moving averages on the chart provide further cause for optimism. After a period of sideways movement, the price appears to be making an effort to break above the long-term resistance trendline. This, combined with the formation of higher lows on the chart, creates a potentially bullish scenario, suggesting that Cardano may be gearing up for a significant price move. Source: Messari Potential Price Direction As of the most recent data from CoinGecko, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.290817. In the last 24 hours, the price experienced a dip of 3.8%, while over the past seven days, it saw a 2.8% rise. These short-term price movements indicate a level of volatility and uncertainty in the market.

19671927,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558509,1698807611,"Solana Flying, Bulls Reverse Post-FTX Collapse Losses But SOL Analysts Cautious","SOL, the primary currency of Solana, is one of the top-performing coins in the top 10, according to CoinMarketCap, a crypto tracker. According to data on October 31, SOL is changing hands above $36, trending at 2023 highs, reversing all post-FTX collapse, which saw the coin tumble to as low as $8 in Q4 2023 before recovering steadily over the past 11 months to spot rates. Solana Flies 150% To Reverse Post-FTX Losses At present prices, SOL is up more than 150% from November 2022 lows. At this pace, SOL is outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), whose prices have also rallied by over 100% from 2022 lows. Looking at the daily chart, SOL is within a bullish breakout formation, trending above the July 2023 high of around $32. Notably, the leg up is with rising trading volume, suggesting that optimistic traders possibly support the uptrend. Related Reading: Ripple Partner’s Staggering XRP Holdings Revealed, Do They Know Something You Don’t? Besides expanding trading volume, bull bars are riding the upper Bollinger Bands (BB), diverging from the middle BB, indicating that the uptrend momentum is also high and may support prices. BB is a technical indicator for measuring price volatility. Whenever either band diverges from the middle BB, the underlying volatility is high, as with Solana at spot rates. The bankruptcy of FTX triggered the SOL plunge in November 2022. The exchange was one of the most popular before collapsing after it emerged that its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, had misappropriated user funds. Bankruptcy Trustee Free To Sell SOL, Why Did They Stake? FTX, through its subsidiaries, was one of the largest holders of SOL. Therefore, when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in early November 2022, it had a ripple effect on the broader Solana ecosystem, forcing SOL prices lower. FTX holds roughly 16% of the SOL outstanding supply worth over $1 billion and over $500 million BTC. According to a ruling by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in September, FTX can begin selling and investing its crypto holdings to repay creditors. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone In mid-October, the FTX estate staked 5.5 million SOL. According to on-chain data, coins were staked via Figment, a platform leveraged mainly by institutional investors. By staking SOL, the FTX estate, which a bankruptcy trustee manages, is bullish on the coin since it has the option, as directed by the court, to liquidate it at any time. Moreover, by staking, the estate will receive more SOL. Even so, Nansen’s report on October 31 shows that the FTX estate unstaked 1.6 million SOL. It remains unclear if they will be sent to exchanges for liquidation, potentially lowering prices.

The controversy arose following Bitget’s listing of TokenFi (TOKEN) and subsequent accusations of market manipulation, unauthorized listing, and insufficient solvency. Bitget Faces Allegations Of Market Manipulation On October 27, 2023, Bitget announced the listing of TokenFi (TOKEN) in the Innovation Zone of its Spot market. Shortly after the trading service for TokenFi commenced, significant price fluctuations were observed, prompting suspicions of market manipulation. Concerns were further raised when it was discovered that TokenFi’s project team had contributed less than $2,000 worth of tokens to the liquidity pool of decentralized exchanges (DEXes), suggesting potential manipulation of initial liquidity. Moreover, an investigation of the TokenFi project uncovered additional issues, including an “opaque” token economy and an unclear vesting schedule. In light of these findings and to safeguard their users, Bitget decided to delist TokenFi (TOKEN) and initiated a buyback plan for users who held the token on its platform. Related Reading: Ripple Partner’s Staggering XRP Holdings Revealed, Do They Know Something You Don’t? Floki Inu, responded strongly to the exchange’s actions, alleging that Bitget had violated their agreement not to list TOKEN until seven days after its launch. The meme coin protocol claimed to have had conversations with “several Tier 1 exchanges” and respected parties in the cryptocurrency industry. While these exchanges had expressed interest in listing TOKEN earlier, they agreed to honor Floki Inu’s request to wait for the stipulated period. However, Bitget, which, according to Floki Inu, was “the smallest exchange” among those involved, allegedly announced the listing of a fake version of the TOKEN token just 12 minutes before the official launch on the blockchain. Floki Inu further asserted that Bitget had engaged in “deceptive trading practices,” manipulating TOKEN’s volume without evidence of holding the actual tokens. The protocol alleges that Bitget’s initial announcement had even stated that withdrawals would open 24 hours after trading began, potentially indicating an attempt to manipulate the token’s price. However, the market response did not align with Bitget’s expectations, resulting in a significant financial loss. The situation escalated when users began reporting difficulties in withdrawing TOKEN from Bitget’s platform, with some users allegedly being banned for complaints. Floki Inu claimed to have contacted Bitget to address the issue, but the response was unsatisfactory, including a request to report liquidity issues to Bitget’s support team. Floki Inu Alleges Bad Faith Following subsequent discussions between Floki Inu and Bitget, it was revealed that Bitget required up to 1 billion TokenFi tokens to meet user withdrawal demands and cover their financial deficit. According to Floki’s response, this amounted to approximately 10% of TokenFi’s total supply, equivalent to around $20 million at the time of Bidget’s statement. Furthermore, the protocol accused Bitget of acting in “bad faith” and attempting to resolve the situation through an over-the-counter (OTC) deal at a deeply discounted rate. The proposed discount of 90% from the market price raised concerns, as it was argued that Bitget should bear the responsibility for its actions and the resulting financial shortfall. In response to Bitget’s announcement of delisting TokenFi and accusations of market manipulation, Floki Inu disputed the claims made by Bitget. They asserted that Bitget had listed the token against their explicit instructions and falsely accused the Floki Inu team of price manipulation. Floki also challenged Bitget to provide verifiable evidence of their TOKEN and FLOKI holdings, expressing concerns about Bitget’s overall solvency and risk management practices. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone Ultimately, the protocol cautioned its users against trading or holding FLOKI on Bitget, citing the “troubling patterns” witnessed during the TokenFi incident. As the situation develops, the cryptocurrency community awaits further clarification and resolution regarding the allegations and the impact on affected users. Given these developments, FLOKI has experienced a retracement of over 9% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00003250. Nonetheless, the token has seen an impressive 85% increase over the past fourteen days.

19668954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558462,1698800406,A Chat With Dave Weisberger: Why Bitcoin Entered A “Perfect Storm”,"The price of Bitcoin might be losing bullish momentum in the short term, but on higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency is likely to extend its current rally. At least, this is part of what we spoke with Dave Weisberger, co-founder and co-CEO at CoinRoutes, a liquidity and algorithmic trading tool provider for the crypto market. Related Reading: Trader Who Bought Dogecoin In 2017 Maps Out Meteoric 37500% Rise To $26 As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $34,200 with a 2% loss in the last 24 hours. As the bullish momentum seems to fade, some analysts expect BTC to return to the critical support area of around $33,000. This area must hold if BTC bulls want to prevent a more extensive correction. Bitcoin Becoming Digital Gold, Low Selling, And The Potential For 20x Profits On the back of the current macroeconomic landscape, Bitcoin has become more relevant as a global financial asset, a store-of-value, and “gold 2.0,” according to CoinRoutes’ co-founder. Weisberger has been sharing his bullish thesis on cryptocurrency and the impact of the spot market on the current rally. During our conversation, we spoke about the Israel conflict, the current market structure, and the reasons brewing a perfect storm for BTC. This is what he told us: Q: With a delicate situation in Israel, high inflation, and talks about a potential economic recession, How is the current macroeconomic landscape impacting the Bitcoin price? A: I think that the easiest way to look at it is to understand the famous quote from Ram Emanuel when you’re in the government, never let a good emergency go to waste. The fact is I don’t believe the Federal Reserve and the treasury have a whole lot of choice anymore. There’s really only one way out of the current macro environment in a real sense. They effectively have two choices. Door number one is to deregulate like crazy, cut taxes like crazy and hope to grow your way out of it. Choice number two is choose the Japanese approach, which is to manage the yield curve to allow the government to continue to function and kick the can down the road so it’s somebody else’s problem later. I actually, I think that there are a couple of candidates that talk about doing door number one, but none of them are in power and none of them are likely to win. And even if they did win, they’re unlikely to have the congressional support to do the massive amount of deregulation it would take to lean into AI and digital assets and all the new technologies that will allow for a growth rate to be able to grow tax receipts while cutting spending on government programs and government bureaucracy. That seems highly, highly, highly unlikely. It’s what I would do, but I don’t think it’s going to be done. So then you’re stuck in a situation where you have a current administration that is continuing to add spending. James Lavish quotes, I think $1.6 trillion in new debt. It’s a $2 trillion yearly deficit. At the same time that debt service is approaching a trillion dollars and that’s at sub 5%. What happens if we get a normal yield curve with a 2% upward slope to 7% at that point, debt service would literally be debt service plus even a cut defense department would literally be the entire amount of tax receipts. So if you think about that, there is no escaping the debt spiral that we’re in. The fact is all roads lead to monetary debasement. Now whether rates are high or low, that’s an interesting question. Maybe they’ll keep short rates high to try to put the genie back in the bottle. But the fact is the Bitcoin prices is responsive to the overall amount of money, monetary aggregates and debt. And Bitcoin is quite literally growing into digital gold. And digital gold. If you look at the monetary aggregates or monetary value of gold would imply a Bitcoin price. That’s 15 to 20 times where it currently is. So when you look at Bitcoin at 34,000, it’s like, okay, it’s well bid there and we’ve seen it over the last few days. When Larry Fink started making this case a few months ago, a couple months ago, it triggered a massive rally. Well now we have Mohamed El-Erian making this case one of the most widely respected bond analysts and just yesterday, Stanley Druckenmiller making this case. So you’re starting to get a shift in the opinion leaders of the economy to say this (BTC) is a hedge against a looming fiscal disaster debt disaster. At some point, Bitcoin will reach a tipping point. Now your question was about the Israel situation. The fact of the matter is ever since Napoleon, the world knows entering a two front war is probably not going to go well for your fiscal policy. Q: From a broader perspective, how do the dynamics between spot buying and derivatives trading impact the overall health and sustainability of a potential crypto bull run? Do you think BTC is poised for further profits? A: Look at CoinRoutes. Our client volumes almost doubled in October compared to September when there’s any interest in this market, liquidity comes out. There’s an old expression in trading; order flow begets order flow, liquidity begets liquidity. The fact is the crypto markets function extraordinarily well. The fact of the matter is sometimes the volatility in crypto happens because there’s too much speculation around the edges because perpetual swaps are a much more efficient way of getting leverage than option markets are, for example, and the US people in equities use options to get leverage. It’s much more expensive than perpetual swaps. So the crypto market has this dynamic of a small percentage of the actual liquidity speculating in perpetual swaps around the edges and moves. Things like what we saw this (past weeks) when there was the (Bitcoin ETF) fake news event. It’s kind of funny, the fake news event took Bitcoin from $28,000 to $31,000 in a blink all in the perpetual swaps markets. The spot market moved, but it wasn’t a lot of trading going on because it went up and came right back down. But a funny thing happened, people who were short realized, “oh my god, if this news does come out, I’m going to get carried out in a body bag. I better not short it.” So the natural spot buying that was going on became relentless and pushed the price to now we’re well beyond what are we, 25% above where it was before that fake news story came out. (…) it basically proves that it was spot buying, not derivative buying because when derivative buying or derivative selling creates a market move, you see gaps in where the perpetual swap gets to be too expensive or much cheaper. When we saw that, if you remember the move down from $29,000 to $26,000 a few months ago, that was a fast five-minute move that move featured perpetual swap prices over a thousand dollars per Bitcoin below the bid on spot markets. And so that was obviously a single de-leveraging event, and that happens and you see it. But what happened last Monday was clearly spot-led because the premium never moved. I mean, it literally never moved. It was moved. The spot actually market led the derivative markets higher. And so there are clearly spot buyers and what’s going on is something that I’ve been chronicling for about eight months, which is we’ve had patient spot accumulation and you can see that in two ways. If you look at the way things lined up over the last few weeks, the speculators got carried out and saw that in a rally there were no sellers. Well, that’s really scary. If you’re short, you have the condition for what some people would call a God candle. I don’t know about a God candle or otherwise. I think that the most bullish thing Bitcoin can do is stabilize at this level for another few weeks (…). We had seven months of no volatility in that period of time. People levered up on the short side and that’s why this move was so strong. Q: You mentioned this earlier in your analysis, but can you tell us why Bitcoin entered a “Perfect Storm” scenario? A: I wouldn’t call it a perfect storm because US regulators are still trying to shut down crypto because crypto is ultimately, it’s not really crypto, it’s digital assets. They’re trying to shut it down, slow it down, and stop it from overtaking the incumbents in finance. The fact is the US has the number one capital markets in the world. 50% of investible assets are here despite being what 4% of the world’s population that is on the back of having the most efficient analog financial system. So the incumbents would love to delay digitalization or co-opt it. So that’s the one thing that’s going on that’s not perfect. But the perfect storm aspects of it are overseas. So yesterday the UK came out and basically said, listen, “if you’re going to let us be the global hub for digital finance, we’re going to be (…).” And that is more or less exactly what happened and why the London became the big financial center. It is because of the Eurodollar market, because US regulators pushed the Eurodollar market out of the US and of course it became headquartered in London. So history may not often repeat, but it does rhyme and we see that. But take the regulation to the side, the perfect storm is very simple. It’s burgeoning deficits and monetary debasement on a global scale (…). (…) fiat currencies have never in financial history ended with anything other than debasement ever, because governments who have the ability to print money out of thin air will do so until the market stops them. It is becoming more and more evident to anybody that the fiat experiment of Bretton Woods, which started in 1971, which isn’t very long in monetary epoch, is coming to an end. Now, will it come to an end now or could we extend it for another 10 to 15 years? Maybe 20? Yeah, maybe. But if you do that, then what’s going to happen (…). Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Breakout Above Multi-Month Resistance: Next Targets So if you think about a perfect storm, we have an emerging digital society that’s more and more global every day. We need a store of value that people can save in. They want to spend in dollars. And that’s why Tether and stable coins are so important, but they want to save in something that’s a store of value. Bitcoin solves the part of the equation that’s saving not spending. That’s why, yeah, at some point you need the scaffolding to be able to spend the bits or lightning or whatever to be able to spend Bitcoin, but not at these levels. If you’re a Bitcoin holder, why are you buying a cup of coffee with Bitcoin? You want to be made fun of, like the pizza guy, doesn’t make sense because you think it’s going to go up 20, 30 or more times. That makes it a very expensive cup of coffee. So, Bitcoin is a savings vehicle and stable coins are a spending vehicle, and Ethereum is a technology platform to allow the world to go more and more digital. And so all of these things are happening and the meta trends are all for them. The macro trends in the economy are all for monetary debasement and trying to get out of a debt spiral. And the more geopolitical instability, the more likely that debt spiral is to materialize.

Dmitry Noskov On Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement The crypto analyst predictions were fueled by the current growth of the cryptocurrency market due to the forthcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024. He highlighted that the market growth will continue to grow till the end of the year, and Ethereum is set to grow with it. Related Reading: Analysts Give Their Latest Ethereum Price Predictions “We can say that the cryptocurrency market is now on a wave of growth, which may continue until the end of the year. The target for Ethereum before the new year may be $1800-$1900. It can also break the psychological level of $2,000,” Noskov stated. Dmitry’s recent ETH predictions can also be traced back to the excitement and propaganda from the cryptocurrency community and the positive development encompassing a potential approval of Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “The positive developments around the potential approval of a Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) have boosted other cryptocurrencies, including ETH,” Noskov stated. Dmitry Noskov is not the only one who has shared projections on the price of Ethereum by the end of the year. Several other analysts have also shed light on their optimism about how Ethereum is expected to finish the year. In July, finance platform Finder sought 32 fintech and cryptocurrency analysts for them to offer their year-end price predictions for Ethereum. From the details shared with Finbold, the experts believe that the digital asset will finish the year at $2,451, presenting over 30% price surge from the current price of Ethereum.

Shah also believes that the digital asset is the exceptional second choice of investment for institutional and ordinary investors alike. “Ethereum remains the standout second choice investment for both the retail and institutional investors alike. Following the successful upgrade to proof of stake, akin to “changing a jet plane engine, mid-flight,” ETH has become more efficient and deflationary, to mention a few,” Shah stated. Lately, the cryptocurrency has garnered momentum, slowly heading toward the $1850 resistance level. The digital asset is set to go higher if it crosses the $1850 resistance level. Ethereum is currently sitting at approximately $1797 as of the time of writing.
