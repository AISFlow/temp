42378018,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrsX,1424386824,Vermont Finance Commissioner: We Don't Need a BitLicense,"Though a number US states have recently introduced measures that would allow bitcoin to become accepted as payment, Vermont came into the spotlight this week for a different reason – its decision to abruptly shut down the state’s only bitcoin ATM.    While the machines operators, New York-based PYC, have tried to paint the state as out of touch with innovation, the state’s Department of Financial Regulation is seeking to set the record straight that it’s anything but.    In a new interview, Commissioner Susan Donegan described digital currencies as “not a new issue” for the small New England state, which she contends has met with “a handful” of such businesses in recent years that have received licenses, or have pending licenses, to operate.  Donegan told CoinDesk:  “We’re open and having those conversations and if going through that process is either too daunting or doesn't fit into someone’s philosophy, they should rethink being in this business. This is money. We don’t allow folks to go without some sort of oversight.”  Perhaps most notably, Donegan suggested that, unlike regulators in New York and California, Vermont already has existing laws under which digital currency businesses can be regulated.  Donegan pointed to Title 8, Chapter 79 or the Vermont Statutes, dealing with money services. Particularly, she emphasized a passage that covers “monetary value evidenced by digital record”, a definition the state strongly believes captures bitcoin services.  “I believe that bitcoin fits within the definition of stored value. Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, but it’s evidenced by electronic record. Without that electronic record there’s no tangible record, so it does exist on that record,” Donegan said, adding:  ”We’re pretty clearly within the statute of a money transmitter.”  Rules of the road  Donegan went on to describe herself as supportive of innovation, noting her belief that PYC and the media have dragged some more prominent digital currency startups into the controversy surrounding the ATM shutdown.  “The concern is that a different company – I think the company was named Coinbase – that they were not licensed or should be licensed,” she said. “I know that Coinbase is licensed in quite a few states. It’s not something that I think a serious company is going to put up a fuss, they know the rules of the road.”  Vermont, Donegan said, isn’t the only state that has taken an approach that emphasizes face-to-face interaction. She described the licensing process as one where digital currency businesses sit down with the state to discuss their business plan.  Factors that are considered for determination include whether the company executives have past criminal convictions, whether the business is audited or whether other states have licensed the entity. Should the business satisfy all requirements, Donegan said a license is granted.  “We make sure companies have a say, and if there’s a public good, then they’re free to start work. It’s not a particularly onerous process, but it’s one that we feel satisfies the kind of oversight we want to see for any money transmission operation,” she added.  Bitcoin as monetary value  At issue in the interpretation by PYC may have been that bitcoin is not defined as money under Vermont state law, and that, due to the fact that bitcoins never leave the blockchain, no funds are sent in a traditional sense.  However, Donegan clarified that she believes it is captured under the definition of monetary value, even if it's not a currency or money.  “I like to think that when this statue was written it was a little ahead of its time, all of those definitions are already baked into the statues,” Donegan said.  Still, she stressed that Vermont doesn’t intend to send a hostile message, even if it’s been forced on the defensive by its relative lack of public statements on the issue.  Rather, Donegan indicated that the licenses and regulation are important for the industry, especially given that it continues to struggle with fraud and theft.  “The message that has been out there is come talk to us, let us know what your plans are and we can talk you through the process,” Donegan concluded.

With the launch, Stripe is now allowing any merchant in its network with a US dollar bank account to accept bitcoin. Integration for merchants is made possible through either its API or as part of its Checkout feature.  A representative for Stripe told CoinDesk that its beta test had delivered promising results, and as part of the testing merchants within Stripe's network received both domestic and international payments.  The spokesperson noted:    ""While in beta, Stripe merchants accepted bitcoin transactions from more than 60 countries so we're excited to see what's next.""          San Francisco-based Stripe has been moving slowly towards full bitcoin integration, as company executives including CTO Greg Brockman have opined in the past on the technology's potential.  ""It really comes down to the the way that we, Stripe, want to be the universal payment infrastructure of the web,"" he told CoinDesk during an interview last June. ""As part of that, bitcoin is really interesting as something that helps spread that, that helps connect this archipelago of different financial systems.""  Stripe began testing bitcoin payments in March 2014, when it worked on an integration with online data backup service Tarsnap. The company plans to charge a 0.5% fee for each transaction.  The announcement follows Stripe's beta completion in December. At the time, Stripe said it expected to launch its full service in January.

42378022,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrwJ,1424371529,Report: Mt Gox Data Provides More Clues to Trading Bot 'Willy',"Tokyo-based security firm WizSec has released a preliminary analysis of suspicious trading data leaked from now defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  The exchange suspended its operations in February last year and was subsequently declared bankrupt in March, having lost around 850,000 BTC (more than $450m at the time).  Since last November, bitcoin exchange Kraken has worked alongside authorities to support the investigation on behalf of creditors. Meanwhile, WizSec has been working to track Mt Gox's bitcoin transactions in an unofficial capacity.  WizSec's release follows the Willy Report, the report that an anonymous researcher published last May, which alleges suspicious trading activity at Mt Gox. It concluded that trading bots ran rampant through the system under various user IDs, including one dubbed ""Willy"" that placed repetitive buy-only orders that always manipulated the price upward.  Another bot, dubbed ""Markus"", appears to have bought and sold at random prices, paying no trading fees. Both bots were most active immediately before and during November 2013, when bitcoin's price suddenly rocketed.  By November 2013, the two bots had bought a total of 570,000 BTC – enough to have impacted the price.  Data analysis  WizSec's report, released Saturday, uses the data leaked from Mt Gox in early 2013 to provide greater insight into how Willy and its operator(s) worked.  The firm says its analysis was originally completed six months ago as a means to introduce the exchange's trustee and other investigators, including the police, to its work. The information it has divulged is ""safe"" and will not impact the ongoing Mt Gox investigation or its various non-disclosure agreements, WizSec says, but may provide some long-awaited clarity for creditors.  From September to November 2013 Willy had a significant impact at Mt Gox, trading over 250,000 BTC, according to the report.  As the graph below indicates, the bot frequently accounted for more than 30% of hourly trades on the platform. On a few instances Willy reached 80-90%.  But did this trading volume impact bitcoin's price during this time? WizSec says it is highly probable that the bot's behaviour had a ""large effect"", adding:  ""[It opens] up the possibility that this may have been a plan to manipulate the market rather than – or in addition to – fraudulently acquiring bitcoins.""  The firm cites incidents where the market has ""corrected"" itself to a lower price level following Willy's absence.  The leaked data ends on 30th November. The influence of Willy and fraudulent trading past this point remains up for speculation.  Strict parameters  By reconstructing the bot's trade orders, the firm observed that Willy operated over several different accounts. Each of these worked within strict parameters with regards to how much bitcoin could be bought with each order.  As the rising price of bitcoin continued, Willy was reconfigured to buy smaller amounts, in order not ""to drain each account's deposit of USD funds too quickly"".  However, WizSec also noticed the presence of ""certain anomalous, high volume orders"" that fall outside the parameter for automatic trading, seen circled below.  These high orders, it says, were characterised by even amounts and would change to more ""random-looking values"".  For this reason, the firm believes that these trading orders were issued manually. At a later point, Willy's controller may also have deliberately used random-looking values to detract attention from these big orders.  Profiling Willy  Using timestamps, the team found that an absence of activity between 17:00 and 20:00 UTC could point to the operator's sleep cycle and location. The firm used Japan Standard Time (JST) as a frame of reference and plotted all suspected Willy events against the time of day in the following graph:  This pattern could indicate that the suspected user is an irregular sleeper, or that there are actually two or more users.  The data also shows greater activity on weekdays, leading the firm to believe that it is more specifically related to work days, and thus an employed person, WizSec says.  The long spread of hours also hints that Willy's operator may have had access at both home and work. The bot was known to operate during periods when other users had no access to Mount Gox's system, indicating internal influence.  Long road ahead  WizSec says that there are still a few issues that require further investigation. The security consulting firm has yet to find out how such large amounts of currency could have been deposited at the exchange without raising alarm bells.  More information is also needed with regards to what happened to the bitcoins bought by Willy, as well as the USD that ""reverse Willy"" had accumulated in February.  Willy's purpose is also unclear. More clarity is needed to decipher whether it was simply a buying tool or whether it attempted to manipulate the market price.  There are also questions around Willy's location and whether it was running in Mt Gox's internal network or in connection with it.  Finally, WizSec says it is still investigating the role that Willy played in the events leading to the collapse of Mt Gox and urges anyone with information relating to the case to come forward.  ""We have been gathering pieces to the puzzle for a long time, and every piece helps,"" it said.

42378023,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrxZ,1424365374,Xapo Bids for Big Bitcoin Business With Enterprise Security Suite,"Bitcoin services provider Xapo has announced the launch of Xapo Institutions, a suite of products aimed at capturing a potentially lucrative customer base that includes businesses, bitcoin exchanges, hedge funds and institutional investors.  Institutions  launches today with a treasury management system that Xapo contends will empower organisations to better manage bitcoin through permissions and privileges that can help protect large bitcoin holdings from miscues and misconduct.  The treasury controls allow users to structure and organize accounts into an array of wallets and vaults, and then control which parties have access to funds.  Chief strategy officer (CSO) Ted Rogers positioned the announcement as a larger step forward for the company, one that he argues finds Xapo building on its basic infrastructure of products like multi-signature wallets and deep cold storage for the first time.  Rogers told CoinDesk:  ”We started out focusing on building the most secure place to store bitcoin, now we’re evolving from that into providing more customized tools that are essential for organisations.”  The new tool suite will be available free of charge, Rogers said, adding that Xapo wanted to ensure users can begin to feel comfortable with both bitcoin and its management system, stating that “revenue models will come as the industry matures”.  The news follows Xapo's release of consumer-facing security offerings it debuted in January.  No more physical processes  Rogers indicated that Xapo’s new treasury management system will solve problems for existing clients today, removing their need to go through physical in-person processes to initiate transactions.  Xapo  , he said, built the product in part to better manage its own bitcoin holdings, and that it has a new institutional client team dedicated to migrating new customers to its service.  Calling the tool simpler and more transparent, Rogers said the product is a response to institutional clients who found earlier fund management processes problematic. As an example of the change, Rogers explained that the treasury management system now allows users to control and automate permissions for bitcoin accounts.  “You can add someone or multiple people to initiate transactions, and then you add people to approve transactions over a certain limit and set others who have only view-only privileges,” Rogers said.  He went on to frame the product as most useful to bitcoin-only institutions today, though he hoped the product would be appealing to organisations that are new to the ecosystem as well.  'Intuitive' container  The Xapo Institutions dashboard features a bright and straightforward design, with wallets organized and color-coded for users.  One area of particular focus, Rogers said, was withdrawals from other institutional vault services, which he described as requiring confirmation from parties hours after the transaction.  ""If you’re involving a lot of people it can get complex, so we had to simplify that process as much as possible,"" Rogers noted.  The result is that now the service sends 'action required' emails to involved parties, allowing them to confirm or stop the request.  Need for new solutions  Rogers further spoke of the need for products built for an institutional client base, citing the recent string of hacks in the bitcoin space.  The former investor called the use of consumer tools by institutions a “big issue”, and pointed to the recent incidents as evidence for the need for institutional products, saying:  “Some of the hacks that are happening are driving home the point that ‘Hey, we need to focus on our core business and let Xapo handle the secure storage of bitcoin'.""  Echoing other business-to-business companies in the space, Rogers called on the industry, even those who may compete against Xapo in other verticals, to recognize that security is now something they must consider outsourcing to capable partners.  For those who want to migrate to the service, Rogers pitched Xapo’s team as capable of guiding users through the transition.  “It’s not very complex but it is something that, when you’re dealing with large amounts of bitcoin, you want to make sure you’re holding people’s hands as much as they need and want,” he added.  Creative applications  Going further, Rogers suggested that the treasury management system is a “baseline product” one that could one day expand in “creative ways”.  Rogers speculated this might include using fiat currencies secured to a blockchain, but said such discussions, while possible, are still in very early stages.  ""We’ll be expanding it as the industry evolves,"" he said.

42378057,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LrmF,1424360108,Dell Expands Bitcoin Payments to UK and Canada,"UPDATE (19th February, 2015 17:00 GMT): Updated with comment from Dell CIO Paul Walsh.      Dell has announced it has expanded its bitcoin payments program to consumers in the UK and Canada.  The announcement was revealed today at eTail West, an annual e-commerce conference, during a keynote address by CIO Paul Walsh.  In remarks, Walsh suggested that the decision was prompted by customer demand and the positive feedback the company had so far received for its US offering.  Walsh said:  “We’re hearing from our customers around the world that they want the option to use bitcoin when buying Dell products, so we are excited to deliver bitcoin as a payment method on Dell.com to our customers in Canada and the UK.”  Dell has been accepting bitcoin for purchases via its US store since July 2014. The company will continue to receive local currency from Coinbase in exchange for bitcoin orders, in this case GBP and the Canadian dollar.  Earning $56.9bn in revenue in 2013, Dell remained the largest merchant in the bitcoin space until December when it was replaced by tech giant Microsoft.  The news also follows the decision by e-commerce leader Overstock to expand its bitcoin payment option to global consumers, though it has since reported struggles encouraging international customers to use bitcoin.  Choice and flexibility  Speaking to CoinDesk, Walsh elaborated on the news stressing that bitcoin's ability to provide consumers with added choice and flexibility was key to Dell's decision to expand the payments program.  Walsh noted that since accepting the program, bitcoin has become a popular purchasing tool for both consumers as well as business customers. ""We’re seeing purchases across our full product spectrum,"" he noted.  He indicated that Dell would not be launching any special promotions for bitcoin users, but said future offers would be posted to Dell.com.  Above all, however, he was positive in his comments about bitcoin as a payment method, adding:  ""We will offer bitcoin as long as our customers demand it – it is one method of payment available to them to make purchasing products and solutions from Dell easier and meet them on their terms.""

The UK and Lithuania-based company indicated the iOS app is designed to appeal to existing Apple customers who had previously used its desktop service, but turned to other wallet providers for on-the-go purchases and trading.  SpectroCoin CEO Vytautas Karalevičius told CoinDesk:  “It makes SpectroCoin more of a one-stop shop, as there is no need for third-party mobile apps. Also, differently from most apps, clients can have both EUR and BTC wallets on their phone.”  Karalevičius indicated that SpectroCoin is working on automatic buying and selling functionality, but that users can send and receive bitcoin, and check their balances using the app today.  The full suite of apps is available in both English and Lithuanian.  Diversifying services  The iOS app launch comes as SpectroCoin seeks to diversify its market approach, delving into new verticals both in and outside of the bitcoin space.  For example, SpectroCoin recently launched a referral and voucher program that allows other businesses to resell its services for a commission, as well as add-ons for e-commerce platforms such as Drupal and OpenCart.  Most notable, perhaps, is its SpectroCard service, a virtual prepaid MasterCard that Karalevičius framed as targeting online shoppers in Europe more broadly, adding:  “At this point in the company lifecycle, we’re trying to grab as many clients who are paying online as possible.”  Images via SpectroCoin",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/19/spectrocoin-unveils-ios-bitcoin-wallet-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/827705666db340f11a605fabcab1228e9650e22c-461x372.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also participating in the round were Hi-Pay (Hi-Media group), NetAtmo CEO Fred Potter, Rentabiliweb Group VP Thibaut Faurès Fustel de Coulanges, Alain Tingaud Innovations and Pascal Gauthier, Criteo’s ex-COO and founder of Challenger Deep, a bitcoin startup currently working in stealth mode.  This event is being seen as significant for the French bitcoin community. While digital currency startups in other countries such as the US have seen significant VC funding rounds, French bitcoin entrepreneurs have been struggling to garner similar attention.  Ledger  released its first product in December 2014: the Nano Wallet, a bitcoin hardware wallet focused on ease-of-use, affordability and security.  Future plans  Ledger says the round will allow it to fulfil its mission of helping bitcoin and other future blockchain applications to scale and achieve mass adoption via simple yet powerful solutions to secure users’ private keys.  Eric Larchevêque, Ledger’s co-founder said:  “Hardware wallets, or digital identity security systems, must be eventually perceived as a commodity. Only horizontal integration, as well as extremely low cost per user, is compatible with global mass adoption.”  The company aims to focus on developing customer-centric applications: improving the Ledger Wallet experience and finalising the Ledger Blue, a secure element-based hardware wallet integrating a display and a keyboard, as well as NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities for integration with smartphones and merchant POS terminals.  It also has plans to forge ahead with its LedgerOS TEE integration – the first real-life application running in a trusted execution environment. This will mean private key security and transaction validation will not rely on an external device, but on a secure operating system running on a secure enclave of the application processor, directly inside the smartphone.  The long-term goal is to develop and leverage a core secure operating system, LedgerOS, in a diverse set of secure devices and architectures: smartcards (Ledger Nano, Ledger Proton and Ledger Blue), hardware security modules (Ledger Enterprise) and trusted execution environments (Ledger Trustlet).  About the company  Ledger arose out of a union between members of La Maison du Bitcoin, the first European bitcoin centre, and startups BTChip and Chronocoin.  Thomas France, co-founder of both Ledger and La Maison du Bitcoin, told CoinDesk that this type of coming together was the raison d’être of the centre: to “gather great talents, and see what happens”.  Ledger has now grown to a team of 15 members, led by CTO Nicolas Bacca, who come with years of expertise in the fields of security, cryptography, secure elements, embedded hardware and UX design.  XAnge is well-known in France for being at the forefront of FinTech investment, having previously invested in KissKissBankBank, a crowdfunding platform; Lydia, a French Venmo-like startup; and CurrencyCloud, an international payment solution.  Since the launch of Ledger's first product just two months ago, the startup says it has already sold several thousand Nano wallets in more than 50 countries.  The Nano has also caught the attention of the bitcoin community. Gavin Andresen declared in an interview with Fortune:  “Ledger is an example of an innovation that’s happening that could make it much easier and safer to use bitcoins.”  The company has also indicated it has expansion plans for 2015. Notably, co-founder Thomas France will relocate to San Francisco to open a US subsidiary, Ledger Technology Inc, to place the firm at the heart of the Silicon Valley bitcoin sphere.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Sandrine Ayral,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/19/hardware-wallet-startup-ledger-closes-13-million-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59d00b4328300a6f59837c9f073fa59e235fe5a3-1500x729.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lrtn,1424337949,New Email Service Tackles Spam With Bitcoin Micropayments,"A recently launched service called Composed aims to boost the fight against spam by charging bitcoin micropayments for emails.  Composed  users are assigned an email address with a getcomposed.com domain name and can decide how much they wish to charge senders for an email. Anyone wanting their message to arrive at that address will have to respond to an automated reply and pay for the privilege by sending bitcoin or fiat currency via PayPal.  Ryan Gerard, who created the service, said:  ""When it costs spammers real money to send email, they will send less of it. Using bitcoin for micropayments in that system is the perfect solution.""  Putting a good idea into practice  The developer, who goes by the Twitter handle '@dreadpirateryan', said he had come across proposals for using bitcoin micropayments to make spam more expensive to send. Composed is his attempt to turn that idea into a working ""utility"" that also compensates receivers for having to spend time reading email from strangers.  The idea is for Composed users to publish their paywalled email address in places where the general public might see it. Gerard suggests personal websites, blogs and social media profiles as places where users might swap out their personal email address for a Composed one.  ""Composed is a utility to compensate you for your time when external parties you don't know well want to cold-email you,"" he said.  Where does Composed leave people who do know its users well – someone's spouse or children, say?  The email paywall has no effect on people who already know a user's actual email address, Gerard said. They would simply continue sending email to that address as usual, as Composed itself does after extracting a fee from strangers. A user can log in to Composed to check or withdraw their balance.  Gerard said the response to his service has been surprisingly positive so far, having signed up 200 users in its first two weeks after launching on 29th January.  Email spam is a global issue  Email spam remains a huge global problem. A 2012 paper by research scientists at Yahoo! Research estimated that spam costs businesses and consumers in America $20bn a year to deal with. The same paper cites statistics that show spam accounted for 88% of the 100 billion emails sent globally in 2010.  The notion of dealing with spam by making spammers incur additional costs is the subject of a Microsoft Research project called Penny Black. The project is so named because the Penny Black stamp, introduced by the British postal system in the 1830s, shifted the cost of postage from the receiver to the sender.  Microsoft's research took a different tack to Composed's model of placing a financial burden on the sender, however. It looked instead at using processing power or computer memory cycles as 'currencies' for payment by the sender.  The project, conducted in 2003, concluded that imposing a computational cost in the form of processing power is one of the most effective methods to combat spammers.  According to an overview of the project:  ""Spammers would have to invest heavily in hardware in order to send high volumes of spam.""  Setting out to solve the global spam epidemic isn't exactly what Gerard set out to do with Composed, though.  The developer, who has a day job in engineering with payments firm Square, said he built his project to be a small-scale endeavour. He has only paid out a few dollars to users so far, but he hopes the combination of digital currency and micropayments will scale along with his project.  Gerard said:  ""Spam would be the most obvious problem that micropayments help solve, but there are a variety of small financial transactions that could easily take place over email. Imagine signing up for a paid weekly newsletter by just sending an email, or paying your cellphone bill by replying to an email.""
