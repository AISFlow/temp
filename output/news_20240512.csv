Why Altcoin’s Price Continues To Plunge,"The once-booming cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) finds itself in a precarious position. The past month has been marked by a significant drop in XRP’s value, leaving investors and analysts in a state of flux. While some fear a continued decline, others see potential for a comeback, with technical indicators hinting at a possible reversal of fortune. However, the road ahead for XRP remains shrouded in uncertainty, with the ongoing legal battle with the SEC and broader market sentiment playing a crucial role. Related Reading: XRP All Talk, No Action? Social Media Booms, But Price Stuck In The Bear Pit A Downturn And Dampened Enthusiasm The last few weeks have been a rough ride for XRP holders. The cryptocurrency, which once held the distinction of being the only one with apparent regulatory approval in the United States, has shed over 5% in the last week alone. The price dipped as low as $0.49 before recovering slightly to its current position around $0.50. This downtrend has coincided with a noticeable dampening of enthusiasm within the crypto community. Discussions about XRP have dwindled, and the usual “bullish” fervor seems to have gone quiet. Technical Signals And Expert Opinions Despite the gloomy outlook, there are some glimmers of hope for XRP. Analysts point to technical indicators on TradingView that suggest a potential uptrend in the making. The chart shows a series of “higher lows and higher highs,” a pattern typically associated with bullish momentum. Additionally, the $0.50 mark seems to be acting as a support level. Each time the price dips close to this point, it rebounds slightly, indicating that some investors see it as an attractive entry point. This bullish sentiment is echoed by some experts. Dark Defender, a prominent crypto analyst, remains optimistic about XRP’s prospects for 2024, predicting a surge to $1.80 before year’s end. A recent poll conducted by Egrag Crypto among nearly 4,000 crypto community members also revealed mixed feelings. While a significant majority (61%) expressed optimism about XRP’s ability to participate in an upcoming bull run, a sizable minority (40%) remained apprehensive. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView Clouds Over XRP: The Looming Legal Battle XRP’s path forward is far from certain. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to cast a long shadow. The lawsuit, which centers around whether XRP is a security, has created uncertainty in the market, hindering investor confidence. This regulatory ambiguity makes it difficult for institutional investors to enter the XRP market, further dampening its potential for significant growth. XRP price down in the weekly timeframe. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Unlocking The Dogecoin Code: One Factor Holds The Key To Its Next Ascent Market Sentiment And Ripple Effect The broader bearish sentiment currently gripping the crypto market also adds pressure to XRP’s price. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the cryptocurrency market, has seen a significant correction in recent months, dragging many altcoins, including XRP, down with it.

Buy The Dip Sentiment Erodes Amid Drop Toward $60,000","Bitcoin has been sliding down since it reached its all-time high in March. This has largely led to a buy-the-dip sentiment among crypto traders, with many believing the correction would end as soon as it ended and Bitcoin would surge again to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Unlocking The Dogecoin Code: One Factor Holds The Key To Its Next Ascent According to crypto analytics platform Santiment, the thrill of scooping up ‘cheap’ Bitcoin appears to be fading as the consolidation drags on around the $60,000 price mark. As Santiment noted, this fading buy-the-dip mentality could actually be a signal that Bitcoin is nearing a bottom, according to price history. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Bitcoin tumbled from $63,000 to $60,000 on Friday, extending its run of range trading in the past few weeks. As noted by Santiment, traders are becoming less enthusiastic about buying the dip according to social media interactions. While this might be worrying for some investors, Bitcoin’s unique price movement over the years has prompted Santiment to note this is generally a good sign that the bottom is nearing. To explain this further, the sentiment usually turns quite negative when Bitcoin crashes from all-time highs. But historically, the point at which “buy the dip” talk on social media starts to fade is often a sign the bottom is near than most people will think. The fading “buy the dip” talk suggests the weak and scared bears have sold and the bulls are starting to position themselves. 🤔 Traders are showing weak #buythedip interest in #Bitcoin‘s latest retrace down to as low as $60.2K today. Generally, the crowd’s lack of faith is a strong sign of prices being close to a #bottom. Track social interest levels to see if #FUD stays high. https://t.co/cZjTWcCnL2 pic.twitter.com/Nj19XkIdgq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 10, 2024 Unfortunately, there’s no way to know for sure if prices have bottomed out until after the fact. However, key support levels on the Bitcoin chart haven’t broken down and fundamentals haven’t changed. If Bitcoin continues to hold above $60,000, this could signal the bottom is in. Bitcoin is now trading at $60.991. Chart: TradingView BTC Risk Signal Hits Lower High – Woo At the same time, the bullish Spot Bitcoin ETF narrative driving increasing mainstream adoption is still in place, meaning the crypto could reverse into a full bullish action very soon. Other key factors also point to Bitcoin nearing its bottom. As noted by crypto analyst Willy Woo, Bitcoin’s risk signal recently printed a lower high, which is a formation that frequently paves the way for a bullish trend. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,000 and is down by 4.2% in the past seven days. Although Bitcoin might have formed its bottom, this lull action could continue into the next few months until the crunching supply of the halving gets factored into its price.

27692157,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607609,1715508035,Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Nearing Historic Lows – What This Means For BTC Price,"The price of Bitcoin has continued to move within a consolidation range since hitting a new all-time high in mid-March. This sluggish price action has been a source of worry to most investors, especially when the premier cryptocurrency recently lost its support at the $60,000 level. Interestingly, price is not the only Bitcoin metric that has cooled off since the first quarter of the year. Data analytics firm Santiment has revealed that on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network has also slowed down over the past few months. How Historically Low On-Chain Activity Affects BTC Price In a new post on the X platform, Santiment revealed that on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network is approaching historic lows. This revelation is based on the noticeable downtrend in various metrics, notably transaction volume, daily active addresses, and whale transaction count. Related Reading: US Mega Banks JP Morgan And Wells Fargo Unveil Bitcoin Exposure As BTC Drops To $60,000 According to the blockchain intelligence platform, investors have been transacting less with BTC since the premier cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high price. As a result, Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has dropped to its lowest level since 2019. Breaking down the metrics, Santiment found that transaction volume on the pioneer blockchain is falling to its lowest in the past decade. The data analytics firm defines transaction volume as a metric that tracks the total amount of coins transacted for a given asset within a timeframe. What’s more, Santiment mentioned in its report that the number of daily active addresses, which measures the number of distinct addresses that participated in a BTC transaction on any given day, has reached its lowest point since January 2019. Source: Santiment/X The blockchain intelligence platform also revealed that whale activity has slowed down on the Bitcoin network. The number of whale transactions (greater than $100,000) has fallen to the lowest point since the end of 2018, according to Santiment’s data. On the surface, the decline in on-chain activity seems like a worrying trend and a symptom of an unstable market health. Santiment, however, noted that this dip might not necessarily be associated with imminent BTC price dips – as seen in the past weeks. The analytics company said that the decline in on-chain activity is more indicative of “crowd fear and indecision” amongst traders. Ultimately, this underscores the connection between the on-chain activity and sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin sits just above $60,770, with a mere 0.2% price dip in the past day.

27692156,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607608,1715499081,Ethereum Whale Offloads Holdings Amidst Market Downturn,"Ethereum (ETH) tumbled 6.45% in the past week, marking a rough stretch for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Generally, Ether has left investors much to desire in recent times with a price decline of 16.57% over the last few months. Amidst this bearish market, a crypto whale has sold off all his Ethereum tokens drawing much attention from traders and market experts alike. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Signals Fresh Increase Unless Fails To Surpass $3,080 ETH Whale Liquidates Holdings, Incurs Substantial Loss In an X post on May 11, blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain reported that a crypto whale offloaded all its 6,714 ETH tokens at a market price of $19.5 million. While the profit looks quite massive, LookonChain states that the investor actually recorded a loss of $6.5 million based on the acquisition price of these tokens. Generally, whale transactions gain much attention among investors as they are viewed as indicators of market trends. Thus, if a whale suddenly sells a large portion or all of their holdings it may be interpreted as a bearish signal prompting other investors to follow suit, resulting in a price dip. However, that may not necessarily be the case with the ETH market following this recent whale sell-off. With the Bitcoin halving completed in April, the crypto bull run is expected to begin in the following months based on historical data. In previous times, Ethereum has proven as one of the most favorable assets for investors in this period. Notably, the altcoin gained by over 2000% in the months following the Bitcoin halving in 2020. Thus, most ETH investors are likely to hold on to their tokens. Aside from Ethereum, the whale also liquidated all its 428,047 Optimism (OP) and 901,685 Arbitrum (ARB) at a loss of $902, 000 and $1.08 million respectively. In total, they incurred a loss of $8.43 million in offloading their investments in the three prominent altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Moves 1,000 ETH – Is The Top In?

This significant development comes amidst the persistent downturn in the crypto market, resulting in BTC’s price dipping slightly above $60,000. US Financial Banks Expose Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings American financial services companies, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, have revealed their exposure to BTC by disclosing their adoption of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in a recent filing. This decision to invest in BTC ETFs marks a notable change from the banks’ previous cautious approach to cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? Wells Fargo revealed in its new filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it currently holds 2,245 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), valued at $121,207, which it has since converted into an ETF. Additionally, the American bank holds 37 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), valued at $1,195. On the other hand, JP Morgan, which holds about $2.9 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), has revealed its total Spot BTC ETF holdings in an SEC filing. The bank reported that it had purchased about $760,000 worth of shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). Moreover, JP Morgan also owns about 25,021 shares valued at $47,000 in cryptocurrency ATM provider, Bitcoin Depot. The investment company also unveiled its exposure to Spot BTC ETFs just hours after Wells Fargo’s announcement. Despite the regulatory uncertainty and the market’s continuous volatility, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly BTC, has been growing rapidly. Bloomberg senior analyst, Eric Balchunas also forecasted that more financial services companies would likely follow JP Morgan and Wells Fargo’s footsteps to unveil holdings in Spot Bitcoin ETFs as market makers or Authorized Participants (APs). BTC Price sUFFERS More Declines Despite the increasing interest from traditional financial institutions seeking exposure to BTC, the price of the cryptocurrency has shown a surprising lack of bullish momentum. Since its halving event on April 20, BTC has been trading sideways, witnessing continuous declines that have pushed its price down to around $57,000 previously.
