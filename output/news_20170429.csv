42399792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbym9w,1493469612,What Bitcoin Traders Should Know: Fundamental Analysis,"While there are many different methods for evaluating the price of bitcoin, fundamental analysis may be the most integral for figuring out its true value.  Fundamental analysis is the evaluation of economic, financial and other key variables, known as fundamentals, to determine a security's true value. This differs from technical analysis (the counterpart to fundamental analysis) in that the former is more interested in looking at a security's price movements to make better-informed decisions.  When evaluating bitcoin, though, investors are keen to evaluate key aspects of the cryptocurrency's underlying technology, for example, how its scaling challenges might affect the digital currency's value.  After all, if the digital currency's transactions grow costly and time-consuming on account of block size limitations, this could reduce demand, in turn lowering the price.  Laying the foundation  While investors use fundamental analysis to evaluate different asset classes, such as equities and fiat currencies, several analysts assert that using this approach to evaluate bitcoin is more complex.  For instance, investors can evaluate a company's stock by looking at certain items on its balance sheet, but bitcoin does not produce revenue or earnings numbers.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation, telling CoinDesk: ""It's hard to derive an even remotely precise valuation for bitcoin from future cashflows"", the way you can for other assets such as General Motors stock.  As a result, traders interested in conducting fundamental analysis on bitcoin have developed ""a whole new set of metrics,"" according to Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare.  However, even though bitcoin has been described as a new asset class, the same rules that apply to fiat currencies also apply to cryptocurrencies, said Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management. ""All the laws of economics apply – in full – to cryptocurrencies,"" he said.  As a result, he emphasized that the starting point for all fundamental analysis should be the supply and demand that drives prices.  Key role of demand  Several variables affect bitcoin demand, including user adoption, transaction activity and trading.  Many analysts noted the importance of user adoption, which is crucial to a cryptocurrency's long-term viability. As for what drives user adoption, the analysts said money can have many uses. At its most basic level, money is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.  Outside of small circles, bitcoin has never really been used as a unit of account, said Enneking.  But bitcoin has managed to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange. Hundreds of companies – including eBay and PayPal – have agreed to accept the digital currency since its inception in 2009.  In addition, the number of confirmed transactions per day has generally followed a steady, upward trend, according to data from Blockchain. Transactions started surging in early 2012, rising from more than 7,000 per day at the start of April 2012 to more than 300,000 per day now.  While this data is informative, Eliosoff asserted that it's not the best indicator, because many blockchain transactions are ""generated by automated systems and don't represent economic activity, [especially] on scalable chains with low fees.""  Instead, traders must figure out which transactions are an actual person sending to or accepting from another person.  But as bitcoin obtains more widespread adoption and retailers aren't seeing increasing sales via bitcoin, there's been a major shift in focusing on the cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and to a store of value, concluded Enneking.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, said similar things, telling CoinDesk that the extent to which bitcoin is perceived as a store of value is a major driver of the digital currency's price.  Key role of supply  While demand for bitcoin can be a complex study, supply is a bit more straightforward.  The bitcoin protocol limits the total number of units at 21 million, and 16.3m bitcoins were in circulation at the time of reporting. Further, the rate of new supply is also determined by the bitcoin protocol. This contrasts sharply with the traditional monetary system, in which central banks have the ability to print money whenever they want.  However, there are some caveats that affect bitcoin's supply.  For starters, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, supposedly holds roughly 1.1m bitcoins which have not moved since they were mined. And many people in the bitcoin community think they won't ever be, seeing these coins as ""dead bitcoins."" Past that, it is impossible to know just how many ""dead bitcoins"" there really are, noted Enneking.  That's because for the first several years of bitcoin's existence, units of the digital currency didn't have much monetary value. When the price began moving upward, stories of people throwing away hard drives that held the private keys for their bitcoins were commonplace.  Major events  Analysts also noted the key role major events play in determining the price of bitcoin. These incidents are sometimes directly related to bitcoin, such as the hack of a major exchange, or a setback in the community's push to solve the scaling dilemma.  However, Enneking told CoinDesk:  ""The events that impacted bitcoin prices the most were non-bitcoin events like Cyprus and Greece.""  BitMEX's Hayes also spoke to the importance of macroeconomic events, emphasizing that ones fueling instability usually bolster alternative assets like bitcoin.  ARK Invest's  Chris Burniske agreed. During times of economic turmoil, bitcoin can act as a ""disaster hedge,"" he said.  Key considerations  By leveraging fundamental analysis, bitcoin traders can get a better sense of the cryptocurrency's true value and get a better sense of whether it's a good time to buy or sell.  However, some analysts criticize fundamental analysis because it reflects more what a security should be worth than what its actual market price is. Relying too much on fundamental analysis, without also using technical analysis, could cause a trader to buy or sell at a less-than-ideal time, they said.  To manage this risk, bitcoin traders can combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, a fundamental analyst might look at several indicators of demand, concluding that bitcoin is underbought, and then leverage technical analysis by reading charts to find the best entry point.  Alternatively, a trader might use technical analysis to determine that it's a good time to sell, and then leverage fundamental analysis to confirm this view by looking at key drivers of demand.

42399788,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbym6z,1493466310,Ethereum Meets Zcash? Why IPFS Plans a Multi-Blockchain Browser,"The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) sounds like just the kind of futuristic protocol that would coalesce with blockchain, and its inventor, Juan Benet, has big plans for the two decentralized technologies.  By storing multiple copies of data, the IPFS protocol, heralded as a tool for building a more permanent web, makes data more difficult to erase. Notably, it caught the attention of global warming archivists earlier this year when many worried that US government agency data would disappear under the new administration.  But Benet envisions future blockchain applications as well.  Mainly since blockchains have proven an inefficient and expensive way of storing data, Benet believes data, from webpages to PDFs, can be offloaded to another computing layer like IPFS. Since distributed ledgers can be put on top of IPFS for application building, he calls the two systems a ""great marriage"".  ""If you add it to IPFS and take that hash and put it in a block, you can then use IPFS to browse the transaction and browse the file directly on the web,"" he told CoinDesk.  Benet continued:  “IPFS connects all these different blockchains in a way that's similar to how the web connects all these websites together. The same way that you can drop a link on one page that links to another page, you can drop a link in ethereum [for example] that links to zcash and IPFS can resolve all of that.”  The ethereum–zcash example, which is currently in progress, is an interesting one, since those blockchain's developers have previously floated the idea of connecting the two blockchains.  Linking blockchain data  So, how does it work? It's a bit of a complex process, one that's more easily grasped by understanding IPFS and its functionality.  Much like ethereum developers, IPFS developers want to decentralize the internet. The protocol is an experimental replacement for HTTP, the technology currently responsible for delivering webpages like this CoinDesk article to a computer.  But rather than central servers managed by a few companies storing webpages online in the cloud (think Google Docs and emails), IPFS distributes data across a web of computers. A single computer, for instance, could participate in storing a slice of data.  The way this is achieved is through content addressing, hash-linked lists and other technology that's still being worked on today.  With this underpinning, data links can be embedded in other places, such as in blockchains.  ""What we have is a situation where you can create a link. You can go into the ethereum blockchain and issue a transaction that links to zcash. You can browse and access the entire ethereum blockchain and the entire zcash blockchain on IPFS,"" Benet said.  Effectively, it's a way to abstract away from cryptocurrencies.  ""Imagine you're browsing one blockchain,"" Benet explained. ""You can click through from one to the other, which means that you can write applications that relate the two without those applications having to understand either ethereum or zcash.""  The idea is, if ethereum, zcash and other blockchains can store smaller amounts of data, IPFS can be a tool for linking them and browsing them.  But, while IPFS and MetaMask developers have presented how this would work with the two blockchains, there are still challenges. The biggest hurdle is coming up with one data format to work between all the networks.  Interplanetary ambitions  If this sounds forward-looking, Benet's long-term vision is much stranger, and revolved around the 'interplanetary' in the protocol's name.  ""Yes, we mean it,” Benet said, noting the team is working on versions of today's most popular applications available over IPFS in time for people to travel to Mars.  ""By the time SpaceX sends the first people to Mars – or NASA if it's them – we want people to be able to use their normal computer applications there so that they have a good internet experience,"" he said.  The idea is an homage to computer scientist and internet pioneer JCR Licklider, who directed ARPANet, one of the precursors to the internet, Benet said. In one of his early memos, the word internet is actually short for 'Intergalactic network'.  ""He had this crazy vision of all these computers hooked up together and this network of networks, and then he wanted to extend it to the whole galaxy,"" Benet said.  IPFS is then an extension of Licklider's original vision, one that cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology have expanded on by added immutability and permanence of data.  For now, however, it's watch and wait as the idea tries to stand the test of time.
