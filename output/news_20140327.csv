42377053,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4aJ,1395954606,'Stripe' Lead Engineer: Bitcoin is a Long-Term Investment,"Earlier today (27th March), San Francisco-based online payments provider Stripe made a game-changing announcement, revealing that it is now testing bitcoin support with online data backup service Tarsnap.  The big picture implication of the move - that online bitcoin merchants would have yet another potential processing partner to choose from - was clear. However, many questions about the specifics of exactly how Stripe - which has traditionally focused on making online credit card acceptance easier - would adapt its service remained unanswered.  Now, Stripe has provided new details.  In a Q&A with CoinDesk, Christian Anderson, Stripe's lead bitcoin engineer, provided more information about the program, which he said will find Stripe taking bitcoin on behalf of merchants, then exchanging the digital currency for whatever fiat currency customers prefer.  Most notably, Anderson indicated that Stripe's beta test has a long-term focus.    ""This is a long-term investment for us. People selling online aren't going to shift all their sales to bitcoin overnight, or even in the next few months. There's some education needed on what accepting bitcoin means and what the advantages are.      We also need to make the consumer buying experience better. That'll take time.""    Speaking to CoinDesk, Anderson addressed a number of subjects, including the most recent IRS ruling that bitcoin would be treated as property, how Apple might react to the mobile payments implications of its decision and whether Stripe sees itself as a competitor of companies like Coinbase.  Said Andreson on the latter subject:  ""We would like interoperability to be the winning path, and we want to support the ecosystem. Think about a South African consumer using their Coinbase wallet to buy services from a German Stripe merchant. That's a very cool world to live in.""  Read excerpts from our Q&A with Andreson below:    _________________________________________________________________      CoinDesk: How will Stripe set the exchange rate on bitcoin transactions?      Christian Anderson: We peer directly with several existing companies, and they in turn peer with many markets. The exchange rate for a given transaction is set by one [of] the partners who exchanges that transaction. In the implementation, Stripe does not make money off of spread. Our goal is to find the best exchange rate for our merchants.    How will Stripe hedge its risk to cope with bitcoin's volatility?  Anderson: Stripe users will not handle Bitcoin directly and Stripe will not hold Bitcoin on behalf of its merchants.  We have partnerships with multiple entities that convert Bitcoin to currencies immediately. This mitigates volatility for Stripe and its merchants.  Will you be building bitcoin support into the mobile app, and if so for which platforms?  Anderson: Stripe has SDKs for web, mobile web, iOS and Android. These SDKs give merchants a range of flexibility over how they take payments: they can drop in Stripe Checkout, or they can build their own payment form from scratch. Bitcoin will be available across all these SDKs.  Do you anticipate any pushback from Apple, which has been traditionally censorious when it comes to bitcoin apps?  Anderson: Fundamentally, we have to wait and see what rules shake out in iOS  apps. Plenty of Stripe merchants - like Lyft, Postmates and Grindr - accept credit card payments from within mobile apps, so we hope that bitcoin won't be treated too much differently.  Much of the furor has been over *wallet* apps rather than apps that accept Bitcoin payments.  Will Stripe's app support the new payment mechanism released in Bitcoin Core 0.9.0?  Anderson: If this refers to the Payment Protocol (BIP 70) [then] yes. Stripe is very enthusiastic about the Payment Protocol and will support it and encourage its adoption.  How will you cope with the inability to revoke (charge back) transactions with bitcoin? Will this be a problem for merchants or customers?  Anderson: As we do today, Stripe will monitor all of its merchants for fraud and other malicious behavior.  Have you any reaction to this week's IRS announcement regarding bitcoin? Does it change your operations materially?  Anderson: First off, the ruling doesn't affect merchants using Stripe to accept BTC. Merchants never take possession of any Bitcoin and are paid out in dollars, so they should not be affected by the IRS's decision to treat Bitcoin as property.  It's too early to say how the ruling will affect Bitcoin adoption overall, but our general feeling is that it contributes to its legitimacy.  Will there be an option to deliver bitcoin directly into a merchant's account, rather than handling the conversion immediately and sending them fiat?  Anderson: We haven't seen as much demand for this, so it's not on our roadmap yet. That said, our mission is to build better payment infrastructure for the Internet, so we would find Bitcoin payouts exciting inasmuch as they help us achieve that.

42377056,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4fL,1395952166,Would a $10k Bitcoin Help or Hurt Transactions?,"A focus on what really makes up the bitcoin ecosystem - transactions - was discussed in a panel on Wednesday, 26th March, as part of the final session of CoinSummit San Francisco.  The talk included Vinny Lingham, CEO of Gyft; Tom Longson, CEO of GogoCoin; and was moderated by Luke Sully from PwC.    _________________________________________________________________    Everyone loves to predict that the price of bitcoin will rise, but the more important question may be, 'Is an expensive bitcoin actually good for the BTC economy?'  No one can deny that the level of exposure bitcoin has received in the past year has had a lot to do with its price. One year ago, the highest traded price of one BTC on Mt. Gox was $86. Today, there is no Mt. Gox, and bitcoin is now trading in the $500 range on a more diversified set of exchanges.  So, does a high valuation bode well for bitcoin as a transactional store of value?  Vinny Lingham, CEO of Gyft, a mobile gift card platform that accepts BTC, and Tom Longson, CEO of GogoCoin, a maker of prepaid bitcoin cards, weighed in at CoinSummit on 26th March.  Volatility  The upward pricing pressure on bitcoin means that as the price goes up, investors will cash out to realize a fiat return, causing a selloff market the drives the value down. That can create volatility in the bitcoin markets over time.  Both Gyft and GogoCoin's businesses are similar - they are a tangible retail way for consumers to experience bitcoin. However, both of these companies are impacted by bitcoin price swings.  Explained Longson:  ""When I talk to people [about bitcoin] volatility is one of their primary concerns.""  Lingham echoed these concerns, saying:  ""I just want it to be a smoother ride than what we have had in the past two years.""  Both Lingham and Longson also agreed that retail businesses like their own offer a way to solve some of these issues, if not reducing volatility, at least improving consumer trust.  Lingham believes getting bitcoin to the point of sale is what will increase the transactional value of BTC:  ""I think merchant adoption is going to far outpace consumer adoption.""  The $10,000 bitcoin  Lingham took an informal survey of hands from the audiences about bitcoin's future price prospects, and there wasn't much doubt that bitcoin would surpass $2,000 soon:  ""The broad consensus is that bitcoin will be over $2,000 within two years. I’m kind of fearful if bitcoin hits over $10,000 this year.""  Many believe that the $10,000 bitcoin will come in 2014.  The problem that Lingham sees is that to the consumer, bitcoin looks like a wild ride. Most people require a form of payment that is stable and secure:  ""If you ask what consumers are looking for, they want something that stands behind it [bitcoin].""  Getting banks on board will be a huge deal for bitcoin. It starts with financial companies in the US banking bitcoin businesses, which is still a struggle for many of them today. ""A bank that would accept bitcoin businesses, that would be a big deal,"" said Longson.  He added: ""The US is being quite permissive when it comes to bitcoin. I don’t think we’re not that far away.""  The question is: if banks start working with bitcoin, will the price skyrocket? Will that limit the use of bitcoin as a transactional currency and make it more like a commodity?  Lingham already thinks that's the case:  ""I don’t think bitcoin is a currency. It’s a commodity,"" he said.

42377069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4tB,1395950494,"'Cosign' Wallet Streamlines Multisignature Transactions, Enhances Security","BitPay's BitCore development team is working on a new project that it claims will be ""the most secure wallet in the world"".  Dubbed Cosign, the wallet is being developed to allow streamlined multisignature transactions that will add much needed security to bitcoin storage technology.  The idea behind multisignature wallets is a simple one – transactions must be authenticated by more than one person to confirm that they are valid, hence boosting security. However, this does add another level of complexity to the process.  Now, though, the Bitcore team thinks it has cracked that problem with a user-friendly system that coordinates the cosigning process.  Streamlined transactions  The developers explained that Cosign will allow users to spend multisignature coins much like standard, single-signature bitcoins.  If someone wants to spend coins from a multisignature wallet, they can do so just as they would with a normal wallet, but that would not complete the transaction. The partially signed transaction would then show up on cosigners' screens, requiring them to approve it.  Once three cosignatories have signed the transaction (in a 3-of-5 scenario), it would then be broadcast to the bitcoin network.  This obviously adds yet another layer of protection. Even if your private keys are compromised, that won't be enough to steal your coins, as an attacker would also have to steal keys belonging to your cosigners.  The keys must be generated by the client and they must be encrypted. The software also has to be executed on the client side, so it could not be audited or changed by a third party.  The developers explained:  ""Cosign takes advantage of a number of modern browser and bitcoin technologies to make this possible. Web RTC is used to establish P2P connections between cosigners. HTML5 local storage is used to store the wallet. HD extended keys are used to simplify the generation of new addresses.""  Cosign: Step by step  While the process may sound cumbersome, the whole point of Cosign is to simply and streamline every step.  The team outlined a basic scenario, which includes five people who want to open a joint wallet and act as cosigners.  First, a new Cosign wallet must be created and its ID shared between the members of the group.  All cosigners then join the wallet and generate a new extended private key, which has a corresponding public key. The public key is shared with the others, while the private key is held in secret, as the name suggests.    The team explained:      ""Now the cosigners can view their multisignature wallet just like a normal wallet. The appearance and workflow of the wallet are almost exactly the same, with only one catch: when someone wishes to send bitcoins, the bitcoins are not immediately sent. Instead, the partially signed transaction is shared with the other cosigners.      If three of them sign it, then the transaction is complete, and can be broadcast to the bitcoin network and stored in the blockchain.""    When a cosigner sends bitcoins, the transaction is regarded as 'partially signed', and shows up on the screens of the other cosigners. The other cosigners can either choose to sign or to ignore the transaction.  If enough cosigners sign the transaction (say, three, in the case of a 3-of-5 multisig wallet), the transaction is fully signed and automatically broadcast to the bitcoin network.  Other than the fact that the transaction is not broadcast to the network until it is signed by the required number of cosigners, the wallet looks and acts much like a regular bitcoin wallet.  There is just one small catch: in order to back up the wallet, at least three cosigners have to have their keys available in order to recover the bitcoins.  Cosign is still not ready for prime time, so CoinDesk could not try it out. However the developers have created a few mock-ups to show off the concept.

42377051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4Xn,1395947206,"Reddit CEO Thinks the World of Dogecoin, Slams 'Crazy' Bitcoiners","Outspoken Reddit CEO Yishan Wong shared his thoughts on digital currencies this week and he appears to be very much a dogecoin man.  What Wong had to say about bitcoin and the politics of many bitcoin enthusiasts, though, probably won't go down well with the libertarian crowd.  ""Dogecoin is great,"" Wong said, adding that the greatest contribution being made to economics does not come in the form of bitcoin itself, but rather the customizable spinoff cryptocurrencies that are now proliferating.  Wong made his comments in a post on question-and-answer website Quora.  Much digital currencies  Wong argued that there is plenty of room for altcoins, and pointed out that the basic concept of money does not revolve around a single currency like a dollar, but rather a whole range of currencies. The same rule applies to cryptocurrencies:    ""It's about anyone being able to create and launch a crypto-currency much like bitcoin, but with little tweaks and changes to fit the usage needs of the population looking to transact in it.      Just like in the real world where if you're a country looking to provide a new currency and you decide you hate Americans and don't want to transact in dollars, you can just print your own currency.""    He pointed out that fiat currencies work if governments and economies are stable enough, so the same principle applies to digital currencies, including dogecoin.  The best thing about dogecoin is that it has a completely different user base than bitcoin, Wong said.  'Crazy libertarians'  As for the bitcoin user base, let's just say Wong probably wouldn't invite many diehard bitcoin fans over for a drink:    ""Without being too inflammatory, the user base for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.      I say 'increasingly' because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it's attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background.""    He also criticised the obsession of some members of the bitcoin community with bringing down central banks, fiat currencies and governments as ""misguided"" and off the mark, as it misses the whole point of bitcoin.  For the first time in history, Wong said, the world has a low-friction electronic payments and trust-delegation system, which is valuable in its own right. In essence, there is no need for any ideology, since digital currencies are a powerful concept on their own.  To the moon!  ""In contrast, the dogecoin community doesn't have anywhere near as much of an ideological bent,"" he said. ""It is basically a bunch of people happily passing around a silly toy currency and giving coins to their friends.""  He went on:  ""[Dogecoin] has all the features of bitcoin – technologically speaking – but frees itself from the libertarian culture of bitcoin that turns off so much of the mainstream.""  Wong argued that any currency has to be mainstream and that ideology just gets in the way. An altcoin whose brand is created around a meme is the lowest-common denominator, which helps drive mainstream adoption.  ""It couldn't be stupider, and that's why it's brilliant,"" he concluded. ""Speaking of brilliance, one of the key stated aims of dogecoin is the collective journey to the moon, a source of long-time brilliance throughout human history.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/reddit-ceo-thinks-the-world-of-dogecoin-slams-crazy-bitcoiners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c9fb2ad8810d46c2c69d3ea3e1f26dc47d101e8-1024x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4bZ,1395942722,Online Payments Provider 'Stripe' Now Testing Bitcoin Support,"San Francisco-based web and mobile payments provider Stripe has announced that it is now testing bitcoin support with one merchant partner, online data backup service Tarsnap.  Founded in 2010  , Stripe has so far garnered $120m in public investments, most recently in January when it capped an $80m Series C round from major investors including PayPal founder Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Sequoia Capital. Tarsnap, in turn, is helmed by Colin Percival, credited with creating the password-based key derivation function scrypt now widely used in digital currency.  The announcement is notable as it indicates that Stripe is poised to enter the bitcoin space as a competitor to fellow San Francisco-based startup Coinbase and Georgia-based merchant processor BitPay, should it follow through and making the service publicly available.  Stripe rose to prominence due to its popularity with developers, who favored the company's APIs, as they allowed merchants to accept credit cards without devoting significant resources toward adding to their site's code.  The company charges a 2.9% fee plus an additional 30 cents on traditional charges, a fee structure similar to PayPal, though with more free services.  Stripe is now allowing interested merchants to enroll for beta testing via a dedicated bitcoin portion of the website.  Behind the partnership  Tarsnap founder Colin Percival spoke at length about its decision to accept bitcoin in a blog post paired with Stripe's announcement. Percival indicated that bitcoin owners currently use Tarsnap to back up their bitcoin wallets, and that as such, he is not surprised that his clients would like to pay in bitcoin.  Said Percival:  ""There is a significant commonality between Tarsnap and Bitcoin — both rely crucially on strong cryptography.""  Rather than use an existing bitcoin payment service, however, Percival indicates that he was excited to work with Stripe due to their ""simple and clean API"".  How Stripe bitcoin payments work  Percival indicated that when he receives a bitcoin payment, Stripe's bitcoin service tells him the amount of bitcoin he should ask for, as well as the address they should be sent to.  He explained:  ""Stripe then gives me the dollars I asked for (minus a small processing fee, of course).""  Percival then used a publically available iframe-generator to create a QR code that redirects the web browser and submits a Stripe ""bitcoin receiver token"" to the provided address.  Unanswered questions  Still, while the news is no doubt exciting for the ecosystem, many unanswered questions about the service remain.  For example, it is not yet known how the company itself plans to hedge against volatility, whether it's working with any third-party services or whether Stripe's app will integrate new features available in the most recent update of Bitcoin core.  Further, given that it also allows merchants to accept payments via mobile phones, it is uncertain which phones, if any, may be able to use the service.

42377063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4mt,1395936107,Swarm Intelligence Event is First Science Conference to Accept Bitcoin,"A Belgium-based swarm intelligence conference is breaking new ground, with bitcoin set to be accepted as payment for registration. This makes it the first such scientific event to accept the digital currency.  The appropriately named ANTS, the ninth international conference on swarm intelligence, is set to be held in Brussels from September 10th to 12th by IRIDIA – the country’s leading artificial intelligence lab located at the Free University of Brussels (Université Libre de Bruxelles).  IRIDIA says it is one of the leading incubators of the Belgian bitcoin scene. Researchers from the lab created a discussion group that later evolved into the Brussels bitcoin meetup group, which they claim is one of the oldest in the world and the biggest in Europe.  The Brussels-based group was a major catalyst in the creation of the recently established Belgian Bitcoin Association (BBA).  To enable bitcoin payments, IRIDIA says it has teamed up with the BBA to become the first scientific conference accepting payments in the digital currency.  ""There are several reasons why we decided to include bitcoin as a payment option,” Arne Brutschy, Director of the Belgian Bitcoin Association, told CoinDesk. ""It's a logical step after being the incubator of much of Belgian's bitcoin activity – we try to promote and use bitcoin where we can. As we're not a business, we have very little opportunity to do so practically, but our bi-annual conference gave us such an opportunity.”  Related field  According to Brutschy, the lab’s research focuses on self-organizing, decentralised systems, which makes the digital currency an interesting field of study from a scientific point of view, as exemplified by IRIDIA’s research director, Professor Marco Dorigo.  ""Professor Dorigo became personally interested in bitcoin and sees it as closely related to our research field,” said Brutschy, who is also a researcher in artificial intelligence and swarm robotics at IRIDIA. ""Thus, for our lab, bitcoin is interesting out of a purely academic motivation as well.”  Moreover, Brutschy says there is a very practical reason for the conference’s endorsement of bitcoin:  ""Research should be open to anyone, anywhere. The research community should be free of barriers of entry in order to ensure that everyone can partake in the discussion. Unfortunately, to date, we had to rely on the traditional banking system for international payments, a choice that excludes a large part of the world in which credit cards are not easy to obtain, international payments are not possible, and so on.”  The conference’s organizers are regularly contacted by researchers who would like to participate in the conference, but cannot do so due to the aforementioned issues, according to Brutschy.  ""We believe that bitcoin can alleviate these problems,” Brutschy says. ""The Belgian Bitcoin Association is also grateful for an opportunity to foster the use of bitcoin in Belgium.”  New discipline  On their website, the conference’s organizers say that swarm intelligence is a relatively new discipline that deals with the study of self-organising processes, both in nature and in artificial systems.  The bi-annual event gives researchers in swarm intelligence the opportunity to meet, to present their latest research, and to discuss current developments and applications in fields varying from ant colony optimization to swarm robotics, and applying swarm intelligence techniques to control large groups of cooperating autonomous robots.  Bitcoin discount  For those researchers who endorse the digital currency, the event will be an opportunity to use bitcoins to pay their registration fees, which range from €300 ($413.8) for students to the full rate of €400 ($551.8) for researchers. Those willing to pay with their digital currency will receive a €10 ($13.8) discount.  According to the organizers, the conference fee expressed in the cryptocurrency is automatically computed using the current average value available here.  Set up in November 2013 and based in Brussels, the BBA says its primary purpose is to support members in their bitcoin-related efforts, promote the use of the digital currency, impact government policymaking, and shape business and technical expertise.  Moreover, the association says it aims to clarify all aspects of bitcoin from the day-to-day transactions to the security and cryptography aspects, educate on the cryptocurrency, and raise awareness on its use across Belgium.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/swarm-intelligence-event-is-first-science-conference-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a01f442d6b5df7447e4453453673f38fba6b9dc-1000x602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4kN,1395932158,Study: Mt. Gox May Have Lost Just 386 BTC Due to Transaction Malleability,"A new report by researchers at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland has concluded that the now-bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox may have lost only 386 bitcoins ($203,000) due to issues stemming from transaction malleability.  The finding provides new evidence that Mt. Gox's continued claims that issues with the Bitcoin protocol were the primary reason for its insolvency are perhaps misleading or untrue.  Released on 26th March, the report was authored by Christian Decker and Professor Roger Wattenhofer, both of the university's Distributed Computing Group (DCG).  Overall, the authors found that only 302,000 bitcoins could have ever been involved in malleability-related attacks, and that of this figure, only 1,811 were likely to be part of attacks that could have prevented Mt. Gox users from making withdrawals.  Concluded the report:  ""Even if all of these attacks were targeted against Mt. Gox, Mt. Gox needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 bitcoin.""  The news comes roughly one week after Mt. Gox confirmed that it had discovered 200,000 bitcoins in an old-format wallet in early March, a claim lawyers representing former Mt. Gox customers say they are currently working to investigate.  Conducting measurements  The researchers provided a detailed overview in their 13-page report of the steps they took to reach this conclusion, first noting how they identified potential double spending attacks and the limitations they faced in doing so.  To trace and dump all transactions from the Bitcoin network, the researchers created specialized nodes, allowing them to detect any double-spending attacks observed by peer nodes. The first, and most prominent limitation, for example, was that the researchers were only able to extend their research as far back as January 2013.  Explained the report:  ""The following observations therefore do not consider attacks that may have happened before our collection started.""  The limitation is significant as evidence suggests that Mt. Gox lost its bitcoins over a period stemming multiple years. The researches estimate their nodes were connected to 992 peers, or approximately 20% of reachable nodes.  The next task was identifying double-spend attacks.  While double spending attacks could be determined by associating transactions with the outputs they claim, researchers chose to remove signature script from the transactions, and looked instead at the unique keys produced by the malleability attacks.  Read the report: ""The unique key is then used to group transactions together into conﬂict sets.""  Notable findings  The report indicates that approximately 29,139 conflict sets were identified over the course of the research and later confirmed by the block chain. More than 6,000 transactions were labeled as invalid due to incorrect signatures or because they were part of further double spending.  Researchers then detailed how they were able to reach the 302,700 BTC estimate.    ""The conﬂict set value is deﬁned as the number of bitcoins transferred by any one transaction in the conﬂict set. The outputs of the transactions in a conﬂict set are identical, since any change to them would require a new signature.      In particular, the value of outputs may not be changed. Each transaction in a conﬂict set therefore transfers an identical amount of bitcoins. Summing the value of all conﬂict sets results in a total of 302,700 bitcoins that were involved in malleability attacks.""    The most prominent type of malleability occurred when attackers replaced a single byte OP_0 with OP_PUSHDATA2, resulting in signature script that was 4 bytes longer. Roughly 28,500 of the 29,139 confirmed attacks had this type of modification.  The effectiveness of malleability attacks  The report also took a look at whether the transaction malleability attacks launched against the exchange were successful, meaning that they resulted in a modified transaction later confirmed.  Overall, the report estimates that of the 28,595 malleability attacks it detected, only 19.46%, or 5,670, were confirmed. It estimated that the total profit from successful attacks was 64,564 BTC (roughly $33.7m at press time).  However, the researchers noted that this conclusion was based on the assumption that conflict sets were the results of attacks directed at Mt. Gox. In order to find this correlation, the researchers set out to verify the claim by finding the transactions used for the attacks.  ""The above mentioned total amount of 302,700 bitcoins involved in malleability attacks already disproves the existence of such a large-scale attack. However, it could well be that malleability attacks contributed considerably in the declared losses.""  Mt. Gox's role in encouraging attacks  The report further analyzed the timeline of the attacks, using as a basis three periods in the exchange's lifecycle.  Period 1, which stretched from January 2013 to February 2014, was the period before Mt. Gox halted withdrawals  Period 2 included 8th to 9th February, when withdrawals stopped but no attack details were public  Period 3, lasting from 10th to 28th February, included the time after Mt. Gox had blamed issues with the Bitcoin protocol for its substantial loss of customer funds.  During Period 1, the report found 421 conflict sets, equating to roughly 1,800 BTC. During Period 2, the number of conflict sets spiked to 1,062, affecting 5,470 BTC, with the number of attacks increasing from 0.15 per hour to 132 per hour.  The report, therefore, concluded that Mt. Gox's announcements relating to the attack dramatically increased the frequency of attacks. Attack activity was also high on 10th and 11th February, when the researchers detected 25,732 individual attacks, totaling 286,000 bitcoins.  ""The strong correlation between the press releases and the ensuing attacks attempting to exploit the same weakness is a strong indicator that the attacks were indeed triggered by the press releases.""  Though, the report notes that Mt. Gox had disabled withdrawals at this time, and as such, the attacks could not have been aimed at the exchange.  Report reception  At press time, discussion of the paper was limited to Bitcoin Talk forum, where the bitcoin community mostly greeted the research as a validation of previous assumptions.  Still, there were some critics who pointed to the limited period of study, the limited reach of the information the study collected and the inability of researchers to observe how Mt. Gox may have modified transactions.  For more details, download the full report here.

42377064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4o9,1395927006,How OneName Makes Bitcoin Payments as Simple as Facebook Sharing,"Though the Bitcoin protocol has been described as an elegant solution to problems that have long plagued both digital currencies and the traditional monetary system, aspects of its construction violate one of the central tenets of tech design: 'keep it simple, stupid' (often abbreviated to KISS).  Arguably, nowhere is this more apparent than in the design of bitcoin addresses, strings of 27 to 34 alphanumeric characters that, while providing privacy and security, don't easily allow users to exchange payment information, except via sometimes cumbersome QR code technology.  However, OneName is looking to remove this pain point, replacing lengthy bitcoin payment addresses with sleek, social handles. Once registered with OneName, asking for payment becomes as easy as adding a plus sign to your username (+pete_rizzo_, for example).  All users need to do is enter their email on the OneName website, and ""claim their name"". Many already have. The OneName website boasts that notable digital currency figures, such as Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and Dogecoin Foundation shibe Ben Doernberg, are already registered too.  However, while OneName's pitch is simple, it's more sophisticated than it may seem at first glance. OneName is not a bitcoin application or company, but rather an open-source protocol built on top of the Namecoin protocol that seeks to enable new, innovative applications of its own.  According to core developers Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea, OneName's goal is to allow the Internet community to take back control of its data from centralised institutions, like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, which right now have a monopoly that they say is stifling innovation.  Explained Ali:  ""If you're using the bitcoin analogy, right now people keep their money in banks. With data, these banks or third parties are companies like Facebook and LinkedIn. App developers that want to use this data now have to deal with [these companies].""  OneName, it seems, does have one thing in common with most bitcoin startups: it's looking to replace powerful and entrenched middlemen.  The big picture  With OneName, Shea indicates that users will be able to regain control of their personal information, sharing it with any app developers that they wish, without the approval of a third party.  Shea says OneName has already been contacted by developers that want to use the its technology to build open-source alternatives to payment solutions like Venmo and instant messaging services.  Added Ali:  ""Any application that can built on an application like Facebook can be built on top of OneName, but it would be decentralized in nature. There really is no limit, it's up to the imagination of the developers.""  Today, developers are restricted from easily building these apps, Shea said, as big conglomerates monopolize user data. Companies like Whatsapp and Snapchat, he argues, were able to grow more quickly by having unrestricted access to cellphone technology and its ability to generate picture data.  Shea indicates that this use case is the best example of what allowing unfettered access to user data can allow entrepreneurs to achieve. Whatsapp, it should be noted, was recently sold to Facebook for $19bn.  How OneName works  Unlike with centralized applications, where data is stored by a single entity, Muneeb says that OneName profile data goes directly into the namecoin block chain, meaning OneName does not directly store any data.  Usernames are sent to account holders on the blockchain, and they can in turn put their private keys in cold storage or share them as desired. In this way, profiles are like coins on the system, allowing users to transfer them from one account to another.  Since OneName is using the Namecoin protocol, it also fronts a cost to register users (about 7 US cents for the purchase of the namecoin). Users must then issue a name update within 250 days.  Said Ali:  ""We do the first update and transfer the profile to the user. This expires in approximately eight months. The user would then have to fire up the Namecoin client and issue a name update, the cost could be zero or just a transaction fee.""  To avoid this potentially cumbersome task, OneName has since added a feature that allows users to update their accounts on its site, as it was heavily requested in initial feedback.  Further, OneName keeps a backup system that uses Shamir's secret sharing. The developers explained via reddit that this means OneName keeps no information about users' private keys, but should users lose this information, it can be recovered.  For now, the emphasis is on showing how this innovation can be applied to a simple use case: payments. However, in the long term, Muneeb said OneName will emphasize the non-financial implications of its protocol.  Said Shea:  ""Right now, our goal is to help people. If you've ever seen people put bitcoin addresses on their website or twitter profiles, it's kind of cumbersome, and we want to make this easier.""  Results so far  The initial launch was not without challenges. Interest was high on reddit, as were critiques of the OneName service, which the developers stressed was still a work in progress.  For example, one user quickly took the username +gavin, which prompted a question about verification from bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen himself. The team later reserved +gavinandresen for Andresen's use.  OneName notes it is working on a system that would seek to confirm whether OneName users are who they claim to be using Twitter accounts, Github accounts and more, thereby reducing username squatting.  Ali said:  ""Basically, users would tweet out a message that links back to their profile to verify that they are the same person.""  Profile updating was also limited at the time of launch, though there is a workaround for tech-savvy people who are able to download the Namecoin-Qt to perform a name update.  Despite all this, the future is looking bright for OneName, given its easy-to-understand value proposition.  The developers revealed via reddit that a few wallets are working on implementing OneName features. Details, they say, are still forthcoming.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/how-onename-makes-bitcoin-payments-as-simple-as-facebook-sharing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a63a28dae2bc1d40d19725115e8762364e70314a-1002x668.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377066,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4rv,1395921636,Bitcoin ID Verification Streamlined With Jumio's BISON,"Credentials management company Jumio Inc. announced it has formed a network of bitcoin exchanges, wallets and ATM providers worldwide to smooth ID verification procedures and open easy transactions to a greater range of connected devices.  Its new Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network (BISON) includes BitAccess ATMs, SnapSwap, CoinMkt, Digital Currency Exchange of Texas, CoinRnr, Hashop.io, NoveltyLab and Bitnet Technologies as initial members.  Using Jumio's 'Netverify’ technology, users in the BISON ecosystem can simply hold their ID in front of a camera on any connected device to get verified and validated at the point of transaction. It also extracts the personal information on the ID and auto-populates the transaction form, doing all this in real-time.  The system can verify driver licences, passports and some other documents issued by over 100 countries using a bundle of automated techniques to detect manipulation. Suspect IDs are then referred to human experts for further examination.  Security for bitcoin businesses  Right now the buyer's identify is used only in the relationship with the bitcoin business they're using. Next summer, however, they will have the option to join a wider network whereby their ID details can be shared between different companies, obviating the need to complete separate identification and verification processes. Jumio gave bitcoin exchanges, with their often lengthy verification times, as the best example where this would be an advantage.  BISON client businesses will also have access to regularly updated data regarding success rates, failure rates, account openings, transaction failures and fraud attempts within the network, giving them a better idea who and what to watch out for. Jumio's founder and CEO Daniel Mattes said:  ""The vast majority of bitcoin users are honest and engaging in a range of legal transactions, but a small minority are not and that threatens the entire ecosystem especially during this formative period.""  ""BISON is designed to minimize the problem by weeding out those who use false or manipulated IDs which is a strong indicator of intended fraud or other illegal activity.""  New world  Jumio is not a 'bitcoin business' per se, concerning itself mainly with verification procedures at all types of clients, including many in the online retail, government and traditional financial spheres. However it is also backed by venture capitalist firm Andreesen Horowitz, and many of Marc Andreesen's recent bitcoin pronouncements have begun to catch on.  [post-quote]  It has also been working with a number of bitcoin businesses recently, and realized the need for an efficient and accurate way to verify identity in transactions using connected devices, like smartphones.  The new concept of 'keystroke-free transactions' seeks new ways that respect the form factor of mobile devices, Jumio says. Everything now is based on the desktop model, with keyboards and browser auto-fill.  Chief Marketing Officer Marc Barach echoed many of Andreesen's bitcoin beliefs: that in its current form, bitcoin is like the internet in 1994.  That is, it's still a mix of fringe players and experimental technology, which doesn't always work nicely. The next phase, both have said, will demand new standards of professionalism and trust to reach the mainstream.  Barach added: ""We didn't actually pursue this sector, it sort of came to us. We saw a need to establish trust between bitcoin customers, and the wallets and exchanges they work with.""  By weeding out fraud in the form of fake or manipulated IDs, Barach said, the network strengthens the entire ecosystem. The main use case for BISON is obviously KYC (know your customer) rules that protect businesses from fraud as much as identify wrongdoers to the authorities.  ""If you set up a process that makes it difficult for criminals to do business, they'll go elsewhere and leave the space to legitimate activities. Criminals will go to that second tier of company, that doesn't care about that stuff,"" he continued.  He said Jumio had learned a few things working with bitcoin businesses, which involved improving security without compromising digital currency's advantages.  ""We discovered a couple of things: (1) Self-regulation is the way to go; (2) These companies have developed good processes to eliminate criminal activity; (3) Bitcoin is a hyper-efficient way to transact, and it's all about keeping that efficiency.""  Privacy issues  Barach says he understands the concerns of users who might at first be reluctant to hand over their personal information to another company to share. But on the whole, trusting it to a secure system like BISON is still preferably to leaving your personal details spread over different businesses of varying sizes and security standards around the internet.  ""If you want to sign up anywhere, say Coinbase or itBit etc, you have to give ID. What's new is you now have the option to keep that info on a central place.""  ""You're leaving your personal information everywhere around the internet anyway. it's something we've become used to, and Jumio doesn't think merchants should be in the storage of payment and personal info business.""  ""A lot of people go back to a small store they'd forgotten about and are surprised to discover they're already logged in and payment details are on file. They think it's convenient. In many ways, there's a bias against the new – we think nothing of handing over our credit cards to a waiter in a restaurant, just because it's established behaviour.""  Jumio now has offices and clients across the US and Europe, with Europe representing 40% of its business. It hopes to expand into Latin American and Asian markets over the next few years.  Founded in 2010 by Daniel Mattes, the Palo Alto company is backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures.

42377055,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4cp,1395918977,Bitcoin Price Drops After New Chinese Bank Rumours,"UPDATE (28th March, 10:00 GMT): Sources in China have reported since this article appeared that the 'rumors' contained in the Caixin story appear to be true, though bitcoin exchanges still have received no official notice from the People's Bank. The bitcoin price has continued to drop, now sitting just above $500.  Less than a week after a fake Chinese news report sent bitcoin and litecoin prices plummeting on some exchanges, another similar rumour hit the Internet on Thursday.  News that the Chinese government would penalize any bank transacting with bitcoin exchanges after 15th April started to break around mid-morning China time on Thursday 27th March. This time, it was reported as fact by a number of news services.  The bitcoin price, already on a downward trend, dropped to a low of $561.61 on CoinDesk's BPI and below the $550 mark on Chinese exchanges.  The latest report gave all the usual reasons a government might want to restrict digital currencies: money laundering, crime, price volatility and investor risk. Given that the People's Bank of China had previously warned banks to stay away from bitcoin transactions, the fake news seemed plausible, but this was the first report of an outright prohibition.  Unfounded rumours  Cracks started to appear in the story when China's exchanges claimed they hadn't heard the news and tried to verify it with the PBOC itself, finding no information.  ""We didn't get any official announcement,"" said Star Xu, CEO of major exchange OKCoin.  ""We haven't seen any concrete evidence of any of this yet,"" said Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCChina, saying the story seemed to be just a rumour, but that he'd stay tuned for any updates.  OKCoin later posted on its Weibo account (a 'human' translation via Reddit):  ""In order to prevent panic (and large volume of trading) like the last time false news came out on 21 March, we have already set up enough resources to deal with situations like this when they arise. There is no related press release on the website of People’s Bank of China. We condemn the use of false news news used to cause panic. OKcoin will pay close attention to news about regulation.""  The leaders of Huobi and BTCTrade also both reportedly denied receiving any official announcement from the People's Bank.  Could it be true?  There is a twist in the tale, though: the reporter who wrote the story for Caixin, generally regarded as a reputable news magazine, said he is sticking by his story, and has posted on various social media sites about its verity.  Last week's hoax not only saw bitcoin prices fall, it caused a 'flash crash' that dropped the litecoin price to 1 RMB on Huobi, which had only begun trading the currency two days earlier.  Prices recovered soon after and Huobi compensated those who lost money, but the exchange was then hit by a day-long DDoS attack just two days later.  The poster of last week's hoax remains unknown, and there was no named source in today's news reports.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/bitcoin-price-drops-after-new-chinese-bank-rumours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/412abe5b4c5ef6d21e88b1b87f38a2ae28ff4753-617x326.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377057,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4gb,1395916299,Mining Malware Infects Mobile Market via Google Play Apps,"Cryptocurrency mining malware for PC platforms has been around for a while, but now it has gone mobile, specifically via the Android OS.  A team of security researchers from Trend Micro has managed to identify two apps that can use your Android device to mine litecoin and dogecoin.  The apps in question are called Songs and Prized, and both are available from the Google Play Store. Songs has between one and five million downloads so far, while Prized has 10,000 to 50,000 downloads.  This is not the first case of mining malware targeting new and unusual platforms. Linux recently got what was likely its first taste of mining malware with the Darlloz worm.  The Android ecosystem is quite a bit bigger, but targeting it is rather pointless from a mining point of view because the hardware simply isn't up to the job.  Malware to the moon  The researchers identified the malware as ANDROIDOS_KAGECOIN.HBT, which has previously been found in repackaged copies of several popular apps, including Football Manager Handheld and TuneIn Radio.  The apps were injected with CPU mining code from a legitimate Android mining app, based on cpuminer. This time around the malware was found on Google Play apps, rather than repackaged apps from third-party app stores.  Google's hands-off approach to app vetting (or lack thereof) will probably be blamed for the mess, but in all fairness this would not be the first time a big tech firm was used to spread cryptocurrency malware.  On New Year's Eve, Yahoo's European servers were piggybacked to spread mining malware to a large number of PCs, but the attack appears to have been limited and relatively unsuccessful.  Once installed, this strain launched CPUminer and connected to a dynamic domain, where it was redirected to an anonymous dogecoin mining pool.  Trend Micro said:  ""By February 17, his network of mobile miners has earned him thousands of dogecoins. After February 17, the cybercriminal changed mining pools. The malware is configured to download a file, which contains the information necessary to update the configuration of the miner. This configuration file was updated, and it now connects to the well-known WafflePool mining pool.""  The researchers now say they have identified exactly the same behaviour in apps downloaded from Google Play. At press time, both apps were still available on Google's app store.  This time around, the miner has been configured to mine litecoins rather than dogecoins. However, the focus was initially on dogecoins and researchers believe that the cybercriminal behind the malware ""accumulated a great deal"" of dogecoins.  Clever but pointless  Although this attack has infected many thousands of devices, researchers seem baffled by the fact that someone chose to attempt it in the first place. Smartphones simply don't have enough processing power to mine cryptocurrencies effectively, and battery life is a further problem.  Trend Micro points out:  ""Clever as the attack is, whoever carried it out may not have thought things through. Phones do not have sufficient performance to serve as effective miners. Users will also quickly notice the odd behavior of the miners – slow charging and excessively hot phones will all be seen, making the miner’s presence not particularly stealthy. Yes, they can gain money this way, but at a glacial pace.""  Trend Micro points out that there are plenty of telltale signs that point to an infection. CPUs in mobile devices spent much of their time idling, so it is relatively easy to notice that something is wrong.  The battery drains quickly and recharges slowly, but heat is an even bigger giveaway. As anyone who was ever hooked on mobile games knows, phones and tablets heat up quickly even after a few minutes of gameplay, as the System-on-Chip (SoC) processor kicks into high gear and starts operating at the highest possible clocks when faced with a lot of load.  It should be relatively easy to figure out if any app is mining in the background. Users who happen to notice unusual behaviour on their devices, such as a hot phone and low battery life, can easily identify the app responsible (go to: Settings > Battery), and remove it.  It goes without saying that the two apps mentioned above should be removed from your phone immediately, if you have them installed.  The ARM-based SoCs used in the vast majority of Android devices today simply don't have the muscle to mine cryptocurrencies. They are designed to be efficient and operate within strict thermal and power envelopes, necessitated by the size of the device and, of course, the capacity of the on-board battery.  Even the latest and most powerful ARM-based application processors used in high-end Android smartphones and tablets, such as the Snapdragon 800, Tegra 4 or Exynos 5, don't have a fraction of the computing power needed to mine digital currencies in any sensible amount of time.  In other words, there probably aren't that many malware developers who are willing to waste time on Android mining. The fact that someone has tried it does not mean that others will follow suit, as the returns are simply too low.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/mining-malware-infects-mobile-market-via-google-play-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c654c10ca021dd832b683ef70bb6fc8a46a18d7-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4qf,1395888483,"Despite Challenges, Bitcoin Technology is Here to Stay","Two economists and an entrepreneur weighed in on the troubles facing bitcoin and how to address them in a CoinSummit San Francisco. Panelists included Susan Athey, senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economics Policy Research; Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Coinometrics; and Andreas Antonopoulos, the Chief Security Officer of Blockchain.  The session was moderated by Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times.  The session was titled, ""Is Bitcoin a Flash in the Pan?"" but right off the bat, the panelists agreed that the digital currency – or at least the block chain concept upon which it is built – is here to stay.  Challenges facing bitcoin today include the high energy demands of mining, the way bitcoins are distributed, security concerns, the difficulties presented by bitcoin's anonymity yet lack of privacy and expected challenges from regulators. Some of these things could be fixed by innovations yet to come, either in the form of changes to the protocol or in the form of a new alternative currency that could supplant bitcoin, they said.  But, this does not mean that Satoshi Nakamoto – whoever he, she or they are – should have done things differently from the get-go, Athey said.  Mining, for instance, might need to be tweaked in the future, but it was the perfect way to get bitcoin off the ground, she said:    ""When you think about what it takes to develop interest and trust in something new like this, the fact that the way the design managed to accomplish that is kind of amazing. Not only was this group brilliant at security, but they also thought through the incentives, and the thing they created captured the imagination as well as the investment of a large group of people. Mining provided a financial reason to be involved, which then helped grow the whole system.      That said, I wish it didn't take so much electricity,""    Levin, however, objected to the way that bitcoins have been distributed.  ""The distribution of coins came out far too quickly for something that should scale over a very long period of time, and disproportionately rewarded early adopters.""  Another problem Levin cited was that as much as 10% of all bitcoins are reportedly in the hands of criminals who have stolen them through hacking or other misbehavior.  ""We have the bitcoin price going through the roof, giving material value to those people,"" he said.  But Antonopoulos called the 10% statistic ""a vast improvement over the rest of our economy, where 80% is in the hands of criminals – and that's the banks."" His comment was met with applause.  The very nature of the block chain, which makes all transactions public but records only addresses, no real names, provides both too much and too little anonymity to users, depending on the point of view, the panelists said.    ""For fitting into a regulatory framework, it can be very important that if you trade a dollar for a bitcoin, that you know where your bitcoin is landing, that you know the identity of that wallet is not, say, in North Korea, that it's not subject to sanctions.      On the other hand, if you thought about a company doing a lot of its internal business over the block chain, then they would have to take a lot of effort to make sure they aren't revealing company secrets that way. The current system is the worst of both worlds in some ways.""    There are technological ways to fix this, but until regulators say what kind of information they're going to want, it's difficult to know what approach to take, Athey said.  Antonopoulos disputed whether regulators will have the ability to dictate changes in how bitcoin works: ""We don't know what regulators are going to ask for, but I think I know what my answer will be: no.""  Governments must beware of being too heavy-handed with bitcoin, he said. If not, they run the risk not only of pushing bitcoin activity into other countries, but also giving rise to more secretive technologies.  ""If they try to stomp on bitcoin, they will discover that bitcoin was a little gecko technology, like Napster was the benign file sharing technology. When you stomp on the gecko, it becomes a Komodo dragon and then bites off your foot next time you try to stomp it,"" Antonopoulos said.

42377059,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4e5,1395883839,Robocoin Offers Bitcoin ATM Operators 0% Fees for Life,"Las Vegas-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin has announced it is lowering its operator fees to 0% as part of a new offer aimed at making its machine owners more competitive on the global marketplace.  Robocoin  had previously taken 34% of the transaction fees set by its operators on its bitcoin ATMs, meaning if an operator set fees at 3%, Robocoin would net 1% of those earnings.  As part of the new offering, operators can pay $10,000 for a lifetime license that allows them to bypass fees for life. The $10,000 cost is an introductory price that will run through 30th April.  Alternatively, operators can forego the added $10,000 cost and pay $20,000 for the BTC ATM and 1% of its fees going forward to the company.  Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley spoke to CoinDesk about the announcement, saying that the measure is proof of its commitment to its customers and to the bitcoin ecosystem at large.  ""Our goal of the company is to ensure that our operators are profitable, that they're operating at the best prices and that we're building our network around the world.""  Kelley indicated that in today's fast-moving digital currency ecosystem, the fees being imposed on new consumers are proving to be an obstacle to adoption, one that his company is committed to doing its part to reduce.  The CEO added: ""We're just guys that like to push the envelope.""  Improving overall service  Kelley sees the new, lower fees as yet another reason operators should choose Robocoin over the available alternatives, saying that individual value propositions don't matter when you consider the overall service a company provides.  Said Kelley:  ""You want a machine that has longevity, a machine that doesn't require you to stand next to it, a machine that can auto-enroll customers with full know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance so that you're protecting yourself from any regulatory scrutiny.""  Further, Kelley indicated that the move will also open up a new customer base for operators, hopefully enticing the large number of early bitcoin adopters who aren't keen to pay 7% on a transaction.  Demonstrating commitment  Of course, Kelley also indicated that lowering fees is just another way Robocoin is demonstrating its desire to improve the overall ecosystem.  Said Kelley:  ""I think our company takes a serious responsibility when it comes to bringing bitcoin to the world, and that this makes a big statement to anyone who wants to operate a Robocoin that our goal is to offer the best hardware and to ensure that our guys are the most profitable.""  Though operators could choose not to pass along reduced fees to their customers, Kelley suggested that this outcome is unlikely.  ""You're going to be getting a ton of pressure. [...] We've done the numbers, the numbers look wonderful when you drop fees low.""  Kelley indicated that Robocoin's data shows a clear connection between lower fees and higher volume.  More in store  Kelley did not elaborate, but hinted that the new pricing model is part of a larger plan that the company plans to unveil later this year, hence the limited run.  Notably, he did return to the subject of remittances, noting that for Robocoin to truly compete in the global remittance market, the 5% to 7% fees imposed by operators on transactions needed to decline.  Further, he added that consumers who remit money through traditional means will typically pay just 3% to 5% on transactions of $400 to $500, potentially indicating that Robocoin has bigger plans beyond simply providing buying and selling services.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/27/robocoin-offers-bitcoin-atm-operators-0-fees-for-life,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1b995ac6cff32e073b54020a05090091b1e9ba8-1001x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4pP,1395878546,"Why Bitcoin Needs Slang, ATMs and Dogecoin to Achieve Mass Adoption","The question of how to encourage mainstream adoption of digital currencies was discussed in a panel on Wednesday, 26th March, as part of day two of CoinSummit San Francisco.  The talk included Alan Safahi of ZipZap; Lamassu CEO Zach Harvey; and angel investor Brock Pierce from Clearstone Venture Partners.  The session was moderated by David Lee of SV Angel.    _______________________________________________________________      How can consumers get bitcoin?      That may seem like a simple question, but it's one that bitcoin aficionados are asked often, even five years into the construction of an ecosystem that many are predicting could have the massive, lasting impact of the Internet.    The CoinSummit panel ""Bitcoin for the masses - How to get Bitcoin in the hands of millions of people?"" tackled this question, and as the panel proved, it's an issue with which the industry is still grappling.  Transition technology  The panelists indicated that though bitcoin can be a transformative technology, ultimately upending the way that people interact with money, getting it to a large number of people is going to necessitate a reliance on systems consumers are accustomed to.  That's why bitcoin ATMs and gift cards are picking up steam in the bitcoin economy.  Angel investor Brock Pierce, agreed:  ""I like, in the near-term, transitionary technologies that can allow for mass adoption.""  Lamassu ATMs is one of the more prominent transitionary companies. Zach Harvey, Lamassu's CEO, said that his company's machines have a wow factor that helps people easily get on board with bitcoin.  Said Harvey:  ""We try to make the machine as shiny and sexy as possible. I think the experience, that’s when people start understanding it.""  ZipZap offers another easy entry point in the form of bitcoin purchases at retail outlets.  CEO Alan Safahi said that people just have to use BTC, then a gradual understanding - not unlike what happened with email 20 years ago - will take place. Safahi explained:  ""Trust comes from having used it [bitcoin], overcoming objections and fear. It’s just like email. You trust that it works.""  Ease of use  Dogecoin came on the cryptocurrency scene as a total lark, but its ability to convey a simple message is what has made it such a transformative altcoin, the panelists said.  As noted at last week's Bitconference California, many people who have gotten on the dogecoin bandwagon probably haven't even touched bitcoin. It's brought a totally different crowd, especially women and younger people who never have been interested in bitcoin.  Said Pierce: ""Almost all of the altcoins, with the exception of dogecoin, people had had experiences with bitcoin.""  Safahi told the audience that adoption is about breaking down decentralized forms of money into simple language.  ""I think part of the branding strategy is making the terminology more user friendly.""  Not many dogecoin fans care about things like risk, volatility and compliance. To them, dogecoin is just a new way to give credit for interesting things that are on the internet. ""People aren’t concerned about volatility [with dogecoin]. They are kind of just giving it away,"" said Pierce.  Harvey thinks slang could make digital currencies a cool thing with people, and perhaps less exclusive.  ""Once bitcoin gets hip enough, it will have its own slang. And that will be enough,"" he said.
