42430004,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM30Ph,1543860060,"US Government Interested in Tracking Privacy Coins, New Document Shows","The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) wants to know if it's feasible to track transactions conducted using privacy coins.  A new pre-solicitation document published by the DHS Small Business Innovation Research Program discusses the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin for transactions. While the document notes that there are both commercial and government uses for crypto, the topic specifically focuses on finding a way to conduct forensic analysis on privacy-focused coins if they are used for criminal activity.  In the document, DHS highlights that platforms such as zcash and monero emphasize privacy and anonymity as key features, making it difficult to determine where a transaction originates or how much is sent.  ""While these features are desirable, there is similarly a compelling interest in tracing and understanding transactions and actions on the blockchain of an illegal nature,"" it reads.  From the document:  ""This proposal calls for solutions that enable law enforcement investigations to perform forensic analysis on blockchain transactions. This analysis can be approached in any number of ways and may consider different data situation use cases depending on whether additional data from off-chain sources are available.""  While the document cites zcash and monero as two examples of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, it also notes that new platforms can be developed with similar features. As such, any proposed solution would have to either be applicable more generally or ""provide working approaches to treating newer blockchain implementations.""  The file outlines three phases such a proposal would follow.  The document notes that it is neither a solicitation nor a Request for Proposals, meaning the agency is not looking for specific solutions at this time. Rather, interested parties can contact topic authors until Dec. 18 to either provide a comment or ask technical questions. The actual solicitation is expected to be released around Dec. 19.

42381359,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LV9,1543845645,Thai Government Trials Blockchain in Fight Against Tax Fraud,"A government agency in Thailand is trialing blockchain tech as a means to track value-added tax (VAT) payments in the country.  According to a report from the Bangkok Post on Monday, Thailand’s Revenue Department is considering implementing blockchain to prevent fraudulent VAT refund claims in the country. VAT is a form of consumption tax levied on goods and services.  Ekniti Nitithanprapas, director-general of the Revenue Department was quoted as saying that blockchain would help verify VAT invoices and in turn help eliminate any that were not genuine. The agency is also reportedly planning to tap other emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data to prevent tax evasion and fraud.  The news comes after a similar move by a tax authority in China back in May. At the time, the Shenzhen National Taxation Bureau partnered with internet giant Tencent to use blockchain in the fight against tax evasion.  The project was aimed to create digital invoice on a blockchain platform as proof of purchase for goods and services, again with the purpose of combating fake invoices and “improve the invoice supervision process.”  Thailand is starting to embrace blockchain technology in other areas too. In June, the country’s central bank, the Bank of Thailand, said it was carrying out a trial of its own cryptocurrency aimed to make interbank transactions both faster and cheaper.  And, in July, a self-regulatory organization called the Thailand Bond Market Association said it was developing a private blockchain system to speed up corporate bond settlement in the country.

42381357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LTt,1543838727,GM Patent Touts Blockchain As Data Solution for Self-Driving Cars,"General Motors (GM) may be eyeing a blockchain platform to manage data from future fleets of automated cars.  A patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office details a process by which self-driving cars would be able to store all their data on a distributed ledger. The document, produced by GM Global Technology Operations LLC, further notes that any data stored could be easily shared among the blockchain's users.  As one notable use case for the blockchain-based data, the firm suggested a role in navigation, explaining:  ""It is desirable to provide locations information and densities of vehicles in regions in an online blockchain ledger for interoperable information sharing between vehicles of participants for use in navigating routes.""  Sharing data between different independent platforms is also proposed in the filing. A blockchain exchange for municipalities, local authorities and public facilities such as airports could, it says, determine the ""validity of permits and licenses to operate as hacks, taxis, or other for-hire services."" Further, if a vehicle is ticketed, that information could be shared with a blockchain run by the relevant authority.  Tying payments into the system would allow cars to maintain balances to cover charges related to tolls, parking and other fee based services, the filing adds.  GM has spent considerable time and effort on such autonomous vehicles, announcing in March that it would begin production of their autonomous vehicles next year. The automaker has also already begun efforts to explore blockchain technology. It joined other automotive companies like BMW to form the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) as an effort to push innovation in the blockchain-auto space.

42381373,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95Liz,1543834855,Bitcoin Price Could Snap Three-Year Winning Streak in December,"Bitcoin (BTC) may break its three-year December winning streak unless prices convincingly cross key resistance at $4,410 in the next few days.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value gained 14 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent in the last month of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. (BPI).  The odds, however, are stacked against BTC extending that winning streak this year.  To start with, BTC's convincing break below the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) last month signaled a resumption of the bear market from the record high of $20,000 reached 12 months ago. Essentially, the bears are in control while prices are trading below the key EMA, currently located at $5,747  Further, the corrective bounce from recent lows below $3,500 ran out of steam near $4,410 last Thursday, validating the strong bearish view put forward by the break below the 21-month EMA.  Meanwhile, historical data shows BTC broke a similar three-year December winning streak in 2013.  As seen above, BTC scored gains in December in 2010, 2011 and 2012 before ending the trend in 2013 with a 33 percent drop.  With bears seemingly in control after November's sell-off, that historical pattern looks set to repeat.  That said, the odds of BTC extending the December winning streak would rise if prices clear the newly established resistance of $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980 on Bitstamp, representing 1.1 percent drop from its monthly opening price of $4,024.  Daily chart  As seen above, the bullish divergence of the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) confirmed last Wednesday has failed to produce a notable rally, which indicates bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  Moreover, BTC created a doji candle on Thursday, signaling indecision in the marketplace despite a bullish divergence, falling below $4,000 on Friday and confirming an end to the corrective bounce. Essentially, the cryptocurrency has carved out a lower high (bearish pattern) at $4,400.  The 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to re-test the recent low of $3,474.  However, a convincing break above $4,400 (Nov. 29 high) would revive the bullish view and allow a sustained rally to psychological resistance of $5,000.  Weekly chart  The descending triangle breakdown (bearish continuation pattern) and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week EMAs indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The 14-week RSI is holding well above 30.00 (undersold territory), meaning there is scope for a drop toward $3,000.  View  The probability of BTC extending the December winning streak this year is quite low.  BTC's lower high at $4,400 marked the end of the corrective bounce. Therefore, a re-test of the recent low of $3,474 cannot be ruled out.  BTC will likely score gains in December for the fourth year straight if newly established resistance at $4,400 is convincingly scaled in the next few days.

42381354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LOr,1543831262,"Security Token Offerings ‘Illegal,’ Says Beijing Financial Watchdog","Huo Xuewen, chief of Beijing’s Municipal Bureau of Finance, has warned projects against holding security token offerings (STOs).  At a recent wealth management forum hosted by the bureau on Saturday, Huo said that STO fund-raising activities are “illegal,” at least in Beijing.  “I will issue a risk warning to those who promote and issue STO tokens in Beijing. My advice is to only engage in such offerings when the government has legalized them,” he said.  An STO is similar to an initial coin offering (ICO), in which crypto tokens are sold by a company to the public in order to raise funds. However, STOs also allow the token holders to share in the profits of a company based on an underlying asset.  Chinese authorities have been taking measures against token fundraising since September 2017, when the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) banned ICOs outright, and forced crypto exchanges to cease operations. Last month, the PBoC said it would clamp down on free distributions of crypto tokens called airdrops.  In the summer, Pan Gongsheng, a vice president at the PBoC, said the central bank planned to hit back hard against ICO projects that had moved overseas yet continued to target investors on the Chinese mainland.  He said at the time: “Any new financial product or phenomenon that is not authorized under the existing legal framework, we will crush them as soon as they dare to surface.”  And, in August, the finance department of China’s Guangzhou Development District issued a notice to local businesses, prohibiting them from hosting any crypto-related promotions or events.

42381371,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LgT,1543827606,Crypto Winter Is Here and We Only Have Ourselves to Blame,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ------------    I have a friend who has made a significant fortune out of bitcoin. He is one of those enthusiasts who happily hands out the cryptocurrency to others in the interest of spreading adoption.  All of that is good. However, one thing has always infuriated me: his boasts, especially last year, that he was spreading belief in bitcoin because the small amount he’d distributed to random people over the years was now worth X times more in dollar terms. He loved it, he said, when they’d call to thank him.  Why on earth would I have an issue with this generosity of spirit? Because it perpetuated a narrative that speculative gains, measured in fiat currency terms, was bitcoin’s core value proposition for the world.  Implicitly, the story my friend told to these people was not that, as a model for censorship-resistant, disintermediated money, bitcoin has the potential to enable peer-to-peer exchange without rent-seeking financial institutions dictating the terms.  Nor was it that we now have the makings of digital cash, a means of transferring value from anyone anywhere to anyone anywhere that doesn’t require a bank account or the approval of some authority.  The underlying message was not that bitcoin is the first digital asset, a representation of value that can live on the Internet without risk of replication or counterfeiting. Neither was it that we now have an ostensibly immutable, consensus-based record-keeping system, the first in history that cannot be changed by someone in power.  No, his story was quite simply that if you hang onto this thing – never mind understanding it – you too can get rich like me.  My friend is not alone, of course. Last year, as an insane market bubble, not only in bitcoin but also in countless other crypto assets, fostered a collective mania around the world, the “to the moon” language and “when Lambo?” mindset permeated everything. It even found its way into the mainstream public.  I’ll never forget a relative who’d paid no attention to crypto beforehand asking me what coin she should buy. After warning her that she really shouldn’t do this, I nonetheless started explaining why I had an intellectual, non-investor interest in ASIC-resistant coins. She replied, “I don’t understand any of that, just tell me what to buy.”  This mania was the making of crypto enthusiasts everywhere. They fostered a blind faith in the Midas touch of their industry. Remember, this was a time when an iced tea producer’s executives briefly showed that they could produce a miraculous share price increase simply by adding the word “blockchain” to the corporate name.  For a community that likes to declare that you can trust crypto because, unlike fiat money, it’s backed, not by wishy-washy people, but by rock-solid math, this encouragement of magical thinking was pretty hypocritical. Now that the bubble has well and truly burst, it is time to banish the voodoo mentality.  The adoption challenge  Some view cryptocurrency solely as a tool of the rich, as a way for the privileged few to keep their property away from the prying hands of the state. If I eventually discover that they’re right, that that’s all it can be, I’ll quit.  For now, though, I still see this technology as a tool of the people, and therefore believe it can only succeed with mass adoption. I don’t care how it gets there – whether by widespread retail usage or by the back-office use of public blockchain architectures to foster a new, decentralized economy – the goal must be to positively impact lives everywhere.  Sadly, I think we’ve set that objective back drastically. We’ve managed to do great harm to the public’s acceptance of and trust in the technology. It’s not irreparable, but it’s fair to say we have a problem when the mainstream now equates crypto with bubbles, scams and losses.  To be sure, this price correction might yet imitate that which followed the late-2013 bubble – a two-year hiatus followed by a revival rally in 2016 that took us to ever higher highs in 2017. But the risk is that the 2018 downturn has produced more lasting damage to public confidence than that of 2014. This time it was the Regular Joes who lost their shirts, not the basement-dwelling bitcoin mining hobbyists.  The blow to confidence is so great that I now regret writing last year that the surge of mainstream interest in crypto was constructive. I’d argued that although many people would lose a lot of money, the surge of buying had sparked a curiosity among a much wider group of people, such that a host of new ventures would be launched by these newcomers. These were the people, I argued, who would build the decentralized economy of the future.  Now, while I’m encouraged to find that many of newly activated innovators are still at it, I don’t think I fairly accounted for the lasting societal effect of so many others losing their shirts.  The angry posts that someone with the Twitter handle @CandleHater compiled into this useful thread are, quite likely, representative of the masses’ feelings.  Rebuilding confidence  Bitcoin is now down roughly 75% from its highs, ether is off about 90% and the overall token market capitalization is 80% lower. Such a brutal meltdown will do great damage to confidence in the sector.  What are the consequences of that loss of confidence?  It means that a hardline critic like Nouriel Roubini is now, in people’s minds, legitimized, regardless of his simplistic, static view of the technology’s ongoing development.  And it means that government regulators, whose obligations are to those same mainstream constituents, will take a more wary view of the technology and, quite likely, a harder line in regulating it. For crypto startups, this will further exclude them from markets, make it even harder to get bank accounts and impose even greater compliance burdens on them.  The good news is that the glare of public opinion will eventually dissipate and that as the spotlight diminishes, real developers will find themselves in a healthier environment within which to do the work needed to unlock this technology’s potential. We saw a similar period of constructive building during the 2014-2016 hiatus.  But whatever new products are produced, they will now have a harder time struggling with acceptance. Whether we like it or not, message and image are important.  Sadly, the Crypto Winter is here. If we are to extract ourselves from it there needs to be more than a sleeves-rolled-up commitment to technical development. The leaders of the community – those of us who have a mouthpiece in social media and elsewhere – also have an obligation to change the message.  The message must be one of education. It must openly address the technology’s cons along with its pros, as well as the formidable obstacles it faces in terms of scaling, efficiency and security.  Let’s quit this ugly obsession with price. After all, it simply validates the notion that the benchmark that matters is not bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency but the U.S. dollar.  We made this mess. It’s up to us to clean it up.  Winter image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael J.

42381358,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LRN,1543820428,Funds Network Calastone to Roll Out Blockchain Settlements in 2019,"Calastone, the operator of a London-based transaction network for investment funds, is looking to move its entire settlements system to a blockchain by May 2019.  According to a Financial Times report on Sunday, Calastone, which provides services to over 1,700 firms including JP Morgan Asset Management, estimates the plan could help the industry save up to £3.4 billion (or $4.3 billion) in fund distribution costs, excluding the U.S. market.  Currently, Calastone’s processes for settling funds are still manual, including over 9 million messages and transactions worth about $217 billion a month between buyers, sellers and distributors, according to the firm's website. It's now eyeing blockchain as a way to automate these processes in order to make them cheaper and more efficient since the parties involved will no longer need to submit the same information multiple times.  In June 2017, Calastone claimed it successfully completed the first phase of a blockchain proof-of-concept for ""distributed market infrastructure,"" and said at the time it would move its system to a private, permissioned blockchain network in 2019.  ""A blockchain-enabled marketplace means alleviating operational inefficiencies, increasing performance and generating greater savings – a win-win for everybody,"" Calastone’s deputy CEO Ken Tregidgo said at the time.  Back in February, Calastone predicted that moving to blockchain could help the global mutual funds market save over $2.5 billion a year, using data from a 2016 Deloitte study.  Other players in the asset management industry are also looking to bring mutual fund transactions onto blockchain platforms. As early as 2016, five major British mutual fund operators, including Aberdeen Asset Management and Aviva Investors, collaborated on exploring blockchain in trading systems to reduce costs.  Last year in December, U.S. mutual funds manager Vanguard said it will begin using smart contracts in some of its business operations soon. Nasdaq and Sweden’s SEB bank also tested blockchain for mutual fund trading in September 2017.

42381366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LbR,1543813228,"Ping An's New Pitch for Blockchain: Shared Ledger, But Banks Keep Clients","Ping An, the Chinese insurance giant that built the eTradeConnect blockchain, is modifying the platform to give its 12 participating banks more control over customer relationships.  Frank Lu, head of the blockchain division of OneConnect, PingAn’s fintech arm, and the architect of eTradeConnect, told CoinDesk his team is revising the way businesses submit their data for trade financing from the network. Instead of going to a central portal, they will have to sign up through individual banks.  First revealed in 2017 as a proof-of-concept by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and formally launched in October 2018, eTradeConnect aims to bring efficiency to the trade finance market in Hong Kong for small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) while preventing fraud.  Major banks that participate in the blockchain network include HSBC, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas in Hong Kong, Bank of East Asia, and the Hong Kong branches of all four state-owned commercial banks in China.  The idea is to let one participating bank verify a customer’s credentials based on transaction history and status of purchase orders so that the SME can borrow money, pledging future payments as collateral.  By putting this data on a distributed network, the project is expected to make it easier for a customer to obtain further financing, but at the same time prevent them from borrowing a total amount from multiple banks that exceeds their credit lines.  Currently, SMEs register for the service through a portal run by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL), a subsidiary of the HKMA incorporated specifically for the initiative. Then they choose the bank they want to work with.  But this approach will soon be revised, Lu said, in a bid to give banks more control of where corporates could choose to go.  ""Customers have a different goal. They would want more options for financing,"" he said, adding:  ""But at the same time, big banks don’t want to become a selection button in a drop-down menu.""  Lu admitted that this may not be in the best interest of SMEs, but said that at the end of the day, ""this is a game.""  ""In my view, customers need money, and banks are the ones that hold this money. So eventually it’s a seller’s market. But the existing model has made it easier to launch the platform and to make it running steadily,"" he said. ""The next step is migration to get rid of the HKMA’s portal so that banks will feel more comfortable introducing their customers into the network [via their own platforms].""  Josh Kroeker, HSBC‘s blockchain lead for global commercial banking, told CoinDesk that it will be convenient in the future if customers can access eTradeConnect via banks’ own platforms rather than ""a standalone portal.""  A spokesperson from the HKMA said in an email response that while the modification is still in the planning phase, the agency envisions bank customers eventually connecting to eTradeConnect through banks' e-banking systems, open APIs or web user interfaces.  'The only way'  Similar competitive concerns among banks are why Ping An built eTradeConnect using zero-knowledge proofs, a technology that allows someone to prove that they have knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.  After all, just as banks are naturally unwilling to let their customers go to the other side of the street, they are equally wary of disclosing their customers’ information to their competitors on a shared ledger.  ""No banks would want to entirely share the information. That’s also why there is always a lot of talks about blockchain, but very few in actual practice,"" said Lu, who joined Ping An in July 2016 from IBM, where he was one of the creators of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.  Echoing that point, HSBC's Kroeker said that ""data privacy/encryption is a key consideration during any trade finance platform design, as banks and corporates do not want their competitive trade data shared unnecessarily.""  He added: ""Technologies like zero-knowledge proof are very appealing as it allows these validations to occur without sharing commercially sensitive data.""  In fact, Lu claims that zero-knowledge proofs are the only way to make any blockchain trade platform to come to fruition.  ""My thinking and vision for enterprise blockchain wasn’t entirely clear when I was at IBM, but now I believe full encryption is the only way out for consortium blockchains,"" he said.  That’s because in Lu’s view the model balances the goals of using a distributed ledger to boost efficiency with letting banks maintain their business secrets.  When a customer submits information to a bank, the bank has absolute control, Lu said, yet when that information is sent out for cross-checking, it’s all encrypted, and no other parties will be able to see the information inside.  For instance, he explained, if a customer has a $10 million purchase order and goes to, say, Standard Chartered to borrow $5 million, the bank will verify the information and then grant the request.  Now, if this hypothetical customer goes to HSBC to borrow another $7 million, Standard Chartered won't share the customer’s exact information with HSBC. Instead, HSBC will run the customized zero-knowledge proof algorithm to get a simple result of ""true"" or ""false.""  ""In this case, the result will be 'false' because the total amount goes above the total collateral already,"" Lu said, adding that's all that HSBC needs to know.  Yet because of the zero-proof knowledge algorithm, neither Ping An nor the banks will have a clear idea of the size or volume of transactions handled by others on the network.  ""If you ask me about transaction volume, I honestly don’t know. Ping An is not able to and [would] not dare to get access to this information,"" Lu said. ""That’s because each node encrypts information with their own private keys.""  The more, the merrier  With eTradeConnect now launched and handling live transactions, another key question for the network is how many customers will opt in and how big these clients will be.  To help create a network effect, earlier this month the HKMA announced a plan to link eTradeConnect with We.trade, the European trade finance blockchain built by IBM on Hyperledger Fabric that went live in July.  Both Kroeker and Lu said the technical integration work is progressing steadily but declined to share more details on the timeline.  However, technology may be the last thing Lu feels concerned about.  Rather, to make full use of cross-border blockchain trade platforms, Lu said the key is to onboard clients with scale.  ""First of all, one single financial product must exist in both networks. And clients on the two platforms need to be sufficiently large,"" he said, adding:  ""Technology now is not really a challenge. But for a buyer in Europe, it better have a large partner based in Asia. Otherwise, it’s just better off finding a seller within the same region.""  However, Kroeker said HSBC is taking its time to make sure the technology and product can work smoothly before widely marketing the solution.  He added that in the past several weeks, HSBC concluded two live transactions for Hong Kong clients – one for house-ware retailer Pricerite, the other with global manufacturer Mainetti.  ""The platform is definitely being used. But in terms of wide commercialization, are we rolling this out to 100,000 clients right now? Not yet."" Kroeker said. ""That’s something we want to make sure we are taking feedback on board from these corporate clients and use that to prove this solution.""  Ping An’s move into blockchain is also one example of how China’s largest insurer is making efforts to sell fintech services to overseas institutions.  Established in the 1980s as one of the first institutions in China owned by both the private and public sectors, Ping An has grown into the world’s largest insurance company, according to Forbes’ 2018 Global 2000 list, followed by AXA and Allianz.  As internet companies in China such as Alibaba and JD.com have moved into financial services with insurance and financing offerings, Ping An launched OneConnect, aiming to sell technology services, including blockchain infrastructure.  A report from the Financial Times this year said the fintech subsidiary was even eyeing an initial public offering in Hong Kong to raise $2 billion.  Lu said OneConnect is now planning to launch a similar blockchain trade finance platform in mainland China for a consortium of small and medium-size banks early next year. He concluded:  ""By using OneConnect’s technology, we want to create our own ecosystem.""  eTradeConnect launch image courtesy to HKFintech Week",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/03/ping-ans-new-pitch-for-blockchain-shared-ledger-but-banks-keep-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a150b305430f3f06c48536d4159deee69cd861b-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
