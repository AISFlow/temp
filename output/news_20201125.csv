42433234,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44Hh,1606344706,Gary Gensler Under Consideration for Deputy Treasury Secretary Role: Report,"UPDATE (Dec. 2, 2020, 04:50 UTC): President-elect Joe Biden announced Monday that he would nominate Obama Foundation president and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Chief of Staff Adewale Adeyemo as Deputy Treasury Secretary.      President-elect Joe Biden may name former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler to become Deputy Treasury Secretary, CNBC reported Wednesday.      Gensler, who is currently heading Biden's financial oversight transition team, would report to former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, Biden's reported nominee for the top spot at the Treasury Department. He is perhaps best known for his work developing derivatives rules in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis under former President Barack Obama, but has experience working in the Treasury Department, as an assistant secretary for financial markets in the late 1990s.      It's unclear how federal regulators might approach the crypto space under a Biden administration. His picks for key administration positions so far include Yellen and Roger Ferguson as his National Economic Council director, according to CNBC. However, their top priority is likely to be addressing the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.      Gensler brings a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency space, saying in 2018 that, ""I’m an optimist, I want to see this technology succeed, it is in essence about the plumbing of the financial system and it’s a new technology that can really enhance the financial system.""      Others with significant familiarity with cryptocurrency on Biden's transition team include MIT Professor Simon Johnson, Georgetown University law professor Chris Brummer, University of California – Irvine School of Law professor Mehrsa Baradaran and Columbia University law professor Lev Menand.      Each of these individuals has weighed in on the potential benefits or complications of using cryptocurrencies for various issues.

42433245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44hh,1606339874,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Loses Momentum at $19.4K; Ethereum Fees Increasing,"The number of billion-dollar spot volume days in the bitcoin market is increasing, pushing prices higher. Ethereum’s transaction fees are also increasing as general cryptocurrency interest fuels demand.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,883 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.75% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $18,640-$19,474 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin closed in on the $19,500 price point Wednesday, hitting as high as $19,474, according to CoinDesk 20 data, before losing momentum, down to $18,883 as of press time.      “Following a meteoric rise over the past week, bitcoin appears to have consolidated at $19,000 even after briefly dropping below this important psychological milestone,” noted Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro. “This is important because it shows there is support for bitcoin at this valuation for the first time in its history.”      Read More: Bitcoin Options Market Suggests Investors Preparing for All-Time High      “Bitcoin maintains itself above $19,000 so we’re about a 2% move away from approaching the all-time highs last seen in 2017,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “Every day we’re seeing volumes increase across venues.”      Helping to lead bitcoin’s price run is volume. In fact, Tuesday’s $1.8 billion in combined daily volume on five major USD/BTC spot exchanges (Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit and Kraken) is the second largest recorded in 2020, only superseded by March 13’s $1.9 billion level. As of press time, Wednesday’s volume for the five exchanges was approaching $1 billion.      “The last few weeks we've seen volumes rise aggressively and we don't expect that to come off too much over the next few days,” noted Michael Rabkin, head of institutional sales for crypto market maker DV Chain. “From a price perspective, we believe there is a lot of momentum in this risk-on market and cannot see it coming to a halt anytime soon given all the money being printed globally.”      Indeed, the amount of M2 U.S. money stock jumped from $15 trillion in January to $19 trillion in November, a 26% increase of circulating money supply created this year in an effort to stave off coronavirus-inflicted economic problems.      And while many market observers talk about bitcoin’s proximity to an all-time price high, many are ignoring the impact ether has also had on the market. An impending upgrade of the network to Eth 2.0 plus an increase in decentralized finance, or DeFi, use cases seem to be fueling the ether fire. In 2020, bitcoin is up over 162% while ether has gained a whopping 343%.      “The recent Eth 2.0 contract milestone is driving a lot of positive sentiment around ether,” noted John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritium.    Ether fees increasing    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down in Wednesday trading around $581 and slipping 4.1% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Coinbase Will Suspend All Margin Trading Citing CFTC Guidance      Transaction fees on the Ethereum network are rising. On Tuesday, average fees hit 0.00577876 ETH, the highest since Oct. 8.      The website Cryptofees.info, which collects data from Coin Metrics, puts Ethereum in the top spot for fees in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Over the past week, Ethereum has generated almost $3 million in average fees alone, and the network’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Uniswap, SushiSwap and Curve are also in the top five in terms of average one-week fees.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, says this fee data is a sign of the Ethereum network’s user demand. “A quick look at cryptofees.info shows that Ethereum is by far the most used network, even more so than Bitcoin,” noted Mosoff. “Ethereum fees are rising as a result of the appreciation in the price of ETH and demand for usage of the network.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

Both funds launched last November when Mike Novogratz first trained his crypto investments firm's sights on the bitcoin fund space.

BSN later announced it would make 24 public chains permissioned and add them to its domestic version in China by the end of November.      “We anticipate Polkadot to be used by developers across the world to build and run innovative protocols and applications,” said Björn Wagner,co-founder of Parity Technologies behind Polkadot. “The BSN integration will support developers on that journey by enabling them to seamlessly connect to the public chain.”      While Polkadot helps connect both public and permissioned chains with each other on its protocol, it is set to join BSN’s Open Permissioned Blockchain Initiative to provide blockchain services in the Chinese market where decentralized public chains are heavily scrutinized by its government.      BSN will integrate Substrate, which is a native framework used to create dapps in the Polkadot ecosystem, as a standard permissioned framework for developers to deploy and operate private chains on BSN, Yifan He, executive director of BSN Development Association, told CoinDesk.      Dapp developers on BSN will also have access to the Oasis Network, which claims to help developers build private and scalable decentralized finance applications.      “The Oasis Network’s privacy features can also create a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data that allows users to take control of their data and earn rewards for staking it,” Jernej Kos, director at the Oasis Foundation, said in a statement.      Founded in 2018, Oasis has raised over $46 million via a private token sale in the same year. Among its backers are its lead investor Andreessen Horowitz’s A16z crypto fund, Binance, Polychain, Pantera and Electric Capital.      BSN will also be integrating Bityuan, which aims to provide blockchain solutions to companies in China.      “I am seeing commercial use cases built on the Bityuan framework are surging in China recently,” He said. “I believe with this integration BSN will get developers around the world to be excited about building dapps that are enterprise-based and commercial oriented.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | BNB | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/25/chinas-state-sanctioned-blockchain-project-bsn-adds-polkadot-oasis-bityuan-to-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e07ffeb7f5b0f697710eaf647f15ac0118ac01a4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44bh,1606334083,"Despite New Incentives to Stay, Some of OKEx’s Chinese Users Are Determined to Leave","The unexpected five-week-long suspension of OKEx’s crypto withdrawal service has left many of its users, largely based in China, disappointed and determined to leave or reduce holdings on the exchange when withdrawals resume sometime this week.      “We will still trade on OKEx but our investment will be much more diversified and [we] will reduce our position on OKEx to about one-third of our previous one,” Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo, told CoinDesk via WeChat. “Even though we think OKEx is still a trusted exchange, there will be many uncertainties in the future.”      That determination has become even stronger after the Malta-based crypto exchange announced it will launch a mix of compensation and reward programs for users who have used its service during the suspension period.      “If OKEx indeed has enough assets to prepare a scenario where bulk withdrawals take place, it would be a smarter move if they told users ‘go ahead and withdraw your tokens. We will guarantee you will receive your tokens immediately,’” Daniel Wang, founder and chief executive of decentralized token exchange protocol Loopring, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Read more: OKEx’s Withdrawal Suspension Isn’t Behind Bitcoin’s Rally: Analysts      “Launching compensation and reward programs does not sound quite impressive as their marketing strategy to keep their upset users,” Wang added.      OKEx unexpectedly announced on Oct. 16 it suspended all cryptocurrency withdrawals on its platform, saying one of its key holders had “been out of touch” with the exchange because he was “cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations.”      Nonetheless, open interest for both bitcoin futures and options has remained high on OKEx. It still maintains its leading position as the leading derivative crypto exchange with the highest bitcoin futures open interest, at $1.27 billion, according to data source Skew.      Without specifying an exact date for resuming withdrawals, the exchange is preparing to reopen the service sometime this week. But this vagueness has raised questions as to why the date has not been disclosed.      Although “less likely,” some of OKEx’s larger, or ""whale,"" clients may be able to manipulate the exchange’s market right before or after the withdrawal opening for “arbitrage opportunities” if they learn the exact date before anyone else, Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer at crypto data source CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk.      Other scenarios include one where some whales who intend to leave OKEx may convert their bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies for a number of reasons including faster transactions, according to Ki. Or some hedge funds could send bitcoin or tether to OKEx for arbitrage opportunities.      The better scenario from the perspective of bitcoin’s price would be for a large amount of bitcoin to flow from OKEx into non-exchange wallets, bringing less supply on exchanges in general, Ki said. Usually, more bitcoin on exchanges is viewed as a bearish sign because it is seen as increasing selling pressure.      A likely possibility is that more users in China could consider sending their bitcoins to private wallets because their options are limited when it comes to exchanges.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: The OKEx Drama Exposes a Weakness in Crypto Market Infrastructure      Crypto exchanges have largely been running in a gray area ever since China’s government banned crypto trading in 2017, Wang said. Chinese crypto holders have mainly been relying on the “Big Three” exchanges – Binance, Huobi and OKEx – that started in China initially with high trading volumes and relatively good reputations.      Huobi and OKEx have both boasted of their close relationships with the Chinese government. However, running their exchange business in a gray area means that close ties with the government does not guarantee the safety of the exchanges' users’ funds in China, as evidenced by OKEx’s situation.      “We believe that after this incident, the trading volumes on OKEx will decline significantly and institutions will also likely withdraw from it,” Cobo’s Zuo said. “Huobi will have the same potential risks. Binance as well.”      Zuo told CoinDesk his company has started considering opening accounts on other exchanges including FTX, Coinbase and Bitstamp, but it will take a long time to shift those transaction volumes from the Chinese Big Three exchanges.      Flex Yang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, said that what remains attractive on the OKEx platform is a variety of derivative products, which may keep some of the more seasoned traders from leaving the leading derivative crypto exchange.      “In fact, we have seen that some traders have been trading on OKEx despite the withdrawal suspension,” Yang said. “It is expected that users that have been trading some contracts offered on OKEx only will return to OKEx soon.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/25/despite-new-incentives-to-stay-some-of-okexs-chinese-users-are-determined-to-leave,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72968db185a0a54ac8fd8255f356c28bed28d34b-1200x582.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44fh,1606333299,Some Are Calling All-Time Highs for Bitcoin. Here's Why CoinDesk Hasn't Yet,"In a fragmented global market, price quotes are all over the place. That's why CoinDesk created the Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The current debate over what exactly is the all-time-high price of the leading cryptocurrency shows how a sector that is all about decentralization has difficulty coming up with a common pricing system on which everyone can agree.      Depending on whom one asks, the price of bitcoin at any given time can be quoted within a range of hundreds of dollars. For that reason, some outlets are claiming bitcoin has already eclipsed its all-time high set three years ago, while others, including CoinDesk, are saying we're still a ways from the mark. That’s because much like the foreign exchange market, the cryptocurrency market isn’t centralized the way, say, the New York Stock Exchange is.      While individual crypto exchanges are called “centralized,” they are to the extent that trades take place within their platforms. In fact, they are trading the same digital assets found on other exchanges.      One could send bitcoin bought on one exchange to another and then sell it on that second exchange. That opens up arbitrage potential that helps keep prices relatively close together, though with sizable discrepancies. Slippage, differences in liquidity and other costs help explain why prices may be so different across the board.      Likewise, the historic all-time high for bitcoin is also different, depending on the source. CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index uses a weighted average of prices to get a reasonable sense of where bitcoin is or was trading at any particular moment. The average is taken from 10 leading cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase and Kraken. Were one to get a quote on bitcoin from a major exchange at any time of day, it may not be exactly at the BPI’s number but it is quite likely to be very close. Nonetheless, volatile markets can produce the occasional outliers.      For decades, if not centuries, good old-fashioned fiat currencies have been mostly traded over the counter, first in physical marketplaces, then using telephones and computer terminals. As in crypto, the exact price of a floating-rate fiat currency is a function of supply and demand. Thus when futures exchanges use a reference rate to use for their forex contracts, they first decide on what sources will be used, then plug them into a formula of some kind. In many respects, one can think of CoinDesk's BPI as a sort of reference rate for the price of bitcoin.  And for the record, CoinDesk views the all-time high of bitcoin as $19,783. We'll let you know if and when it gets there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/25/some-are-calling-all-time-highs-for-bitcoin-heres-why-coindesk-hasnt-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62762b0f6550760f9b244341621807f6641ebbe7-2560x2022.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It happened three years ago. The last time bitcoin went gangbusters, conversations in dining rooms across America were less about giving thanks than the fear of missing out.      “Should I buy bitcoin?” your uncle may have asked. ""And what’s this about icy ohs? (Can you pass the turnips, puh-lease.)""      It’s evident things are different this time around – and not only because many will be clinking glasses over Zoom rather than their parents' fancy china. Despite positively effervescent markets right now, it seems like the retail crowd isn’t buying. Or if they are, they’re being awful quiet about it.      But that doesn’t mean Mom and Pop aren’t interested in your fixation with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has made headlines in mainstream media for breaking a new market cap. Also, due to the relentless work of such Ethereum chroniclers as Cami Russo and Matt Leising, more people are familiar with terms like “the world computer.”      Presuming your wallet is in profit, the folks may even want to hear more about this ""Mr. Nakamoto"" you’ve been working for. And just what is causing the value of this bitcoin to increase?      See also: What Is Ethereum?      “Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Saylor caused the value to increase,” Matthew Graham, an actual investor and chief executive at Sino Global Capital, said. “We control speculative buying through judicious use of such tools as FOMO and FUD.”    Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer of CoinShares, is crypto’s own caffeine-addicted, fun-loving bomb-thrower. Your parents may recognize her as a key figure in getting the colloquial (and scatological) synonym for small-capped cryptos added to the Congressional Record. Ouriel Ohayon, chief executive of ZenGo, a non-custodial wallet startup that produces research reports known to grind gears among bitcoin maximalists.Kathleen Breitman is one of the co-founders of the community-governed, smart-contract-friendly blockchain Tezos. Matthew Graham is CEO of Sino Global Capital, a decentralized tech investment firm based in China. He will eat your hot pot.    Ahead of this autumnal feast, we convened a panel of industry experts to answer the vital questions you might expect from family and friends who haven’t thought about bitcoin since they opened a Coinbase account in December 2017.    Is Satoshi Nakamoto the Bitcoin CEO?    Demirors: No leaders. No rulers. No CEO.      Ohayon: To be the CEO, there needs to be a company. And Bitcoin is not a company, it’s a protocol. That’s point number one. Point number two is that it does not matter, at least, anymore. Ten years in, Bitcoin is widely decentralized enough to exist without a CEO … even if it is a company.      Breitman: Is Moses the CEO of Judaism?    Isn’t bitcoin illegal? If it isn't, it should be.    Demirors: No. Software and math are not illegal, although governments are trying to change that ... [F]unny story: Cryptography – the reason why you can securely use the internet – was briefly banned and considered a weapon. Did not last long for, ahem, obvious reasons.      Ohayon: Like everything in life, bitcoin can be used for legal or illegal purposes. A knife could be used to cut a tomato, but also to kill someone. Because every transaction on the Bitcoin network is public, it is a very bad idea to use BTC for illegal purposes. So actually, bitcoin is the best anti-illegal currency on the planet.      Breitman: That would really increase its street cred.    Why would I need a world computer if my desktop works just fine?    Demirors: You won’t even know you’re using it. Do you really even know how your computer works?    If people can go around spending satoshis, why can’t I go around passing Monopoly money?    Demirors: You can, BUT, it will only work if people are willing to exchange goods and services for Monopoly money. Money is just collective fiction, even the dollar.      Ohayon: It’s the difference between paper and math. With satoshis is that you can’t print as much as you want. No one is keeping count of the amount of Monopoly paper in circulation or where they end up. Satoshis are just the opposite, mathematically proven scarce, and therefore attributable and spendable.      Breitman: I would encourage you to try that and see how far you get.      Graham: Why would you want to buy something with bitcoin?    Why are there so many coins? Dimes, pennies, nickels, quarters and the old half-pence will do.    Ohayon: Asking why there are so many coins is like asking why there are so many websites. It’s because every protocol brings a different utility and aspect to the digital economy.    I always keep my wallet in my front left pocket. Aren’t you asking for trouble uploading it to the internet?    Demirors: Why have a physical wallet in the first place?      Ohayon: Money has been electronic for many years now. Banks, PayPal, credit cards and many other monetary intermediaries have gone digital. But now, with blockchain, money can not only be electronic, but digitally native. The advantage is that you have a more secure protocol and proof of ownership, so you know that your money is your money.      Breitman: I bet you can fit two Ledgers in your front pocket!      Graham: You can try a safe deposit box but actually it’s a hard wallet.    I lost all my savings betting on bitcoin in 2017! My family didn't eat for months. Now you want me to try again?    Demirors: Bitcoin isn’t betting. Please don’t bet on bitcoin. Be reasonable. Ish. (This is NOT financial advice, I’m required to say that.)      Ohayon: 2017 was definitely not a great time to speculate on bitcoin, if that was your intention. When investing, I would not bet more than you can afford to lose.      Breitman: Absolutely not!    If I buy bitcoin, am I not just funding terrorists?    Demirors: No. The paper dollars in your wallet fund terrorism. The banks you hold your money with fund terrorism. Your own government funds terrorism with your tax dollars. When you own bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet, only you can spend that bitcoin.      Ohayon: Bitcoin does not belong to anyone, so you’re not funding anyone. You are usually buying it from services like exchanges and wallets that are usually regulated companies.      Breitman: No, sending money to terrorists is funding terrorists.      Graham: I asked Tether but on the advice of legal counsel they have chosen not to answer.    How do you own part of a bitcoin?    Graham: The same way you can own part of a dollar. Only it’s a religion.      See also: Still Don’t Get Bitcoin?

42433225,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44Dh,1606326007,"Long in China’s Shadow, the US Is Becoming a Bitcoin Mining Power Again","When it comes to the energy- and capital-intensive process of mining cryptocurrency, people tend to think of China, where about 65% of global hash power is located.      But like many other closely observed metrics in crypto, American hashrate is a number that seems to be on the cusp of significant increase.      Crypto mining, which harnesses data centers full of specialized computers to earn bitcoin by processing a so-called proof-of-work algorithm, is an industry that’s about to come out from under the radar in North America, say its proponents, and become new core infrastructure.      While the U.S. and Canada don’t have the cheapest energy on the planet, there’s plenty of underused power and energy infrastructure to repurpose. But the really deciding factor is stability, and with that comes access to capital markets and institutional investment.      See also: Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Sees Largest Percentage Drop in 9 Years      There are at least 23 listed crypto mining companies, the majority of which are based in the U.S. and Canada.      “U.S. equity markets continue to be the most favorable listing venue for mining companies,” Ethan Vera, CFO and co-founder of mining company Luxor Technologies, told CoinDesk. “They can raise through [at-the-market] offerings, which provide a very solid financing method for public companies looking to scale up their operations. Foreign companies have more limited financing levers and have a relatively harder time raising capital through equity.”      A prominent example is Nasdaq-listed Marathon Patent Group, which spent $50 million on a fleet of Bitmain’s state-of-the-art S19 Pro Bitcoin mining computers earlier this year. Marathon is building out a 105-megawatt (MW) mining facility in Hardin, Montana, as part of a venture with Maryland-based power provider Beowulf Energy.      “As a public company, everything we do is transparent,” said Marathon CEO Merrick Okamoto on Tuesday at Bitmain’s Mining and Investment Summit 2020. “There are disadvantages to letting everybody know what you're doing, but it's also a benefit. It gives us unique access to capital markets. We've done two financings in the last year.”    Ruthless algorithm    China may have lorded it over the crypto mining space until now thanks to cheap labor and a massive over-build in dam and hydro generation infrastructure. But the U.S. has begun catching the attention of Chinese players looking to diversify, according to Peter Wall, CEO of London Stock Exchange-listed Argo Blockchain.      “I’ve had conversations with people in the mining industry in the last few months about Chinese miners coming over to North America,” Wall told CoinDesk. “There’s been talk about it for years, but it really now does appear to be a trend we're seeing. Miners are always looking for more stability, which North America offers, and power and hosting costs in North America are competitive and sometimes even cheaper than Chinese options.”      The obvious geopolitical implication is that the U.S. could eventually take on China in this nascent arena. But the mining community would rather couch this in terms of greater decentralization, whether that means geographical spread or selling mining company shares to the public.      See also: Peter Thiel Backs $200 Million Valuation for Renewable Bitcoin Mining in the US      “Everybody loves the geopolitical angle,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry, a crypto mining investment company owned by Digital Currency Group (which is also the owner of CoinDesk). “But the goal is not for the U.S. to dominate bitcoin mining. That's not gonna happen. The goal here is to decentralize it throughout the world.”      That said, Colyer anticipates a muscular market in the U.S. As well as the growth afforded public mining companies, there’s a bank of interesting opportunities available regarding private investment plays in the U.S. coming from the likes of hedge funds and private equity firms that own infrastructure.      “A lot of the power in the U.S. is deregulated, and private equity or hedge funds own a lot of power-generation facilities,” said Colyer. “They’re starting to recognize the idea they can make a lot of money mining bitcoin, and it also helps make their overall power generation more efficient. They actually save money on their core power generation, plus they can make money on bitcoin.”      Bitcoin mining comes in for some stick thanks to its gargantuan energy consumption, but less attention is paid to the fact it’s also at the forefront of energy innovation. Colyer calls the Bitcoin system’s mining algorithm “ruthless” in always driving for the lowest cost possible, which is generally towards renewables like hydro-power – the reason for a migration of up to 40,000 Chinese mining rigs at the end of Szechuan’s wet season.      Also on the renewable energy push is Layer1, the West Texas-based wind-powered mining operation backed by Peter Thiel.    Hybrid    A combination of smart investing and energy innovation is demonstrated by Greenidge Generation, a natural gas power plant in upstate New York converted into a crypto mining facility earlier this year by its owner, private equity firm Atlas Holdings.      Greenidge is a hybrid facility where bitcoin mining can be used to add stability to the grid. Being connected to the Millennium Pipeline system, a very liquid forward, or over-the-counter, market, also allows Greenidge to hedge out input variable costs over multiple years, Tim Rainey, Greenidge’s chief financial officer, said at the Bitmain summit.      “We have positions all the way to mid-2022, so that’s a vehicle we use to lock in our mining economics,” said Rainey, adding that “25% of our overall capacity is dedicated to mining. Then the rest of it we use for sending power to the grid when it's needed. So, prior to bitcoin mining, it would take us 12 hours to start up and put megawatts to the grid in periods of high demand. But now we can ramp up to full 100-megawatt power within an hour. So this provides additional stability to the grid as well as mining bitcoin.”      See also: China’s Crypto Miners Struggle to Pay Power Bills as Regulators Clamp Down on OTC Desks      The U.S and Canada currently account for less than 10% of global crypto mining hash power, with the rest split among Russia, Kazakhstan and the Nordic countries. There are around 15 mining facilities operating at scale in North America (above 50 megawatt), estimates Taras Kulyk, senior vice president, Blockchain Business Development at Core Scientific, the largest crypto mining operation in the U.S.      North America is now on a precipice of real growth, Kulyk says, thanks to its regulatory certainty and the huge amount of infrastructure built in the 1970s and 1980s in anticipation of growing manufacturing that never came. Now that people are starting to realize crypto mining is not some shady enterprise, the U.S. is better positioned at the boardroom level.      “The operational costs are a little bit more expensive in the U.S., but when you're sinking $100 million or even a billion dollars into an ecosystem for infrastructure you're looking at stability,” said Kulyk.      Some government support would also be helpful, said Kulyk. To this end, Core Scientific has put together a policy paper and will be working with the Chamber of Digital Commerce to get the word to the U.S. government.      “We want the folks in Washington, D.C., to understand that digital asset mining is not bad and that there's a right way to do it,” said Kulyk. “I’m into crypto mining but I’m a ‘greenie’ at heart. I think the right way is through renewable power sources done at scale. The larger that becomes, the lower the burden on the environment.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/25/long-in-chinas-shadow-the-us-is-becoming-a-bitcoin-mining-power-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8418cd5a427e1b9b82af82e7cb47dc77cdf718a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance sweeps out U.S. customers. OKEx offers rebates to clients affected by its five-week pause.    Top shelf    Tax change Coinbase will no longer send customers 1099-Ks, the U.S. tax form that led the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to mistakenly think traders had underreported their gains. The exchange will instead use the 1099-MISC form, at least for customers who earn interest on lending and similar products. However, the new form may come with its own issues. According to Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, “The threshold for getting a 1099-MISC is very low,” only $600 in trades, meaning more customers may receive tax forms than strictly necessary. Customers who don’t receive any forms from Coinbase and sold or converted crypto in 2020 are still responsible for reporting to the IRS and should consult a tax professional, Coinbase said.      Binance sweeps Binance’s flagship exchange will cancel services for all U.S. users in 14 days, according to emails sent to users alerting them to withdraw their funds. “As we constantly perform periodic sweeps of our existing controls, we noted that you are trying to access Binance while having identified yourself as a U.S. person,” the notice reads. Binance also suggested current users open an account with the registered exchange Binance US. The Block noted the bans may be based on IP addresses, though that wasn’t the case for at least one unverified, U.S.-based user, CoinDesk has learned. Bans, therefore, could be based on KYC data.      Chained together IDEX, an Ethereum-based non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange, announced Tuesday it plans to expand to the Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot networks. Every holder of IDEX’s Ethereum tokens will get an equivalent number of IDEX tokens for each of the new chains on Dec 7. CEO Alex Wearn said the measure is to “plant our flag early"" in case either alternative smart contract platform eventually competes with Ethereum on a meaningful basis. Next up? Expansion to more chains, if and when that makes sense. However, Wearn notes, seamless cross-chain trading is still a ways off.      Everything OK? OKEx will offer a mix of compensation and rewards to users who’ve suffered because of a five-weeks-long suspension in services. Users who have made deposits, held tokens or traded during the withdrawal suspension time period will receive 20% of OKEx's total income from futures and perpetual swap transaction fees over the last seven weeks. The exchange will also provide rebate cards to users with assets worth more than 10,000 tether within a certain window.

However, the National Assembly said more time is needed to build the relevant tax infrastructure after cryptocurrency exchanges said they couldn't be ready by the deadline. The Ministry of Economy and Finance tabled the proposal in July, seeking to bring in a 20% levy – plus a 2% local income tax – on cryptocurrency trading profits above 2.5 million KRW (around $2,260).

In other words, call options have been drawing more robust demand than puts, a sign of investor expectations being skewed to the bullish side. “Investors are positioning for a bull market continuation,” Shah said.    At stake    Actual delivery? Coinbase announced an end to all margin trading as of Nov. 25, 2020, becoming the first high-profile exchange to cut the profitable business line. According to a report from CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De, the San-Francisco based trading platform is following recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) guidance.      Margin trading is effectively a line of credit offered by an exchange or brokerage to allow users to place highly leveraged bets. Existing positions will be allowed to close out next month, though Coinbase will cancel any open limit order unfulfilled by 2 p.m. PT today.      In March, CFTC clarified the meaning of “actual delivery” of digital assets. According to the guidance, a customer has legal rights, or actual delivery, of a cryptocurrency if they control it after purchase, including if it was acquired via a margin or leveraged product. This also means that the seller has no control over the cryptocurrency in question.      This is where it gets tricky for Coinbase’s margin trading business. Because the exchange uses cold storage and other custody solutions as part of this business line, it complicates the nature of actually delivering an asset in accordance with the updated rule.      At the time the guidance was first proposed, in 2018, then-Chief Legal and Risk Officer Mike Lempres argued that affiliates and third parties should be able to hold crypto on behalf of Coinbase customers.      “Requiring unfettered ability to transfer digital assets would effectively mean that U.S. entities and regulated entities, or entities using cold storage or other asset protection methods, could not hold digital assets acquired through margined transactions,” Lempres said at the time.      “Essentially, Coinbase would have to register with the CFTC as a commodities exchange if it wants to continue offering leveraged products,” De writes.

42433239,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44Th,1606323605,'Bypass' Attack in Coldcard Bitcoin Wallet Could Trick Users Into Sending Incorrect Funds,"The bitcoin-only hardware wallet Coldcard has released a beta firmware patch for a vulnerability that also affected a competitor hardware wallet earlier this year.      Ben Ma, a security researcher who works for hardware wallet manufacturer Shift Crypto, discovered the Coldcard hardware wallet has a flaw: An attacker could trick Coldcard users into sending a real bitcoin transaction when they think they are sending a “testnet” transaction – or a payment on Bitcoin’s testing network, which is not the same as the mainnet.      Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin      Both testnet and mainnet bitcoin transactions “have the exact same transaction representation under the hood,” Ma writes in his post disclosing the vulnerability. An attacker could then generate a bitcoin mainnet transaction for the hardware wallet but make it look like a testnet transaction. The mainnet transaction is presented like a testnet transaction on the user’s wallet, making it difficult for users to recognize the error.      Ma learned of the vulnerability after a pseudonymous researcher discovered the so-called “isolation bypass” attack in the French-manufactured Ledger hardware wallet.      Unlike Coldcard, Ledger supports many coins, so the bypass attack could work by tricking wallet users into sending bitcoin when they mean to send litecoin and bitcoin cash, in addition to testnet BTC.    ‘Bypass’ Bitcoin wallet vulnerability: A background    When the initial vulnerability in the Ledger wallet was disclosed, Coinkite founder and Coldcard creator Rodolfo Novak said, “Coldcard doesn't support any s**tcoins. We find that to be the best path,” implying that his bitcoin-only wallet would be safe because the flaw (in part) resulted from the fact that Ledger devices previously managed different coins using the same private key.      Read more: Maker of Coldcard Bitcoin Wallet Rolls Out an Extra-Strength ‘USB Condom’      Since Coldcard doesn’t support multiple coins, it theoretically shouldn’t have this problem. And it wouldn’t, if it weren’t for the fact that it can be exploited with bitcoin testnet addresses.      If users' computers are compromised – and the Coldcard device is unlocked and connected to that computer – then an adversary could trick users into sending real bitcoin when they think they are sending testnet bitcoin.      “The attacker merely has to convince the user to, e.g., ‘try a testnet transaction’ or to buy an ICO with testnet coins (I’ve heard there was a [initial coin offering] like this recently) or any number of social engineering attacks to make the user performs a testnet transaction. After the user confirms a testnet transaction, the attacker receives mainnet bitcoin in the same amount,” Ma writes in the post.      Because an attacker could execute this attack remotely, it met Shift Crypto’s criteria as a critical issue, triggering the responsible disclosure process.      According to the post, Ma disclosed the vulnerability to Coinkite on Aug. 4 and Novak acknowledged it the next day. On Nov. 23, Coldcard released a beta firmware to patch the vulnerability.      A Coldcard representative told CoinDesk that “unlike the attack on Trezor/Ledger,” Coldcard’s version “is not a realistic attack because the attacker would have to convince the victim to manually switch the device to testnet. That's not something people are likely to do.”      Additionally, Coinkite addressed the vulnerability in a blog post, adding that an attacker would have had to learn a victim’s XPUB (the master public key for their wallet) and the specific transaction ID for the unspent bitcoin they were targeting to pull off the attack.      Coldcard now includes a warning message when a user decides to switch the wallet into testnet (the wallet is set to mainnet by default).

Billions of dollars are flowing out of gold while institutional money is pouring into bitcoin.      The narrative for some cryptocurrency advocates – and a growing chorus on Wall Street – is that investors have finally seen the light and are pulling money out of the yellow metal, an ancient hedge against inflation, and into bitcoin, the safe haven of the future.

While trading 8.5% higher from when the year started, gold is still down more than 12% from its all-time high set back in early August, closing at $1,805 per troy ounce Tuesday. A couple of weeks ago, $4 billion left the gold market, a record outflow, according to Bank of America. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is up 162% for the year to date.      Last week, JPMorgan analysts Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Mika Inkenen and Ekansh Agarwal wrote in their “Flow & Liquidity” report about the recent growth spurt of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, citing it as a proxy for institutional interest in bitcoin. (Grayscale is digital asset management firm owned by DCG, parent company of CoinDesk.) The JPMorgan analysts wrote:    “What makes the past five weeks [sic] flow trajectory for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust even more impressive is its contrast with the equivalent flow trajectory for gold [exchange-traded funds], which saw modest outflows since mid-October. ... This contrast lends support to the idea that some investors that previously invested in gold ETFs, such as family offices, may be looking at bitcoin as an alternative to gold… [T]he potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable if it competes more intensely with gold as an ‘alternative’ currency, given that the market cap of bitcoin (at $340 billion) would have to rise eight times from here to match the total private sector investment in gold via ETFs or bars and coins, which stand at $2.6 trillion.”  For bitcoiners, that reads like the lyrics for the "" Song of Angelshttp://songofangels.com/default.html."" It was another affirmation of the idea that the cryptocurrency can compete with gold and has plenty of upside to go. It was an echo of other fund managers saying similar things, like when Paul Tudor Jones II compared the two back in May or when BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder said last week that bitcoin “could take the place of gold to a large extent.”    Sure, bitcoin remains more correlated to gold than it does the S&P 500, which had a record day Tuesday. The 90-day correlation coefficient for bitcoin and the benchmark U.S. stock index is currently 0.26 while it’s 0.38 when compared to bullion. (A correlation coefficient of 1 means the prices of two assets move in perfect lockstep; a negative figure means they move in opposite directions while 0 means there is no relationship between them.)      ""Alternative?"" Not so fast      Recent market movements seem to be saying something quite different, and that appears to be related to the money flowing from gold into digital assets. Gold prices took a 5% hit on Nov. 9, the day of the announcement that preliminary data showed a 90% efficacy rate for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Bitcoin immediately jumped 2% on the news. Each subsequent week has started with even more encouraging results from other vaccine trials, and the trends show falling gold and rising bitcoin.      If money is leaving gold and going into bitcoin, it may well be because with more optimism in the economy comes more willingness to get into “risk-on” trades like stocks and cryptocurrencies. That doesn’t make bitcoin a safe-haven play except as speculation it might be used as a safe haven sometime in the distant future – a nuanced difference but a difference nonetheless. That difference could be evident should another crisis befall us in the near term.      As it is still 2020, anything can happen.      - Lawrence Lewitinn    Price point    Bitcoin is trading near $19,220 after rising 4.2% on Tuesday to close above the $19,000 mark for the first time since Dec. 16, 2017. The cryptocurrency is now within sight of its all-time high of $19,783 reached three years ago.      ""Bitcoin at $19,000 is just another stepping stone to a new all-time high, and big market coins are taking turns rallying. That's a sign that institutional money continues to pour into crypto markets,"" William Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, said in an email. ""ETH 2.0 will reignite interest in the decentralized finance space, and we should see the small alternative cryptocurrencies taking off very soon.""      Major alternative cryptocurrencies have picked up a bid over the past few days and have outperformed bitcoin in the past 24 hours. While the crypto market leader has gained over 1%, XRP and Stellar lumens have rallied 12% and 41%, respectively. Tron and monero are up over 6%, while ether is flat.      In traditional markets, optimism over potential coronavirus vaccines continues to power gains in risk assets. European stocks are trading on a positive note, although with less enthusiasm, while the S&P 500 futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street. Elsewhere, gold has bounced slightly from the four-month low of $1,800 reached Tuesday.      - Omkar Godbole    What's hot  Coinbase Will Suspend All Margin Trading Tomorrow, Citing CFTC Guidance (CoinDesk)  Binance Ramps Up Crackdown on US Users, Giving Them 14 Days to Withdraw Funds (CoinDesk)  Ethereum 2.0’s Genesis Day Is Officially Set for Dec. 1 (CoinDesk)  South Korea May Delay Implementation of 20% Crypto Tax Till 2022 (CoinDesk)  Digital Yen Would Make Crypto Markets ‘More Lively,’ Says CEO of Monex Group (CoinDesk)  Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance  Behind Dow 30000: A Self-Perpetuating Upward Spiral (WSJ) Low interest rates and a buy-the-dip mantra have put stocks in an ascending pattern, defying the pandemic and economic woes.

According to the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, John Ratcliffe wrote to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton earlier in November in an effort to push the agency to bring in rules that would allow U.S. businesses to be more competitive.  Ratcliffe is said to have raised the fact that over half of the global cryptocurrency mining power is based in China, and that the People's Bank of China is already developing its national digital currency.  Ratcliffe reportedly offered to have senior economic intelligence officials brief Clayton on the issues.  The Examiner said the SEC did not respond immediately to its question asking if Clayton will accept the briefing.  Ratcliffe is also said to have attached a copy of a letter sent Clayton by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in the summer stating the need for ""clearer articulation of policy"" and formal guidance on digital currencies.  Clayton will step down from his SEC role at the end of this year.

42433229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO44Fh,1606309203,"In India, a Clash of Digital Innovation and Internet Censorship","Earlier this month, reacting to a decision by India’s highest court, prominent comedian Kunal Kamra tweeted that India’s Supreme Court is the “most Supreme joke of this country.”      The following day, local media reported that Attorney General K. K. Venugopal greenlighted court proceedings against the comedian, based on a few tweets criticizing the Supreme Court. The charge levied against him: contempt of court. Kamra has refused to apologize for his tweets and local reports indicate proceedings have yet to begin.      This should be shocking, but unfortunately it’s not. In India, speaking out on the Internet can be dangerous. Kamra told CoinDesk that public figures can receive threats on social media, noting that users leaked his phone number on Twitter multiple times. “They dox people, they release information sometimes. … That’s very normal,” Kamra said.      With over 700 million internet users, India’s booming digital market collides with internet censorship or outright bans.      A similar dynamic plays out in India’s crypto market. Trade on Indian crypto exchanges exploded earlier this year after the Supreme Court ruled to reverse the decision by the country’s central bank (RBI) to ban local financial institutions from providing services to crypto firms. Now, just a few months later, the federal cabinet is reportedly discussing another potential ban.      While regulators haven’t clarified their stance on digital assets, they have expressed concern over the fiscal and monetary policy implications of fintech applications, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). Regulators have continued to push for local control over fintech payment platforms like WhatsApp Pay, which received approval from the Indian government only after owner Facebook agreed to store user data locally in India and not offshore.      This is part of a much broader trend. Kamra’s case is the latest in a series of targeted attacks on internet users in the country. In a 2019 report, Freedom House warned internet freedom in India had declined “for the fourth year in a row” due to increasing arrests for online activity and frequent internet shutdowns.      Localized internet shutdowns, restrictions on certain content (like pornography) and wholesale bans on select mobile applications are some of the more visible ways in which the Indian government has sought to control the internet. According to a report by local media outlet Mint, in 2017 and 2018 at least 50 individuals were arrested for comments made on social media, largely for posts considered offensive to politicians.    Digital India    India’s digital ecosystems, from cloud computing to digital payments, are expanding. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, core sectors of the digital economy could double their contribution to India’s GDP by 2025, adding up to $435 billion.      On Nov. 19, in his inaugural address at the Bengaluru Tech Summit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his administration's governance model is “technology first” citing his Digital India initiative that launched five years ago.      “Digital India has become a way of life, particularly for the poor, marginalized and for those in government,” Prime Minister Modi said.      Yet, since2014, government authorities have enforced about 450regional internet shutdowns, with 134 in 2018 alone, according to a local internet shutdown tracker.      Reasons for the crackdowns range from anticipated public unrest to curbing malpractice in school examinations. This blunt-force approach can also lead to monetary loss for businesses and the disruption of web-based services.    If there is no internet, there is no cryptocurrency, there is no blockchain, there is no technology. The internet is the crux.    The longest internet shutdown ever recorded in a democracy was implemented by the Indian government in the disputed Kashmir region after the Modi government revoked the state’s semi-autonomous status in August 2019.      Indian officials justified the extended ban by calling it a necessary move to curb anticipated unrest that might have followed the administrative decision. While services were gradually restored, the blackout lasted over seven months and disrupted some 12 million people’s access to the internet.      Qazi Zaid, chief editor of Free Press Kashmir (FPK), a local media outlet, said his newsroom had to be shuttered during the blackout. The primarily online publication halted all coverage and risked losing its online readership of over 300,000 people, Zaid told CoinDesk.      When phone lines were restored, reporters called each other and dictated stories in an attempt to type and publish them, he added.      “But then we also realized that our audience is not there,” Zaid said.      While FPK managed to gradually come back online in May this year, the blackout had hit local businesses and dried up advertising revenue, Zaid said. He stressed that media censorship in Kashmir hasn’t changed so much after last year’s decision to revoke the region's special status but it may have been further formalized under recent amendments to digital media policy, giving the government regulatory control over digital news and content providers.    Loopholes    When the Indian government wants to shut the internet down, it sometimes invokes a 135-year-old law: the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. The act was created by the British rulers in colonial India to curb uprisings, Indian journalist Sonia Faleiro said in a recent MIT Technology Review podcast. The law gives the government authority over all forms of electronic communications (in 1885 that meant telegrams) in the event of a public emergency.      “In 2017, the law was amended to specify that it allowed the temporary suspension of telecom services,” Faleiro said.      One of the many problems with the law, Faleiro added, was it did not specify or define “public emergency,” thus allowing the government to label any incident as such and shut down communications.      Additionally, a controversial 2008 amendment to The Information Technology Act of 2000, Section 66A, allowed the government to imprison any person sending messages deemed “offensive,” “menacing,” “false” or “causing annoyance” through any electronic communications device. Using this law, in 2012 the government arrested two women for Facebook posts critical of the government.      In 2015, the Supreme Court of India shot down Section 66A, calling it unconstitutional. However, arrests over social media activity continued: In 2016, a Kashmiri man was charged with sedition for liking and sharing anti-India posts on Facebook.    The security argument    Amid a tense border standoff with China earlier this year, India’s government banned 60 China-based apps, including the popular social media platform Tik Tok.      When border tensions continued, leading to an Indian soldier reportedly being killed by a Chinese landmine, the Indian government restricted 118 more mobile applications from Chinese tech companies in September 2020.      The government’s statement alleged it had received “several reports” of these applications misusing user data and “surreptitiously transmitting” it to servers located outside India.      Described as a move to ensure “safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace” in the government’s September statement, the restrictions took aim at apps from WeChat, Baidu, Alipay and the popular mobile game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), which had over 33 million active users in India at the time.      While the restrictions could have been a knee-jerk reaction to a geopolitical situation that has since cooled down, concerns about the integrity of user data and government surveillance on the internet have persisted as India works on the proposed Personal Data Protection Bill (2019).      According to Anirudh Burman, associate fellow at Carnegie India, the draft law, introduced in December 2019, deploys an approach quite similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).      Burman explained that although both frameworks are based on a user-consent model, the Indian bill limits data storage outside the country’s borders and also creates compliance requirements that could burden small enterprises.      “If there is a medium or small enterprise firm going to get a data protection officer or get an annual data protection audit, it's a significant cost,” Burman said.      The draft law’s requirement to store certain types of data locally or always have a copy of it available on local servers has also stoked fears of increased state surveillance, according to a report by DW. Requiring platforms to store data locally could also afford easier access to local law enforcement which, if stored off-shore, would be subject to a different set of laws.      “U.S. law permits the disclosure only of non-content data. So if you want detailed subscriber information or content data, then you have to go through the due process,” said Burman. Content data here refers to data, processed or unprocessed, that can convey the substance of a communication.      The draft bill also provides for the creation of a dedicated body, the Data Protection Authority of India, to ensure compliance with the law. A portion of the legislation also grants the federal government the power to “exempt any agency of Government from application of the Act,” thereby creating broad loopholes for the state to duck requirements levied on private enterprises.      The draft law, India’s first attempt at creating a digital privacy and data management framework at the national level, is currently before a joint parliamentary committee. The committee also recently held discussions on law with representatives from companies including Amazon, Twitter, Mastercard, Visa and PayPal.      Reported to be in the final stages of discussion, the committee is expected to file its recommendations on the bill before the next session of parliament begins.    Sisyphus' boulder    Despite the Indian government’s efforts to exercise control over cyberspace, internet policing can only go so far.      Vikram Subburaj and Arjun Vijay launched Indian crypto exchange Giottus in 2018, just a week after the central bank of India published a circular that banned crypto firms from having bank accounts. Confronted by the ban, they pivoted to setting up a peer-to-peer exchange.      In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India overruled the central bank circular and, according to the two founders, Giottus has enjoyed record growth in the last six months.      “We have been growing at a phenomenal rate of 400% YTD and have been clocking a monthly trade volume of $33 million,” Subburaj told CoinDesk via email.      Vijay doesn’t believe internet censorship can stop web-based services from continuing to grow in India.      “Censorship doesn't work with respect to the internet. With VPN and sorts, it just makes it more difficult for you to access something, but it doesn't prevent someone who wants to access it,” Vijay told CoinDesk.      Even in Kashmir, where students had to make do with government-imposed low-speed internet for their online classes during the coronavirus pandemic, people found workarounds. According to an Al Jazeera report, two applications (Filo and Wise) created by educators Mubeen Masudi and Imbesat Ahmad helped students access the Internet.      India’s government seems to understand the Internet is essential for the country’s growth. While authorities sometimes lean toward stringent controls, the government will not completely stamp out digital innovation. This is good news for the crypto industry.      As Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder of local crypto exchange CoinDCX, told CoinDesk, “If there is no internet, there is no cryptocurrency, there is no blockchain, there is no technology. The internet is the crux.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Sandali Handagama, Jaspreet Kalra",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/25/in-india-a-clash-of-digital-innovation-and-internet-censorship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70e1cf176f15bc1a9fdeccf4b45c904802aa3e65-1500x1082.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3z5h,1606307725,Bitcoin Options Market Suggests Investors Preparing for All-Time High,"Activity in bitcoin's options market shows investors are eyeing more gains for the top cryptocurrency, which is now just 2.8% below a record high.      Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility, which is influenced by demand for call (bullish) and put (bearish) options, has risen to 81%, the highest level since May, having begun the month at 58%, according to data source Skew.      The major part of the move (from 60% to 81%) occurred over the past five days. The three- and six-month implied volatility metrics have also jumped to multi-month highs.      ""The recent spike in implied volatility is the result of a decent chunk of call buying,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk. ""Investors are positioning for a bull market continuation.""      Further, put-call skews, which measure the spread between the cost of puts and calls, are hovering near record lows. In other words, call options have been drawing more robust demand than puts, a sign of investor expectations being skewed to the bullish side.      A week ago, the skews witnessed a bounce from lifetime lows as some traders bought put options following bitcoin's sudden pullback from $18,400 to $17,100.      However, the price dip was short-lived and the cryptocurrency rose above $19,000 on Tuesday. As such, call buying continued, pushing the skews lower once more.      At press time, the one-month metric is seen at 24%, having reached a low of 27.8% on Nov. 17.      Meanwhile, bitcoin is trading near $19,300, representing a nearly 1% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to the CoinDesk 20. Prices have risen by over $9,000 in the past 6.5 weeks.      On-chain data also favors an extension of the ongoing bull run. For instance, bitcoin's trade intensity, which measures the number of times each coin deposited on a spot exchange is traded, rose to 7.28 on Tuesday, the highest level since June 7, according to Chainalysis.      The metric shows demand is still strong, and suggests the market could absorb a potential rise in supply. However, holding sentiment remains strong, as evidenced by the continued decline in the number of coins held on exchanges.      Some investors, though, may look to take profits if and when the cryptocurrency scales the $20,000 mark.      “We could see massive movements in the bitcoin price over Thanksgiving,"" said Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com in an emailed statement. ""A new all-time-high won’t be a surprise to some who’ve seen it as a ‘not if, but when’ scenario. It’s an inevitability, but the world will take notice, and that’s good for adoption.”      Also read: First Mover: Why Is Bitcoin’s Price Rising?

42433215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3yxh,1606296706,BIS Paper Says There's Potential to Embed Regulation Into Stablecoin Systems,"Regulatory responses to private, ""global"" stablecoins like libra need to take into account the potential of the technology in payments, according to economists at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).      In a new working paper published Tuesday, Raphael Auer and Jon Frost, with Melbourne Law School finance lawyer Douglas Arner, drew a line between centralized and decentralized stablecoins, and said the potential of libra to quickly be adopted by hundreds of millions of Facebook product users means regulators will need to adapt quickly.      But the need to protect economies, the monetary system and consumers ""does not preclude public authorities themselves from embracing innovation."" Global stablecoins offer benefits in cross-border payments in particular, according to the paper, and can challenge existing types of payment in e-commerce.      See also: Federal Reserve, 6 Other Central Banks Set Out Core Digital Currency Principles      Stablecoins are generally cryptocurrencies that attempt to maintain a value linked to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, or other assets.      The paper argues that technology in general offers the potential to increase supervision and provides the necessary tools for implementing and enforcing financial regulation. Specifically, stablecoins present the option to implement supervisory requirements and frameworks into the systems that operate them, paving a way for ""embedded supervision.""      ""Direct automated provision of data as a licensing or registration requirement for digital payment systems and markets provides an important opportunity to better use technology to achieve regulatory and supervisory objectives as well as reduce costs for market participants,"" the authors said.      Stablecoins, particularly decentralized ones, also bring the possibility of building ""a robust monetary instrument"" into blockchain applications, such as for programmable money.      See also: MakerDAO’s DAI Stablecoin Breaks $1B Market Cap      The paper further examined whether alternative methods of payment, such as central bank digital currencies or fast payment systems, would be better suited to for the ""functions that stablecoins seek to address,"" concluding they may be more effective ""in many cases.""      Still, baking frameworks for supervising and monitoring transactions directly into stablecoin systems has the potential to enhance the achievement of regulatory objectives, the authors said.      Ironically, the technology was ""initially ... targeted with making the role of regulation unnecessary,"" they wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/25/bis-paper-says-theres-potential-to-embed-regulation-into-stablecoin-systems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8a3aadf9ce1f1c40e1b5e81c52637839d3d8c0f-2560x1696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
