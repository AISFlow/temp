42397199,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXT7,1374148929,"Bitcoin company acquisitions begin: Gambling site SatoshiDice sells for $11.5 Million (126,315 BTC)","Blockchain-based betting game SatoshiDice has been sold for 126,315 BTC, which at the time of writing was worth around $11.47 million.  SatoshiDice (S.DICE), which claims to be ""the most popular Bitcoin betting game in the universe"", was launched by its operator Erik Voorhees in late April 2012. The company's shares have since been traded on MPEx, the Romanian Bitcoin securities exchange.  Yesterday evening (17th July), Voorhees announced the sale of the company, stating: ""I believe this to be a solid, desirable, and fair outcome for those who have put their trust in S.DICE.""  This is interesting news to the digital currency community as, to date, this is the first major acquisition of a company in the bitcoin space. What else is unusual is that the company was bought with bitcoin, not US dollars or another fiat currency.  The sale price works out at 0.00126315 BTC per share ($0.12), however, Voorhees said ""for the good of the MPEx holders and for the sake of the general Bitcoin community, which the site always has intended to support and nurture,"" SatoshiDice will pay MPEx holders an extra 0.00223685 BTC ($0.2) per share, which brings the total to 0.0035 BTC ($0.32) per share.  His statement continues:  ""This is a 277% premium over the sale price and a roughly 175% premium over the current market price of S.DICE shares on MPEx. It is also roughly equivalent to the average price of S.DICE shares at IPO (though BTC was $12 back then, and over $90 today).""  On top of the price per share being paid out, a small amount will be added to compensate users for the BTC that were deducted to fund development of the website.  Responses on bitcointalk to the announcement have been varied, with some forum members supporting Voorhees and others criticizing the move.  Forum member chriswilmer said: ""Wow, that's awesome! Congratulations!""  However, TraderTimm was not so complimentary: "" Well, thank you Erik for showing once and for all you're just a profit-chaser - you don't care about bitcoin, well, only enough to get your money out of it.""  John Bridge, MD at BitCapital, told CoinDesk he was somewhat surprised the site sold for such a high amount.  ""I presume it's a significant existing gaming institute that's bought it. If it has gone to one of the major players in the gaming industry and they're looking to expand beyond the SatoshiDice model, that would be positive for bitcoin as it would give it greater exposure to people who don't currently know about it,"" he said.  Bridge went on to say and he's surprised a lot of the major operators in the gaming space haven’t jumped on the ""bitcoin bandwagon"" already, for example by adding it as a method of funding accounts.  ""There are no transaction fees, it's irreversible, it's just perfect for the online gaming industry,"" he added.  Darragh Browne, founder of Blockspin, said the effect of the sale really depends on whether shareholders want to cash out to fiat, or reinvest their windfall in the bitcoin economy.  ""We have already seen the price drop a little today, but I'd imagine that is mainly due to speculation. The fact that there are still reports of Mt. Gox's on-going problems processing fiat wire transfers is a slightly larger concern for bitcoin prices than SatoshiDice shareholders cashing out,"" he added.  Browne said there is a possibility investors in SatoshiDice may now look to re-invest their windfall in other assets, such as bitcoin securities like ASICMiner shares.  ""We could see a bump in share prices on Bitfunder, BTCT.co and Litecoin Global, and it's worth watching the price of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, PPCoin, Namecoin and Primecoin,"" he concluded.

42397189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXLF,1374140871,Boost's bitcoin-heavy incubator program gets underway,"Boost VC's summer program is well underway, helping the 17 attending companies, seven of which are bitcoin-related, to transform their ideas into working businesses.  Located in the heart of Silicon Valley in San Francisco, Boost provides housing in downtown San Mateo, office space and mentors to the participants, as well as an investment of $10,000 to $15,000.  The 12-week program involves speaker sessions, mentoring and team building exercises with those taking part gaining legal advice and hours of in-office time.  According to Boost's website:  ""We work as hard as you to take your company to the next level.""  Boost accepts companies from all sectors and at various different stages in their development, but it is currently particularly interested in consumer tech, 3D printing and bitcoin.  Brayton Williams, co-founder of Boost, said: ""We believe there are still many opportunities in bitcoin infrastructure, such as exchanges and payment processors, but we are also very excited about next generation companies, which I believe many of our investments fit in to.""  He explained that, aside from the other perks, one of the main benefits the companies will enjoy is working alongside another six bitcoin-focused companies that ""are all going down similar paths"".  The founder of one of the companies taking part said: ""Boost has aggregated a lot of talent focused on the problems we're trying to solve and provides access to a lot of opportunities.""  Adam Draper, co-founder and CEO of Boost, said: ""My life mission is to help people do what they love, it's not necessarily just bitcoin companies. However, bitcoin is the biggest innovation I have seen in the last 10 years, and we want to help propel it into being the global currency.""  He said all of the companies involved in the latest program, which is in its fourth week, are currently ""crushing it"".  Once the bitcoin companies complete the program in early September, each will receive an additional $50,000 from the Boost Bitcoin Fund, which is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Rothenberg Ventures, The Bitcoin Opportunity Fund and Beluga co-founder Ben Davenport.  What kind of bitcoin companies would you like to see come out of the Boost program?

42397201,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXX3,1374136011,Discount code and Primecoin mining enthusiasm cause cloud server overload,"Miners of Primecoin, a new digital currency, caused DigitalOcean, a cloud server provider, to restrict sign ups in some regions of the world. Primecoin was recently announced, with the aim of creating a currency that had a useful proof of work system: the search for prime numbers.  DigitalOcean is a provider of virtual private servers (VPS). These servers are not actual computers, but simulated computers – several of which run simultaneously on powerful server computers at once. This is a cost effective way for any business providing online hosting services whether it be virtual private servers or web hosts.  Usually, a group of virtual servers hosted on single (or across a network of) physical servers do not all need the CPU and network resources at once. Therefore, having several simulated computers contained within one physical computer is more efficient as one set of hardware can be active all the time, providing resources to all of the virtual machines it hosts.  The whole business of virtual hosting is somewhat like fractional reserve banking in that it relies upon most of its users not requiring its resources at any particular moment. This is why many cryptocurrency miners signing up and starting computations all at the same time caused a headache to DigitalOcean.  After a detailed set of instructions was posted to the bitcoin forums, over 18,000 users signed up to DigitalOcean, using a discount referral code from the original poster. We should point out that the DigitalOcean referral program means that the forum user who posted the referral link would earn $10 for every user that was billed $10 or more.  Furthermore, the instructions that he/she listed could be done on any Linux computer. However, the advantage of mining in the cloud means that much more powerful hardware is available than most people will have at home, if they are willing to pay the monthly fee.  Mitch Warner II, DigitalOcean's head of marketing, is quoted as saying that this represented 90 days' worth of growth in just 2 days. The company has three server locations: Amsterdam, New York and San Francisco. DigitalOcean had to temporarily prevent creation of server instances (called ""droplets"") at its Amsterdam and New York locations to stem the tide of budding miners. The Amsterdam location is still closed off to new users.  At the time of writing, 1 Primecoin (XPM) was worth 0.00516662 BTC, and 0.13238239 LTC, according to the Coins-E exchange.
