Recently, the leading cryptocurrency has been leaving a string of broken records in its wake at an increasingly rapid pace after passing the psychologically key $20,000 mark for the first time ever on Dec. 16.  BTC broke $25,000 Friday night for the first time, and set a new all-time high of $26,368.16 Saturday afternoon, before settling back to $26,246.72, up 7.39% on the day. Year-to-date BTC is up more than 250%.  Institutional investors are perceived to be driving this record-setting run. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($25 million in December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic while U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to pass an even bigger relief package to allow for larger stimulus checks. These actions are viewed by many as likely catalysts for inflation, against which BTC is viewed as a hedge.  There are those who think BTC is just getting started.

42433476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQz1h,1608998453,Three Market Trends Fueled Enterprise DLT Adoption in 2020,"After many years of investment, experimentation and infrastructure improvements, the intersection of three market trends are paving the way for enterprise adoption of public distributed networks: tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi) and business logic moving to layer 2.      In 2020, it became ever more apparent that these trends, in addition to hard lessons learned from attempted deployments of private networks, have caused enterprises to be open to the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in ways they simply were not in 2017.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Mance Harmon is CEO and co-founder of Hedera Hashgraph.  Tokenization enabling economic activity, DeFi spurs more efficient financing    In 2017, tokens were used almost exclusively as a way to raise capital for startups. The value proposition of tokenization was only beginning to be understood, with very little appreciation for the full range of use cases and types of tokens that could be created.      Fast forward to 2020, and groups like the Interwork Alliance have created frameworks for understanding the definition and scope of the token concept, including use cases, taxonomy and terminology. Early use cases of DLT focused on its ability to synchronize a ledger across multiple parties, ensuring that all parties get the same information at the same time, and that each network participant has confidence all parties receive exactly the same information.      See also: Blockchain to Play ‘Essential Role’ in Farming Supply Chains, Says US Government      For example, a prominent use case is the track and trace of supply chain activities, specifically recording when and where a product was made and its flow through the supply chain. Tracking when and where a product was made can help provide transparency and reduce fraud, which is of some value.      Creating a token that represents the item being produced makes it possible to not only record the same information used for track and trace, but also enables the buying and selling of the same widget by moving the token between accounts. Digital tokens are designed for economic activity, and this trend is accelerating. Soon products and services throughout the world economy will be tokenized.      One example of this is Coca-Cola’s supply chain, which is being optimized in part by its largest technology provider to the 70 franchised bottling companies in North America – Coke One North America (CONA). In 2019, CONA used Hyperledger Fabric, in combination with SAP’s blockchain-as-a-service for node hosting, to streamline the relationships among the 12 largest bottling companies.    The combination of tokenization, fiat-backed stablecoins and DeFi protocols will make traditional financing operations faster and less costly.    In 2020, CONA went one step further in accelerating the company’s use of blockchain across its supply chain, by deciding to integrate their Hyperledger Fabric solution with the Baseline Protocol. (A primary objective of the Baseline protocol is to enable combined DeFi and asset tokenization use cases.) The goal of the next phase is to use Baseline to establish a “Coca Cola Bottling Harbor” that enables internal bottlers and external raw-material suppliers to easily join the network.      The rise of DeFi in 2020 has laid the groundwork for enterprises to embed componentized financing directly into their business processes.      While the DeFi bubble of 2020 looks in some ways similar to the initial coin offering craze of 2017, the fundamentals of the DeFi movement will change the face of finance in the future. The combination of tokenization, fiat-backed stablecoins and DeFi protocols will make traditional financing operations faster and less costly.      This could have repercussions across the existing processes for purchase order financing, obtaining loans for working capital, purchasing shipping and product insurance, securing inventory financing and invoice factoring.    Business logic moving to layer 2    Bitcoin first demonstrated the value of decentralization in the form of a token, and Ethereum improved the technology by adding programmability, making it possible for counterparties to govern the terms of their transactions with smart contracts.      Now in 2020, as enterprise adoption of DLT accelerates, there is a strong need for privacy in the smart contract execution – or business logic that can be executed without revealing the data to the world.      Public networks expose the business logic and the data of the smart contracts on the network, potentially revealing sensitive business intelligence or privacy information of the smart contract users.      In addition to privacy concerns, the scalability and costs associated with public networks caused the DLT market to split in 2015 with the launch of Hyperledger and later with R3 Corda in 2016.      Then, faced with the performance, cost and regulatory hurdles present in the public networks of the time, enterprises chose to create siloed, purpose-specific, private DLT networks instead. In the past five years, the private DLT industry has learned that creating a consortium of independent parties to run the needed DLT network is time consuming, costly and complex.      See also: Trump’s Security Hawks Call Distributed Ledgers ‘Critical’ in US-China Tech Arms Race      Over the same period, public networks realized that to achieve scale and reduce costs requires moving the execution of business logic off of layer 1 (the mainnet) onto layer 2 (peripheral networks). Public networks may differ in their architecture design and decisions about where to draw the line between layer 1 and layer 2, making different choices on to what degree smart contracts and file storage should be included where.      Hence, a major industry trend witnessed in 2020 saw enterprise applications moving to execute their business logic in layer 2 networks and simply use layer 1 for consensus and arbitration. This approach combines the benefits of public networks – distributed trust – with the benefits of private networks, namely low cost, scalability, privacy and regulatory compliance.    Now it’s up to enterprise to seize these advancements    In his speech at Davos in 2018, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted, “The pace of change has never been this fast, yet it will never be this slow again.” His words were aptly felt by the blockchain industry in 2020. What became clear for those working in the DLT space in this pandemic year is the combination of tokenization, DeFi and layer 2 networks that are being built out are rapidly providing the foundations for enterprises to use distributed ledgers in routine business transactions.      Integrating this combination of technologies with existing enterprise systems will drive a significant acceleration in enterprise adoption in the years ahead. These technological advancements in 2020 have laid the groundwork for DLT enterprise adoption. Now it's time for the captains of industry to steer the ship and capitalize on these breakthroughs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Mance Harmon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/26/three-market-trends-fueled-enterprise-dlt-adoption-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcb332efd2fb7fc6260b53b71bca2228583cc173-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In this case SWIFT it may not be necessary, because it will be a different kind of technological interaction,” Skorobogatova said at a meeting last week, RT reported.  SWIFT is a messaging network that banks and other financial institutions use to securely transmit information and instructions via codes. It enables cross-border payments along with other services between more than 10,000 financial institutions in countries around the world.

42433477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQz7h,1608984042,Now Is the Time for Enterprises to Look at ETH 2.0,"Despite the excitement and enthusiasm in the Ethereum community, many people don’t yet fully understand the significance – and the opportunity – of the second-largest blockchain for large institutions and enterprises.      The nature of network participation is changing dramatically as well as the incentive mechanisms for securing open permissionless protocols, demonstrated by Ethereum’s shift to a radically new consensus mechanism.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Evan Weiss is head of business operations at Bison Trails.    Anyone holding ether (ETH) as an asset can participate in securing the network and earn rewards. Given the increased growth and utilization of the protocol, now is the time for large enterprises to take a look at the Eth 2.0 opportunity.    Ethereum’s future    Ethereum, currently the second-highest market cap network with over $40 billion in value, aims to be a globally distributed computer for executing peer-to-peer contracts. In other words, it’s “a world computer you can’t shut down.” More important, Ethereum has become the most utilized blockchain protocol in the world, settling over $6 billion per day.      Eth 2.0, the next iteration of this distributed system, represents years of research and coordinated effort from teams across the world. A primary goal of Eth 2.0 is to enable the protocol to continue to grow with our industry and scale to support trillions of dollars in value transfer in a decentralized manner.      See also: The Risks and Rewards of Staking on Eth 2.0      Before the launch of its skeletal system on Dec. 1, more than 835,520 ETH was staked to the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, far exceeding the minimum of ETH required to trigger the new network’s “genesis.”      Not only is this launch a huge milestone for the crypto community, the transition also represents a significant change in how the protocol will be secured, as the network moves from mining (proof-of-work, or PoW) to staking (proof-of-stake, or PoS).    Token ownership and rewards    In decentralized protocols, mining and staking seek to accomplish the same goal, determining network consensus. Coming to agreement on the “state of the chain” ensures the monetary balances the blockchain stores are accurate. But networks based on mining and those based on staking operate very differently in the real world to achieve this consensus.      In PoS, mining to secure the network is a separate activity from holding tokens. Many bitcoin miners are sophisticated actors, with large balance sheets. They optimize for access to cheap hardware and electricity but don’t always meet the necessary margins to stay profitable. PoW miners face the significant risks of price swings of the native protocol assets they hold and depreciation of their assets – a risk greater than some investor appetites.      A large portion of this PoW mining happens in China and is controlled by a few large mining companies. These large mining companies are not known for operational transparency and, as such, are not an attractive option for well-established enterprises or institutions with fiduciary responsibilities.    Policymakers understand this is a clear movement towards enabling users to own a small part of the next generation internet.    In proof-of-stake, on the other hand, token holders are responsible for validating blocks. By participating in securing the network, these holders earn rewards. PoS protocols have a built-in inflation mechanism that increases the supply of coins, distributing them proportionally to those coins that have been staked.      More important, with PoS networks, large-scale token holders and enterprises don’t have to navigate the intensive hardware requirements, find locations with cheap access to electricity or rely on international miners in order to actively participate in the supply side of the network.    Enterprise considerations    At a minimum, all you need to participate in Eth 2.0 is 32 ETH and an active validator. For enterprises and large-scale token holders, active PoS network participants may also consider running in-house infrastructure, as well as the time investment and opportunity cost of capital.      In the five years since Ethereum’s debut, a number of new PoS protocols have launched including Polkadot, Celo, NEAR and Flow. There has also been a proportional rise in “infrastructure as a service” companies. These companies make it safe and easy for token holders and institutions to earn rewards as network validators.      These enterprise-grade, cloud-based blockchain infrastructure providers can strengthen the network by geographically distributing the network’s nodes, without introducing the costs associated with proof-of-work mining.      Further, we’re seeing a trend towards professionalization of the staking industry as new products are brought to market that provide liquidity for staked tokens and additionally provide insurance protections around slashing penalties – a major concern for institutions.      As Ethereum’s utilization continues its hockey stick-like growth, staking represents an opportunity to own a small part of the growing Web 3.0 ecosystem. A distributed web built on blockchain technology is a drastic shift from the internet we are familiar with today, where there is no way to own or monetize your usage.      Policymakers understand this is a clear movement towards enabling users to own a small part of the next generation internet. As Ethereum grows to power trillions of dollars in daily settlements, owning a portion of this next-gen web will become a once in a generation opportunity.      Lastly, taxation of assets is an important consideration for institutions. There is promising work being done to advance the idea that staking rewards should be treated as “created property” so that rewards are taxed when they are sold, not when they are first created. These “capital assets” would give token holders the opportunity to hold their staking rewards for longer than one year and then receive long-term capital gains treatment under current tax rules.      Clarity here would provide even more assurance that participating in PoS networks won’t come at the cost of an excessive tax burden.      See also: US Lawmakers Don’t Want Proof-of-Stake Networks to Get Overtaxed      Eth 2.0 represents a fundamentally new kind of business opportunity. It offers a chance for non-technical market actors to own a piece of the Ethereum protocol and the fees that come with its utilization. While still in the earliest stages of its rollout, there’s already a well-established ecosystem of professional companies to support institutional investors with cloud-based infrastructure.      It’s experimental, but the rewards are there for the brave new adopters.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Evan Weiss,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/26/now-is-the-time-for-enterprises-to-look-at-eth-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee59ea87da57f2e0c143795be969dbf0353b192e-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQyzh,1608976800,Building the Next Wave of Web 3.0,"""Blockchain and bitcoin point to a future, and point to a world, where content exists forever, where it's permanent, where it doesn't go away, where it exists forever on every single node that's connected to it,"" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said recently, as he endorsed a decentralized social media standard.      In the same week, the European Union (EU) revealed it is gearing up for another challenge to Big Tech. Under the Digital Services Act regulation proposed by the bloc, the companies that preside over the vast troves of the internet's data, platforms like Amazon and Google, would be forced to make the data collected accessible to smaller rivals.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Colin Evran is the Filecoin Ecosystem Lead.    It is striking to see the coordinated charge by regulators, from Ireland to the United States, in supporting antitrust action meant to make the internet a fairer place. In speaking out against the current structure of the internet, Jack Dorsey has become the latest tech entrepreneur to lend his voice to the conversation about transforming the internet as we know it. It’s a conversation that has grown steadily louder in recent months.      Today, Web 2.0, the model that determines how we locate all of the data across the internet, is failing us. We need not list the numerous data hacks and breaches, cases of government voter manipulation, and the scourge of fake news it is now near impossible to avoid online.      More problematic still is the fact that we are losing precious data each and every day. As it stands, only 7% of the data that is generated actually gets stored. And that ratio is decreasing over time – predicted to decrease to 5% in the next five years. Still, current cloud storage infrastructure proves incapable of keeping up, as the data we produce as a species increases at over 30% a year.      The vision for Web 3.0 is to make all the applications, the data and the use cases of the internet, completely verifiable. Adding the capability of verification means that a centralized intermediary, like a bank or a large tech company, that says it controls your money or your data, can be required to back up that claim and prove the actions they're taking with this data are accurate. Web 3.0 is designed to introduce trust or verifiability into the web, and that's where we're headed.      See also: Juan Benet: From Idea to Action      On the 50th anniversary of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, expressed concerns for the future of the internet. He raised issues of increasing centralization, an imbalance of power contrary to the original design principles of the internet, which sought to achieve the goal of decentralizing information.      In recent years, Big Tech conglomerates including Facebook and Google have turned this concept on its head, caging data in closed platforms. So when you think about Web 2.0, the whole value of the ecosystem has more recently been built on the companies and the platforms that build on top of the protocols, and not necessarily the protocols themselves. Decentralizing information is one of the core tenets behind Web 3.0. The next question is how do we get there?      As Dorsey suggested, along with Ben Horowitz, and Tim Berners-Lee, who have also committed to change by putting their names and money behind blockchain technology to upgrade the web, a decentralized web (dWeb) will be the foundation of the next generation of the internet – Web 3.0.      This collective dream of a future internet, where content exists forever and error 404 is a distant memory, could become a reality if the internet’s data is successfully decentralized away from the Big Tech oligopoly.      This is, by and large, exactly what the EU regulation strives to achieve: fair distribution of the world’s knowledge and moving control away from the handful of money hungry corporations, whose corporate interests do not prioritize ensuring the dissemination of factual information or preserving humanity’s history online.      Error 404 frustration, what is known as link rot, occurs when a webpage, for example, on an old blog is deleted, and as it vanishes so does your access to it. The problem may be that whoever was paying for that particular blog on the internet has ceased doing so and so the content disappears.      This is annoying at the best of times but it becomes even more of a concern when the source you’re trying to access is a national archive or, as was the case in Turkey in 2017, when this design flaw enables a government to restrict its citizens from accessing fundamental online services such as Wikipedia. The solution to this internet light switch that allows trigger-happy corporations and governments to pull the plug, is to change how the data on the internet is addressed.      So with Web 3.0, under a decentralized system, the onus is not on the original publisher to pay for the blog to remain in the public domain, but to enable anyone who has an interest in that information to preserve it.      See also: Pooja Shah – How Web 3.0 Creates Value for Users, Not Platforms      This distribution model grants anyone who is interested in paying to preserve specific information, any storage provider who wants to be paid to preserve said information or anyone who wants to use itthe opportunity to do so. Regardless of the actions of the original publisher, once the data is part of the public record, the network of users on this new, trusted version of the internet can continue to access it and read it.      To put that in the context of social media, as Dorsey envisions, video footage of world events would not be lost or manipulated and the memories of humanity would persist. There are thousands of projects, inspired by the decentralized movement and alarmed by the fragility of the internet we use today, working tirelessly to build solutions to revamp the internet.      As we come to the end of 2020, the signifiers of change are not lacking. Each day we are taking a step closer to Web 3.0, an internet we can trust.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | FIL | REGULATION,Colin Evran,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/26/building-the-next-wave-of-web-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea2192a70d2adbe86f20532c5bc8c3d270b38d9c-1024x704.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Turkish-language media widely quoted him as follows:      “There is an R&D project initiated on digital money. Currently the conceptual phase of this project has been completed. We aim to start pilot tests in the second half of 2021.""      Ağbal's surprise comments place Turkey on the fast track to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Turkey seldom discloses any digital currency ambitions; the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), known in monetary circles as the ""bank for central banks,"" does not even record Turkey as having an active CBDC project in its running database.      Yet, Turkey is now angling to overtake many better-known CBDC projects. Although 80% of central banks are considering CBDC according to the BIS, only a handful – Sweden, China, the Bahamas – have progressed to pilot phase/soft launch.      The details of Turkey's own CBDC project are murky at best.
